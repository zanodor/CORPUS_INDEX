riting is one of the most important inventions ever made by humans. By putting spoken language into visible, material form, people could for the first time store information and transmit it across time and across space. It meant that a person’s words could be recorded and read by others decades, or even centuries later. It meant that people could send letters, instructions, or treaties to other people thousands of kilometers away. Writing was the world’s first true information technology, and it was revolutionary. The very ubiquity of writing in our civilization has made it seem like a natural, unquestioned part of our cultural landscape. Yet it was not always this way. Although anatomically modern humans have existed for about one hundred thousand years, writing is a relatively recent invention — just over five thousand years old. How and why did writing first appear? One of the most important aspects of writing brought out in this book and exhibit is the fact that it was invented independently at least four times in different places in the Old World and Americas — in Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, and Mesoamerica. The specifics of writing varied from place to place, just as did the apparent motivation to invent writing. It is clear that in Mesopotamia, and perhaps to a lesser degree in Egypt, writing only came into existence with the emergence of state societies or civilizations. The earliest written texts from Mesopotamia, from the site of Uruk, are economic records, indicating that the early state needed to keep records of the people who worked for it, the food rations it disbursed, and the taxes it collected. Writing allowed the bureaucracy to have an institutional memory that extended beyond the lifetime of any single priest or scribe. Writing continues to fill those exact same needs of the state, five thousand years later. Once it was thought that writing, regardless of where it was invented, was related to the bureaucratic needs of the newly emerged complex states. Our exhibit draws upon the most current scholarship to take a more nuanced view. For example, the earliest writing in Egypt, although related to state concerns, seems to be more about ceremonial display, while writing in China is first attested in divination rituals, and the hieroglyphic writing of Mesoamerica was motivated by religious beliefs. In much of today’s world, literacy — the ability to use the marvelous invention of writing — is largely taken for granted. Yet in the earliest states, we estimate that literacy was limited to less than 1 percent of the population so that it was rare for even kings to know how to read and write. In this context, it is hardly surprising that the earliest writing and the written word itself would have seemed mysterious, powerful, and even inspired by the gods. Exhibit curator Christopher Woods has done a remarkable job in bringing together the world’s earliest known examples of true writing, while showing us the contexts in which the first visible language was used. This is the first time that the 5,300-year-old clay tablets from Uruk — the earliest writing we know of so far — can be seen in the United States. Visitors to our exhibit and readers of this catalog will be able to see and compare the parallel pathways by which writing came into being and was used by the earliest kingdoms of Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, and the Maya world. Seeing these four examples of the earliest writing together in one place, one cannot fail to be impressed by the wonder of human creativity in these independent inventions that fundamentally transformed the very nature of civilization. I want to thank Christopher Woods, along with Chief Curator Geoff Emberling and Special Exhibits Coordinator Emily Teeter, for envisioning and creating an exhibit that not only educates us, but helps us to see this fundamental and unquestioned part of our life and civilization in an entirely new light.

iven the fundamental importance of writing to the rise of civilizations, it will come as no surprise that a major challenge for this exhibit and catalog has been to limit our scope. We do not discuss every script used in the ancient Middle East (to say nothing of the rest of the world), we do not enumerate every use to which writing was put, or discuss in detail the many changes that writing enabled and imposed, from facilitating the ability of bureaucracies to control their subjects to fundamentally changing the nature of literature. Curator Christopher Woods has maintained an admirably clear focus on inventions of writing — on the early writing systems themselves. The result is a careful look at a subject that is fundamental to understanding past societies. Exhibits are vast collaborative efforts, especially ones that include more than twenty authors and loans from five different museums. It is a great pleasure to thank the many people and institutions who made this project possible. Thanks to our colleagues at lending museums: James Cuno, Richard Townsend, Elinor Pearlstein, and Angie Morrow at the Art Institute of Chicago; Anthony Hirschel, Richard Born, and Angela Steinmetz at the Smart Museum of Art; Lawrence Stager, Joseph Greene, and Adam Aja at the Harvard Semitic Museum; Ulla Kasten, Amy Dowe, and Carl Kaufman at the Yale Art Gallery; and Beate Salje, Joachim Marzahn, Ramona Föllmer, and Olaf M. Teßmer at the Vorderasiatisches Museum, Berlin. Here at the Oriental Institute, we thank our staff: Registrars Helen McDonald and Susan Allison, who did so much to organize and facilitate the loans; our conservators, Alison Whyte and Laura D’Alessandro, for preparing the objects for exhibit; and in our Photo Department, Anna Ressman assisted by Kevin Duong, Colin Halverson, and Kathryn Weber for the splendid new photography. Thomas James, Assistant Curator of Digital Collections, designed interactives for the exhibit and Web site, assisted by Allison Drtina. Our Publications Department, Thomas Urban and Leslie Schramer, demonstrated their usual good cheer and efficiency designing, editing, and producing this catalog. The exhibit team, Erik Lindahl and Brian Zimerle, were responsible for the overall design and installation of the show. Robert Wagner kindly provided translations of the catalog entries from the Vorderasiatisches Museum. Head of Public Education Carole Krucoff and intern Melanna Kallionakis Smith provided valuable recommendations on exhibit design and writing. Dianne Hanau-Strain of HanauStrain Associates designed the elegant cover and gave good advice. We also thank Oriental Institute Director Gil Stein and Executive Director Steve Camp for their consistent and generous support of the exhibit program. Assisting Christopher Woods on the curatorial front, Emily Teeter, Special Exhibits Coordinator, kept the catalog and exhibit on track. Curatorial Assistants Oya Topçuoğlu and Elise MacArthur undertook a range of duties, from object selection to case layouts and authoring object entries; Andrew Dix, Tablet Assistant for the Oriental Institute’s Tablet Collection, supplied information about some of the tablets. Dr. Michael Vannier of the University of Chicago Medical Center, aided by Monica Witczak, led the CT examination of the Mesopotamian token balls. We thank Matthew Stolper for allowing the museum to use the Persepolis Tablet Project’s PTM photography set up for some of the exhibit materials. We appreciate the generosity of the Egypt Exploration Society and Günter Dreyer, respectively, for permitting us to reproduce images from their publications. Robert K. Englund prepared the diagrams of the early cuneiform tablets, and Hans Nissen provided a crucial photograph. We also thank the anonymous reviewer of the exhibit catalog for helpful comments made under pressure of time. Our Community Focus Group (Angela Adams, Randy Adamsick, Christine Carrino, Dianne Hanau-Strain, Nathan Mason, Patty McNamara, Cesário Moreno, and Molly Woulfe) has once again provided valuable advice in the planning stages of the exhibit and associated programs.

A number of companies and individuals showed their support for this exhibit. The Women’s Board of the University of Chicago generously underwrote the exhibit catalog as well as a portion of the exhibit costs. We also thank Exelon for their ongoing support of our special-exhibits program. We also appreciate the support of T. Kimball Brooker, David and Judy Harris, Julius Lewis and the Rhoades Foundation, Catherine Moore, Mary and Charles Shea, Toni Smith, and Anna White for their enthusiasm for the project. It is with a tinge of sadness that we also thank the Rita Picken Memorial Fund. Rita, a long-time volunteer at the Oriental Institute, and a sharp-witted and warm-hearted supporter, would have enjoyed this show.

“The invention of writing and of a convenient system of records on paper has had a greater influence in uplifting the human race than any other intellectual achievement in the career of man. It was more important than all the battles ever fought and all the constitutions ever devised.”
— J. H. Breasted, The Conquest of Civilization, pp. 53–54
T
he ability to represent language graphically, to make language visible, stands as one of humanity’s greatest intellectual and cultural achievements. It is an often-quoted sentiment that speech is to being human, what writing is to civilization, or, in the words of the anthropologist Jack Goody, “Cognitively as well as sociologically, writing underpins ‘civilization,’ the culture of cities” (1987, p. 300). While many of us would quibble with the grandness of this claim and its implications for non-literate societies, it would be difficult to dismiss the contention that writing — the boundary between history and prehistory — transformed civilization more than any other invention. Books, letters, records, computers — all the ways in which we record ideas, facts, opinions, and sentiments — are inconceivable without writing. Speech is temporally fleeting and spatially anchored. Writing frees speech of these constraints, giving it permanence and allowing it to be transmitted over space far beyond the place of discourse. Writing also enhances capacity, enabling the recording of information well beyond the capabilities of human memory. Our exhibit, Visible Language: Inventions of Writing in the Ancient Middle East and Beyond, explores mankind’s earliest attempts to graphically represent language. In Mesopotamia and Egypt this took place toward the end of the fourth millennium bc. But no less significant developments took place in China at the end of the second millennium bc, and in Mesoamerica by the middle of the first millennium bc. The Middle Eastern inventions of writing, the primary focus of our exhibit, together with the inventions in China and Mesoamerica, comprise the four “pristine” writing systems. These are the four instances in human history when writing was invented ex nihilo “out of nothing” — that is, from scratch — with no previous exposure to, or knowledge of, writing. It appears quite likely that all other writing systems either derive from, or were inspired by, these four. Future research may, of course, force us to augment, or even decrease, this number. For instance, we do not currently include among these the undeciphered Harappan script of the Indus valley civilization (midthird millennium bc), for its status as a writing system and the influence of Mesopotamian cuneiform remain uncertain. But at our present state of knowledge, Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, and Mesoamerica represent the best candidates for the independent inventions of writing. In addition to investigating the four pristine writing systems, the exhibit addresses the forerunners to writing in Mesopotamia and Egypt as well as the evolution of these scripts. Of particular interest, with regard to the latter, is how in Egypt several derivative scripts developed to write the same language, whereas in Mesopotamia one script, cuneiform, which was invented to express Sumerian (unrelated to any known language), was adapted to write several unrelated languages, including Akkadian (belonging to the Semitic language family) and Hittite (Indo-European). The exhibit also explores a lesser-known writing system, Anatolian hieroglyphs, as well as the invention of one of the most influential and widely disseminated writing systems, the alphabet.

Visible Language opens at a time of renewed interest in written language generally and early writing systems in particular. Once banished to the fringes of linguistics, considered the poor cousin of speech, writing has gradually come to be acknowledged as an inherently interesting linguistic and cultural phenomenon in its own right — a mode of human communication parallel to speech and not necessarily subservient to it (Sampson 1985, p. 11). Not surprisingly, this newfound interest in the written word has reinvigorated discussion about the world’s first writing systems, an area of study that until recently was the restricted purview of a few specialists working with the individual languages. And with recent finds from Abydos in Upper Egypt — which may very well not only challenge the primacy of writing in Mesopotamia, but undermine common assumptions about the origins and evolution of writing — this topic promises to continue to draw the interest of scholars and the public alike. Finally, if we may be permitted to boast, it is particularly fitting that the Oriental Institute present an exhibit on early writing, given our long history of study in this area. Indeed, the modern study of writing systems has its beginnings at the Oriental Institute with the publication in 1952 of Ignace J. Gelb’s highly influential A Study of Writing.
*** In what follows I discuss some aspects of early writing, describing in broad strokes some of the similarities and differences between these systems, both in terms of the cultural context of each invention and, more particularly, the mechanics of each system. Much has changed in the nearly sixty years since the publication of Gelb’s pioneering study. Then, monogenesis and “stimulus diffusion” were the theories of the day. These ideas are most closely associated with Gelb, although they had earlier proponents and antecedents. In its essentials, the theory is that writing originated only once, namely, in Mesopotamia with the Sumerian invention. And, from southern Iraq, the idea of writing, rather than the technology itself, spread during periods of strong cultural influence, to Egypt at the beginning of the third millennium and, by uncertain processes and mediums, eventually to China at the end of the second millennium. Writing in the New World, which was little understood at the time, Gelb discounted, claiming that it was not real writing at all. Since Gelb’s day, major strides have been made in understanding early Mesoamerican writing and today no one would seriously question the Maya script’s status as true writing. And recent finds at Abydos that have pushed back the date of writing in Egypt, making it contemporaneous with the Mesopotamian invention, further undermine the old assumption that writing arose in Egypt under Sumerian influences. Finally, it is difficult to accept that Mesopotamian writing could inspire the type of system that developed in China at the end of the second millennium, the Sumero-Akkadian writing system at that time being so completely different from the one developed by the Chinese, not to mention the distances involved. Acceptance of the independent invention of writing in these four cultures naturally raises questions

as to their similarities and differences in terms of the social context of each invention, their structure, and evolution — in short, to what degree can we speak of writing universals when we consider the pristine systems?
*** As for the cultural contexts of the invention, the clearest evidence is from Mesopotamia. There can be no doubt that the appearance of writing here was closely related to the sudden expansion of Mesopotamian civilization, an expansion that is particularly well attested at the city-state of Uruk — a settlement that in a short period of time became the largest in Babylonia, and the place where writing is first found and, in all likelihood, invented in Mesopotamia. Uruk writing can be convincingly connected with the dramatic increase in the sociocultural complexity that defined the city-state at the end of the fourth millennium. Given that the vast majority of the earliest cuneiform texts are administrative — detailing transactions involving property, materials, and labor — it is indeed difficult not to see the invention of writing as a solution to the practical bureaucratic problems posed by an increasingly complex economy. And the Egyptian invention may corroborate the utilitarian basis of writing. Long connected with ceremonial display, early writing in Egypt arguably now finds closer associations with bureaucratic necessity. The some two hundred small bone and ivory tags and the more than one hundred inscribed jars found at Abydos bear short inscriptions consisting of numerical notations (limited to the tags) and, what may be, personal names, place names, and the names of institutions. The tags and jars plausibly relate to the management of deliveries, documenting their places of origin. Similar to the Mesopotamian development, the invention of writing has been connected to the increase of sociopolitical complexity, which included the emergence of a vast territorial state near the end of the fourth millennium (see Baines 2004, pp. 161–62). The nexus between administration, social complexity, and writing is more tenuous in the Chinese and Maya cases. In China, the social component is clearly in evidence as witnessed by the emergent Shang state (ca. 1200 bc), but writing is first attested primarily within the context of divination — for the purpose of recording royal divinations performed at the Shang court. Written on turtle shells and ox scapulas, these inscriptions recorded the answers to queries that were put to the gods (see 14. The Beginnings of Writing in China, this volume). The Mesoamerican case is even more nebulous. The earliest writing in the Americas — the undeciphered Zapotec and Isthmian scripts and the first Maya writing — is essentially commemorative with a considerable theological component, many of the glyphs having a basis in long-established iconographic traditions and a calendrical system of great cultural significance (see Houston 2004b, pp. 292–308). Further, in the betterunderstood Maya case, the advent of sociopolitical complexity, as witnessed by monumental architecture and increased social stratification, predates the first texts by several centuries (Houston 2004b, pp. 302-03). These are contexts that may suggest religious and cultural motivations for writing, rather than administrative or economic necessities (see 15. The Development of Maya Writing, this volume; Houston 2004b, p. 308). It has been suggested that in those cultures for which we do not have direct evidence for record keeping, utilitarian administrative necessities were nevertheless the driving force behind the invention of writing (Postgate, Wang, and Wilkinson 1995). The absence of these kinds of records in these cases, it is claimed, is to be attributed to the perishable media on which they were likely to have been kept — papyrus in Egypt, wood or bamboo slips in China, or bark or palm leaves in Mesoamerica. Although based entirely on circumstantial evidence, the hypothesis is, in many ways, compelling. Yet, there are reasons to question the utilitarian basis of all writing, and whether we are correct in assuming that writing must have a universal basis in the first place. The aforementioned tags discovered at Abydos, for instance, were found within the context of an elite burial and were the result of a fairly labor-intensive manufacturing process, the inscriptions being incised into bone and subsequently colored with black paste (see 6. The Earliest Egyptian Writing, this volume). The inefficiency in terms of the effort and costs involved suggests that writing in this case had a purpose beyond practical administration, though not necessarily incompatible with it. Even in the best-documented case, Mesopotamia, where writing is unquestionably bound to administration, the relationship may not be one of cause and effect — for writing emerges at the end of the Uruk period, appearing just as the sociopolitical institutions that gave rise to it collapse. Writing here, it can

be argued, did not give rise to complex bureaucracy, but was a function, or end result, of it. And if the breaks in the written record have a reality beyond the vagaries of discovery, then this new technology was not indispensable for Mesopotamian administration. The same can be said for Mesoamerican writing, which likewise makes its appearance shortly before the polities out of which it grew began to crumble (Houston 2004a, p. 10). Conversely, we may point to those complex cultures that managed quite well without writing, for instance, the civilizations of West Africa, the Incas, or the Aztecs before the Spanish conquest (Trigger 2004, p. 40). And so questions remain as to the relationship between writing and social complexity — what role does writing play in shaping civilization? Is writing a defining characteristic of civilization? And, more specifically, is all writing ultimately based in administration and record keeping? At present, it appears that we are dealing with likelihoods and general tendencies rather than universals. As Jerrold Cooper points out, writing is not “an obligatory marker for complex societies or civilizations. Rather, writing is a response, but not the only possible response, to problems raised by complexity” (2004, p. 94). Writing tends to arise as societies become more complex, and writing is often tied to bureaucracy — again as a response, not a cause — but there are, of course, exceptions. As Piotr Michalowski reminds us, “actuaries have their place in the world, but even the administrative use of writing involves complex psychological, ideological, and social issues that cannot be accounted for by purely utilitarian explanations” (1994, p. 56).
*** There is a more basic question that must be addressed before we can speak with confidence about the nature of the world’s earliest writing systems and the roles they played in the societies that gave rise to them — namely, what is writing? It is a question that is more difficult than first appearances suggest. Broadly defined, writing represents speech. One must be able to recover the spoken word, unambiguously, from a system of visible marks in order for those marks to be considered writing. As defined in a recent survey of the world’s writing systems, writing is “a system of more or less permanent marks used to represent an utterance in such a way that it can be recovered more or less exactly without the intervention of the utterer” (Daniels 1996, p. 3). The bond to the spoken word is prerequisite to any definition of writing. Those systems that meet this criterion, and so represent true writing, are labeled glottographic, while systems of communication that represent ideas only, without that essential bond to speech and so do not meet our definition of writing — for example, musical and mathematical notation, international road signs and the like — are labeled semasiographic (Sampson 1985, pp. 29–30). An often-cited example of semasiography is the so-called Cheyenne letter (fig. 2). This nineteenthcentury pictographic letter was posted by a Cheyenne father named Turtle-Following-His-Wife to his son, Little-Man, both of whom are represented by icons above the drawings of the respective figures. The letter contains a request from the father for his son to return home. The essence of this message — “Come to me” — is indicated by the “speech lines” emanating from the father’s mouth and by two lines drawn from the small figure at the right shoulder of Little Man in the direction of his father. The fifty-three small circles between the two figures represent fifty-three dollars, which the father is sending Little-Man to cover expenses in connection with the trip (DeFrancis 1989, pp. 38–39; Gelb 1963, pp. 30–31). The message is quite detailed and specific, but, since it represents ideas

19
rather than speech directly, it is not writing — the message could be rendered in speech in various ways without affecting its essential meaning. In order for the letter to be intelligible, the father and the son presumably would have had a prior understanding of the symbols and their arrangement. Far from representing an outdated, primitive form of communication, semasiography is being increasingly used in this era of globalization and mass media, in which it is necessary to communicate with speakers of various languages (Sampson 1985, pp. 31–32). Typically, these messages appear in limited and well-established contexts, but nevertheless may be quite sophisticated: a well-known example is unpacking and assembly instructions of the type given in figure 3 — with the exception of the word “Ikea” in the fourth case, the entirety of this relatively complex message is communicated pictographically (however, the question mark, while not representing speech, is more accurately described as an ideogram — representing the “idea” of a question). Implicit to most discussions of writing is that the invention represents a punctual event — that there is a knife-edged division between the eras of the oral and the written, between prehistory and history. But upon closer inspection, the situation is not as sharply defined as we often assume, and there is no distinct watershed moment when full speech begins to be made visible. First, in terms of the origins of the individual signs, writing grows in part out of earlier, long-standing symbolic communicative systems that are not writing at all, that is, out of semasiography. Second, in their earliest phases, writing systems have more in common with the semasiographic systems from which they spring than the mature, full-fledged writing systems that they become. This first point is particularly well illustrated in Mesopotamia. At the end of the Uruk period, around 3500–3300 bc, there were a number of communicative devices utilized by administration that were decidedly not writing. These included pictographic and iconographic elements known to us from the glyptic and visual arts, clay envelopes, counters of various kinds, and numerical tablets. When writing was created, it was not a simple evolutionary development since many of these same devices persevered along side it (Michalowski 1990, p. 59; idem 1994, p. 64). Rather, writing in Mesopotamia borrowed elements from these various non-linguistic structures, added many new ones, codified and integrated the whole into a system that was quite different from the ones in which the individual elements originated (Michalowski 1996, pp. 35–36). Similar developments are attested for the Egyptian, Chinese, and Maya systems as well. In all cases, early writing contains signs, or graphs, that have an ancestry — for example, as symbols, icons, emblems, or pot marks — in earlier communicative systems. There is a distinction to be drawn, however, between the origins of individual graphs and the origins of the system. The systemization of the various elements of the writing was itself a more or less punctual event. In Mesopotamia — and the same applies to Mesoamerica, Egypt, and China — writing appears full-blown, from a structural point of view (Michalowski 1994, pp. 55–56; idem 1996, pp. 35–36). The essential organizing principles are in place at the very beginning. Writing already represents a coherent system in its earliest phases, reflecting most of the features and characteristics that it would display in its later, mature phases. Certainly, each writing system would evolve further — mostly in terms of sign inventory and

20
the relative proportions of signs representing words and those representing syllables or consonants without meaning (see below) — but these were developments that were separated by often long periods of stability. What is at issue, however, returning to the second point made above, is the degree to which nascent writing systems represented speech. The operative word here is degree, for early writing did not reflect spoken language, nor was it invented to do so. Each of the pristine systems was of limited dissemination and each was used to record information within restricted domains. As such, early writing systems could rely heavily on oral context and non-linguistic background information to make their abbreviated, mnemonic messages intelligible. Prior to the invention of writing, the transmission of information and knowledge was the purview of oral traditions. The invention of writing did not immediately change this. Hundreds of years would pass in most cases before writing was used to record literature, letters, historical accounts, and other genres that originally belonged to the realm of speech, but that we most closely associate with writing. Indeed, Jerrold Cooper has made the point that the domains in which early writing was used were, in fact, invented along with writing itself — “Livestock or ration accounts, land management records, lexical texts, labels identifying funerary offerings, offering lists, divination records, and commemorative stelae have no oral counterparts. Rather, they represent the extension of language use into areas where spoken language cannot do the job” (2004, p. 83). Particularly for early Mesopotamian and Egyptian writing, the bond with the spoken word was tenuous and, as Stephen Houston has pointed out, we do not know how the ancients read these documents, or if it is even appropriate to speak of reading in the sense that we understand it today (2004a, p. 12). The earliest Egyptian writing displays a significantly closer relationship with speech than its Sumerian counterpart; early Chinese and Maya scripts more so, but again, here the extant materials do not necessarily represent writing in its incipient phases. Indeed, early writing in Mesopotamia and Egypt, which may be the most representative of writing in its earliest stages, is not so different from the Aztec codices that recorded ideas and that we categorize as non-writing (Trigger 2004, pp. 47–48).
*** What systems of communication that eventually develop into full-fledged writing do have, as opposed to their semasiographic counterparts and progenitors, is the germ of phoneticism — the rebus principal is integrated into these systems. That is, the existence of homonyms in the language is exploited in that the sound of one word, most often one with a referent that can be easily drawn, is used to write another word that is pronounced identically or similarly, just as we alphabet users might draw the picture of an eye, , to write the first personal pronoun “I” in a game of Pictionary. The rebus principle is integral to writing, as it allows the writing of those elements of language that do not lend themselves easily to graphic representation, such as pronouns, grammatical markers, and, of particular importance for early writing, personal names and foreign words. There is an element of economy here as well. By assigning homonyms to a common sign, the system can make do with fewer signs, thus facilitating the learning of the script. Early Mesopotamian writing, in particular, displays a remarkably limited degree of phonetization and use of the rebus principle. In this sense, in terms of reflecting full speech, the development of early writing was gradual. It was not before the first quarter of the third millennium bc that rebus writings would play a significant role, and not until the second half of the third millennium that the linear order of signs reflected sequential speech. The Mesopotamian case demonstrates that we must accept a continuum between semasiography and glottography, for the distinction between the two disappears without the representation of connected speech and confirmed rebus writings. In the case of Egyptian writing, phonetic signs apparently played a larger role in its incipient stage. Nevertheless, over five hundred years would pass before the script recorded continuous speech. The rebus principle was obviously known at an early date in both systems, and so the potential to represent speech was there from the very beginning or nearly so. What is at issue, then, is not so much the evolution of script in terms of developing new strategies, but rather the limited application of writing and its perception within the culture. Writing was regarded as a mode of communication quite distinct from speech — and, alien to our own perceptions of writing, the earliest writing systems, as we have seen, fulfilled different communicative niches than speech. But beyond the

21
social perception of writing, there are also functional reasons for the divide between speech and writing in pristine systems, motivations that extend to the nature of writing itself. Although writing is born of speech, it belongs to the realm of the visual rather than the oral and aural, and so it has a different basis from speech. First, there is an intrinsic element of economy in all writing — no writing system notates all of the linguistic structure of speech. Tone, stress, and loudness, for instance, are most often omitted in writing systems that are considered to be highly phonetic. In the name of economy writing omits those elements that can be recovered from context. Given the limited and predictable domains in which early writing was applied, much of the linguistic structure, particularly with regard to grammatical markers, could be omitted. We must also take into account the way in which language is first committed to writing. At the root of pristine writing is the logogram — graphs representing individual words — although a more accurate description would be to say that early writing is ultimately based on the morpheme. Morphemes represent the smallest meaningful units in language, and include lexemes, or words, as well as affixes that may be added to form larger words: for example, drink contains one morpheme, while undrinkable contains three (the verb drink and the affixes un- and -able). Morphemes have a greater psychological salience for native speakers than the phonemes, or sounds, that constitute morphemes (Sampson 1985, p. 36). People think in terms of morphemes and syllables, and they are immediately apparent to speakers without the linguistic awareness that allows for the dissection of language into units smaller than the syllable. Although not immediately apparent to those of us reared on the alphabet, dividing words into individual sounds smaller than morphemes is not intuitive, but requires a level of linguistic training, which we acquire when we learn how to read and write. Thus, it comes as no surprise that none of the pristine writing systems is alphabetic. Further, morphemes, specifically nouns, can often be represented by motivated, iconic symbols — that is, by pictures or pictographs — an option that naturally facilitates both the creation and learning of a script. On the other hand, morphemes that do not lend themselves to iconic representation can be expressed by relying upon homonymy and the rebus principle. But in many cases, these very morphemes represent the grammar. And, as we have seen, grammatical elements can often be recovered from context and so may be omitted.
*** That the logogram is at the root of pristine writing, while the rebus principle generates further phonetic values, accounts for similarities shared by the four pristine writing systems. As previously observed, all four have logograms, which are used to write nouns, verbs, and adjectives. And all have phonograms, signs that represent sound but not meaning, that are used to write bound morphemes, such as grammatical affixes. A phonological component is essential to a writing system for the simple reason that a system would have, quite literally, an impossibly large sign inventory — numbering into the tens of thousands, at least — if it assigned a different graph to each and every morpheme in a language, not to mention that without a phonological component the script would have no obvious bond to the language it was representing. Once again, economy is essential to writing and it is for the sake of economy that a phonological dimension and redundancy must be built into every logographic system. Consequently, there are no purely logographic writing systems. Furthermore, all the pristine writing systems have a class of semantic determinatives, although these are apparently rare in Maya writing. These are signs that belong to the realm of writing only, as they were not spoken but rather were used in reading to classify nouns and disambiguate homonyms by semantic class. In addition to the rebus strategy, which relies on homonyms, each system also exploited the existence of synonyms by assigning semantically related concepts or nouns to the same graph, and distinguishing the individual readings with phonograms or semantic determinatives. But there are also important differences between these writing systems, some of which correspond to different language structures. As is the case with the Semitic languages, in Egyptian semantic meaning is expressed primarily through consonant variations, while grammatical meaning — which as we have seen is often retrievable from context by speakers — is expressed by vowels. It comes as no surprise then that Egyptian writing is logo-consonantal with uni-consonantal, biliteral, and triliteral consonant graphs. Sumerian and Maya, on the other hand, lacking this distinction between consonants and vowels, are logo-syllabic with the phonograms

22
consisting of syllables. And although Chinese writing is built on the same principles, structurally it is quite different. Here the logogram plays an even greater role, and every homonym has its own graph; in the course of the script’s development, phonograms were added into the individual graphs, creating compound signs that combined phonological and semantic information, thus enhancing the script’s bond with spoken language. The relationship between language structure and writing has been pursued by Peter Daniels (1992), and recently by William Boltz (2000) in connection with Chinese. Both suggest that highly monosyllabic languages such as Sumerian and early Chinese, in which syllables are equivalent to morphemes, possess homonyms in large numbers and so more readily lend themselves, structurally, to productive rebus formations. They argue that it is more than simple coincidence that early writing tends to represent monosyllabic languages — that language structure affects writing. Critics of this idea contend that the theory of monosyllabicity stands in opposition to cultural models for the origins of writing, while, on the other hand, it appears not to be applicable to all cases (Houston 2004a, p. 7; Trigger 2004, p. 63). Maya and Egyptian do not share the same structure and degree of monosyllabicity as Chinese and Sumerian, while Inca, which was largely monosyllabic, did not develop a script. This suggests that monosyllabicity is just one among other possible motivations for writing — it likely did play a role in the commitment of Chinese and Sumerian to a visible form, yet it was not the only force at work, or, necessarily, a requisite one. Certainly, there are cultural factors involved in writing, and they may play a more critical role, but this does not exclude structural motivations. We must admit that there are correlations between the internal structure of spoken language and script type — we need only point to consonantal writing in Semitic languages to show this much. Historically, we can also speak of broad similarities, but among them we see differences in detail. In terms of the formal development of individual graphs, we observe that pictographs — those signs that resemble their referents — may become in the course of time increasingly symbolic, that is, they become bleached of their iconicity and lose the visual similarity that they once shared with their referents. The degree to which iconicity is lost depends in part upon the medium of writing and the relationship between art and text. In Mesopotamia, where writing was done on clay, graphs became less iconic and more symbolic once they were no longer drawn with curvilinear lines but rather pressed into the clay in wedge-like strokes. But in Egypt and Mesoamerica, where the bond between art and writing was greater, in part owing to the use of the pen and the brush, iconicity was retained to a much higher degree (Cooper 2004, pp. 87–88). However, again, we must be careful not to take this as a universal development. In China, for example, where graphs were also drawn and painted, the iconic value of the graphs was lost, although the semantic basis of the logograms remained robust. The transition to increased symbolism concerns not only the shape of the signs, but also their values in terms of phoneticism. As we have seen, historically, each pristine writing system increased its phonetic representation, becoming more closely linked to spoken language and thus better able to represent it. Each system, theoretically, could have simplified in the interests of efficiency, abandoning its logographic and semantic origins and developing into a purely phonetic system. Such a development would have greatly simplified the sign inventories of each: Sumerian, Chinese, and Maya could have conveyed language entirely with syllabic signs; and Egyptian could have done the same with its small class of uni-consonantal graphs — certainly, in all these cases there was the potential for this. That this development did not take place, that none of the pristine writing systems evolved into a purely phonographic one, speaks to overriding social pressures and the role of ideology in writing (see Cooper 2004, pp. 90–92). Writing systems are inherently conservative and once they reach their stable, mature phases they tend to persevere over long periods, resisting large-scale changes and maintaining their organizing principles. Issues of cultural identity and perpetuating long-established scribal traditions and the prestige attached to them are important contributing factors. Furthermore, in cultures of highly restricted literacy, as is the case with the four pristine systems, for the elites who control writing, there are, naturally, advantages to keeping writing complex and arcane (Gelb 1963, p. 165). However, we must not overlook other, compelling linguistic reasons for maintaining logography. Logography tends to mask morphophonemic alternations — that is, the various pronunciations that morphemes acquire in different phonological environments. This is particularly true of Maya writing, and, although often

23
misunderstood, of Sumerian writing as well (Robertson 2004, pp. 32–34; Woods 2010). In short, a morpheme has one fixed spelling even though it may have multiple pronunciations depending on the context. English orthography observes this principle, for instance, in the writing of the past-tense suffix -ed, which has three different pronunciations, or allomorphs, but one invariant spelling: following d and t, it is pronounced -ɨd, where ɨ is a neutral vowel labeled a “schwa,” for example, added, visited; after all other voiced consonants (those produced with vibration of the vocal cords) and after vowels, it is pronounced d, for example, mobbed, booed; following all other voiceless consonants (those produced without vibration of the vocal cords), it is pronounced t, for example, mopped, kissed, nicked.
In other words, English orthography ignores allomorphic alternation with respect to the past-tense suffix. Native speakers intuitively apply the same phonological rules that they use when speaking, and subconsciously read written -ed as d following voiced consonants or vowels, and as t following voiceless consonants. The basic principle at work here, as described by Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle, is that writing systems tend not to indicate phonetic variation “where it is predictable by general rule” (1968, p. 49). Again, economy is the motivating factor, as a single written form can represent several allomorphic realizations. But there are further advantages to this type of logography, or more accurately, morphography. It has been claimed, for instance, that one of the advantages of morphographic systems is that they provide a common orthographic foundation for various dialects and historical stages of a language. Writing systems of this type tend to represent morphemes in their most basic shapes — in other words, the written form is the most common allomorph or the one that is perceived by speakers to be, on some level, the default form. These basic allomorphs, it is argued, are often remarkably stable and resistant to secondary sound changes. Consequently, logographic writing systems that exploit basic allomorphs can provide speakers of different dialects with a mutually intelligible written language, while preserving access to older documents (Chomsky and Halle 1968, p. 49; Sampson 1985, p. 171; compare DeFrancis 1984, p. 154). In this light, there were distinct benefits to logography beyond the distinguishing of homonyms. And as Japan bears witness, heavy doses of logography, while seeming to complicate a writing system, particularly in the eyes of alphabet users, in no way diminishes literacy rates (Trigger 2004, p. 65). The retention of logography, for both linguistic and cultural reasons, appears to be one of the most stable tendencies when comparing pristine writing systems. And, as Jerrold Cooper has recently admonished us, it is of tendencies that we must speak when we discuss the similarities in early writing (2004, pp. 93–94). In the end, as unsatisfying as it may be, we must content ourselves with the likelihood that there will never be a set of universals for pristine writing. The independence that characterizes the invention of each of the four writing systems extends to their internal structures, social contexts, and the evolutionary processes themselves — no two are identical. Yet, still there are similarities and tendencies. The study of the points of agreement, and disagreement, in early writing is in itself enlightening of the social and psycho-linguistic processes by which humans first made language visible.

1. Iconography of protolIterate SealS
B
eginning in the late seventh millennium bc, seals carved with sometimes elaborate designs were used to mark ownership of goods in the ancient Middle East. With the development of urban economies in the fourth millennium bc, seals were used to mark ownership, origin, authorization, acknowledgment, or obligation, as well as individual or institutional responsibility for goods. The seals were impressed on wet clay that sealed containers and storerooms, to secure the contents from unauthorized access. After the advent of writing, seals were impressed on tablets by administrative officials and witnesses to legal transactions. In addition to their undeniable value as works of art, seals provide important insights into the society, economy, and symbolic systems of the ancient Middle East. As the most important tools of the complex administrative system developed prior to the invention of writing, stamp and cylinder seals tell us about the intricate practices of record keeping, administrative hierarchy, and beliefs of ancient Mesopotamians. Cut from a variety of materials such as shell, bone, limestone, and semiprecious stones, seals also functioned as amulets, votive objects, and jewelry. Stamp seals first appeared in the seventh millennium bc in northern Iraq and quickly spread into the neighboring regions of Syria, Anatolia, and Iran. Early stamp seals have geometric designs carved on their flat surfaces (Catalog Nos. 2–3). Early in the fourth millennium, elaborately sculpted, animalshaped stamp seals with crude animal figures carved on their bases were introduced. Crouching rams and the heads of lions and rams were the most popular seal shapes (Catalog No. 1). The fourth millennium also gave rise to cylinder seals, a tall, cylindrical style of seal with images carved around its circumference. After a short period of co-existence, cylinder seals replaced stamp seals. The earliest use of cylinder seals is attested on hollow clay envelopes that contained tokens of various shapes and sizes (see 2. The Earliest Mesopotamian Writing, this volume). It is still uncertain why cylinder
seals were developed, and theories about this change in form are varied. Edith Porada suggested that cylinder seals, which appeared at a time when fine stone vessels were being produced, were a by-product of the stone-carving process. She claimed that because both vessel carving and seal engraving were done with the drill, the craftsmen who were able to use this tool skillfully may have developed the cylinder seal using the cylindrical stone cores of the vessels (Porada 1977, p. 7). On the other hand, Henri Frankfort suggested that since cylinders could be rolled on wet clay in one continuous motion, they provided an unbroken frieze that covered and sealed the juncture between a vessel and its cover, leading to the abandonment of stamp seals and the emergence of cylinders, which remained in use for two thousand years (Frankfort 1939, pp. 2–3). Finally, Hans Nissen has suggested that cylinder seals emerged as a result of the need for a more effective administrative control in the complex social system of fourthmillennium Mesopotamia, since with a cylinder the entire surface of an object could be sealed and protected from tampering while the small impressions of stamp seals provided only partial protection. In addition, the wider surface of the cylinder allowed increased variability in design, which in turn provided increasingly differentiated seals for a larger number of people (Nissen 1977, p. 15). Seals functioned as markers of ownership through their designs, which differed for each seal. After the invention of writing, an inscription often accompanied the design. Inscriptions on seals that identified seal owners by name and profession appeared in the first half of the third millennium bc. Most identifications of figures and events depicted on protoliterate seals, however, remain speculative in the absence of contemporary textual evidence. Although the imagery of protoliterate seals remains difficult for us to “read,” it is clear that it was used in conjunction with writing in a complex administrative system where the visual expression complemented the textual one.

The largest and best-known group of cylinder seals and seal impressions for the protoliterate period comes from the sacred Eana precinct in the ancient city of Uruk in southern Mesopotamia. Such is the importance of this city that scholars have named the period of its dominance the Uruk period. Seals and related materials were also found at the contemporary neighboring sites of Susa and Chogha Mish in southwestern Iran. At the very end of the fourth millennium bc these sites were important centers for the development of a complex administrative system and provide a toolkit similar to that from Uruk itself. Comparisons between Mesopotamia and Iran allow us to see the extent of shared ideology, technology, and administrative practices between the two regions. Despite difficulties of interpretation, representations on Uruk-period seals provide important insights into various aspects of Mesopotamian society such as social organization, rituals, economy, architecture, and warfare. Major themes were expressed on seals through various combinations of basic design elements to create a large variety of seal designs and to allow both individual people and institutions to have their own specific seals. Designs on protoliterate seals depict mostly rituals or ceremonies central to the functioning of the state. The most common subjects were cultic scenes, scenes depicting the priest-king, battles, animals in front of architectural facades (Catalog Nos. 4–5), animal files with rows of identical or different animals (Catalog Nos. 6–10), and animals attacking other animals (Catalog No. 11). These scenes with their lively figurative imagery constitute the beginning of narrative in Mesopotamian art. Toward the end of the Uruk period (ca. 3000 bc) abstract imagery with geometric motifs was also introduced into the cylinder seal repertoire of Mesopotamia. One recurrent figure on the protoliterate seals is a bearded man wearing his hair gathered in a bun, a thick, rolled band around his head, and a long diaphanous skirt covered with crosshatching. He is the central figure in a variety of scenes ranging from rituals, feeding plants to animals representing his active role in preserving the fertility of crops and herds (fig. 1.1), processions toward a monumental structure, and hunting and battlefield scenes. The importance attributed to this figure and his central role in a variety of activities help us to identify him
as a royal figure, who is also easily recognizable in protoliterate monuments. Initially this central figure appears as a man mastering the forces of nature (Catalog No. 12). The iconography of the figure signals the emergence of a powerful ruler at the top of the increasingly hierarchical society and complex administrative system of the Uruk period. Although the identity of this ruler is not known with certainty, he is likely to be connected with the royal figure known from later historical sources as en (Sumerian for “lord” or “ruler”), whose office combined cultic, military, and political powers. Cultic scenes depict humans approaching a building identified as a temple, carrying objects interpreted as offerings on their shoulders and in their hands (fig. 1.2). Another common design shows animals emerging from reed huts (fig. 1.3) accompanied by a reed bundle (Catalog No. 39) symbolizing the goddess Inana (see 2. The Earliest Mesopotamian Writing, this volume), which indicates their sacred character. Scenes depicting animals, mostly caprids in front of elaborate architectural facades, usually referred to as the “temple and herd” motif, have also been tied to the functioning of the temple institution through their identification as temple herds (Catalog Nos. 4–6). Finally, scenes involving manufacturing activities, in particular weaving, also belong to the group of scenes related to the functioning of the state (Catalog Nos. 13–15). Textual evidence indicates that Mesopotamian temples controlled a large workforce that took care of the temple fields and herds and manufactured products in associated workshops.

The close association between rituals and activities of production, both of which were fundamental parts of religious and economic life in ancient Mesopotamia, prove the importance of the temple institution in the economy. Based on this knowledge, scenes depicting men and women involved in activities such as weaving, threshing and storing grain, working the fields, herding animals, and carrying goods (Catalog No. 16) have been interpreted as showing the personnel in the service of temple institutions. Symbolic scenes depicting vessels, tools, or products of manufacturing arranged in rows were also popular design elements on protoliterate seals and they could also be combined with the above-mentioned scenes of manufacturing activities involving humans (Catalog Nos. 15, 37). In the battlefield scenes, the central male figure of the ruler holding a long spear dominates the scene (fig. 1.4). He stands on the right side of the composition looking over his troops and is larger in comparison to the rest of the figures. The spear and the figure’s large size are indications of his power and importance. The rest of the scene is populated by two groups of people, one victorious group standing up and holding weapons and another group on the ground with their legs bent up and hands tied behind their backs. It is clear that the scene in question is one of conquest over the fallen enemy where the priest-king and his troops are celebrating their victory. Such battlefield scenes suggest the existence of armed conflict and coercion in the protoliterate period (Catalog No. 17). Geometric seals most commonly found in Iran and referred to as “piedmont style” seals constitute a slightly later but quite different group (Catalog Nos. 18–19). These cylinder seals are normally made of a
dark stone called steatite or chlorite that was baked at a temperature high enough to cause the material to turn white and to take on a glazed appearance. Some examples are also cut in bone. What makes them different is the distinctive imagery with which they are carved, depicting either fully abstract elements or abstract elements combined with representations of trees and animals. The main geometric motifs used on piedmont seals are hatched meander, hourglass, crosses, triangles, lozenges, rosettes, and chevrons. The lack of written documents accompanying protoliterate seals and seal impressions that explain the meaning of their designs has given rise to a very puzzling question that scholars have been trying to answer for a long time. Is there any correlation between seal imagery and administration in protoliterate Mesopotamia? Several scholars have suggested

that there may be a link between the different categories of subjects illustrated on seals and the administrative system of the period. In addition, while in the historical periods the owner of a seal was identified primarily through an inscription on the seal that mentioned the name, profession, and/or political or religious affiliation of the individual, in the absence of inscriptions in the protoliterate period, the link between the seal and its owner may have been made through the seal imagery. One suggestion is that the quality of craftsmanship of seals and the complexity of their designs may be related to the status of the seal owner and his standing within the administrative hierarchy. Seals with schematic designs that were hastily made with mechanical tools probably belonged to institutions in which a large number of people were authorized to use the same seal and only a low level of differentiation in design was necessary. Simple patterns such as rows of animals could not be distinguished from one another and were thus used by anonymous individuals representing an institution. On the other hand, more complex seals with elaborate figurative imagery took a long time to make, were thus more expensive, and belonged to high-ranking individuals within the administrative hierarchy. Their complex patterns made up of unique design features differentiated and identified their owners. Another theory claims that seal imagery referred to distinct offices within the administration and each design category represented and was used by a different branch of the administration. In other words, the complex images on seals were literal depictions of activities concerning different sectors of the economy. For instance, seals depicting the priest-king in rituals, hunting, and battles may have been used to seal central storerooms located in temples in the city of Uruk, while seals with animal file designs may have been used by a section of the administration dealing with animal husbandry, and those depicting prisoners may have sealed war booty. A separate category of seals and seal impressions depicting pigtailed ladies involved in industrial activities may have been used by temple institutions involved in production activities such as spinning, weaving, and pottery making (Catalog No. 13). On the other hand, the geometric designs on the piedmont style seals, which are most common in
western Iran and appear also in central Mesopotamia, have been related to the Proto-Elamite script developed in Iran around the same time as the proto-cuneiform system in Mesopotamia. Holly Pittman, who has studied the iconography of piedmont seals and its association with writing, suggests that the imagery of piedmont seals is “a complex visual system made up of a large number of individual elements combined according to discernible rules” (Pittman 1994, p. xv). In other words, variation in the imagery of piedmont style seals was not introduced for decorative purposes, but it was meaningful within the administrative system. According to Pittman, some design elements used in the piedmont style have formal similarities to the appearance of some signs in the undeciphered Proto-Elamite writing system and thus carried meaning somehow comparable to that of signs. A similar association between writing and seal imagery has also been made for a cylinder seal formerly belonging to the Erlenmeyer collection (fig. 2.20). As described by Christopher Woods (2. The Earliest Mesopotamian Writing, this volume), this seal employs symbols that bridge the boundary between art and writing, a number of the graphs of the cuneiform writing system having their origins in the protoliterate visual arts. So far there is no scholarly agreement on the specific cultural value of seal imagery and a literal reading of protoliterate seal images will remain unattainable for us in the absence of contemporary written documents accompanying them. Nevertheless, protoliterate seals and their designs continue to play an invaluable role in our understanding of the social, political, and economic aspects of ancient Mesopotamian culture. Most important of all, protoliterate seals begin for the first time to narrate events and social relations accompanying the emergence of the state. It is clear that both seal imagery and writing were used to communicate information and as devices of social control by a newly emerging state structure in fourth-millennium Mesopotamia and its neighboring regions. In addition, the unquestionable value of seals as astonishing works of art shows the remarkable dexterity of the seal carver to narrate elaborate and detailed events and situations on such a small surface.

2. The earliesT MesopoTaMian WriTing
A
t some point during the second half of the fourth millennium bc Mesopotamians began to inscribe signs on wet clay in what may very well represent the world’s first writing system. The script is known as cuneiform (from Latin cuneus “wedge”) — a descriptive designation that refers to the distinctive wedge-like appearance of the signs, or graphs, which were fashioned with a reed stylus. Indeed, the native Sumerian designations, which include the words gag, gu-šum2, and sangtak, all similarly meaning “wedge” or “nail,” also reflect this visual quality. The cuneiform script was likely invented to express the Sumerian language, but was subsequently adapted to write a wide variety of unrelated languages throughout the ancient Middle East. These include Akkadian (see 3. Adaptation of Cuneiform to Write Akkadian, this volume), Eblaite, Elamite, Hittite (see 4. The Rise and Fall of Cuneiform Script in Hittite Anatolia,
2. the earliest MesopotaMian Writing

this volume), Hurrian, and Urartian. Cuneiform texts were written as late as the first century ad, more than three thousand years after the script’s invention. A consequence of using durable clay as the principal medium of writing, rather than perishable material such as papyrus, is that Mesopotamia is one of the best-documented civilizations prior to the Industrial Revolution.
uruk and the archaic text corpus
The earliest-known cuneiform documents were found at the sacred temple precinct Eana in the city-state of Uruk, located in southern Babylonia in present-day Iraq (figs. 2.1–2) — and there is good reason to believe that this was the birthplace of writing in Mesopotamia. The invention of writing was

tightly intertwined with the rapid development of Mesopotamian civilization, as evidenced by extraordinary changes that took place there toward the end of the fourth millennium. During the Late Uruk period (ca. 3350–3100 bc), which takes its name from the city, Uruk was characterized by rapid urbanization and population growth, swelling to a population of 20,000 to 50,000 individuals and a size of 2.5 sq. km — nearly twice the size of the next largest settlement — to become, arguably, the world’s first true city. Coupled with this, Uruk experienced a dramatic increase in social, political, and economic complexity. The results were a need to maintain records of production, goods, and labor and the corresponding rise of a complex administration. Writing was invented in this context. Indeed, that the vast majority of the earliest texts are administrative in nature suggests that the invention of writing was a response to practical social pressures — simply put, writing facilitated complex bureaucracy (Michalowski 1994, p. 56). It is important to stress in this connection that literature plays no role in the origins of writing in Mesopotamia. Religious texts, historical documents, and letters are not included among the archaic text corpus either. Rather, these text genres arise relatively late, beginning in the middle of the third millennium, some seven hundred or more years after the first written evidence.
The date traditionally given for the invention of writing in Mesopotamia is 3200 bc, but this is more or less conventional. A precise date for the earliest cuneiform texts has proved elusive, as virtually all the tablets were discovered in secondary archaeological contexts, specifically, in rubbish heaps that defy accurate stratigraphic analysis. The sun-hardened clay tablets, having obviously outlived their usefulness, were used along with other waste, such as potsherds, clay sealings, and broken mudbricks, as fill in leveling the foundations of new construction — consequently, it is impossible to establish when the tablets were written and used. The charcoal remains of pine beams found in the context of some of the Uruk texts suggest a date of around 3500–3390 bc. However, this date must be used with caution given that it represents a lone sample and various problems are known to complicate radiocarbon dates acquired from the latter half of fourth millennium (Margarete van Ess, personal communication). Currently, the German Archaeological Institute is attempting to acquire new radiocarbon dates of this material, which will hopefully clarify the situation. Despite the difficulties surrounding the dating, we can identity two distinct phases in the evolution of the archaic script — frequently referred to as protocuneiform — based primarily on graphic styles, technique of execution, and complexity of the documents,
mesopotamian accounts of the invention of writing
“(Enmerkar’s) speech was very grand; its meaning very profound. But the messenger’s mouth was too heavy, and he could not repeat the message. Because the messenger’s mouth was too heavy, and he could not repeat it, the Lord of Kulab (that is, Enmerkar) patted some clay and put the words on it as on a tablet. Before that day, words put on clay had never existed. But now, when the sun rose on that very day — so it was! The Lord of Kulab had put words as on a tablet — so it was!”
Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta, lines 500–06 (after Vanstiphout 2003, p. 85)
The oldest and most explicit Mesopotamian account of the origins of writing comes from the Sumerian story Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta, one of a cycle of narrative poems that involve the rivalry between the southern Mesopotamian city-state of Uruk and the faraway, fabled city of Aratta, considered to lie across seven mountain ranges on the Iranian plateau. The story is known primarily from early Old Babylonian sources (ca. 2000–1750 bc), but it was likely first compiled in the preceding Third Dynasty of Ur (conventionally referred to as the Ur III period, ca. 2100–2000 bc), based on older oral traditions.

all of which are suggestive of a chronological development. These two script stages correspond, but only indirectly, to the stratigraphy of the findspots. Consequently, the script and tablets of the earlier phase are labeled Uruk IV (ca. 3200 bc), while the script and tablets from roughly one hundred years later are labeled Uruk III (also known as the Jemdet Nasr period, ca. 3100 bc) (fig. 2.3). Approximately five thousand proto-cuneiform tablets were unearthed
at Uruk by the German Archaeological Institute between 1928 and 1976 (Englund 1998, pp. 18–41). But these are not the only witnesses to the archaic script. Proto-cuneiform texts corresponding to the Uruk III tablets have been found at the northern Babylonian sites of Jemdet Nasr, Khafajah, and Tell Uqair, testifying to the fact that the new technology spread quickly throughout Babylonia soon after its invention (in ancient Iran proto-cuneiform possibly inspired
Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta, like the other poems of the cycle, takes place at a time that is nearly contemporaneous with our earliest historical sources, during the semi-mythological First Dynasty of Uruk (ca. 2800–2700 bc), which included, in addition to Enmerkar, such legendary rulers as Gilgamesh and Lugalbanda. The story involves several challenges and counter challenges of ingenuity to determine which ruler — and city — has superiority over the other. This contest required an envoy to travel back and forth between the two cities in order to relate the long and cryptic messages, which, naturally, had to be memorized. As the excerpt given above describes, Enmerkar invented writing so that his message to the Lord of Aratta could be conveyed accurately, and would not be subject to the errors of memory. The messenger’s mouth is described, literally, as “heavy” (the Sumerian word is dugud), which may refer to his inability to memorize the lengthy message, but may also — or additionally — speak to his failure to convey the eloquence of Enmerkar’s words. Upon inspecting the inscrutable marks by the light of a fire, the Lord of Aratta furrowed his brow, for “the spoken words were mere wedges!.” Remarkably — and in contrast to many other indigenous accounts, for instance, the Egyptian one (“The Conception and Development of the Egyptian Writing System”) — the invention of writing is here portrayed as a human invention, occurring without the intervention of the gods. This account, mythological though it is, also shares the notion, which we believe to be historical fact, that writing was invented in the city-state of Uruk, and invented as a response to a practical, utilitarian need — though, that need, in reality, was to facilitate bureaucracy, and letters do not appear until nearly a millennium after the first texts.
In another Sumerian story, Inana and Enki, which also dates to the Old Babylonian period, writing is considered to be one of the hundred or so basic elements, or “essences” — the Sumerian term is me — of civilization. These me’s reside with Enki, the god of wisdom and intelligence and Inana’s father, in the ancient cult center of Eridug. Inana, coveting them, endeavors to acquire the me’s for her city, Uruk, by getting her father intoxicated — a common ploy in Sumerian literature — and duping him into giving them to her. Succeeding in her plot, Inana loads the me’s, including that of the scribe’s craft (Sumerian nam-dub-sar), into the Boat of Heaven bound for Uruk. The story may be interpreted as an etiology, though one necessarily based on a much older oral tradition, for Uruk’s ascendancy. Writing, accounting, and the scribal matters generally were in the third millennium bc the purview of the grain goddess Nisaba. In the second, and particularly in the first, millennium, the scribal arts were attributed to the god Nabû, divine scribe and patron of writing, whose symbol was a single wedge likely representing a writing stylus. Finally, we note the late account of Berossus, an early third-century bc priest of the god Marduk. The story of the creation of the world encountered in the first book of his Babyloniaca (Burstein 1978) includes the myth of Oannes. This part-fish, part-human creature emerged from the Erythrean Sea (likely here referring to the Persian Gulf), in the “first year,” and revealed to humanity all that was necessary for civilization, including the knowledge of writing, the sciences, and the arts. Giving his revelation during the day, Oannes would return once again to the sea at night. His teachings were comprehensive and perfect, for from that time “nothing further has been discovered.” cw

the proto-Elamite script ca. 3100 bc). Illicit excavations since the 1990s account for several hundred additional texts, which possibly originate from the ancient Babylonian cities of Umma, Adab, and Kish. These texts have the advantage of being generally in better condition than those from Uruk, which, as noted, represent discarded rubbish and thus are frequently fragmentary. To date, the proto-cuneiform corpus numbers approximately six thousand tablets and fragments. The Uruk IV tablets, representing the earliest phase of writing, typically bear only a few graphs and are simple in format. Further, many of the graphs represent naturalistic renderings of their referents,
that is, they are pictographs. While this earliest phase of cuneiform contains a few arbitrary symbols (see fig. 2.5 below; note that the graph for “sheep (and goats)” is symbolic and not pictographic), for those that do represent pictographs — the vast majority of the signs — the Uruk IV phase of writing exhibits a high degree of iconicity between graph and referent (e.g., Catalog No. 41). The curvilinear lines of these graphs were drawn — or, perhaps more accurately, approximated with multiple small strokes (Joachim Marzahn, personal communication) — with a pointed stylus. The Uruk III phase of the script, on the other hand, represents a significant development in the paleographic evolution of the script in several

respects. The curved lines of the Uruk IV phase were straightened, while the strokes that comprise the graphs were restricted to certain orientations and were created by a stylus with a triangular cross section (fig. 2.4). Additionally, the graphs were simplified and depicted more abstractly — for example, in the rendering of graphs consisting of animal heads, facial features, which were rendered naturalistically in the Uruk IV phase, were now omitted or depicted schematically (Green 1986, p. 465). These developments, which may have been made in the interests of efficiency as well as aesthetics, would continue well into the third millennium. As a consequence, those signs that shared a pictographic relationship with their referents gradually lost this iconic quality in the course of the evolution of the script, becoming conventionalized symbols — certainly contemporary users of the script would have regarded them as such, having no knowledge of the pictographic origins of certain graphs (fig. 2.5). With the loss of curvilinear lines, the script assumed its distinctive cuneiform appearance as graphs were pressed into clay in short wedge-like strokes. There are two further notable developments that distinguish proto-cuneiform from the mature phases of the script. The first concerns the number of graphs employed in the system. Whereas the archaic script contained roughly nine hundred graphs, about six hundred graphs sufficed for later cuneiform. The second concerns the direction of the script. At some point, likely in the third millennium, the graphs were rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise so that now they rested on their backs and the script was read from left to right rather than vertically (e.g., became , sag “head, person”). The reason for the change is obscure and much debated. However, it should be noted that developments of this kind are typologically quite common (Sampson 1985, p. 51). As noted above, the majority of the archaic text corpus — about 90 percent — is administrative in nature. That is, these are economic texts that figured into a complex bookkeeping system consisting primarily of receipts and expenditures of animals and a wide range of commodities and raw materials. The tablets identify the goods, their quantities, and the individuals and institutions involved in the transactions. These were the detailed records of the business

activities involving the Eana, the sacred precinct and central economic unit of Uruk. The archaic tablets displayed in the exhibit clearly demonstrate not only the types of administrative information contained in the archaic text corpus, but also the salient differences between Uruk IV (Catalog Nos. 41–46) and Uruk III (Catalog Nos. 47–55) phases of the script. The Uruk III tablets provide a glimpse into the economic life of Uruk at the close of the fourth millennium and include accounts involving livestock, slaves, grain, and other commodities (figs. 2.6–8; Catalog Nos. 53–55). Those graphs that were originally pictographs demonstrate a degree of abstraction, with straight lines, or wedges, having in many instances replaced the curvilinear lines of the Uruk IV script. Further, several of the longer texts represent the more complex accounts that distinguish this phase of the script from the proceeding one. Catalog No. 45 and particularly Catalog No. 44 typify the simple accounts that are diagnostic of the Uruk IV phase. But more revealing of the drawn, naturalistic quality of the Uruk IV graphs are the group of tags on display, particularly Catalog No. 41. These small pieces of clay were perforated to accommodate string so that they could be attached to baskets or vessels. The short inscriptions consist of the names of offices or officials; in some cases they possibly refer to beverages and dried fruits, commodities that would have been contained in the vessels to which the tags were attached (Englund 1998, p. 57).Interestingly, the earliest

The sign for “slaves” in fact derives from two distinct signs, one for male ( ) and one for female ( ) slave. Typical of proto-cuneiform texts, the inscription does not include a preposition or verb, which would clarify the roles of the participants. This ambiguity is, in part, resolved by tablet format and the organization of information into cases

writing from Egypt consists of similar perforated tags (see 5. The Conception and Development of the Egyptian Writing System, this volume). Like the Mesopotamian tags, the two hundred small bone and ivory tags discovered at Abydos bear short inscriptions, consisting apparently of personal names, place names, and the names of institutions. Numerical and metrological notations play a prominent role in the archaic text corpus. The numbers can be large and the numerical notation complex. Roughly sixty graphs are devoted to expressing numerals. These graphs were not incised with a pointed stylus, as was the case with the word graphs, but were impressed with a round stylus held either perpendicular or at an oblique angle to the writing surface (Nissen et al. 1993, p. 25). At least five different counting systems are attested for the archaic texts, including the sexagesimal (i.e., with units 1, 10, 60, 600, 3,600) and bisexagesimal (i.e., with units 1, 10, 60, 120, 1,200, 7,200) systems. Remarkably, the numerical system used depended on what was being
counted. For instance, all animals and humans, animal products, dried fish, fruits, tools, stones, and pots were quantified using the sexagesimal system, while all grain products, cheeses, and, seemingly, fresh fish, were quantified using the bisexagesimal system (Englund, 1998, p. 120). The sexagesimal system survived the archaic period and the Sumerians and was used by the Babylonians down to the end of cuneiform civilization at the turn of the current era. Indeed, our division of the circle into 360 degrees, the hour into 60 minutes, and the minute into 60 seconds goes back, ultimately, to the Sumerians and their sexagesimal numerical system, having come to us through the Babylonians and the Greeks (fig. 2.9). The roughly 10 percent of the archaic text corpus that is not concerned with administrative matters are critically important for understanding early Mesopotamian intellectual life and the means by which the new technology of writing was passed from one generation to the next. These texts, referred to as lexical lists, represent one of the most distinctive and

prevailing signatures of Mesopotamian civilization. Essentially long lists of thematically organized words — ancient dictionaries, of a sort — lexical lists constituted the native lexicographical tradition. These texts were the primary paradigm for the scholarly organization and presentation of information, and served, moreover, as a means for teaching professional vocabulary and the intricacies of cuneiform writing. Copying a complex text of this kind would certainly have been assigned to a more advanced scribal student. A more elementary exercise is represented
by VAT 16741 (fig. 2.10), in which a student has practiced inscribing various signs. This crudely formed lump of clay anticipates the elementary school exercises known from later periods, which were typically inscribed on round, bun-shaped tablets (Catalog No. 47). Lexical lists were copied and recopied by scribal students down to the end of cuneiform culture.

of Uruk officials and occupations (Englund 1998, pp. 103–06); other lexical texts from the archaic period include lists of plants, animals, wooden implements, jars, and cities. The Standard Professions List contains some 140 entries and begins with the title namešda, which a later, second-millennium text equates with Akkadian šarru “king.” In the archaic period, namešda may have simply represented the highest-ranking official in the Uruk administration (Englund 1998, p. 103). The titles of several high officials included in the Standard Professions List also appear as recipients of disbursements in Catalog No. 52, an Uruk III administrative text, demonstrating that titles included in the lexical list had a real-world basis. The Standard Professions List is thus crucially important for reconstructing Uruk society at the end of the fourth millennium. Remarkably this list was copied with little change throughout the third millennium, a span of nearly a thousand years — an astonishing fact indeed. From the succeeding Uruk III phase alone we have some 185 tablets and fragments (Englund 1998, p. 103), while the first complete exemplars — the archaic lexical lists typically represent extracts of longer texts — stem from the mid-third millennium (ca. 2600 bc), from the site of Fara (fig. 2.11). Naturally, the existence of word-for- word duplicates from later periods, in which the script and the language are more comprehensible, facilitates enormously the decipherment of the archaic script. It is important to point out that faithful adherence to tradition with regard to the repeated copying of what was already an ancient text by the third millennium meant that scribes were reproducing sign forms and vocabulary, like the aforementioned namešda, that had become obsolete long before. Conversely,
the titles of professions from the contemporaneous language necessarily could not be incorporated. This suggests that the lexical lists had a value beyond their use as simply lexicographic and instructional tools (Civil 1969, p. 4). Likely, their prestige stems in part from their cultural value as symbols of the scribal profession, the tradition of their scrupulous transmission from one generation to the next being intimately bound up with scribal identity.

the writing system and its relationship to speech
At the root of the cuneiform writing system, as originally conceived, is the logogram, or word sign, which represents a single word or group of semantically related words (see fig. 2.5). Assigning semantically related words to a common graph was done in the interest of economy, as it limited the number of signs the writing system required and facilitated the learning of the script. For instance, the sign du, originally a pictograph of a foot, , expressed the verbs gen “to go,” gub “to stand,” and de6 “to carry,” all of which share a transparent semantic relationship. Taken in isolation, one would be tempted to describe du, and similar signs, as ideograms — signs that represent ideas or concepts — but in actuality all cuneiform signs represented specific words in a given context, and so functioned as logograms. As Sumerian words tend to consist of (but are not exclusively) single syllables, logograms had both a semantic meaning, as representing words, as well as a phonetic value, expressing the syllabic pronunciations of those words. For example, the logogram represented by the graph ku6 (the subscripted number is a modern convention for distinguishing homophonous signs), , has the meaning “fish” as well as the syllabic value ku, which is the pronunciation of the word for “fish” in Sumerian. As described above, many of these logograms had a clear pictographic relationship to their referents; other examples include the picture of a reed, (gi4), for the Sumerian word for “reed,” that is, gi, or the graph for “mountain,” (kur), for the word for “mountain,” kur. A much smaller group of logograms, however, had an arbitrary relationship to their referents, such as the sign for “sheep and goats” which consisted of a cross inscribed within a circle, (e.g., Catalog No. 28). Through the use of the rebus principle, whereby a sign for one word could be used to express a homonym, a second class of signs arose — phonograms — which possessed sound but not meaning. That is, the phonetic value associated with one word, most often something with a ready iconic representation, could be used to write another word that was identical or nearly so in pronunciation. The rebus principle is integral to writing, as it allows for the representation of those elements of language that are not easily
represented graphically, for instance, grammatical affixes, prepositions, and — of considerable importance to the historical development of cuneiform — the phonetic rendering of personal names and foreign words. The high frequency of monosyllabic words and homonyms in Sumerian clearly facilitated this development. For instance, in later cuneiform the sign for sar “garden” (originally a pictograph of a garden bed, ) could be used to write the homophonous but more abstract verb sar “to write”; similarly, the sign originally representing “water,” , a in Sumerian, was used for the syllable a, which among other things was the phonetic shape of the locative case in Sumerian. Finally, there is a third, smaller set of signs that are referred to as determinatives. These signs were not read, but merely served as aides in reading by indicating the semantic class to which certain words belonged; trees and wooden objects, for instance, were often preceded by the logogram, giš, for “wood,” cities by uru “city,” gods by dingir “god,” and so on. In its original conception, however, Sumerian writing relied almost exclusively on the logogram. Phonetic writings generated via the rebus principle played a remarkably minor role in proto-cuneiform. More certain examples of phonetic writings include: the writing of the name of the moon god, Nanna, which is written uri3+na, , where na, , is phonetic complement with the value na indicating that the graph uri3, , is to be pronounced nanna; pirig+nunuz, , where the complement nunuz, , has the value za, indicating that the composite graph has the phonetic value az(a); the aforementioned sign designating a reed, (gi4), pronounced gi, is used to express the homophonous verb gi “to return”; and the syllabic, that is phonetic, spellings of the city names Ša3-bu and Gir2-su (Englund 2009, pp. 9–10; Krebernik 2007, p. 43). Relatively rare attestations of this kind notwithstanding, phonetic writings do not constitute an important organizing feature of the proto-cuneiform writing system. Only in the first quarter of the third millennium did phonograms, generated via the rebus principle, begin to play a significant and increasing role. The scarcity of phonetic writings creates a number of problems connected with identifying the language of the script and determining whether proto-cuneiform can be defined as “true” writing.

Visible language
As described in Visible Language: The Earliest Writing Systems (Introduction, this volume), writing is typically defined as the unambiguous visible representation of speech — forms of communication that convey ideas directly and are unhinged from spoken utterances do not qualify as writing according to this definition. A purely logographic system, without any phonetic signs (no such writing system actually exists) would pose certain problems in terms of determining the underlying language. For instance, we may intuitively know that the pictograph means “head,” but taken in isolation the graph gives us no indication of its pronunciation and hence what language it represents. We would have to consider how grammatical elements are rendered and how syntax, that is, word order, is handled to make this determination. If this information is not indicated in the script, it would be theoretically impossible to determine the underlying language, for the division between writing and other forms of visual representation would be blurred in the absence of an explicit link between script and speech. This difficult situation is essentially what we face with the proto-cuneiform script. More than any other writing system known, Sumerian writing, in its original conception particularly, held economy as its topmost priority. There was a considerable gap between the natural, spoken language and what is represented by the early Uruk script. Most of the morphological information of speech, such as pronouns, adverbial markers, and other elements that convey grammatical meaning, is simply not recorded. The script, in this sense, is quite incomplete (fig. 2.12).
In Sumer, writing, as we have seen, was invented for a very restricted application, namely, for bookkeeping purposes. Much of the omitted grammatical information was either unimportant to the purpose at hand or was predictable from context, rendering its inclusion redundant. The proto-cuneiform texts were in a sense mnemonic devices — the decoder or reader of these texts had to rely heavily on the broader context in order to recover their full messages. As this context is forever lost, these documents pose enormous problems of decipherment and interpretation for the modern scholar. This was a writing system that was modeled on speech but did not mimic speech. Consequently, it is more appropriate to speak of “interpreting” texts rather than of “reading” them. Indeed, the breach between writing and speech extends to syntax. The order of graphs is fluid in early texts and words were not written in the order in which they were spoken. Tablet format, to a limited degree, compensated for this, as the organization of text into boxes, or cases (e.g., see figs. 2.6–8), played an important role in organizing information. Not until the second half of the third millennium did the sequence of graphs within individual cases reflect the sequential order of speech. In sum, the evidence that the language represented by the proto-cuneiform script is, in fact, Sumerian is quite slim, being based on perhaps fifteen instances of phonetic writings, of varying degrees of certitude that have been discovered to date. However, the circumstantial evidence provided by the cultural continuity between the late fourth and the midthird millennium, at which time there is no doubt the language represented is Sumerian, bolsters this

argument. Most scholars today assume that Sumerian underlies the earliest texts from Mesopotamia. As for proto-cuneiform script representing writing in the sense defined above, we must accept that there is no sharp division between what we know to be true phonological writing and more symbolic modes of communication — pristine writing systems, in general, appear to occupy the ambiguous gray area between the two. Phonetic writings were present at the beginning, or so it appears, but they were of little importance to the organization and structure of the proto-cuneiform system. Indeed, the proliferation of phonetic writings, in terms of the development of a syllabary, was not precipitated by a desire to better express Sumerian, but rather by the necessity to write foreign words and the adaptation of the script to write the Akkadian language. That Sumerian writing became more closely bound to speech was a secondary consequence of these developments. Sumerian writing became more explicit in its expression of morphology, so that by the end of the third millennium the grammatical elements of speech were, for the most part, reflected in writing. Yet economy of expression always remained a basic feature of Sumerian writing and it was always possible to omit information that was deemed to be retrievable from the broader context. A striking example of this is the existence of what may be referred to as “morphograms,” an extension of the logography that was the basis of the writing system (Woods 2010). Morphograms are signs that represent a conceptually basic or default form of a morpheme, the smallest unit of meaning in a language. An example of a morphogram in English would be the writing of the plural marker in the words cats and dogs. The plural in both cases is written -s, even though in the case of dogs the plural is pronounced z. In other words, English orthography ignores the fact that the plural has the pronunciation z following a voiced consonant. English speakers unconsciously apply the same rules they use in generating speech and “read” the -s in dogs as a z (for a discussion of this phenomenon more generally and the English past-tense suffix -ed, see Visible Language: The Earliest Writing Systems, Introduction, this volume). In Sumerian writing this phenomenon is much more pervasive. A scribe could exploit the logographic, or more accurately morphographic, basis of Sumerian writing and write a basic
or primary form of a morpheme regardless of the allomorphic shape — that is, the pronunciation — dictated by the context. The burden of supplying the appropriate “surface” or phonetic form of the morpheme was left to readers, who did so by relying on their native competence with the language. One had to know the language in order to render what was written into intelligible speech. For example, the verbal form pronounced hanašumu “he should give (it) to him” could be written he-na-šum2-e (in addition to the more phonetic ha-na-šum2-mu), a writing that preserves the basic or underlying form of the individual morphemes contained in the verb but obscures the phonetic changes owing to the assimilations that take place in speech. In the interests of economy, phonetic variation could be omitted in the writing where it was predictable from the context. While writings that more faithfully represent pronunciation increasingly dominate over time, it was always possible for a scribe to employ the morphograms that were the basic building blocks of the early script. One potential advantage in doing so was that fewer signs needed to be memorized and used, so that messages could be written more succinctly. But the overriding interest appears to be in the continuity of tradition and the prestige associated with the old orthography.
precursors to writing
Mesopotamia boasts not only what may be the earliest writing system invented, but also some of the clearest evidence for the non-linguistic communicative systems that were precursors to writing. The first writing, which we may define as the unambiguous representation of speech, borrowed symbols from pre-existing administrative devices and artistic traditions, added many new elements, and codified and integrated the whole into a system that was fundamentally different from the communicative systems that preceded it (Michalowski 1994, p. 54; idem 1996, pp. 35–36). The invention of writing represented a more comprehensive solution to a number of administrative and bookkeeping problems posed by an increasingly complex bureaucracy, problems that were addressed individually, and only in part, by earlier devices (Nissen 1986, pp. 323–26). These earlier,
oi.uchicago.edu



46
Visible language
prehistoric administrative devices, which were likewise products of the Late Uruk period, include cylinder seals, numerical tablets, and clay counters and their accompanying “envelopes” (see 1. Iconography of Protoliterate Seals, this volume). As writing would more effectively do, each served as a means to control and monitor the flow of materials, commodities, and labor. The hollow, baseball-sized clay balls referred to as envelopes and their associated counters, or “tokens” (Catalog Nos. 20–28 and 32–36), have received the most attention, having been made famous by Denise Schmandt-Besserat and her theory of the origins of writing (1992). These artifacts have been excavated in Iran, Syria, and Mesopotamia and make their first appearance in the archaeological record shortly before the Uruk IV tablets. The clay envelopes bear the impressions of one to three seals, but most importantly they contain clay tokens (Catalog Nos. 32–33 and 35–36); some envelopes, in fact, bear marks that indicate that the tokens were impressed upon their outer surface before being sealed within. The idea that these envelopes represented precursors to writing was first suggested by the French archaeologist Pierre Amiet in the 1960s. Studying a group of envelopes found at Susa in southwest Iran, Amiet (1966) observed that in some cases — the emphasis being on some — the markings on the envelopes matched those on the enclosed tokens. It was Amiet’s idea that the tokens were numerical counters, and that each envelope was the record of a transaction — a type of primitive accounting system in which it was necessary to impress the tokens onto the outer surface of the envelope so that it would not have to be broken to inspect its contents. The very act of impressing tokens onto envelopes to represent numbers could have led to the creation of writing. Amiet’s understanding of the function of the envelopes was seemingly corroborated by a much later, second-millennium artifact found at Nuzi. This object, the so-called egg-shaped tablet (fig. 2.13), was first discussed in 1959 by A. Leo Oppenheim of the Oriental Institute. This object is a type of envelope, but, again, much later in date than those discussed by Amiet. At the time of discovery, it contained forty-nine small pebbles. What is remarkable about this object, and what distinguishes it from the archaic envelopes, is that
figure 2.13. The “egg-shaped tablet” from Nuzi (SMN 1854 = HSS 16:499)
it bears an inscription written in Akkadian. The inscription on the envelope makes reference to fortynine sheep, and so matches the number of pebbles enclosed, identifying the pebbles as “the stones of the sheep” (Abusch 1981, pp. 3, 6). A receipt tablet, which clearly concerns the same transaction, was found together with the envelope, and also makes mention of the forty-nine sheep. The tablet provides the additional information that the sheep in question were placed in the care of a shepherd, Ziqarru, by a sheep owner, Puhišenni. So there can be no question that this particular envelope represents a simple accounting device for a specific transaction. And, although it postdates the protoliterate envelopes by some two thousand years, it seems reasonable to suggest that those earlier artifacts served a similar function (Lieberman 1980, pp. 340, 352). As to why such a primitive device would remain in use at Nuzi, where writing was well known, and why this transaction would be recorded in two different media, it might be suggested that the exchange of sheep involved an illiterate shepherd (Abusch 1981, pp. 7–8; compare Oppenheim 1959, pp. 123–24). Because the shepherd could not verify the accuracy of the written document, it was necessary to draft a second parallel receipt that would be comprehensible to him, this one consisting of the pebbles within the sealed envelope (Steinkeller 1984, p. 6). Returning to our fourth-millennium envelopes, Amiet stopped short of equating specific tokenshapes with specific cuneiform signs. This is the critical point at which Schmandt-Besserat’s theory of the origins of writing departs from that of Amiet.

In Schmandt-Besserat’s view, both the numerical and logographic signs of cuneiform evolved directly out of the earlier token system. This theory is based on the visual similarities between the elements of the token and writing systems (fig. 2.15). According to Schmandt-Besserat, the simple, undecorated tokens, which first make their appearance with the beginnings of agriculture in the ninth millennium, developed into the numerical graphs (Catalog Nos. 20–21). The so-called complex tokens, those that have various markings and incisions and are regarded as a hallmark of the burgeoning urban societies of the fourth millennium, became the logograms of cuneiform (Catalog Nos. 22–28). They represented, she argues, the new commodities and bureaucratic needs of the complex societies that were emerging at the end of the fourth millennium. In Uruk and Susa, early
figure 2.14. The development of cuneiform, after Schmandt-Besserat (1992)
bureaucrats organized them by threading them on strings and, of course, sealing them within clay envelopes after impressing them on the surface. From this point it is supposedly a simple and logical step to the development of writing. Early accountants soon realized that the process of enclosing tokens within envelopes was entirely unnecessary, since their twodimensional impressions on the surface conveyed the same information with far less effort. So the envelopes were replaced by tablets. The cones and spheres of the complex token system were now translated to two-dimensional pictographs and were drawn with a stylus on clay tablets. By comparing the geometric shapes and designs of the tokens with those of the early cuneiform signs, Schmandt-Besserat assigned meanings to fifty complex tokens.

Although there is an elegant simplicity to much of this argument, and Schmandt-Besserat is certainly to be praised for reigniting the debate over the origins of writing, the theory is problematic. It is difficult to accept, for instance, that tokens found over such a vast time period and over such a vast geographical range — from the Mediterranean to Iran, from the ninth to the end of the fourth millennium bc — comprised a uniform accounting system, as Schmandt-Besserat argues. For many of the objects, the archeological context is vague if not completely unknown. Notably, most of the tokens that are claimed to be the evolutionary precursors to cuneiform signs are not even found in connection with envelopes. However, it should be pointed out that perhaps only five envelopes have been opened, as doing so would necessarily destroy these artifacts; eighty of the some 130 excavated clay envelopes remain intact (Englund 1998, p. 49; Schmandt-Besserat 1992, p. 117). But recent technological advances in CT scanning and three-dimensional imaging now allow us to inspect the contents of sealed envelopes with a level of detail impossible just a few years ago. Currently, the Oriental Institute is working jointly with the University of Chicago Hospitals to scan the fifteen envelopes in the Oriental Institute’s collections that
were excavated from Chogha Mish in southwest Iran.
The results promise to significantly enhance our figure 2.16. Three-dimensional CT scan of the contents

understanding of the nature of the transactions or agreements represented by the tokens and clay envelopes (fig. 2.16). The lynchpin of Schmandt-Besserat’s theory that tokens look like cuneiform signs — is, of course, subjective, and many of her identifications linking complex tokens to cuneiform signs are simply not plausible. Moreover, the assumption that a symbol present in two distinct systems — in this case the tokens of a prehistoric accounting system and proto-cuneiform — must necessarily have the same value is a well-known methodological pitfall in decipherment efforts, for it is entirely possible that the shared symbol has different values, or meanings, in the respective systems. Also damning in this regard is that the distribution of tokens, if we accept Schmandt-Besserat’s identifications, is at odds with our understanding of early Mesopotamian economy and society. As the archaeologist Paul Zimansky has

pointed out, the alleged sheep token, perhaps her most compelling piece of evidence on visual grounds, occurs only fifteen times over seven thousand years (Zimansky 1993, p. 516). This is indeed troubling, given all we know about the importance of livestock in the ancient Middle East. Conversely, the most common tokens are those that supposedly signify “nails” and “work days,” prompting Zimansky to ask, “is it really credible that early villagers would leave more evidence of keeping accounts of nails than of livestock?” (Zimansky 1993, p. 516). At this point, all we can say with any degree of certainty — as Amiet pointed out over forty years ago — is that there is a relationship between the impressions on the envelopes and the numerical graphs of the cuneiform system and that these two systems, and only these two, appear to be related. Indeed, the existence of numerical tablets (see Catalog Nos. 29–31) — stemming from the period immediately preceding the invention of writing with numerals but without graphs representing words — bridges the gap between the accounting systems represented by the tokens and the numeral graphs of proto-cuneiform, as numeral signs appear to have been made, in some instances, by impressing the tokens into the wet clay. In a final development before the inception of protocuneiform proper, these simple numerical accounts were supplemented with graphs (one or two at most) representing the commodities concerned (Englund 1998, pp. 52–56). As for the origins of the word signs, or logograms, of proto-cuneiform, most of these were no doubt invented with the writing system itself. Others, however, were borrowed from various pre-existing communicative devices that were decidedly not writing (Michalowski 1990, p. 59; idem 1994, p. 54; idem 1996, pp. 35–36). The symbol that would become the graph for “sheep and goats,” , for instance, obviously belonged originally to the accounting system represented by the complex tokens. When the script was invented, this symbol was borrowed from the older accounting system and assigned the meaning “sheep (and goats).” The graphic symbol was borrowed — people used and re-used the shapes known to them — but in all likelihood, based on its distribution in the token system, the meaning, or perhaps better, meanings, it had in that earlier system was not (Zimansky 1993, pp. 516–17). An example of this
figure 2.18. Composite sign gu7 “disbursement” consisting of the graph for “head,” sag , and the graph for “rationing vessel,” ninda , likely the depiction of a beveled-rim bowl of the Uruk period
type of adoption from the material culture is the ubiquitous beveled-rim bowl, a diagnostic feature of the Late Uruk period (fig. 2.17). These crude, moldmade bowls were mass produced, and were likely used to disperse standardized rations to workers. The distinctive shape of the bowl was incorporated into the writing system to represent “a ration of food”; when combined with the graph sag “head,” the composite graph gu7 denoted “disbursement” as well as the verb “to eat” (fig. 2.18) In other cases, the inventors of the script borrowed long-established pictographic and iconographic elements from the visual arts of the protoliterate period. In particular, a number of standards and emblems connected with deities and their cult centers, which possessed powerful symbolic value, were drafted into the script (Szarzyńska 1989, 1996)

Visible language
(fig. 2.19). The exhibit includes an illustrative example in a fired clay symbol of Inana, the patron goddess of Uruk (Catalog No. 39). The object was found at Uruk in 1929 by the German Archaeological Institute and served as part of a wall frieze in the Eana complex. Often described as a reed bundle, this volutelike symbol may have represented a stylized scarf or headband (Steinkeller 1998, p. 95). Interestingly, the impressed circular designs on the staff mimic the clay-cone mosaics that decorated building facades, a characteristic feature of the architecture of the Eana precinct. This cultic symbol was borrowed and integrated into the writing system as the graph representing the name of the goddess, . As a cultic symbol it may not have survived the fourth millennium, but as a cuneiform graph it persevered down to the end of cuneiform civilization (Steinkeller 1998, pp. 87–88). In the protoliterate period the boundary that would later separate writing from artistic, symbolic representations was quite porous, and the two systems mixed more freely than they would in later periods. A unique Uruk-period seal demonstrates the point (Glassner 2003, pp. 175–76; Nissen, Damerow, and Englund 1993, pp. 17–18) (fig. 2.20). The image includes the symbol of the goddess Inana discussed above, and, to the left, a star representing the divine determinative, the pictograph UD — the sun rising between two mountains — and the mirror image of the latter, SIG, designating the setting sun. Also included, to the right of the Inana symbol, is the sign ezen “festival” (the pictograph depicts a drum). The
group together can be “read” as “the festival of the rising and setting star,” that is, the planet Venus, a manifestation of the goddess Inana. It should be emphasized that while some graphs can be demonstrated to have roots in other, earlier symbolic systems, the vast majority of the pictographs likely came into being with writing itself. And here we must be careful to distinguish between the history of the individual graphs and the writing system as a whole (Michalowski 1994, p. 55). When writing was invented it represented a completely new mode of communication, quite different from anything that preceded it and quite different from any of the systems in which individual graphs may have originated. The present evidence leads us to believe that although it would evolve and undergo enormous changes in the course of its history, writing, as a system, came into existence suddenly as an integrated whole (Michalowski 1996, pp. 35–36). For the restricted applications for which it was invented, as a bookkeeping device, it no doubt served its users well. While the potential to do so was there from the outset, accurately tracking speech was beyond this initial purpose, and the bond between the incipient script and the spoken word was tenuous. In this sense, at least, the earliest writing from Mesopotamia had more in common with the administrative devices it replaced than with the flexible visual representation of speech that it would become.

rom their earliest appearance in the late seventh millennium bc, stamp seals were used to mark property through their impressions into clay that sealed doors, jars, or other packages. Stamp seals continued in use into the Late Uruk period
(3350–3100 bc), when they were largely replaced by cylinder seals, perhaps because more varied and complex scenes could be carved into their surface, and perhaps because being rolled, they could cover a larger area of sealing clay. ge

This object represents a stylized bundle of reeds that is rolled into a volute at the top. It is a symbol of the goddess Inana and was also the basis for the cuneiform writing of her name. It was found in 1929 along with four other fragments of clay inlays (similar pieces and a fragment of a bull figure) that served as parts of a wall frieze at a building in the southern part of Eana, the temple complex of Inana. The form of the Inana symbol is derived from bundles that originally served as entry posts to reed huts, a common type of dwelling in the marshlands of southern Iraq. The drawing of the bundle had been partly done with a simple writing stylus. The
circular impressions represent contemporary mosaics of clay cones found at other buildings at the same site. jm, translated by rw

he earliest Mesopotamian texts, conventionally dated to about 3200 bc, belong to the Uruk IV phase. They are simple in format, most consisting of only a few signs, and the signs are more pictographic, or representational, than later signs.

Among the earliest written tablets were small, rectangular tablets, or tags, that could be attached to goods by means of a hole running lengthwise through the tag. Unlike most tablets, tags are inscribed on one side only. Tags may have served to record deliveries.

This tablet is the oldest-known version of a list of titles and occupations, known as the Standard Professions List. Such lists, known as “lexical lists,” were used to train scribes and also served to organize knowledge. This scribal exercise from the early Uruk IV writing stage represents what was apparently a favorite version of such compilations. Its content was copied many times in the subsequent Uruk III period (about 180 fragments of it are preserved), and it was the model for numerous modified and expanded forms of such lists. The

Archaische Texte aus Uruk (Archaic Texts from Uruk). Although initially assigned a provenance of Jemdet Nasr, these tablets can now be assigned with some degree of certainty to Uqair (in northern Sumer, not far from Jemdet Nasr) owing to similarities of certain sign combinations. This text deals with transactions regarding sheep and is an example of the more complex documents from the later Uruk III writing stage. jm, translated by rw

This small administrative tablet, a receipt for one dead lamb, dates to the height of the Third Dynasty of Ur (conventionally labeled the Ur III period, ca. 2100–2000 bc), specifically, the 46th regnal year of Shulgi, the second king of the Ur III dynasty. Shulgi is considered the architect of the short-lived Ur III empire, which is known for its highly centralized, state-run economy and its unparalleled documentation. An estimated 100,000 administrative texts survive from this brief period of Mesopotamian history, making it perhaps the most documented era prior to the invention of the printing press. This particular text originates from Puzrish-Dagan (modern Drehem), the central government’s main redistribution center for livestock, which was founded by Shulgi. cw

3. AdAptAtion of Cuneiform to Write AkkAdiAn
T
he Sumerian literary text Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta recounts that the legendary king Enmerkar of Uruk invented writing for the purpose of recording a very long letter addressed to his rival dwelling in the distant land of Aratta. When the Lord of Aratta received the first missive ever inscribed on a clay tablet he exclaimed with surprise and disbelief “It is wedges!” as he saw pegs instead of words (Vanstiphout 1989). By inventing writing, Enmerkar not only showed intellectual superiority over his contender, but he also implicitly instituted cuneiform as a Mesopotamian creation that outsiders would need to learn and adopt. The narrative expresses the way certain scribe(s) imagined the invention of a system of wedge-shaped signs to convey a message in a graphic, non-oral manner. The Lord of Aratta’s prompt identification of those markings on a piece of dried clay with wedges or nails (Sumerian g a g ) correlates with the Akkadian words sikkatu “peg, nail,” miḫiṣtu “stroke, cuneiform wedge” (Sumerian g u - š u m2 ), and santakku “triangle, wedge” (Sumerian s a n t a k ), and with the expression tikip santakki “cuneiform sign.” Likewise, in modern times, scholars have dubbed the writing system “cuneiform,” similarly alluding to the shape of the characters (Latin cuneus “wedge,” plus forma “form”).
The story Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta offers an intriguing blend of fiction and reality in a text coming from the beginning of the second millennium bc. The motif of envoys going back and forth between Uruk and Aratta with messages involving difficult tasks and riddles that the kings had to solve is undoubtedly charming for a mythological piece, but the connection between the invention of writing and the creation of an epistolary clay tablet to record oral communication failed scholarly scrutiny. Writing systems were not initially conceived to reproduce speech (Michalowski 1998, p. 43; Cooper 1999, p. 72),

and, judging from the available evidence, letters are a comparatively late development that first appeared around 2400 bc (Cooper 2004, p. 84). Similarly, the earliest signs used for writing, that is, proto-cuneiform (ca. 3200 bc), did not look like wedges, but they were rather realistic and, occasionally, symbolic representations of words (Gelb 1952, p. 62). It was only after the archaic period (Uruk IV–III/Jemdet Nasr; see table 3.1) that cuneiform signs acquired an abstract appearance that disguised any traces of their pictographic forerunners. The earliest signs were pictographic in the sense that they represented physical objects, but they were subsequently simplified. In the final step of this development, during the NeoAssyrian period (ca. 1000–600 bc), each sign has a specific number of wedges and every wedge is important, but in previous periods the number of wedges per sign can vary and only the general form of the character was significant (Civil 1992). Although an aetiological myth, Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta also contains information that agrees with archaeological and philological discoveries. For instance, the oldest tablets currently available were indeed found in Enmerkar’s capital, the city of Uruk (biblical Erech, modern Warka) in southern Mesopotamia (see Nissen, Damerow, and Englund 1993). A ruler by the name of Enmerkar is mentioned in a later text, the Sumerian King List (ca. 2100/2000 bc), as the second monarch of the dynasty of Uruk after the Flood, succeeding his father Mes-kiag-gašer. Most modern historians date Enmerkar’s rule to the Early Dynastic II period (ca. 2700 bc), that is, several hundred years after the invention of writing (e.g., Nissen 1966); whereas it has also been suggested that the title “Lord of Aratta” might be attested in the colophon of an Uruk tablet from the archaic period (Green 1980, p. 17). Of course references to Enmerkar and to the title Lord of Aratta do not directly prove

the identification of this name and title with the characters of the Sumerian literary composition, but they do place them within the framework of Mesopotamian tradition. On a safer note, as undisputable as the existence of archaic Uruk tablets is the adoption of cuneiform writing by polities outside Uruk, as implied in our myth. Indeed, after its invention by Sumerian speakers, cuneiform script was employed during a period of about 3,300 years (from ca. 3200 bc to ca. ad 100) to write a variety of languages such as Sumerian, Akkadian, Eblaite, Elamite, Old Persian, Hurrian, Hittite, Palaic, Luvian, Urartian, and Ugaritic (e.g., Civil 1992; Michalowski 1996; Gragg 1996) in a vast geographical area including modern Iraq, Iran, Turkey, the Levant, and even Egypt. Scholarly efforts to understand the way in which cuneiform was adapted to write Akkadian are still ongoing and they are subject to and at the same time limited by philological and archaeological discoveries. In the following section I discuss some of these issues.
intellectual and historical background for the adoption of cuneiform writing
The adoption of cuneiform to write Akkadian as well as other Semitic languages is still poorly understood. This is the case in part because for such a reconstruction scholars depend on the chance of discovery, on the archaeological sites that have been excavated, and on philological progress. For several decades after the official decipherment of cuneiform in 1857, the way in which cuneiform was employed to write Akkadian seemed to have been relatively transparent. During that time, Assyriologists reconstructed the following scenario: Sumerian, a linguistic isolate, was the written language of Mesopotamia until King Sargon (ca. 2334–2279 bc) established his capital in the city of Akkad and built an unprecedented empire. In this newly created regime, official documents were now mostly written in a Semitic language known today as Old Akkadian, named after Sargon’s capital, and for Old Akkadian (ca. 2350–2110 bc) scribes used the same cuneiform script as Sumerian. After the decline and fall of the Sargonic empire, a new order appeared under the kings of the Third Dynasty of Ur
(ca. 2100–2003 bc), and Sumerian became once again the language of the administration. After this socalled “Neo-Sumerian” period, Akkadian once again became the official language, and Sumerian was relegated to literary texts and to other genres of the scholarly tradition. According to this theory, it was then assumed that cuneiform was originally adopted and adapted from Sumerian for Old Akkadian. As is usually the case, however, things turned out to be more complicated than originally thought. Three factors contributed significantly to the challenging of previous explanations and to our current understanding of the process of adaptation, namely, the chronological placement of early tablets, the identification of Semitic names in texts written in Sumerian, and the discovery of tablets outside Babylonia dating to the Early Dynastic period (ca. 2500/2400 bc). It was Adam Falkenstein (1936) who, based on the documents from southern Mesopotamia available in the 1930s, first proposed a chronological arrangement of those tablets which is still considered generally valid. According to his classification, the most ancient group consists of tablets dating to the fourth stratigraphic level of Uruk (Uruk IV). They are followed by texts with similar ductus from Jemdet Nasr and Uruk III. After a chronological hiatus follow the archaic tablets from Ur, and after a second hiatus come those from Fara (ancient Shuruppak), which are slightly older than those from Tello (ancient Lagash). To this sequence one can now add tablets found at Tell Uqair, Tell Asmar, and Khafajeh (see Nissen 1998, p. 22), as well as archaic and pre-Sargonic tablets found at Mari (e.g., Charpin 1987 and 1998; Bonechi and Durand 1992), and those from Kish, Adab, and Abu Salabikh, among others. Once tablets were properly classified, a major turning point toward the understanding of the adoption of cuneiform to write Semitic languages occurred when Robert Biggs (1967) demonstrated that Early Dynastic tablets from Abu Salabikh contain numerous Semitic personal names. This realization was most important because those personal names represent the first attestation of Semitic words written with cuneiform signs. After those two major achievements, two archaeological discoveries in Syria again changed the picture: the archives of Ebla (modern Tell Mardikh) and Nabada (modern Tell Beydar). So impressive was the discovery of Ebla, that one scholar
oi.uchicago.edu

3. AdAptAtion of Cuneiform to Write AkkAdiAn
declared it to be the great surprise of ancient Middle Eastern history (Edzard 1994). Although excavations at Ebla began in 1964, tablets and fragments from the third millennium (ca. 2400–2350 bc) first appeared in 1975–1976. This discovery allowed the identification of Eblaite as an East Semitic language which, like Akkadian, also used cuneiform writing. The new evidence furthered studies on the adoption of cuneiform and on the connections between literary and lexical traditions from Babylonia (e.g., Civil 1984; Milano 1998; Archi 1992; Pettinato 2003). Similar undertakings were also possible thanks to the discovery of the cuneiform texts from Nabada in 1993 (Ismail et al. 1996), considered to be the first pre-Sargonic documents (ca. 2400 bc) from the Syrian Djezirah (see
Sallaberger 1998). One important conclusion drawn from these studies is that Akkadian and other Semitic languages were already written in cuneiform before the Sargonic period and before the adoption of a predominantly syllabic writing. The attestation of Semitic names in Early Dynastic tablets and the discovery of tablets from sites in northern Babylonia and in Syria led to the question whether those records were written in Sumerian, Akkadian, or some other language. Clues that could establish the language in which a text was written include: provenance (because a document from the south was more likely to be in Sumerian, whereas a text from the north or from Syria was more likely to be Akkadian), the presence of Akkadian

morphemes such as the preposition in and certain suffixes (e.g., -šu, -ka, etc.), or the employ of logograms and syllables exclusively used in Akkadian or Semitic texts. Miguel Civil (1984, pp. 75–76), however, has argued that this approach was far too simplistic, especially when a text is mostly written in logograms, or word signs. Based on a comparison with the adaptation of the Chinese script to Japanese literature, Civil concluded that in the case of ancient Mesopotamia, an Akkadian or Semitic speaker could have handled Sumerian in four different ways: 1) reading Sumerian as Sumerian, 2) reading Sumerian as Akkadian, 3) writing Sumerian as Sumerian, and 4) writing Akkadian as Sumerian. A few years later, Piotr Michalowski (1998, p. 45) argued similarly when he stated that there are pre-Sargonic texts written in Akkadian even if they are written mainly with Sumerian characters used as word signs or logograms. According to him, in theory a cuneiform text could be: 1) written and read in Sumerian, 2) written and read in Akkadian, 3) written in Sumerian and read in Akkadian, and 4) written in Akkadian and read in Sumerian.
cuneiform writing, sumerian, akkadian, and the adaptation of cuneiform to write akkadian
A brief description of cuneiform writing and of the Sumerian and Akkadian languages is necessary in order to discuss how cuneiform worked for Sumerian and how it was adapted to write Akkadian.
a) Cuneiform Writing
The cuneiform writing system invented around 3200 bc underwent multiple changes throughout the approximately 3,300 years in which it was used. In archaic tablets, for example, signs did not necessarily appear in the order they were intended to be read. At that stage, writing was something of a mnemonic device in which readers were supposed to supply those elements of the language that were not written down, or were redundant. In the later periods, cuneiform signs consist of simple wedges or of the combination of five basic wedges: . Modern sign lists (e.g., Labat 1995; Borger 2004) arrange
individual signs following the shape and orientation of those five wedges in the sequence shown above. Impressions of signs were made with a reed stylus on wet clay, and they were also inscribed on other media such as stone, waxed wooden boards, and metal. Although the earliest script is essentially logographic (i.e., a sign represents a word), certain Uruk IV–III signs can already be employed syllabically as phonetic indicators (Krispijn 1991–92; Krebernik 1994; Steinkeller 1995) for the reading of certain signs. This phenomenon, however, was very limited. In later periods, the phonetic use of signs for syllables increased and an individual character could then have three main functions: it could represent a whole word, a determinative or classifier, or a syllable. In a little more detail:
1. When a sign represents a whole word is called a logogram. Such signs can be read in any language, for example, g u d (Sumerian), alpum (Akkadian) “ox.”
2. When a logogram functions as a determinative or a classifier, it precedes or follows a word: d i g̃ i r + u t u → d u t u (the sun god Shamash), where the logogram d i g̃ i r (“god”) indicates that the following word is a divine name; or k a 2 + d i g̃ i r + ra + k i → Bābilu ki (the city of Babylon), where k i (“land, district”) shows that the preceding term is a geographic name. Determinatives were graphic devices and were not pronounced.
3. When a sign represents the sound of a syllable, it is called a syllabogram or a phonogram. In cuneiform there are four types of syllables: V (vowel only), CV (consonant+vowel, e.g., ba), VC (vowel+consonant, e.g., ab), and CVC (consonant+vowel+consonant, e.g., šar). Syllabograms can be used to write a word phonetically, e.g., ka-al-bu-um “dog,” or they can be used as phonetic complements to disambiguate the reading of a logogram. For instance, the logogram can be read in Akkadian as ilum “god” (Sumerian d i g̃ i r ), as Anum, a divine name (a n in Sumerian), or as šamû “heaven” (also an in Sumerian). The writing a n -e (a n noun + e-phonetic complement) shows then that in this case the logogram should have an Akkadian ending /e/ and thus must be šamê

3. AdAptAtion of Cuneiform to Write AkkAdiAn
(i.e., šamû in the form of the genitive/accusative plural). A similar case of disambiguation is the use of syllabic signs to specify the grammatical ending of a word. Thus in the Old Babylonian period, the logogram a - š a g 4 “field” can be written a - š a g 4 -lum, a - š a g 4 -lim, a - š a g 4 -lam to be read in Akkadian eqlum, eqlim, eqlam in the nominative, genitive, and accusative cases respectively (Reiner 1966, p. 26). Syllabograms can be polyphonous. For instance, the sign has many different readings, including ud, ut, uṭ, tam, tu2, par, pir, laḫ, liḫ, and ḫiš. Conversely, several different signs can have homophonous readings. For example, the syllable /u/ can be written: (u), (u2), (u3), or (u4). Note that in Assyriological transliteration, signs with homophonous readings are differentiated by subscript numbers (e.g., u2, u3, u4) or by accents (e.g., ú and ù). The choice of signs to represent a particular syllable is not completely arbitrary but follows certain rules which vary depending on geographic and diachronic conventions. Ambiguities can furthermore be reduced by the use of classifiers and phonetic indicators.
Occasionally a single sign can be used in all three functions. Consider, for instance, , which can be read g̃ e š logographically, meaning “tree”; it can function as a determinative preceding the names of trees or wooden objects, and it may also represent the syllables iṣ, is, and iz.
b) Sumerian and Akkadian
Sumerian is a linguistic isolate because — like, for example, Etruscan or Basque — it is not related to any other known language. It is an agglutinative language, in which words are inflected by stringing identifiable morphemes one after another before or after a given root that is in itself invariable. Thus for instance, in the sentence e re š - e i n - t u d - e n “The queen bore me,” the verbal root t u d is preceded by the morphemes /i/ and /n/ and followed by the morpheme /en/ (Michalowski 1980, p. 91). Because Sumerian roots are mostly monosyllabic and internally unalterable, and because of the agglutinative character of the language, a primarily logographic writing system was quite suitable for Sumerian.
Akkadian, unlike Sumerian, is related to other languages, such as Hebrew and Arabic. It is actually the earliest Semitic language attested and it was employed until the first century ad. Akkadian was the language of ancient Babylonians and Assyrians, and it includes both the Assyrian and Babylonian dialects (table 3.2). Like other Semitic languages, the Akkadian verbal root usually has three radicals that can be modified by consonantal reduplication. It further has an internal vowel pattern, and other additions such as prefixes, infixes and suffixes. Another feature, which actually became crucial in the way the Sumerian writing system was adapted to write Akkadian, is that this language has a simple but strict rule that does not allow clusters of more than two consonants which, if they occur, will always be separated by a syllable boundary. In other words, Akkadian has no syllables that start or end with more than one consonant. For example, the verb aštanapparakkim (root š-p-r) “I (will) keep writing to you,” has the syllables aš ta nap pa rak kim. Its morphological analysis, on the other hand, is as follows: a- (1st-person common singular conjugational prefix), -š- (1st radical), -tana- (infix with iterative force, i.e., it expresses a repeated, habitual or continuous action), -pp- (doubled 2nd radical that indicates present/future), -a- (theme vowel that indicates present/future), -r- (third radical), -ak(directional morpheme -am with the -m assimilated to the following consonant, -k), and -kim (dative pronominal suffix, 2nd-person feminine singular). The morphological pattern is therefore:
a š tana pp a r ak kim
prefix radical infix radical theme vowel
radical suffix suffix
Thus, whereas the Sumerian verbal root was monosyllabic and could not be internally altered, scribes writing Akkadian needed an essentially phonetic syllabic system in order to convey the semantically important structural characteristics of the language. The transition from logograms to syllabograms, therefore, played an important role in the adaptation of cuneiform to write Akkadian, even if a number of syllabic values of certain signs were already available in the earliest stages of writing Sumerian, especially for the prefixal and suffixal morphemes. As a result,

an Old Babylonian scribe, for instance, had a number of options to write aštanapparakkim syllabically. One choice is aš-ta-na-ap-pa-ra-ak-ki-im, that is, using only signs with values CV and VC, without including syllabograms of the CVC type. The brief description of the two languages presented above is obviously simplified for the sake of convenience. One cannot emphasize enough, though, that since the third millennium — and in later periods in scribal circles at least — Sumerian and Akkadian were in very close contact, and Civil (1984, p. 76) is right to remind us that “languages do not exist in a chemically pure, isolated form.” In addition, because of the history of decipherment, our understanding of Sumerian is significantly influenced by our knowledge of Akkadian, which led certain scholars to maintain that we read Sumerian through an Akkadian looking glass (e.g., Edzard 1998,
p. 35). Many gaps in our reconstruction of the process of adaptation still remain, but a huge amount of progress has been made when one compares the current knowledge with that of four or five decades ago, before the time when, for instance, documents from Ebla and Tell Beydar were discovered.
c) Adaptation of Cuneiform to Write Akkadian
The two basic yet fundamental issues related to the process of adapting cuneiform to write Akkadian are: when and how did it happen? Both questions are problematic because of the nature and the fragmentary character of the evidence, and also because of chronological gaps. Judging from the extant evidence, it is almost certain that the adaptation of cuneiform to write Akkadian originated in northern Babylonia. Even though it is impossible to provide an exact date,

3. AdAptAtion of Cuneiform to Write AkkAdiAn
it is now known that cuneiform was already being adapted to write Semitic languages in Mesopotamia and Syria by about 2500 bc (Cooper 1996, p. 37), but the process seems to have started even before that. In the Early Dynastic IIIa (ca. 2600 bc) tablets from Fara and from Abu Salabikh, Semitic names were already written syllabically. Political history, however, lets us suspect that perhaps the beginning of the adaptation occurred still earlier than that. This is the case because during the Early Dynastic I period (ca. 2900 bc) the city of Kish had become a regional center for northern Babylonia, at times influencing also the south. This political predominance has led scholars to hypothesize that the process of adaptation must also have already been taking place in the Kish area at this early time (Cooper 1999, p. 64), although unfortunately we do not yet have any textual information from there proving this point. The question pertaining to how cuneiform was adapted is equally hypothetical and I now present the clues that are available to understand the adaptation. The discovery of the potential of the syllabic values of logograms possibly had already happened during the Uruk IV period because there are a few combined cuneiform signs in which one of the elements functions as a phonetic complement for the reading of that sign (see 2. The Earliest Mesopotamian Writing, this volume). But the syllabic potential of signs was not fully exploited until later. The first attestations of Semitic personal names written syllabically in texts from Fara and Abu Salabikh seem to indicate that scribes had realized by then that the sound of signs could also be used as syllabic values of cuneiform signs. This discovery must have given them flexibility to express linguistic subtleties by means of a phonetic rendering of words. One important thing to notice from the writing of these personal names is that they already combine VC, CV, and CVC signs and logograms. Consider, for example, the following patterns of names from Abu Salabikh (Biggs 1967, p. 62):
iš-lul-il = VC-CVC-VC
i3-lum-ma-lik = V-CVC-CV-CVC
uš-mi-il = VC-CV-VC
puzur4-il = logogram-VC
i3-lum-gar3 = V-CVC-logogram
The fact that personal names were the first attested words written syllabically may have been related to the need to identify people properly. This was perhaps a way of preventing ambiguities that may have created some confusion. For instance, the name i3lum-g a r 3 could have been written simply d i g̃ i r -g a r 3 all in Sumerian logograms, but the scribe was possibly making the statement that his name was Semitic and not Sumerian. By providing one of the elements of his name in Semitic, he was also indicating that the following logogram should be read in Semitic. This was done at the expense of writing quite a few more wedges (in this period the sign d i g̃ i r had simply four). Yet a further step in the adaptation process is the splitting of CVC signs into CV-VC, where the phonetic spelling CV-VC expresses a CVC syllable. Evidence for this important development in syllabification comes from Ebla texts. The following CVC signs are all attested in the Uruk IV period (Green and Nissen 1987). Examples include:
CVC → CV-VC
lum sa-na-rux-lum (MEE 3* 218, r iii: 2)
→ vs.
lu-um
u3-lu-um
(MEE 3 199, 99 A)
šum / šum2 su-šum

(MEE 3 192, vi: 4)

vs.

Thus, unlike the instances from the personal names from Abu Salabikh, where the writing CV-VC is separated by a word/morpheme boundary (e.g., the compound name uš-mi-il = ušmi-word1+il-word2), in the examples from Ebla, the sequence CV-VC represents the phonetic spelling of a CVC sign. The phenomenon is structurally relevant for the adaptation

of cuneiform and becomes more prominent in the Sumerian texts of the ruler Gudea of Lagash (ca. 2100 bc) and later. Another fundamental piece of information to understand the importance of syllabification and therefore the adaptation of cuneiform originates also from Ebla. From this site in Syria come Early Dynastic lexical lists that go back to the Uruk period (Pettinato 1981). Some of these lexical lists include Sumerian words with their Semitic translations (most likely in the Eblaite language) and others were versions written in syllabic Sumerian. These lists are important because they “represent the first instance of the systematic use of cuneiform signs for the syllabic representation of both Semitic and Sumerian” (Civil 1982, p. 22). One could speculate that the phonetic rendering of Sumerian in Ebla was done because in Syria Sumerian was a foreign language that scribes had to learn in order to adopt the writing system for which it was created. Perhaps simultaneously or slightly later scribes also provided the Semitic translation of Sumerian words. It is not unlikely that scribes from Babylonian cities had already discovered those advantages of syllabification and made use of the pedagogical potential of syllables, because syllables allowed them to assign phonological values to logograms and to convey the inflexions of Semitic languages. Inflexions, as we have seen, are best represented by the full writing of verbal forms. The employment of syllabic values explains the development of syllabaries or lists of signs and their values, which were used mainly for scribal training. One of the earliest extant syllabaries also comes precisely from Ebla and can be dated to around 2500 bc (Pettinato 1981, pp. 187–205; Michalowski 2008). All this implies that by the time of Sargon of Akkad the adaptation of cuneiform was very advanced but by no means over. The adaptation of all the necessary syllables from the Sumerian system to write Akkadian may have caused certain challenges because, since Akkadian is Semitic and Sumerian is an isolate, each language had a different phonemic inventory and adjustments were necessary to convey more accurate phonemic information. For instance, the phoneme /ṣ/ is part of the Akkadian inventory, but it did not exist in Sumerian. This problem was solved by assigning new values to existing cuneiform signs by applying the rebus principle phonetically.
For example, the Sumerogram g̃ e š (“wood”) means iṣum in Akkadian. The base of the Akkadian noun, iṣ, was therefore adopted as one of the syllabic values of the sign g̃ e š to write the syllables iṣ, iz, is. It is unknown exactly when this happened, but it is clear that the process was not completed by the Sargonic period because in the Old Akkadian syllabary, for instance, voiced, voiceless, and emphatic phonemes were not yet distinguished (Cooper 1996, p. 46). The fact that during the Old Akkadian period the writing system was still in a process of adaptation makes it difficult to analyze Sargonic orthography (Hasselbach 2005, p. 35). Only in the Old Babylonian period did this process reach a level where basically all phonological and morphological features of Akkadian could be written in an almost unambiguous way. Akkadian had then reached the level of “full writing.” Not coincidentally, this also seems to have been the only time in the history of Akkadian cuneiform script that an effort was made to establish a normative “orthography,” a phenomenon known as “the scribal reform of Hammurabi’s chancellery.” But even after this, the adaptation of cuneiform was still ongoing in later periods when, for instance, a new sign with the value Vʾ (vowel+aleph) and ʾV (aleph+vowel) is attested only from the Middle Babylonian period (ca. 1500–1100 bc) on; whereas in the Old Babylonian period (ca. 2000–1595 bc) such phonemes were written with signs containing ḪV (khet+vowel) or the VḪ (vowel+khet) sign. Regarding the reconstruction of phonemic adaptations, however, it is important to remember that any knowledge of Akkadian and Sumerian was lost for about two thousand years. The sounds of Akkadian were therefore reconstructed from other Semitic languages and, because of that, Akkadian phonology remains an educated guess. This is so in part because, even though Akkadian phonemics is well known, there is in practice no real Akkadian phonetics (Buccellati 1996, p. 16). The available evidence allows us to present only an artificial reconstruction of the process of adaptation because of the qualitative and quantitative character of the extant records and their distribution. One could very well suspect that the process of adaptation had different avenues in different geographic areas and periods. Therefore experimentations on the adaptation could have been multifarious, encompassing successful trials and others that

were discarded. Although the syllabic component of the adaptation was very important, the implementation of syllabic writing does not mean that suddenly all verbs and other words were written syllabically throughout ancient Syro-Mesopotamia. In Ebla, for example, scribes tended to use syllabic writing for proper names and for linguistic elements but not for nouns and verbs, even though they could have done so, and they eventually did (Cooper 1999, p. 67). This persistence in the use of logograms might have been related to the fact that, when writing was adopted by non-Sumerian speakers/writers, scribes learned the system by copying Sumerian texts and by learning Sumerian lexical lists (e.g., Krecher 1992). As a result, a number of conventions may have become frozen in certain areas far away from Babylonia. Generalizations, however, tend to be misleading, because in places such as Mari, writing was occasionally modified to keep up with Babylonian conventions (see Durand 1985 and 1992; Michalowski 1987). Although it may seem that syllabification implied a big step toward the simplification of the writing system, logographic writing was never abandoned. What is more, Akkadian kept employing a mixed logo-syllabic system throughout its written history. The potential for simplification is obvious when one considers that Uruk IV shows a repertoire of about 1,200 signs, a number that was reduced significantly in later periods, and by the mid-third millennium it was possible to write Akkadian and Sumerian with about 150 signs (Cooper 1996; Michalowski 1998). But a number of factors may have influenced the adoption and maintaining of a logo-syllabic system. When looking at them with a Mesopotamian frame of mind, both syllabograms and logograms have pros and cons. Resorting to syllables undoubtedly simplifies the sign repertoire if one so desires, but the use of logograms makes it easy to skim through a text. Ignace Gelb (1952, p. 69, 251) argued that the use of logograms responded to a “principle of economy” because
fewer signs are employed (e.g., “dog” written u r in Sumerian vs. ka-al-bu-um in Akkadian), but as other scholars have shown, the economy principle does not work in all cases (Cooper 2004). The persistence in the use of logograms may have depended on scribal preferences and on the writing of specific genres. For example, in the Old Babylonian period (Catalog No. 59), we can find economic documents written mostly with logograms alongside letters written mostly syllabically. Similarly, in the late first millennium when Sumerian had been a dead language for a long time, Akkadian divinatory and astronomical texts can be 85 percent logograms (Civil 1973, p. 26); whereas literary texts are almost entirely syllabic (there is less redundancy since the phonetic realization is important). One feature that one should keep in mind for the persistent use of logograms is what Jerrold Cooper (1999, p. 73) has described as “a symptom of the perverse pleasure that academics can take in their most arcane and recondite creations.” His comment was meant to explain the very difficult allographic ud.gal.nun orthography of early Sumerian literary texts. Perhaps the same reasoning can be applied to the use of convoluted logograms and exegetical commentaries of first-millennium texts. After all, scholars have always been proud of their intellectual sophistication. This brings us back to Enmerkar’s pride in defeating the Lord of Aratta by inventing a writing system. He undoubtedly would have been proud to know that his combination of wedges was still conveying messages thousands of years later until the very beginning of the Common Era.

This ornamental peg of blue frit is one of four excavated in the Southeast Palace, often called the Harem of Xerxes, at Persepolis, the complex of palaces built by the Achaemenid kings in the Persian heartland of their empire. This peg and two others have inscriptions of Darius I (522–486 bc), the founder of Persepolis: “Knobbed peg of precious stone (or lapis lazuli) made in the house of Darius the King.” The fourth peg has a similar inscription in the name of his son and successor Xerxes (486–465 bc). In a striking departure from the practices of other ancient Middle Eastern rulers, the Achaemenid Persian kings usually displayed their inscriptions, whether on palace walls, on
column bases and doorframes, on ornamental or precious items, on stelae, or on cliff faces, in three unrelated languages: Old Persian (an Indo-European language), Akkadian (a Semitic language), and Elamite (a linguistic isolate, indigenous to ancient western Iran). Inscriptions set up in Egypt or carved on objects brought from Egypt often add a fourth version, in Egyptian, written with hieroglyphs. Where the versions are displayed together, the language of the rulers, Old Persian, is normally on top or in the middle.

3. AdAptAtion of Cuneiform to Write AkkAdiAn
The Old Persian characters are composed of wedges, but they are not drawn from Mesopotamian cuneiform characters, and Old Persian writing is systematically different from Mesopotamian cuneiform. Old Persian writing has only thirty-six syllabic signs: three vowels (a, i, u), four of the type C(onsonant)+i (e.g., di, mi, vi), seven of the type C+u (e.g., du, mu, ru), and twenty-two of the kind C+a, also representing consonant alone (e.g., ka or k, ta or t, pa or p). It has seven signs representing words (e.g., “king”); a word-divider (here, the single slanting wedge ); and numerals. Almost all the characters have five or fewer strokes, and the strokes never cross, making the script especially appropriate for carving in stone or metal. Many scholars believe that Old Persian writing was invented at the command of Darius I. It is used for no other language. The Akkadian and Elamite versions are written in two variants of the same Mesopotamian cuneiform script used for Sumerian, Eblaite, Hittite, Hurrian, and Urartian. Its hundreds of characters were of several types: syllabograms, representing syllables of several kinds (C[onsonant]+V[owel], V+C, C+V+C, and V+C+V); logograms, representing words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and prepositions); determinatives, unpronounced characters indicating semantic categories (e.g., identifying a noun as the name of a bird, of a wooden thing, of a place name); and numerals. Many characters belong to more than one of these types. Many have more than one syllabic value (polyphony), and many syllabic values are represented by more than one sign (homophony). From about 2100 bc on, Elamite texts were written with cuneiform signs that were similar in form to contemporary Mesopotamian signs, but after about 650 bc the forms of many Elamite characters diverged. To a modern eye (and perhaps to an ancient eye) the forms are perhaps as
distinctive as German Fraktur forms of European alphabetic characters. Elamite scribes did not use the rich array of graphic options that Mesopotamian cuneiform allowed. They introduced some syllabic and determinative values specific to Elamite, but most of their adaptations were in the direction of graphic economy. In any period, they used only about 100–140 characters, using logograms only to represent nouns, and they made very sparing use of homophony and polyphony, almost eliminating them entirely by the time the Achaemenid Persians wrote inscriptions and kept records in Elamite. The results of this economy, and of the structural difference between the Mesopotamian/ Elamite and the Old Persian systems, can be seen when the three versions of Achaemenid inscriptions are displayed side by side: the Old Persian needs more characters and more space than the other versions, as it does here; the Elamite often needs more characters and more space than the Akkadian. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries ad, the trilingual inscriptions of the Achaemenid Persian kings, copied from the palaces of Persepolis and Susa, were the basis for the first steps in the decipherment of the cuneiform scripts. Old Persian, combining a small sign inventory, little polyphony, and no homophony, with consistent writing rules to represent a language from a family that was familiar to the decipherers, was the first to yield, affording a basis for interpreting the far more complicated Akkadian cuneiform and then its sparer Elamite variant. mws

4. the rise and fall of cuneiform script in hittite anatolia
W
hy, when, and how does a society start to write? And when they do, from where do they get their script? In many cases these early steps toward literacy are shrouded in darkness, because when our earliest sources begin to flow, writing is already there and usually societies were not interested in recording for us the why, where, and how. The interesting thing about Anatolia is that we may be able to answer some of the above questions.
anatolia: the early years
When written sources begin to flow in Anatolia early in the second millennium bc, at first its society becomes visible only indirectly through the lens of a network of merchants from Assur. This commercial network consisted of several trading posts and hubs spread throughout central Anatolia and extended along some major routes all the way to their hometown in Assyria. With few interruptions this network lasted from about 2000 into the 1730s. The most important center was the city of Kanes (also known as Nesa). In their dealings with the local population and in contacts with their firms back home, these traders used their own Assyrian language written in a simple form of cuneiform script. It used few word-signs and comprised just over 100 signs with a syllabic value (e.g., a, i, ku, id, tup). The tablets have a very characteristic look with their rulings and the right slant of the signs (fig. 4.1). Over twenty thousand records have been found thus far. The Assyrians lived in close proximity with the local Anatolians, they mingled and married, and there is even evidence for some level of bilingualism in the local population. Certain mistakes made in the Assyrian documents betray how sometimes local Anatolians would use the Semitic language and its script. They themselves mostly spoke the IndoEuropean languages Hittite and Luwian, others the non-Indo-European and non-Semitic Hattian. Yet when the network came to an end and the merchants

returned home for good, they took the language and the script with them, never to return. There is no evidence that the Anatolians ever felt the urge to use the script systematically for their own purposes, let alone to record their own languages. One of the reasons the Anatolians do not seem to have been ready for a script of their own may be that in this period Anatolia formed no political unity. The area was a conglomeration of small independent and probably largely self-sufficient city-states in a mountainous landscape that favored geographical isolation. With small local economies and no international relations to speak of, there was little need for long

lines of communication. For their local administration they had developed a system of symbols that did not represent speech, but which could be used for surprisingly detailed and efficient bookkeeping. In this system a symbol, that is, an animal or a piece of vegetation, a ceramic shape, a geometric pattern, or other abstract looking design (fig. 4.2), probably stood for a person or a group of individuals, just as we might recognize an elephant or a donkey symbolizing a political party or just as we immediately associate an illegible scribble as the signature of a person we know. The impression of that symbol on a lump of clay attached to a container with goods showed who had been responsible for filling the container or for taking goods out and closing it again most recently. This is best illustrated by the seal impressions found at the fourth-millennium bc site of Arslantepe near Malatya. It shows how all withdrawals from a storeroom over what may have been the equivalent of a fiscal year or period could be followed in great detail, including who made them. Clay lumps or bullae with such symbols impressed in them have been found in many places in Anatolia, among them in Kanes and the later Hittite capital Hattusa. The later hieroglyphic script used in Anatolia stands in the same tradition in that it draws on the same material surroundings for the inspiration of its symbols (see 13. Anatolian Hieroglyphic Writing, this volume). Such systems probably sufficed for the internal administration of most of the cities and towns in Anatolia. The first-known effort to unite many of the hitherto independent settlements into a kingdom of sorts was made by Anitta, king of Kanes around 1750, just
before the end of the Assyrian presence in Anatolia. It may be no surprise then that he is the first local ruler we know of, who put up an inscription. Although the original has not been preserved, we have later copies in Hittite, but there is uncertainty as to whether it was originally written in that language or in Assyrian. Doubt is in order, because of a spearhead with the Assyrian inscription “Palace of Anitta, Great Prince.” Was this a first step toward some form of internal administration, using Assyrian cuneiform and language? A small clay document, likewise in Assyrian, with his name points in the same direction (fig. 4.3). It lists a number of dignitaries, the first among whom is “Anita, Prince,” who have appended their seal to some unnamed object. This makes it likely that the publicly displayed inscription just mentioned likewise used the same medium. If this was indeed the beginning of using the Old Assyrian cuneiform by the local Anatolian government for internal purposes, it was nipped in the bud: in the time of Anitta the Assyrian network was already on the wane and when it came to its end, Anitta’s short-lived kingdom and Anatolia reverted to their illiterate and oral ways. We have to assume

that all those centuries since the Assyrians had started their trading the Anatolians observed them using the cuneiform script but felt little to no need to adopt it systematically for themselves. Their own
administrative system fully satisfied their needs and the collapse of Anitta’s kingdom put an end to what may have been a first attempt at implementing the script.

the beginnings of a hittite state
Less than a century later the political landscape of Anatolia had thoroughly changed. Around 1650 Hattusa had become the capital of the young Hittite state under Hattusili I. With central Anatolia already in his power he focused his attention on northern Syria. Here lay the powerful kingdom of Yamhad with its capital Aleppo. A variant of (Semitic) Akkadian was spoken there and a different kind of cuneiform writing than the Old Assyrian one was used for state business. Upon entering the world of international diplomacy, Hattusili had to rely on foreign scribes if he wanted to correspond with his peers in Syria: a letter sent by him to a local Syrian ruler by the name of Tunip-tessub uses the local Syrian variant of Old Babylonian cuneiform and language and has come to down to us in almost pristine condition (fig. 4.4). We also know he erected in Hattusa a gold statue — probably of himself — inscribed with his “manly deeds” over a period of five years. The statue has not been preserved but we do have a late copy of the text in both an Akkadian and a Hittite version. The entry for his second year runs as follows:
In the following year I went to (the city of) Alalakh and destroyed it. Thereafter I went to (the city of) Warsuwa, and from Warsuwa I went to (the city of) Ikakali. From Ikakali I went to (the city of) Tashiniya. I destroyed these lands, but I took their goods and filled my palace with goods. (Güterbock and Otten 1960, no. 2 i 15–21)
It so happens that the site of Alalakh, that is, the archaeological level (Level VII) that Hattusili claims to have destroyed, has yielded over 300 tablets. Hattusili’s statement about his campaign and the proven use by him of the Syrian script and dialect supports the traditional view that it was he who re-introduced cuneiform in Anatolia. But it may not have been one campaign of a single king that achieved this. Not only Hattusili but also his grandson and immediate successor Mursili I extensively campaigned there. Likewise, it may also have been Aleppo or some other site in the Syrian area that formed the inspiration for the later typical Hittite variant of cuneiform. However, Alalakh is practically the only site where cuneiform tablets from this area and period have come to light and its script is very similar to the later Hittite one. The Syrian cuneiform for which Alalakh is representative ultimately came from Babylon and shows the typical traits of a peripheral area that is no longer subject to the standardizing pressures of the center. Syrian scribes developed certain variant sign forms that were distinctly non-Babylonian. As table 4.1 below shows, the new shapes even became the most popular: the newer variants appear on average in 75 percent of the cases. Judging by the extant evidence, cuneiform writing in the days of Hattusili I and Mursili I was a relatively rare phenomenon, perhaps reserved for special occasions. We already saw Hattusili’s diplomatic correspondence with a local Syrian king and the

propagandistic inscription on his own statue. Besides these we have in a late thirteenth-century copy his so-called Testament in both Akkadian and Hittite. In it he instructed his entourage to obey and support his grandson Mursili and toward the end of the text he stipulated:
My words, too, I have given you and let them read this [tabl]et out loud to you every month so that you will instill my [wor]ds and my wisdom in (your) heart! (Weber 1921, no. 16 iii 56–58)
This shows how he was already aware of the long-term use of script: by having his advice written down, his words were sure to outlast him and his wisdom would be preserved for ever. As said, only the letter to Tunip-tessub (in Akkadian) is a contemporary document, the inscription on the statue and the Testament we have only in late copies in both Akkadian and Hittite. Some rare instances of writing from their successors are also preserved in late copies only. Why do we see so much Akkadian in these early sources? Comparisons with societies that adopt scripts from others with a different language show that writing initially is done in the language of the other society. This is due to the fact that the “imported” scribes usually are not versed in the language of their host society and teach the first local generation in their own language. Only gradually do they start experimenting to write in the local language and the transition can last one or more generations. One of the oldest contemporary documents from the days of Hattusili or Mursili written in the Syrian script and in the Akkadian language already contains a sentence in Hittite and a few isolated Hittite words inserted in the text. The difficulty of adapting a foreign script used to write a foreign language to one’s own is not to be underestimated. Some of the oldest texts in Hittite betray through uncommon and irregular spellings of words the struggle of early scribes to express the sounds of their mother tongue by means of the foreign script. Where the two languages, Akkadian and Hittite, sounded alike, there was no problem: the same cuneiform signs could be used. But where there were real differences, creative solutions had to be found. Akkadian, for instance, distinguished between voiced and voiceless consonants, like the difference between (voiced) b and (voiceless) p in English bet vs.

pet. Hittite, on the other hand, did not: most probably it had within a word an opposition between so-called “short” and “long” consonants. A long t, for instance, is a t where the tongue is held against the upper teeth just a little longer before it is released than in a short one. English does not have this, but one can hear such a long t in Italian otto “eight.” Using the Syrian cuneiform, Hittite scribes eventually decided to simply ignore the voiced/voiceless contrast that came with the script, but spelled short consonants single and long ones double: compare p vs. pp in Hittite apa- “that one” vs. appa “back, behind.” Despite its relatively modest volume, the writing activity in the century between Hattusili and

Mursili (ca. 1650/1600 bc) and king Telipinu (late sixteenth century) was enough to sustain a development from the originally Syrian variant of the cuneiform script known from Alalakh to what eventually became the typical Hittite cuneiform variant. In this new Hittite script, the 75 percent to 25 percent ratio between the new peripheral Syrian variants vis-àvis the traditional Old Babylonian shapes (see table 4.1, above) that we know from Alalakh became even more pronounced: the peripheral variants became the typical Hittite ones to the virtual extinction of the Babylonian forms, although they may never have been given up completely. This development is understandable from the point of view of the new local generations. Their Syrian teachers brought in the mix of standard and newly developed forms, but having to learn already a few hundred cuneiform signs, the local students were probably not keen to memorize more than one shape per sign. The end of this development may already have been reached by around 1550 bc. We have a graffito on a bronze ax of king Ammuna from that period (fig. 4.5). It is still in Akkadian but the inscription already shows the familiar Hittite sign forms. The slightly later reign of king Telipinu toward the end of the sixteenth century probably served as a real catalyst. He issued an unprecedented range of official documents, from land grants, the first diplomatic treaty, a new “constitution” to a fiscal reform. It is very well possible that also the first codification of Hittite Laws into two series was written down at his behest. Again, most of these documents were still written in Akkadian, but the law collection was in the Hittite language only.
from akkadian to hittite
After this, Akkadian was used less and less and the fifteenth century was the last one to see internal records written in that language. By the time Tudhaliya I ascended the throne around 1420, Akkadian was restricted to international diplomatic documents and all internal record keeping was done in Hittite exclusively (fig. 4.6). By this time, too, a professional chancellery must have emerged and the growing number of records both produced in the capital and received from the
far corners of what had become the Hittite “Empire” prompted an efficient organization of those records. A lot of tablets concerning daily administration of incoming and outgoing goods and services to the state were discarded regularly and after a brief period. Others had a more long-term relevance and some, especially those of a legal nature, were stored indefinitely. Tablets that got damaged were copied as were certain compositions of which more than one copy was deemed necessary. Initially, in the time when writing was still something special, tablets may have been kept in temples and were stored alongside other “treasures” as was the practice in church treasuries in early medieval Western Europe. But with the increasing production of records a system developed with a so-called record center atop the royal acropolis (Turkish Büyükkale) for all documents considered of longer-term importance, and at least two scribal centers in the lower city near some of the gates and the endless storerooms where all goods received were packed in chests and baskets or poured into huge pithoi and underground silos (fig. 4.7). The further development of the Hittite cuneiform scripts illustrates the vicissitudes of the empire that

around 1400 had grown out of the former kingdom. The script used in the fifteenth century had evolved in relative isolation and had weeded out most “unnecessary” variants of the Syrian cuneiform it had adopted. But now that the empire had taken its rightful place alongside the other major powers of Egypt, Babylon, Assyria, and Mittani, it became increasingly drawn into the international diplomatic world where the Babylonian language and script were the standard. It may have been through these increased contacts that the standard Babylonian forms gained new prominence in Hittite society. What had once been the “new” forms from the peripheral Syrian scribal milieu now became the “old” forms in the Hittite
system, and the original old Babylonian standard shapes once again became fashionable (table 4.2). By the late thirteenth century toward the end of the empire the “new” shapes all but eclipsed the “old” ones. Judged by the fact that, for instance, “old” LI was used in certain texts in a royal name only, shows how they could be felt as old fashioned, that is, hearkening back to older, long-established scribal traditions, and therefore also festive or solemn.
the end
The Hittite language and the cuneiform script were the official medium of the empire’s internal record keeping, but the Hittite language’s dominant status did not necessarily match the linguistic make-up of the country. Because of its huge mountain ranges and rugged terrain, Anatolia was riddled with isolated areas, each with its own dialect or language. The most important of these was Luwian, a sister language of Hittite. Over the centuries the parts of the population that spoke Luwian probably increased, to the extent that by the thirteenth century most of the population spoke Luwian and Hittite may no longer even have been anybody’s mother tongue. Anatolian Hieroglyphs had reached the full status of a script by 1400 bc and they became the preferred medium for the Luwian language. Hittite kings employed the hieroglyphic script and Luwian language for ever lengthier and mostly propagandistic inscriptions meant for the population at large. Meanwhile, the scribes in the empire’s offices continued to compose annals, prayers, depositions, oracle reports, cultic scenarios, and the like in Hittite and cuneiform. This meant, however, that once the empire’s power structure broke down around 1200, the support for both the Hittite language and its cuneiform script fell away and they disappeared without a trace.
conclusions
Coming back to the questions posed at the beginning, why, when, and how a society starts to write, we can say that the rise of the Hittite cuneiform script depended on the need the ruling class perceived and
figure 4.7. Storage pithoi at Hattusa near Temple 1

106
Visible language
on the availability of a script. Initially, at least, there was little internal administrative need and their “choice” of a script was not motivated by efficiency or pedagogical principles. For a period of about two centuries they lived in close proximity and daily interaction with the Assyrian merchants who used writing intensively. Even though some Anatolians mastered both their language and the script, when the Assyrians left, nothing happened. The Assyrian writing system, despite its relative simplicity, was not adopted. About a century later, around 1650 bc, the Hittites settled for the much more complex Syrian variant of cuneiform. It was the need that came with a state that grew too big for purely oral communication and for its eagerness for international prestige that compelled them to adopt a script of their own. In keeping with other societies the Hittites started writing in the language that came with the script they adopted and only gradually started experimenting with their own language. The fall of the Hittite cuneiform script was a question of political sustainability. The cuneiform
script and the Hittite language had become the official medium for all internal and external communication of the Hittite state and its ruling elite. The use of the Akkadian language was restricted to diplomatic purposes. However, due to political developments the linguistic make-up of Anatolia changed and Hittite became an increasingly artificial language that ultimately was nobody’s mother tongue. The consequence of this was that when around 1200 bc the state disintegrated, the bottom fell out from under the system that had supported the Hittite language with its cuneiform script: with the language the cuneiform script vanished for ever from Anatolia.

This tablet contains a list of tax payments by twelve individuals to the Hittite state. The text dates to the thirteenth century bc. All payments are made in dyed wool and ready-made textiles. Divided into twelve sections or paragraphs by horizontal lines, each paragraph lists the specific payments of a
single person. The last line of each paragraph gives the name of the taxpayer preceded by the vertical wedge marking male names. Sometimes the name is followed by a city name for further identification. On the obverse (compare lines 13–14, 20) the scribe sometimes uses the right edge to finish the last word of a line. In obverse line 14, however, although already on the right edge, he squeezes in an entire extra tax item and ends up writing on the reverse. It is unclear whether he was reluctant to devote a whole extra line to this one payment before the name of the tax payer or if he had forgotten it initially and was forced to add it afterwards. Since elsewhere in the text (compare obverse line 17, reverse line 13) he does give the

5. the conception and development of the egyptian writing system
elise V. macarthur
E
choing the sentiments of many scholars regarding the origins of Egyptian hieroglyphs, the moment of conception of the Egyptian writing system is inaccessible (e.g., Baines 2004, p. 172). Such sentiments have a long history, as even Egyptian mythological tradition maintains only that the god Thoth invented hieroglyphic writing (Watterson 1984, p. 180; see text box below). Although much is known about early Egyptians, very little is known about the origins of their written language. Indeed, millennia later, Egyptologists are still searching the sands for clues about the earliest Egyptian writing. Writing is defined as a conventionalized system of visual communication representing language.
Early Egyptian writing, in particular, has been especially problematic for scholars. These difficulties are due to the fact that texts from the developing Egyptian writing system were (from the point of view of the modern scholar) essentially incomplete; the intended, ancient reader knew the greater context and could thus understand the information being communicated.
precursors to writing
Beginning in the fourth millennium bc, with the onset of the Naqada period of Egyptian history, an iconographic revolution began to take place, which
Socrates: I heard, then, that at Naucratis, in Egypt, was one of the ancient gods of that country, the one whose sacred bird is called the ibis, and the name of the god himself was Thoth. He it was who invented numbers and arithmetic and geometry and astronomy, also draughts and dice, and, most important of all, letters. Now the king of all Egypt at that time was the god Amun, who lived in the great city of the upper region, which the Greeks call the Egyptian Thebes, and they call the god himself Amun. To him came Thoth to show his inventions, saying that they ought to be imparted to the other Egyptians. But Amun asked what use there was in each, and as Thoth enumerated their uses, expressed praise or blame, according as he approved or disapproved. The story goes that Amun said many things to Thoth in praise or blame of the various arts, which it would take too long to repeat; but when they came to the letters, “This invention, O king,” said Thoth, “will make the Egyptians wiser and will improve their memories; for it is an elixir of memory and wisdom that I have discovered.” But Amun replied, “Most ingenious Thoth, one man has the ability to beget arts, but the ability to judge of their usefulness or harmfulness to their users belongs to another; and now you, who are the father of letters, have been led by your affection to ascribe to them a power the opposite of that which they really possess. For this invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory. Their trust in writing, produced by external characters which are no part of themselves, will discourage the use of their own memory within them. You have invented an elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom, for they will read many things without instruction and will therefore seem to know many things, when they are for the most part ignorant and hard to get along with, since they are not wise, but only appear wise.”

Egyptian prEdynastic pEriod
would set the stage for the emergence of writing at the end of the Predynastic period (fig. 5.1). It is in these precursors that many scholars have sought the origins of Egyptian writing: pot marks, rock drawings, decorated pottery, cylinder seals, and decorated ceremonial objects. Rock drawings constitute the earliest of the precursors to writing in Egypt. Drawings date from the earliest habitation of the Nile valley to the Islamic period, but the most salient early examples date to the Naqada I period (ca. 3750–3500 bc). They are located in the Eastern Desert along principle routes to the Red Sea (e.g., the Wadi Hammamat), and in the Western Desert along important land routes (e.g., the Theban Desert Road). Among the more popular motifs displayed are boats, animals, and humanoid figures with feathers (fig. 5.2). Their composition is seemingly narrative, but their meaning is difficult to ascertain. There are rare examples of rock art of the late Predynastic period that can be interpreted. The 1936–1938 expeditions of Hans Winkler yielded a serekh (a rectangular enclosure with the king’s Horus name and a niched facade, surmounted by a falcon)
of King Narmer (before ca. 3150 bc) at the site of figure 5.2. Example of early rock art in the region of Aswan, now in the Nubian Museum
Wadi el-Qash, in the Eastern Desert (fig. 5.3). This inscription is composed of an abbreviated version of King Narmer’s name (only the nar-catfish is written; the mr-chisel has been left out)1 within a serekh, and constitutes the only definite example of writing from this corpus at such an early date in Egyptian history. In general, during the Predynastic period the distinction between purely pictorial rock drawings and

hieroglyphic writing is very hard to make. Although the motifs foreshadow those of subsequent periods of Egyptian history, aside from the example at Wadi el-Qash there are no clear attempts at writing during the Predynastic period presently known to scholars. Instead, these spectacular scenes, carved into living rock, remain frustratingly ambiguous. The assemblage of Predynastic pottery — C-Ware (White Crossed-Lined) and D-Ware (Decorated) pottery — is particularly renowned because of its captivating designs, which are reminiscent of rock drawings. Chronologically, C-Ware was an innovation of the Naqada I period, and was replaced by D-Ware during the Naqada II period (ca. 3500–3320 bc) (Hawass, Hassan, and Gautier 1988, p. 38). The geographic distribution of D-Ware was quite widespread: examples have been found throughout Egypt as well as in Nubia and the southern Levant. The images depicted on these vessels — animals, humanoid figures, boats, and landscapes — seem to evoke greater narrative contexts, the messages of which are not entirely clear to the modern observer (fig. 5.4). Although, like rock drawings, their repertoire of images is similar to that of later hieroglyphs, these images do not represent known words and cannot be considered writing. Pot marks are defined as incised signs or marks on the exterior of a vessel (van den Brink 1992, p. 265). Although these incisions are systematically applied to specific types of pottery vessels, their function is still a matter of great debate. They are attested in Egypt as early as the Neolithic period (ca. figure 5.4. D-Ware vessel, Naqada II period,
ca. 3500–3320 bc. OIM E10758
4800–4400 bc) (Hassan 1985, p. 95). From their first appearance through the end of the Predynastic period (ca. 3150 bc), there are about two thousand known pot marks, most resulting from Petrie’s excavations at Abydos (Catalog Nos. 64–67). Pot marks represent a more perplexing class of objects than rock drawings and decorated pottery, as they do not match neatly with many later-known hieroglyphic signs. Additionally, despite the fact that some of the signs that occur were later incorporated into the hieroglyphic system, there is no clear evolutionary relationship between certain pot marks and later, corresponding hieroglyphic signs. Although they probably denote a pottery workshop — just as insignia on modern pottery represent specific name brands — like rock drawings and decorated vessels, pot marks do not contain discernible words and cannot be reliably translated. However, during Dynasty 0 (ca. 3200–3150 bc) and the subsequent First Dynasty (ca. 3150–2890 bc) some pot marks occur in conjunction with serekhs (Catalog No. 65), and even royal economic institutions for the production of goods, called “domains” (Catalog No. 67). Although the pot marks still cannot be securely read, the accompanying signs can be translated. In contrast to Mesopotamia,2 Egyptian cylinder seals are rare within the Predynastic archaeological record: only about eighteen are documented (Catalog

the Narmer Palette, from the reign of King Narmer, (Dynasty 0, before ca. 3150 bc; fig. 5.5). Mace-heads, another salient example of decorated ceremonial objects, are first attested in the Naqada I period as disk-shaped objects. In the Naqada II period, however, they were replaced by pearshaped mace-heads. Like palettes, mace-heads were also reproduced on a larger, more ceremonial scale than their functional counterparts. Two well-known examples are the Scorpion and Narmer mace-heads, recovered along with the Narmer Palette from the Main Deposit at Hierakonpolis (all three examples date to Dynasty 0, ca. 3200–3150 bc). Both maceheads are adorned with both pictorial scenes and hieroglyphic texts. Ceremonial objects have been the focus of much debate since their discovery at the turn of the twentieth century. Many dramatic interpretations have been offered: the scenes have been interpreted as historical documents recording the unification of Egypt, or the royal marriage of King Narmer to Neith-hetep (more correctly read “Hetep-Neith”),3 who was buried in the elite cemetery at Naqada. The texts upon these objects, however, can be read as no more than “King Narmer,” or “ṯ(Ꜣ)t(y),” for example. Decorated ceremonial objects are also important because they can be used to explore the relationship between image and text in the nascent stages of both mediums. On the mace-heads of King Scorpion and King Narmer, as well as on the Narmer Palette, the hieroglyphic signs functioned as captions of the greater scenes depicted on these objects. Thus, this class of objects demonstrates the intimate connection that existed in Egypt between image and text, which continued to be a characteristic of Egyptian writing throughout ancient Egyptian history.
the earliest egyptian writing
The earliest-known Egyptian writing was discovered in Tomb U-j of Umm el-Qa’ab, the necropolis of the Predynastic and Early Dynastic kings at the site of Abydos in Upper Egypt. Umm el-Qa’ab (Arabic for “Mother of Pots”) had previously been explored in 1896 by Émile Amélineau, where he is believed to have dug in the vicinity of the burial chamber of Tomb U-j. Thereafter, W. M. Flinders Petrie began excavations at
No. 73). Rather, impressions made by cylinder seals (the majority of which were not recovered) in mud and clay — called “sealings” — are far better represented (Catalog Nos. 74–77). They are first attested in the Naqada II period and have been found as far from Egypt as the southern Levant and Nubia. Cylinder seals were used in administrative contexts, and many of their impressions were found with trade items. In their earliest forms, seals and sealings bear motifs that are known from the other classes of objects mentioned above, but only a few of these closely resemble later hieroglyphic signs. The first evidence of writing in Egypt, from Tomb U-j at Abydos (see below) and dating to around 3320 bc, is contemporaneous with the use of cylinder seals, impressions of which were also recovered from this tomb. Early, indecipherable signs appear on seals into the First Dynasty (Catalog No. 75). Beginning in Dynasty 0 specifically with the reign of King Iry-Hor (ca. 3200 bc) — the signs that appear on sealings can be translated with some certainty (Catalog No. 74). By the end of the Predynastic period, other decorated ceremonial objects, including knife handles, plaques, and combs also bear recognizable hieroglyphs. Some of the best examples of early Egyptian inscriptions appear on decorated cosmetic palettes and mace-heads. Cosmetic palettes are quite common within the funerary assemblages of the Predynastic period. Large, ceremonial palettes evolved from earlier, more functional forms, and were often elaborately decorated. Ceremonial palettes first appear during the Naqada I period in zoomorphic form, with scenes of men and animals roughly incised on the palettes’ surface. In the subsequent Naqada II period, the palette shape is simplified, and the supplementary scenes are carved into the palette in raised or sunken relief. Finally, in the Naqada III period (ca. 3320–3200 bc), the shape of the palette seamlessly complements its accompanying relief, itself a narrative composition. This narrative is sometimes more explicit: certain Naqada III palettes bear writing that ranges in complexity from suspiciously recognizable signs, as on the standards on the Hunters, Battlefield, and Bull palettes, to unidentifiable serekhs, such as those that appear on the Metropolitan Museum Palette, to speech writing in the town names on the Bull and Town palettes, and finally to captioned scenes as on

the tomb were an ivory scepter, fragments of a shell cosmetic container, and an obsidian blade. Tomb U-j is best known for three distinctive forms of administrative record keeping, in the form of ink-inscribed vessels, sealings, and tags. The size of the tomb, its contents, and the amount of labor its construction and assemblage would have required has led many scholars to propose that this tomb belonged to a proto-ruler who reigned over a sizable territory by the Naqada III period. In several chambers of the tomb, excavators found Egyptian pottery sherds, believed to belong to some 800 vessels. On some of these vessels, 125 ink inscriptions were preserved. Scholars divide the signs represented on these vessels into two groups: “main signs” (e.g., scorpions, Red Sea shells, fish, falcons,
Abydos, where he discovered and published several tags and labels from the area immediately surrounding the tomb (Catalog No. 68). Since the 1970s, Günter Dreyer of the German Archaeological Institute has re-excavated the site with new and very important results (Dreyer, Hartung, and Pumpenmeier 1998, p. 14). Tomb U-j, which dates to ca. 3320 bc, 4 is a rectangular, mudbrick tomb with twelve interconnected chambers, mud-plastered walls, acacia wood beams, and mat roofing (fig. 5.6). Some scholars hypothesize that the tomb was modeled after a Predynastic palace, with a central room surrounded by connecting chambers; however, no palaces of this date have survived.

and ships) and “secondary signs” (e.g., trees, reeds, horizontal and vertical strokes). In other chambers of the tomb, distinct from those with Egyptian ceramics, some 700 imported vessels were discovered. Although they are the topic of some debate, they are believed to have derived from the southern Levant and to have contained resinated wine infused with figs.5 The vessels were covered with cloth or leather, bound with string, and sealed with Egyptian clay, upon which cylinder seals were rolled. About 250 sealing fragments were also recovered. The sealings all bear a central design embedded in a frame with geometric patterns. The final group of administrative record keeping found in Tomb U-j was tags. Of the nearly 200 tags recovered, most were made of bone or ivory (only a few of stone) incised with signs and perforated. A majority of the tags have representations of people and animals of various sorts; about a quarter of the tags have numbers on them, believed to indicate lengths of cloth (Catalog No. 68). Excavators recovered cedar boxes with bolts of cloth and ivory games. It is believed that the tags were originally attached to these commodities. The written evidence from Tomb U-j, in particular the tags, probably denotes quantities of goods, and localities in Egypt and beyond. The Egyptian writing system had already undergone a number of important developments by the time of Tomb U-j, which have not yet been recovered, or have not
survived to modern times. Linguistic terminology makes it possible to identify the various units of language that helped to transform communication in early Egypt from merely pictorial expression to speech writing, which is important in identifying the nature of early graphic material:6
1) Logograms: symbols representing specific words
2) Phonograms: symbols representing specific sounds
3) Determinatives: symbols used for classifying words
Moreover, writing on the tags shows that the Egyptian writing system had adopted the rebus principle, which broadened the meaning of symbols to include their homophones — words with the same sound but different definitions. For example, several tags from Tomb U-j bear the image of an elephant on top of a mountain: Ꜣbw, Elephantine (after Dreyer, Hartung, and Pumpenmeier 1998, p. 119, fig. 76, no. 55). This sign combination demonstrates compelling parallels to later attestations. Using the rebus principle, the place indicated by the signs is not “Elephant (Ꜣbw) + Mountain/Highlands/Mound ( ḫꜢs.t),” but rather the city Elephantine (Ꜣbw).7 As demonstrated in table 5.1, the determinative qualifies the logogram, signifying that the sign combination is a place name, for example, a city or village.

egyptian writing: from tomb u-j to the early dynastic period
Over five hundred inscriptions from Tomb U-j date from around 3320 bc to the end of the Predynastic period at around 3150 bc (Kahl 2001, p. 102). Although the earliest inscriptions seem to function as captions of larger images and scenes, stringing together nouns in short phrases, slightly later textual material provides compelling evidence for grammar and may even demonstrate the first uses in Egypt of modified verb forms (e.g., ḥtp-H̱ nmw “may Chnum be satisfied,” a personal name dating to the reign of King Narmer, before ca. 3150 bc).8 The Egyptian writing system appears to be well developed by the reign of Den (ca. 3110–3020 bc ), when the hieroglyphic repertoire is more or less complete. The first definite example of a conjugated verb dates to the reign of King Peribsen (before ca. 2686 bc) — a past tense use of the verb, and reads d(m)ḏ.n f (“he has united”).9 Inscriptional evidence from the late Predynastic period (and even into the Early Dynastic period, 3150–2868 bc) (Shaw 2000, p. 481) often makes references to “provisions,” “taxes,” and “income.” Other objects, especially decorated ceremonial objects, express the power of the ruler through his close relationship with certain gods. Thus, the use of the script at this early stage of Egyptian history was intricately tied to the burgeoning state, functioning in administrative and ideological capacities (e.g., royal and elite status markings). In the Early Dynastic period, Egyptian hieroglyphs are used on a variety of media: labels (Catalog Nos. 69–70), sealings (Catalog Nos. 76–77), pot marks (Catalog Nos. 66–67), various funerary objects (Catalog Nos. 78–79), and other miscellaneous objects (Catalog Nos. 71–72) which bear the names and titles of kings, royal family members, and private individuals, as well as commodities with which
some of these objects were associated. Using certain components of Old Egyptian grammar (derived from inscriptions of the Old Kingdom, 2868–2160 bc) (Shaw 2000, p. 482), as well as more recent studies of Early Egyptian (Kahl 1994; idem 2001), the inscriptions on these Early Dynastic objects can be translated with some certainty.
notes
1 For more information on the various ways that King Narmer’s name was written, see Kahl 2001, p. 112.
2 Cylinder seals are attested first in Mesopotamia in the midfourth millennium bc and enter the Egyptian archaeological record thereafter (ca. 3500–3300 bc); see Honoré 2007, pp. 31–33.
3 The name of the god or goddess is usually moved forward in personal names, so although it is spelled Nἰt-ḥtp, it should be read ḥtp-Nἰt. This phenomenon is referred to as “honorific transposition.” Note, however, that most literature refers to this individual as Neith-hetep.
4 The findings at Tomb U-j are summarized in two volumes: Dreyer 1998 and Hartung 2001. The dating of Tomb U-j is determined using calibrated radiocarbon dating; see Boehmer, Dreyer, and Kromer 1993, pp. 63–68. These dates, however, have been called into question (Hendrickx 2006, p. 91). Regardless, they will be used alongside the favored, relative dates (e.g., Naqada periods) to provide a rough date with which scholars outside of Egyptology can work.
5 There has been some debate about the origins of these vessels. For instance, McGovern (2001, pp. 107–16) suggests that the inked vessels were imported from the southern Levant and processed in the Nile delta, while Porat and Goren (2002, pp. 252–70) argue that they were manufactured in Egypt. McGovern, however, has demonstrated a much stronger case for a southern Levantine origin for these vessels.
6 For the phases in the development of writing, see Senner 1989, p. 5; or Kahl 2001, pp. 116–24.
7 Although Dreyer originally read these signs as Ꜣbḏw (Abydos), they have since been correctly re-read as Ꜣbw (Elephantine) by scholars such as: Kahl 2001, p. 118; Breyer 2002, pp. 56–58; Jiménez-Serrano 2004; and Kuhlmann 2008.
8 Although some scholars believe that such names are important because they seem to be composed of grammatical features such as modified verbs, many others note that the inflection is not represented and thus the grammatical value of this inscription is limited. As a result, the potential contribution of Predynastic and Early Dynastic personal names has not yet been fully explored. The inscription mentioned in the text appears on the underside of a baboon statuette, published by Schott (1969, p. 81, fig. 5) and has been re-read here by EVM.
9 Kahl (1994, p. 84) convincingly rejects Kaplony’s (1963a, pp. 387, 395) reading of dḏ.n f (he has compiled/interpreted) in favor of d(m)ḏ.n f.

This vessel is an example of black-topped red ware, typical of the Naqada I period. It was found by Petrie at the site of Naqada in Tomb T 1426. Many other black-topped red ware vessels were also recovered from this tomb, some of which have pot marks. Seven of these vessels bear a similar mark, which closely resembles the number “ten.” This inverted U-shaped sign is very common among Naqada I pottery, and although such pot marks are
considered to be among the precursors to writing, it cannot be securely translated. The pot mark on this vessel was incised into the baked clay with a sharp point (perhaps a flint blade). evm

This sign combination is attested at least six other times on vessels from the same tomb, connecting these specific markings with the tomb of Den — perhaps denoting a particular workshop that supplied vessels for the king’s interment. Although by the reign of King Den the hieroglyphic repertoire was well established, pot marks such as these remain enigmatic. evm

This sherd was once part of a larger vessel. It bears incised marks made in the clay while it was still moist. The hieroglyphic signs represent a royal economic domain belonging to King Semerkhet: the wavy frame denotes an economic domain (an institution for the production of goods) and the serekh bears the name of Semerkhet (although fragmentary on this sherd, the king can be identified by means of parallel inscriptions; cf. fig. a). King Semerkhet was succeeded to the throne by Qaʾa, in whose tomb the sherd was found. The former’s economic domain, still functioning at the time of Qaʾa’s death, occurs on many vessels throughout the royal cemetery at Abydos, perhaps because it was supplying the contents of such vessels. The other signs are pot marks and cannot be securely translated, though the top sign resembles the kꜢ or sḫn open-armed hieroglyphs. evm

This small, square-shaped tag made of ivory, with six incised marks and a small hole drilled into the upper right corner, was found by Petrie during his excavations at the turn of the nineteenth century. Petrie attributed this object, and other tags he recovered, to the reign of Aha (ca. 3150 bc), the first king of the First Dynasty, because he found them in the vicinity of tombs dating to this time period. More recently, however, Dreyer has demonstrated that the tag probably derived from Tomb U-j (ca. 3320 bc), based on striking parallels he discovered in this tomb. The number “six,” among the earliest definite example of numbers, probably indicated a quantity of linen, which was stored in cedar boxes, to which the tags had been attached. evm

At the turn of the nineteenth century, Petrie recovered this wooden label, inscribed in red and black ink. It is darkened, perhaps by oil or smoke. The label was perforated in the upper right corner. This object demonstrates how the use of tags and labels changed from Tomb U-j to the First Dynasty. The earlier ones bore numbers and place names, while the later ones have kings’ names, titles, and economic information.
The inscription consists of the serekh of the king Djer (on the right) and the name of an economic domain (or, ḥw.t) “ḳd-ḥtp” (on the left). The other hieroglyphic signs (in the center of the label) have been the focus of much scholarly debate. They represent either a title and a personal name, or simply a personal name (sḏ-sḫm-kꜢ or swḏ-kꜢ). The individual named on this label is known to be a high official, probably an administrator of the aforementioned economic domain, who was buried at Saqqara in Tomb S 3504. evm

This weathered, double-sided ivory tag was found by Petrie’s workmen in the loose rubbish heap that had been removed from the tombs. The tag was once square shaped and probably had a hole perforating the upper right corner. The text is an “annals inscription,” which recorded special ceremonies or occurrences during a specific year of a king’s reign. It further demonstrates the evolving use of tags and labels, which at this point in time record more complex information. The obverse has three registers; the reverse further distinguishes the product to which this tag

This miniature, cylindrical vessel, which imitates larger examples with a wavy band below its lip, was found in one of the subsidiary tombs surrounding the tomb of Djer. It is made of ivory and bears the name of ḥtp-Nἰt (which can be translated as “May Neith be satisfied”). The name Hetep-Neith is often erroneously translated Neith-hotep, because the hieroglyphic sign(s) for the name of a god/goddess is typically moved before the other signs (called “honorific transposition”). The goddess Neith is not uncommon in personal names at this time; in fact, the specific name Hetep-Neith is relatively well attested in the royal cemetery of Abydos. Moreover, a Hetep-Neith buried at Naqada is believed to be the queen of Narmer and the mother of Aha. Indeed, Neith was a popular component of First Dynasty female names, especially royal family members (e.g., Meryt-Neith, the mother of Den). Although some scholars believe that such names (i.e., those pertaining to the name of a god or goddess) are important because they seem to be composed of grammatical features such as modified verbs, others note that inflection is not represented (as is the case with this object), and thus, that the
grammatical value of such an inscription is limited. However, the potential contribution of such person names to the study of early Egyptian writing still needs to be explored. evm

This object is a gray stone cylinder seal belonging to a private individual. The signs, from left to right, resemble the early emblem of the goddess Neith ( ), uncertain signs that may simply be decorative, a ram (possibly representing the god Chnum), and the word šms(.w) “follower(s).” The signs between the ram and the Neith emblem are probably just decorative, thus precluding a secure translation. The cylinder is perforated through the center.

Multiple impressions made by this cylinder seal have been recovered at the royal cemetery of Abydos. This particular sealing was found in the vicinity of tombs B.9 (Ka) and B.17 (Narmer). It bears the name of Narmer, the last ruler of Dynasty 0, who was succeeded by Aha, the first king of the First Dynasty. On the sealing, the catfish (the nʿr-sign) appears in the serekh and the triangular mr-chisel lies below. The name is repeated over and over again. King Narmer’s name has been written in different ways (e.g., sometimes, only the nʿrsign is used) and thus demonstrates that scribes were still experimenting with different layouts of hieroglyphic signs at this early period of Egyptian history. evm

This sealing was recovered by Petrie in the tomb of Aha in the royal cemetery of Abydos, although examples are also attested at Naqada and Saqqara. The impression bears the “wild animals” motif that was especially popular during the reign of Aha. Such seals have rows or dispersed arrangements of wild animals, typically caprids (e.g., antelopes or goats), and objects interpreted as hunting equipment (e.g., throwing sticks, arrows, and traps). The god known as Aker (a double-headed feline god) seems to appear also on this sealing. In contrast to Catalog No. 74, which has discernible writing, seal impressions of the early First Dynasty still sometimes bore signs that cannot be securely translated. evm

The impressions bear the names of Sab, an administrator (ʿḏ-mr) and supervisor of the magazine (ḥry wḏꜢ) of the economic domain Ḥr-sbꜢ-ẖt. Sab was buried at Saqqara in Tomb S 3111. As Anedjib ruled near the end of the First Dynasty, these impressions, like the
tags and labels, show the increasing complexity of information that inscriptions began to bear. evm

Petrie recovered numerous funerary stelae surrounding the graves of Djer and other kings of the First Dynasty at Abydos. The stelae from the subsidiary tombs within the tomb complex of Djer bear only the names of the individuals interred there. In contrast, in the reign of the next king, Djet, stelae found around his tomb bear both names and titles. This particular funerary stela has a triliteral sign (ḥtp) and the determinative of a seated woman, whose name was ḥtp(.t), Hetepet. Like
Hetep-Neith, this personal name can contribute greatly to our understanding of early Egyptian writing, as it is composed of a modified verb form. The stela, like many others Petrie found, is badly weathered. evm

riting is classically defined as a conventionalized system of visual communication representing speech. At first sight, such a definition seems to imply a clear-cut divide between writing and other systems of visual communication that convey messages without reference to speech. In practice however, the distinction may be more complex, particularly when it comes to the earliest stages of the emergence of writing. In this essay I examine aspects of the earliest Egyptian writing concentrating on its gradually increasing representation of language and speech.1 In proposing a developmental sequence for the earliest Egyptian writing, I further question the functional contexts in which the Egyptian developments take place in contrast to the roughly simultaneous, but largely different, evolutions in southern Mesopotamia. In particular, I focus on the inscribed material from the recently excavated “proto-royal” Tomb U-j which produced the as yet earliest evidence of writing in Egypt.
before and beside writing: early cultural codes of visual communication and non-linguistic marking systems
Prior to the emergence of writing proper, fourthmillennium Egypt witnessed a rich development of various, increasingly complex, types of visual communication. These included representational art (ceremonial objects, rock art, an elaborate painted tableau in an elite tomb), decorated pottery, and motifs on seals. The repertoire of graphic forms and their combining into broader compositions displays elements of conventionalization. Interpretation relied on specific cultural codes which, although largely unrecoverable to the present, would have been available to the original audiences (e.g., Graff 2009). Yet, such forms of visual communication differ from writing on

multiple levels. Crucially, they were not indexed to language: to be sure, a visual representation could always be paraphrased linguistically but such possible paraphrases were necessarily multiple ones, rather than corresponding to a single string of speech. The messages conveyed were generic ones, rather than related to any particular time, place, person, event. Visual forms were arranged according to the logic of pictorial composition, rather than following the later formal conventions of writing, such as orientation and adjustment of relative sizes of signs (see below). So-called “pot marks,”2 found in increasing numbers from the late fourth millennium onward (Catalog Nos. 64–67), stand closer to writing as far as formal aspects are concerned. They display defined, although variable, repertoires of graphic forms, combined according to specific rules. Moreover, the disposition of graphic forms defines a space of its own, different from pictorial composition. Yet, pot marks are not indexed on language either. Individual forms shared with simultaneously developing writing were associated with different values within the respective systems. Pot marks had specific identifying and marking functions and continued existing in historical times alongside fully developed writing as well as various other functionally specific non-linguistic marking systems (Andrássy, Budka, and Kammerzell 2009). Some of these visual codes, as well as a few seals immediately pre-dating Tomb U-j, feature graphic forms later found as signs of writing. It is only natural — and well documented elsewhere — that a developing script would draw on pre-existing repertoires of visual forms within a given culture.3 Such visual forms become signs of writing only when they are associated with each other and integrated into a broader system that conventionally and unequivocally relates them to a linguistic meaning on a stable, context-independent basis. The above visual codes do not qualify as “proto-writing.” Rather, they are part of a general background of multiple semiotic explorations on which writing proper would draw.

the inscribed material from tomb u-j
The first forms of emerging writing were found in the “proto-royal” Tomb U-j in the Umm el-Qaʾab cemetery, in the vicinity of This/Abydos in Upper Egypt, in the late fourth millennium.4 The period witnessed the emergence of competing regional political entities along the Nile Valley extending to Lower Nubia (e.g., Kemp 2006, pp. 60–110). Ongoing excavations in Hierakonpolis document early developments in sacred architecture, urbanism, craft specialization, and modes of elite display. The extent of the domain over which the ruler buried in Tomb U-j held sway remains difficult to assess. Long-distance trade connections are evidenced by huge quantities of a Palestinian export ware found in the tomb.5 It has been proposed that some inscriptions in the tomb may refer to remote places such as Elephantine in the far south on the one hand, possibly a sanctuary close to Buto and Bubastis in the Delta on the other. Provided the inscriptions have been correctly interpreted, such far-reaching ties to important places and sanctuaries would have been essential in establishing the regional prestige and authority of the ruler buried in Tomb U-j. Political integration of Egypt occurred only in the course of the centuries to follow. The inscribed material from Tomb U-j comprises two, perhaps three, different types of visual codes. The association with three different surfaces and modes of inscription points to different functions. Iconographic imagery on sealings elaborates upon previous traditions. Possible writing is found both in large painted forms on vessels (henceforth referred to as “dipinti”;6 figs. 6.1–2, 7), and on small incised bone tags (figs. 6.3–6). The tags have a small hole and were originally attached to goods, probably bundles of cloth as can be inferred from the particular type of numerical notations found on some of them. Inscriptions consist in short sequences of one or two signs (dipinti), or of one to four, generally two, signs (tags). Among possible writing, the inscriptions on the dipinti and on the tags have been interpreted as two different formal realizations of the same underlying system. These have been further analogized with the hieratic (cursive) and hieroglyphic (non-cursive) varieties of later Egyptian writing and it has been proposed that they would reflect a similar functional complementariness (e.g., Baines 2004, pp. 160–61).
However, the evidence, both systemic and formal, may suggest otherwise (Regulski 2008a, 2009). The overlap in signs featured in both the dipinti and on the tags is relatively limited. Only the tags may display occasional cases of phonetic representation and semantic classification (see below). Moreover, the size of the dipinti is very large and fitted to the body of the vessels on which they were painted. Their execution is detailed with at times extraordinarily elaborate realizations of internal parts of signs (fig. 6.1). The dipinti thus hardly qualify as cursive. As a result, the relation between the two types of inscriptions found in Tomb U-j differs from the relation later to obtain between hieratic and hieroglyphic varieties, and remains unclear. An interpretation of the Tomb U-j inscribed material7 builds on the contextual appreciation of the find as a whole, combined with an internal analysis of the inscriptions themselves (sign repertoires, combinations of signs). Several signs and sign combinations on the tags have been plausibly interpreted as place names, possibly the origins of the goods to which the tags were attached. The interpretation of the smaller sized corpus of the dipinti — which may

reflect a different system — remains tentative. Based on a recurring combination of a tree sign with various other signs, it has been suggested that some of the dipinti could refer to domains associated with the production or distribution of funerary goods. Based on its high relative frequency, a scorpion sign has been interpreted as standing for the ruler buried in the tomb (fig. 6.2). Overall, many signs and sign combinations remain unclear in interpretation. Actual “readings” (a few examples below) rely on the application of general principles and values of individual signs as known from later stages of writing. Only some signs, however, can be readily identified with later ones, and the whole enterprise may involve some danger of back-projection. Further difficulties arise from the small size of the corpus and its relative isolation. Moreover, the very concept of “decipherment,” while historically at the heart of the philological disciplines devoted to the study of the written record of the ancient Middle East, may be partly misleading when it comes to the earliest forms of writing. These were only incipiently adapted to (or “oriented on”) representing language, let alone speech (Baines 2004, pp. 184–85; Wengrow 2008).
the tomb u-j material as an incipient form of writing
It is difficult to assess the status of the Tomb U-j inscribed material as writing — that is, as a visual code aimed at representing language — due to persistent difficulties in interpreting, let alone “reading,” the inscriptions. It is thus advisable to begin with issues of form (Vernus 2001). Intuitively, the Tomb U-j inscriptions, particularly the tags, “look” like writing. Signs shared with later stages of Egyptian writing, while not many within the overall repertoire, suggest some continuity of development. Asymmetrical signs tend to be oriented in the same direction on a given tag, as in the later script. More significantly yet, signs are calibrated to each other, irrespective of the relative sizes of their referents: for instance, a bird sign has the same size as an elephant sign (fig. 6.3). The Tomb U-j visual code(s) may display emergent representation of language. According to the generally accepted interpretation of the material, this seems limited to names and designations, of places (sanctuaries/towns, estates) and prestigious beings (divine entities, ruler[s]). Provided the readings that have been proposed are correct, very few common words may also be found, embedded in place designations. One inscription may thus read “Mountain of Darkness” or “Western Mountain” (ḏw

grḥ: fig. 6.4). It remains unclear whether the latter type of place designations are proper names themselves or not. Although names have a particular status in language, different from common words, their visual rendition similarly relates them to a unique segment of speech. By strongly focusing on names, the Tomb U-j visual code(s) thus differ from other forms of visual communication which lend themselves to multiple paraphrases in speech. An emergent adaptation to (or “orientation on”) language may further be found in the very ways names and designations are notated. The Tomb U-j visual code(s) display clear elements of principled rules for combining signs. Per se, combinations of signs need not be grounded linguistically: non-linguistic combination of signs is characteristic of pot marks, for instance. Within Tomb U-j, similar modes of nonlinguistic juxtaposition underlie the combination of a tree sign with various other signs (figs. 6.1–2, 5). The sequence can be interpreted — if this is correct quite literally as “Plantation/Domain of X,” without reference to any particular language. In other cases however, on the tags only, two signs seem to notate a single name or designation. Such combinations may then be playing directly — even if limitedly — on the two articulations specific to language, the semantic (meaning) and the phonetic (sound). The following is based on a series of readings that have been proposed, the hypothetical nature of which cannot be over-emphasized.8

Names and designations were overwhelmingly notated through single signs, that is, through signs which, for more mature stages of writing, would be described as “logograms” (“word-signs”). In rare cases however, it seems that the interpretation of an individual sign could be further specified — and thus disambiguated — by another sign that offered some additional phonetic or semantic information. An often quoted instance of possible phonetic specification would be in the combination of a snake with a hill sign (fig. 6.4). If the proposed interpretation is correct, the snake sign would stand for its later value, a sound conventionally transcribed as ḏ, derived via the rebus principle from ḏ(wwt), a word for a snake. The presence of the snake sign would suggest a reading ḏw “mountain” for the group, as opposed to other values the hill sign may have had in other contexts. It remains unclear whether wholly phonetic notation is documented in Tomb U-j. A case in point may be a group for which a reading bꜢst “Bubastis” has been both advocated and criticized (fig. 6.6). If the reading is correct, this would be a case of reciprocal specification of two signs: their combined occurrence would indicate that neither of them is to be read according to values they had when used in other contexts. Elsewhere, specification may work on the semantic (meaning) level, in a manner akin to “determinative” signs of later periods. This may be the case in a group of an elephant and a hill sign (fig. 6.5), if to be read as Ꜣbw “Elephantine.” The hill sign would make it clear that the place name is

meant, rather than the animal, the iconic referent of the sign. Among the above “readings,” only the one proposed for “Elephantine” is supported by spellings known from historical times, while the others are not. This does not exclude them, given that historically attested spellings might have developed only later. Other interpretations, including ones based on less linguistically oriented “readings,” constitute a strong possibility. Even in a maximalistic perspective that would accept all the above readings, phonetically interpreted signs and semantically specifying ones play a very limited role only. Notation remains predominantly logographic (i.e., based on single signs). The balance between components, and thus the functional workings of the whole system, differ significantly from more mature stages of Egyptian writing. Moreover, the recourse marginally made to phonetic or semantic disambiguation — if indeed the case — may well reflect ad hoc strategies, rather than systemically entrenched “values” of these signs. Such strategies, as well as the rebus principle, pre-exist to any attempts to represent language and need not be part of a principled system. Suffice it to think of similar semiotic experimentations in contemporary text-messaging writing or in advertisements (e.g., “4U” as a rebus writing for “for you”). To be sure, it is precisely on the basis of such ad hoc explorations of the rebus principle, phoneticism, and semantic complementation that the later writing would develop, extending and systematizing their potential. In the stage witnessed by Tomb U-j however, there is no evidence that they constituted more than gradually emerging, still largely opportunistic, disambiguating strategies. The Tomb U-j inscribed material thus markedly differs from more mature stages of Egyptian writing. No connected speech was notated, and the scope of writing may have been limited to names, common words probably featuring only as components of such. These names were partly represented by emblems drawn from pre-existing modes of visual communication (fig. 6.7).9 Emblems are paralleled elsewhere as an early way of representing culturally salient names and may be integrated as a distinct subsystem into later, fully developed writing.10 While the evidence remains contingent upon archaeological findings, it seems plausible on internal grounds that the stage of development witnessed by Tomb
U-j involved only a limited inventory of signs, in accordance with the restricted functional scope just outlined. This repertoire may have been not much larger than the few dozens of signs actually attested in the extant inscriptions (Baines 2004, pp. 157–58). Other repertoires of — not necessarily linguistically oriented — signs might have been used in other functional contexts. If so, this would strongly contrast with the much higher number of signs found within a single repertoire in proto-cuneiform and reflect the very different functions of the two writings in their respective earliest attested forms. In sum, the visual codes in the Tomb U-j tags — as opposed to the dipinti whose status remains unclear — represent a very early developmental stage of writing. Both types of inscriptions, tags and dipinti, can be characterized as functionally restricted marking systems (Kammerzell 2009, p. 304). The inscriptions on the tags additionally show formal features typical of writing (Vernus 2001) and emerging orientation to language. The potential for later developments may possibly be given by exploratory phonetic and semantic disambiguation strategies.

egyptian writing as a local development
Prior to the proper scientific excavation of Tomb U-j and its publication in 1998, the earliest clear instances of Egyptian writing dated back to the late Dynasty 0 (ca. 3200–3100 bc), a few centuries later than in southern Mesopotamia. It had long been known that later fourth-millennium Egypt witnessed sustained cultural contact with southern Mesopotamia and Susiana, tokens of which are found in elements of foreign iconography on Egyptian prestige objects, the adoption of the cylinder seal, and niched brick architecture. This led to the — always controversial — hypothesis that Egyptian writing may have originated as a result of cultural influence from Mesopotamia, whether through general awareness that writing was present elsewhere, or possibly through some actual knowledge of the workings of the Mesopotamian system. The distinctively indigenous nature of the Egyptian repertoire of signs was interpreted as a case of cultural adaptation of a foreign technology to local purposes. The hypothesis of a Mesopotamian influence on the emergence of Egyptian writing was at times embedded into a broader frame arguing that the original invention of writing, conceived of as a dramatic cultural achievement, would have occurred only once in human history, subsequently to spread elsewhere.11 As to the latter issue, the decipherment of Mayan glyphs and other New World scripts, and the realization that these represent actual writing rather than pictography, now proves otherwise (e.g., Houston 2004b). Simultaneously, a more refined understanding of the working of early writing in general demonstrates that writing may develop gradually, rather than dramatically, a good case in point being, precisely, the stage witnessed by Tomb U-j. The discovery of the Tomb U-j inscribed material, predating late Dynasty 0 evidence by a century, has further recast the debate. The earliest Egyptian evidence for writing, dated by the excavator to ca. 3320 bc, 12 has now moved significantly closer to the Mesopotamian one. The crucial point, however, lies elsewhere. As argued above, the Tomb U-j inscriptions represent a typologically very early developmental stage of writing, restricted in its inventory of signs and in its scope. The focus on
names is remarkable and strongly contrasts with early Mesopotamian writing which overwhelmingly notates goods and institutions of various sorts. As further suggested by the sign forms themselves, the incipient form of writing found in the Tomb U-j inscriptions is profoundly rooted in the emblematic modes of representation more generally found in late fourth-millennium Egypt. Rather than chronological, the importance of the Tomb U-j material lies with the window it opens on the very early stages of development of an emerging writing, which can now be modeled as a local sequence. The close proximity in time and the relative proximity in space of the southern Mesopotamian and Egyptian inventions of writing remains remarkable, but is explained by taking into account the broader context. The development of the earliest Egyptian writing is contemporaneous with, and directly related to, the emergence of regional political entities and associated elites. This in turn is part of a set of complexly interrelated phenomena that simultaneously affected various parts of the ancient Near East in the later fourth millennium, partly in relation to the development of, and attempts to control, supraregional trade networks. In the context of major political and social changes affecting both southern Mesopotamia and Upper Egypt,13 the roughly simultaneous emergence of writing in the two regions is no coincidence.
the functions of the earliest egyptian writing
Writing may emerge and develop for a variety of reasons, specific to any given society.14 While protocuneiform is associated with the needs of already complex administrative structures and associated institutions of scribal training, Mayan writing shows a strong focus on ceremonial functions and elite display (see 15. The Development of Maya Writing, this volume). Against the background of these two contrasting poles, an appreciation of the functional range of the earliest Egyptian writing is made difficult by potential gaps in the archaeological evidence, almost exclusively from funerary contexts. Other possible contexts in which writing might have been used, such as settlements, often lie buried under the alluvium

or present-day towns, have been insufficiently excavated, and could have involved perishable materials (Postgate, Wang, and Wilkinson 1995). Due to the lack of direct evidence in the late fourth millennium, a general argument is sometimes made that the emergent Egyptian state must have needed writing for administrative control. This however need not have been the case. The classical image of the Egyptian bureaucratic state is based on material from considerably later times. It is also partly ideological, as in the funerary self-presentations of Old Kingdom elites. Furthermore, the situation as found in late fourth-millennium southern Mesopotamia cannot be generalized uncritically to the vastly differing Egyptian society, economy, and early state. Other parallels, such as in Mesoamerica (e.g., Inca quipus) or in fifth- and early fourth-millennium Greater Mesopotamia (e.g., Arslantepe in southern Turkey [Frangipane 2007]), illustrate how societies developing toward early state structures may well manage the level of administrative control they need by non-linguistically oriented record-keeping techniques of various sorts. Writing becomes a requisite only at a later stage. Such a stage was certainly reached in Egypt at some point no later than the early First Dynasty, but the generally limited knowledge of the Egyptian state and society of yet earlier periods makes it difficult to assess more precisely when. The Tomb U-j inscribed material itself has been interpreted as directly evidencing an administrative function of the earliest attested Egyptian writing. Both the tags and the dipinti are physically associated with goods deposited in the tomb. Moreover, some tags display numerical notations. Yet, as appealing as this line of argument may seem, a closer consideration of the evidence suggests a more nuanced picture. To begin with, the surfaces and modes of inscription point to a strong ceremonial dimension of writing in Tomb U-j. As discussed above, the dipinti hardly qualify as a cursive script, banning any conclusions drawn from the analogy with the functions of the later developing hieratic script. Furthermore, both the dipinti and the inscriptions on the tags involved a relatively time-consuming production process. The tags were first carved, then filled with paste, while the dipinti were painted with elaborate details, often in monumental size (fig. 6.1). Neither the paste fill of
the tags nor the internal details of the painted signs carried any added value in making the signs more distinctive for practical purpose. Rather, this value resided at the level of the materiality of the inscribed object itself. It has also been observed that the tags were made out of large bone plates scored into a grid (Dreyer, Hartung, and Pumpenmeier 1998, p. 137). The plates were cut along the lines of the grid only after the inscription was applied, as is shown by several cases of overlap of signs from one tag to another whenever the break was not made in the right place. The tags were thus produced in whole series in one place, rather than being attached to the goods on their various places of production, or upon the different moments of arrival of such goods in This/Abydos. This suggests that the tags were, from the very outset, designed for the tomb. The many hands that can be identified on the tags (Kahl 2001) further point to the participation of numerous individuals in rituals associated with the burial of the Tomb U-j ruler, perhaps to be viewed as enacting group identity (Wengrow 2008, p. 1027). The material aspects of the Tomb U-j inscriptions thus reflect a strong ceremonial dimension of the earliest attested Egyptian writing.15 To be sure, this is not exclusive of a utilitarian function, either within the particular context of Tomb U-j or more generally in late fourth-millennium Egypt. Numerical notations on the tags (Catalog No. 68) clearly reflect actual record-keeping practices. Similarly, the writing of names and places probably had a more mundane background in contemporary non-ceremonial marking practices. Within a proto-royal tomb such as Tomb U-j, the latter would have been transposed to a ceremonial level, through both context and material. Yet, this need not imply a utilitarian function of the earliest Egyptian writing itself. Strictly speaking, the transposition of marking practices to a ceremonial level — to which the Tomb U-j inscriptions are a witness — primarily pertains to the very marking practices themselves, and does not necessarily extend to the repertoires and systems of signs employed in such. To be sure, it is safe to assume that contemporary non-ceremonial marking practices would have shared numerical signs with the Tomb U-j tags. However, they need not have shared much else. Numerical signs stand out as a subsystem in

any writing because they do not point to words or names. As to the non-numerical inscriptions in Tomb U-j, they seem to relate mainly to a small number of culturally important names. These are marked with a limited inventory of signs, most of which are highly prestigious visual forms, partly derived from emblematic representations. The manipulation of such visual forms was no trivial thing in late fourthmillennium Egypt. In actual record-keeping functions — to the extent to which such were needed at these early times — marking would have been done by largely different sets — and possibly even systems of signs. There is no necessity,16 nor any evidence as yet — neither internal to the Tomb U-j inscriptions, nor elsewhere in the period — that such contemporary utilitarian marking practices should have begun representing language, thus qualifying as incipient writing.
subsequent developments
Written evidence becomes more abundant in late Dynasty 0/early First Dynasty (ca. 3200–3000 bc), roughly one century after Tomb U-j. While keeping a strong focus on names (e.g., fig. 6.8; Catalog Nos. 7172, 74, 78), writing expanded from its initially highly restricted functions to other domains.17 On ceremonial objects (palettes, mace-heads, ceremonial tags) writing was used to complement
pictorial compositions (Baines 1989). The latter remain predominant on such objects, expressing generic ideological archetypes associated with kingship. Writing allowed these visual representations to be secondarily related to the singular identity of a specific king, as well as, when place names are featured, possibly to a particular event (Vernus 1993). At the same period, written signs rapidly evolve toward distinctively “hieroglyphic” forms (fig. 6.8; Regulski 2010), while pictorial conventions of representation were established, many of which would be defining of Egyptian visual culture and remain remarkably stable throughout later history. Writing thus developed as one component of Egyptian centrally driven formal culture. Standing alone, writing is found on seals, funerary vessels, private funerary stelae, and in offering lists. So-called “taxation marks” from late Dynasty 0 to the mid-First Dynasty have been reinterpreted as reflecting largely ritual dimensions of funerary economy, rather than narrowly utilitarian purposes (Kahl 1995). In its conspicuous usage on seals (Catalog Nos. 76–77; Kaplony 1963c; Pätznick 2005) — contrasting with Mesopotamia where seals remained largely uninscribed at this period — writing was associated with marking functions that could be both utilitarian and prestige bound, depending on the type of seals and contexts of sealing practices. References to written administration are found from the mid-First Dynasty (ca. 3000 bc) onward, as well as indirectly, with the

appearance of a hieroglyphic sign depicting a papyrus scroll (reign of Qaʾa, end of First Dynasty [Kahl 1994, p. 36]). During the Second Dynasty, increasing cursiveness of ink-drawn signs and the development of consistent modes of abbreviating signs — such as emphasizing the distinctive visual features of the object depicted — similarly point to a widening range of usages of writing. These developments may be described as the earliest stages of hieratic proper — as opposed to ink-written signs found already in late Dynasty 0, which are mere painted versions of hieroglyphs (Regulski 2009). While extending its functional range, writing came to represent ever more aspects of language. Besides royal and geographical names, it notated private names and an increasingly large variety of words. The latter notably included titles, administrative entities, and commodities (Catalog Nos. 70, 7677). Simultaneously, writing tended toward increased autonomy from the material surface on which it was inscribed. In a first stage, isolated names or entities stood in exclusive relation to non-written elements, such as the object they were written on and/or pictorial compositions they were embedded in. In a second stage, names or entities were directly associated with each other, in inscriptions on seals, in lists (of titles, of offerings, probably also in administrative usage), and in more elaborate captions to pictorial scenes. Within the latter, verbs are significantly found in the infinitive only, rather than in a conjugated present or past tense. Complete clauses with predicative forms are found from the late Second Dynasty onward, initially in the context of expressing the relation of the king to the gods. Continuous texts appear only with the Old Kingdom, bundling individual clauses into cohesive written discourse. As a result of the above developments toward higher textual integration, the meaning of written messages became increasingly less dependent upon extra-linguistic frames of interpretation associated with their context of inscription. The system itself underwent profound changes with gradually augmenting recourse made to strategies for secondarily specifying the readings of individual signs. Such strategies involve both phonetic and semantic complementation (“determinatives”), increasingly on a regular and systemic basis (Kahl 1994, 2001). A near complete set of signs representing
the consonantal phonemes of the Egyptian language is attested by the early/mid-First Dynasty (ca. 31003000 bc). A large set of signs representing discontinuous sequences of two consonantal phonemes (so-called “biliterals”) is developed before the Third Dynasty (ca. 2750 bc). Such values are derived by the rebus principle, now fully productive. Phonetically interpreted signs are used both in purely phonetic notations and, increasingly, for complementing otherwise notated words. Various strategies for semantic (meaning) specification are developed. These include both determinatives specific to one word and more generic ones that could be applied to a whole class of words. Double semantic complementation of a word by both a specific and a generic determinative is found by the Third Dynasty. As a result of the above developments, solely logographical notations, while still prominent, increasingly give way to more explicit writings of words through multiple signs. The overall number of signs dramatically increases to about a thousand, a figure comparable with protocuneiform. The strong development of the phonetic component in notation and complementation is striking and becomes even more so when compared to the still predominantly logographic modes of notation found in contemporary Mesopotamia. At a general level, this contrast reflects two different possible trajectories in script evolution. The written representation of grammatical morphemes was extremely slow to emerge in both areas and did not play any significant role in the rapid phoneticization of the early Egyptian writing. It remains unclear whether the latter process is to be related to the particular morphological structure of Egyptian, with its salient consonantal root morphemes. To some extant, it may be related however to the distinctive focus of the earliest Egyptian writing on personal names. Names have a special status within any language because their referent is an individual, rather than a class of entities with particular semantic features potentially exploitable for written representation. While names found in Tomb U-j, mostly prestigious ones, could still largely be represented emblematically (fig. 6.2), the extension of writing to a wide range of personal names from late Dynasty 0 onward could have been one favorable locus for the phoneticization of the early Egyptian writing. Some names are clauses,

each word of which could be notated logographically (Catalog No. 71). Other names, however, have no particular linguistic meaning and are rendered purely phonetically (fig. 6.9). The development of determinatives is also interpreted as a response to the widening functional ranges of writing. With more words being written, the need for disambiguation, both phonetic and semantic, increases. Determinatives, which stand at the end of a given word, further contribute to signalling word boundaries. With the extension of writing to continuous sequences of speech, this secondary function of determinatives becomes important. As the relative chronology of development suggests, the rise of determinatives may also have been an indirect consequence of increased phoneticism. Ambiguity and thus the need for further specification — may be higher in solely phonetic notations, as opposed to such containing a logogram, dedicated to one, or very few, specific word(s). Furthermore, while a logogram immediately indicates the word boundary (the latter being identical with the sign itself), phonetic notations use multiple non-specific signs for representing one word, with the effect that word boundaries are not given a priori any more.
Egyptian writing at the beginning of the Old Kingdom (ca. 2650 bc; Schweitzer 2005, pp. 21–98) represented language in both its phonetic and semantic articulations. As a result of the complementary developments toward strong phonetic and semantic complementation as outlined above, one-sign notations of words had receded dramatically. Solely logographic notations, as well as purely phonetic ones without any semantic complementation, were mostly confined to high frequency items, such as core vocabulary and some grammatical words, as well as to predictable contexts, such as in sequences of titles. By and large, Egyptian writing had moved by the mid-third millennium to notations in which semantic and phonetic information, both incomplete, complemented each other to indicate the accurate reading. The particular balance between phonetic and semantic components allowed for the remarkable variability of spellings found in mature hieroglyphic writing. These developments strongly contrast with mid-third-millennium cuneiform which used complementation strategies only in a more limited way and remained predominantly logographic at the time.
conclusion
The Tomb U-j inscriptions offer a rare view of a typologically extremely early developmental stage of writing. Based on internal analysis, this may be described as a marking system with a highly restricted scope of application. It displayed formal features typical of later writing and emergent representation of language. The latter occurred in relation to notating names, which point to a singular referent. The probably limited inventory of signs, as well as the strong, perhaps exclusive, focus on names, stand in a stark contrast with contemporary proto-cuneiform. Egyptian writing thus emerged as a local development, rooted in late prehistoric visual culture, notably in emblematic modes of representation. As far as current evidence goes, the motivation for the earliest development of Egyptian writing would have revolved around marking, prestige, and ceremonial functions associated with the nascent kingship. Administrative needs need not have been a prime motivating factor and were possibly initially

managed by other, non-linguistically oriented, marking systems. The focus on names kept for some time after Tomb U-j may have played a role in the early and thorough phoneticization of Egyptian writing. This in turn may have been instrumental in the increasing recourse made to semantic complementation, leading to a remarkably complex system of determinatives. The early Egyptian and contemporary cuneiform writings thus followed significantly different paths of development. Yet later, writing was extended to notate continuous strings of words and clauses, leading to an increasing alignment of written messages with actual speech. In the past, Western semiotics — reaching back to Aristotle who was thinking within the cultural horizon of Greek alphabetic script — have tended to view writing exclusively in terms of its function of representing speech, i.e., as a secondary code, as “speech made visible.” The Egyptian material contributes to a more differentiated perspective on early writing, one that is less strongly pre-defined by what is known from later developments.18 Written messages only gradually gained autonomy from non-linguistic frames of interpretation. Full orientation of writing on speech was a process that took almost a millennium to be completed.

7. Egyptian HiEroglypHic Writing

E
gyptian is an Afroasiatic language that is distantly related to Semitic languages (e.g., Arabic, Hebrew, Akkadian) and many African languages (e.g., Berber, Cushitic, Chadic). Egyptian shares many things with these languages. One shared trait had a major influence on the Egyptian writing system — the root system. Most words consist of two or three consonants; the vowels changed depending on the form of the word being used (noun vs. verb, singular vs. plural, past tense vs. present tense, etc.). This led to use of a writing system that (like Arabic and Hebrew) wrote only the consonants, which were consistent among all the forms of the word, not the vowels, which changed from form to form (a native speaker of the language would have known which vowels to use with which forms, so there would not have been any confusion). The earliest Egyptian writing may have written words by drawing a picture of the item involved. Each hieroglyph is a picture of a real object from daily life. But it is impossible to write some words in such a system (how do you draw a picture of “love” or “faith” as opposed to “man” or “house”?), and it is very hard to write complete sentences. Thus, the Egyptians employed the rebus principle: One can write a word using a picture of something that has the same sound. A classic example in English is drawing a (honey)bee followed by a leaf from a tree to write the word “be
lief.” Thus, in Egyptian, a picture of a mouth á (phonetic r) could be used to write the preposition “to, at, against” (also phonetic r), or the floor plan of a simple house L (phonetic pr) could be used to write the verb “to go (up)” (also phonetic pr). Since, as noted, the consontal root was so important in Egyptian, only the consonants needed to be the same, not the vowels, for one picture to represent an unrelated word. Thus, many signs developed a phonetic meaning/usage derived from, but distinct from, their pictorial meaning. Such phonograms may represent one (e.g., r), two (e.g., pr), or three consonants. (Such phonograms are frequently referred to as uniliteral, biliteral, and triliteral signs; fig. 7.1.) The Egyptians
did develop what modern scholars refer to as an alphabet, a group of twenty-four uniliteral phonetic signs representing each letter of the Egyptian phonetic inventory (see table 9.2 below). But the classic Egyptian scripts, based on hieroglyphs, never restricted themselves to using only alphabetic, or even only phonetic, signs. Rather, the writing system used a combination of both ideograms (or logo
grams) (e.g., á as “mouth” or L as “house”) and
phonograms (e.g., á for the sound/letter r or L for the sound/letter combination pr) in combination with what modern scholars call “determinatives” (or semagrams) — signs used to indicate the general category to which a word belongs (e.g., L used as a “determinative” after many words indicating types of structures, from huts to palaces). Biliteral and triliteral signs were frequently accompanied by one or more uniliteral “phonetic complements” reiterating the phonetic structure of the word. For example,
Lá ́ pr “to go (up)” uses the biliteral pr followed by a uniliteral phonetic complement r and a “walking legs” determinative indicating that this word is a verb indicating motion or movement. When a sign was being used with its logographic meaning (and without phonetic complements), it was normally accompanied by a stroke (e.g., L » “house”) where the stroke said “take me literally.” Although in theory every hieroglyphic sign could be used in all of these ways, in actuality pr is one of the few which is so used regularly; most signs were restricted to one or two of the three functions of logogram, phonogram, determinative.

The earliest and most characteristic Egyptian script is hieroglyphs, a term derived from the Greek ἱερογλυφική “of sacred carving,” reflecting the use of hieroglyphs on temple and tomb walls, stelae, statues, and other monumental inscriptions. The Egyptians themselves referred to this script as mdw nṯr “words of the god,” believing that the god Thoth invented writing (see 5. The Conception and Development of the Egyptian Writing System, this volume). Other scripts described as “hieroglyphic” are known, among them Luwian, Chinese, and Mayan (see 13. Anatolian Hieroglyphic Writing, 14. The Beginnings of Writing in China, and 15. The Development of Maya Writing, this volume), but the systems are completely unrelated, and they developed in isolation from each other. The earliest hieroglyphic texts appear about 3320 bc; the latest dated hieroglyphic inscription comes from ad 394. The brief texts from the predynastic Tomb U-j at Abydos already employ signs for
their phonetic values. For example, a tag (see fig. 6.4) is marked with a bird (known from later periods to have the phonetic value bꜢ) and the chair/throne sign (phonetic st); this combination has been interpreted as the writing of the geographic location Bubastis (BꜢst). The complexity of the earliest texts has led some scholars to propose that Egyptian was the result of a “single invention” rather than a gradual development (Parkinson 1999, p. 73). Others, however, assume that the earlier stages of the script have simply not survived. Egyptian hieroglyphs were, as noted, used in monumental and ceremonial contexts, including religious papyri and tomb furnishings. Hieroglyphs served as part of the decoration of such monuments and could be written in columns or rows and could face either right or left (the front of the hieroglyph would point toward the beginning of the inscription). This flexibility is especially noticeable on doorways where an inscription may start in the middle over the doorway and flow out and down in both directions (fig. 7.2). An inscription accompanying a human being or deity would face in the same direction as the human or deity. There is no space left between words or sentences, although the determinatives found at the end of most words do effectively mark word boundaries. Signs were arranged in square or rectangular groups rather than simply being strung
out one after the other (e.g., áL  ́ where the pr-sign is written over the r); signs are read from top to bottom and from front to back. The placement of individual signs may be transposed for aesthetic reasons (to avoid gaps) or for honorific reasons. For example, in personal names that incorporate the name of a god, the divine name may be written before the other phonetic elements (fig. 7.3). The interaction between

There were several hundred signs in regular use until the Ptolemaic period (fourth–first century bc), when a large number of new signs were developed. Most signs appear in their classic shape already in the Old Kingdom and show little modification in their form through time. Because hieroglyphs can be elaborate images that are time-consuming to execute (fig. 7.4), the more cursive, and more rapidly written hieratic and Demotic scripts were usually used for economic, legal, and administrative documents, literary texts, and letters.

Because hieroglyphs are not abstract signs but actual images of objects, there can be ambiguity about whether a sign is being used for its phonetic value, for the image it portrays, or for a combination of both functions. For example, a small figure of a man or woman normally follows the writing of a person’s name indicating that the word is a person’s name. On this stela, the large standing figures of the man and his wife serve two functions:
as oversized hieroglyphs that normally follow their names and simultaneously as a representation of the couple. The hieroglyphic writing system could be highly efficient. The images of offerings in front of the man — a foreleg, ribs, and head of a calf, five beer jars in a rack, two baskets, a shallow tray with bread(?), and two tall wine jars in stands — all have more extended phonetic spellings, but here, only the image of what is portrayed was used, blurring the line between phonetic writing and picture writing. The artistic aspect of hieroglyphs is illustrated by the use of pigment on this stela. The small hieroglyphs of men and of men’s faces in profile or frontal view are highly detailed in dark red and black, dark red being the color used for men’s skin. In the third column from the right, the

small hieroglyphs of a seated man and woman are colored red and yellow respectively, just like the large figures of the man and his wife. The word for “bread loaf ” is always yellow and the beer jar sign is dark red in imitation of their true color. Otherwise the red, yellow, and black pigments seem to alternate decoratively among the signs. Hieroglyphs can be written from left to right or right to left. Their orientation is related to larger-scale figures to whom the text refers. On this stela, the man and his wife face right, and so all the hieroglyphs also face to the right. In this arrangement, the text is read from right to left, starting with the horizontal line at the top of the stela and then continuing with the right-hand vertical column. The text that begins in the fifth row from the right demonstrates the potency of the written
word. It implores visitors to the tomb to leave food, but, if they have nothing, to give bread, beer, cattle, and fowl and “every good thing” by the simple act of reciting the names of those provisions. This type of prayer, which transformed written text into actual food for the deceased, is called a “voice offering.” These voice offerings are a common feature of funerary stelae, even though it is unlikely that a visitor could actually read the text (the literacy rate has been estimated at about 1–3 percent of the population). Yet the text had such effectiveness that its appearance on the stela guaranteed funerary provisions for the deceased. et

The close relation between hieroglyphic writing and art is evidenced in the interrelation of the orientation of signs and figures in scenes. In the orientation of Egyptian writing, asymmetrical signs (such as animate beings) face the beginning of the line, looking against the flow of reading (see 13. Anatolian Hieroglyphic Writing and 15. The Development of Maya Writing, this volume, for similar phenomena in those systems). The most common orientation of the script is reading from right to left, with asymmetrical signs thus facing right. Any accompanying figures would likewise be mainly oriented to the right.
Very often, however, signs and figures can face to the left. The rules presiding over this orientation are multiple, at times in relatively complex interaction (Fischer 1977). In the case of a caption to a scene, the figures and the signs usually share the same orientation, but there are exceptions. For example, in Old Kingdom offering lists, the hieroglyphs usually face the person for whom the offerings are intended. Additional subtleties result from principles of harmonic composition.
The orientation of signs is further adapted to their architectural setting. For example, when a text is inscribed on the jambs of a false door, signs on opposite doorjambs will face each other to create a symmetrical composition. An example of such symmetry is found on the false door stela of nisuredi. Remarkably, however, while the general principle is at work on the outer doorjambs, deviations can be observed on the inner doorjambs of the same monument. On the upper part of the inner left doorjamb, the sign for s is oriented to the left À, but at the bottom of that text, it is in reverse orientation: À . similarly, on the right inner doorjamb, the group a J∑ “craftsmen” is written from right to the left, rather than J∑a as would be expected from the left to right orientation of the remainder of the column. The “correct” left to right arrangement of signs of this same title can be seen on the horizontal line.
such examples, as well as many others, show how far the visual relation between hieroglyphic signs and pictorial representation were consciously exploited and deliberately composed in the monumental sphere. jsp

7. Egyptian HiEroglypHic Writing
Due to their iconic nature, hieroglyphic signs not only represent language, they also carry power of their own. This dimension is alluded to in an inscription on a panel from the early Fourth Dynasty mastaba of nefermaat in Meidum, now housed in the Oriental Institute Museum. This inscription makes a remarkable statement about the status of hieroglyphic writing in the Old Kingdom.
swt ir nt≤rwÚf m sš n zinÚf
He (nefermaat) is the one who made his gods (i.e., hieroglyphs) in writing that cannot be erased.a
The designation nt ≤rw “gods” for the signs engraved bears witness to the close relationship between writing and the sacred sphere, especially in the funerary context. note that the designation of signs by nt≤rw alone is rare: the usual term is mdw-nt ≤r “godly words,” referring to both uttered words and words in hieroglyphic writing, as well as to texts written in this script. As nefermaat’s inscription makes explicit reference to, signs of hieroglyphic writing had power of their own, beyond their basic function of mirroring speech. Developing just one specific example, some signs could not be used in particular contexts during the Old Kingdom. The sign representing the solar disk % is used to write the name of the solar god Ra, Ra, among other things. As such, it is found in Old Kingdom theophoric royal names (royal names incorporating a divine element), for instance, in the name of the Fifth Dynasty king S|h≥w-Ra, sahura. Remarkably, however, the very same sign is systematically avoided in non-royal theophoric names. In these, the sun sign is replaced by a phonetic writing of the god Ra: r (the mouth sign) + a (the arm sign). Consider for instance the name of the Fifth Dynasty official Wr-ra, Werra. In Old Kingdom theophoric names, the use of the solar disk thus appears to have been restricted to royal names only (Fischer 1986). jsp
note
a “Erasing” refers to the phenomenon of tomb usurpation. Re-use of extant elite tombs by later officials is well documented in the Old Kingdom. In nefermaat’s mastaba, the reliefs are deeply carved and filled with a color paste, protecting them against any attempts at destruction or usurpation.

I
n ancient Egypt writing was more than a means of communication because the written word had the power to create what was recorded. For example, the written reference to food offerings on a mortuary stela (see Catalog No. 80) ensured that those provisions would be provided for the deceased forever, and the written reference to a person’s name ensured that individual’s eternal existence in the afterlife. The connection between the writing of a person’s name (or even the name of a god) and their existence is demonstrated by occasions where, for often unknown reasons, their name has been chiseled out or erased, thereby “killing” that individual. In a similar way, the identity of a statue could be altered by changing the name incised on it without recarving the facial features. In some contexts, signs of animals

that might bite, sting, or consume funerary offerings were considered to be dangerous. When these signs appear in texts on coffins or on tomb walls, they are sometimes mutilated by knives or shown cut in two to render them powerless. et
Writing in Egypt was considered to have such power that it could transcend the realm of the living and the dead. Just as one might write to someone who was physically not present, writing was used to communicate with the dead. These “letters to the dead” are in the form of quasi-legal appeals from the living to the dead asking them to intercede on their behalf with the tribunal of the gods in the realm of the dead, or to appeal to dead relatives or acquaintances to stop harming the living from the beyond. Most of these letters are written on pottery vessels that were left in the tomb chapel of the recipient. This example is written on a jar stand that would have supported a dish of food to attract

Egyptian protective texts were thought to be far more than invocations — they were so potent that they were capable of effecting cures. This statue, which portrays the young god Horus standing on crocodiles, grasping and immobilizing dangerous creatures, symbolizes his ability to control wild and evil influences. The sides, back, and base of the statue are incised with hieroglyphic texts that refer to divine protection against crocodiles and other threatening creatures. Just as Horus the Child triumphed against the wild animals, the texts could heal the sting and bite of wild animals. The power of the texts was transferred to the sufferer by pouring water over the statuette, thereby activating the liquid through contact with the words. The water was then drunk by the sufferer. et

ieratic is a cursive script that was most commonly written with a reed brush and ink on either papyrus or ostraca (pieces of pottery and stone). Examples of hieratic written in ink have also been found on cloth, leather, and wood; however, few such examples have been preserved. Hieratic was even written using a stylus on mud tablets (dated to the Old Kingdom, ca. twenty-third century bc) and a carved version of the script (known as “lapidary hieratic”) is frequently found in graffiti at sites such as quarries and along trade routes. The term “hieratic” comes from the Greek expression grammata hieratika, “priestly writings,” which was coined by Saint Clement of Alexandria in the second century ad to describe the cursive script used for ancient Egyptian religious texts at the time. Hieratic, however, was not exclusively used during the Greco-Roman period for religious compositions. Hieratic texts are some of the earliest-attested documents in ancient Egypt (ca. 3200 bc) and provide some of the most important socioeconomic and cultural information about Egyptian society. Contrary to Saint Clement’s characterization of the script, hieratic documents include not only religious texts, but also literary, medical, mathematical, administrative, and legal texts. Many of the famous literary tales known from ancient Egypt have been preserved on papyrus in hieratic. The cursive nature of hieratic is what makes the script most notable. After dipping his brush in ink, a scribe would have been able to write several signs before having to re-dip for more ink. As a result of this technique, signs were frequently joined together and at first glance do not appear to resemble hieroglyphs. Hieratic was always written from right to left, as opposed to hieroglyphs, which could be written in either direction, and like hieroglyphs was written in either vertical columns or horizontal lines. Differences in the script’s paleography — how a text was written as exemplified by the scribe’s handwriting and the shapes of different signs — allow Egyptologists to date hieratic documents solely by
the script. Egyptologists are even able to tell what kind of document a text is without reading it because there are distinct differences in the handwriting between literary and administrative documents. Although the signs used in hieratic do correspond to most of the same shapes used in hieroglyphs, the script is neither a derivative nor an abbreviation of hieroglyphs. Despite the similarities, there is not a one-to-one correspondence in signs and writing between the two scripts. Hieratic even has some signs that are not found in hieroglyphs. Egyptian scribes were capable of using both scripts and most hieroglyphic inscriptions in formal contexts like temple or tomb walls were originally drafted in hieratic and then adapted into hieroglyphs. Hieratic texts are frequently transcribed into hieroglyphs for the convenience of modern Egyptologists, but differences in spelling, sign usage, and even the presence of a type of punctuation mark demonstrate that Egyptian scribes did not translate between the two scripts when they were writing. Instead, Egyptian scribes were able to use both scripts independently. The appearance of hieroglyphs in about 3320 bc is seen as the beginning of writing in ancient Egypt, but hieratic is actually found soon after the first hieroglyphic inscription. Both scripts are found among the earliest examples of writing in ancient Egypt during Dynasty 0. The appearance of hieratic so early suggests that it was not a later adaptation of hieroglyphs but was developed alongside it. These early inscriptions were very brief and are found on vessels from burials. Typically they list only royal names and information about the contents of the vessels, frequently the place of origin. The first hieratic inscription, dating to about 3200 bc, is the royal name Scorpion from the site of Tarkhan, just south of Cairo. Examples of hieratic continue to be found throughout the Early Dynastic period (ca. 3000–2680 bc), when the first examples of monumental hieroglyphs — inscriptions appearing on large structures and objects, such as tombs, stelae, and statues — appear. The importance of writing, the use of papyrus, and

the importance of scribes even in early Egyptian history is illustrated by the inclusion of a roll of blank papyrus among the burial goods in the Early Dynastic tomb of the seal-bearer Hemaka at Saqqara. Throughout the following millennia of Egyptian history, hieratic underwent a dramatic series of changes — the scripts of later pharaonic periods bear little resemblance to the earliest attestations of hieratic. Despite these changes, hieratic always remained an important part of a scribe’s training and Egyptian writing. Hieratic even seems to have influenced hieroglyphs at different points in Egyptian history; some of the changing forms of Egyptian hieroglyphs reflect the hieratic script.
The longevity of the script demonstrates the important role it played in the written tradition of ancient Egypt. Hieratic texts are among the earliest examples of Egyptian writing and the script continued to be used throughout all ancient Egyptian history. Even after the advent of Demotic in the Late Period (seventh century bc), hieratic continued to be used for administrative and religious texts into the third century ad. Perhaps most illustrative of the importance of hieratic is the fact that the hieroglyphic sign used to represent the word “scribe” is a scribal palette with the inkwells and reed brush needed to write hieratic.

83. Hieratic text: PaPyrus Gardiner iii
Papyrus, ink

Gift of Alan H. Gardiner, 1933

This papyrus contains three sections of a series of funerary texts known as the Coffin Texts. Ancient Egyptian religious texts were frequently written in the hieratic script, as is the case here. The division of the papyrus into three sections is clearly indicated by long black vertical lines, with each section containing a different funerary spell. The handwriting of the scribe is very clear and legible and is not as cursive as the hieratic
script that people typically associate with papyri. Hieratic becomes more cursive over time and texts such as Papyrus Gardiner III, which dates relatively early in Egyptian history, are key sources in our understanding of how the script developed and changed over time. Nevertheless, despite the fact that some of the signs look very similar to hieroglyphs at first glance, there are a large number of joined (ligatured) signs and clear cursive forms. For example, there are almost no obvious animal or human signs on the papyrus even though they are present — all these forms become abbreviated and abstract in hieratic making them less recognizable than hieroglyphs. As can be seen on the papyrus, the scribe was clearly conscious of the amount of space he used when writing. Through careful examination

of the papyrus, the order in which the papyrus was written can be reconstructed. The double horizontal lines at the top and bottom of the papyrus were inked first, then the dividing lines between the sections were added, and finally the hieratic text was written last. At the beginning of each of the three sections, and in the two horizontal lines in the central section of the papyrus, one can see that the scribe began writing carefully in order to conserve space — his handwriting is smaller and he leaves very little space between signs. Toward the end of each section, when it became clear that he was not going to run out of space, the signs become larger and more space is left between them in order to avoid large gaps in the columns on the papyrus. The central section of this papyrus demonstrates a common trait of hieratic religious texts which is less frequently found in hieroglyphic texts. The section is divided into two series of very short vertical columns, with a long horizontal line of text below each. When reading the papyrus, the horizontal line is to be repeated after each short vertical column — essentially marking a refrain. Both horizontal lines contain the same content, stating the primary purpose and importance of the central spell: allowing the deceased to identify and associate himself with a variety of different divinities. As the text in the horizontal lines states, “the eye of Horus appears as me and I appear as the eye of Horus. I am it and it is I.” The scribe wrote the portion of the text in this manner in order to avoid having to recopy the horizontal lines multiple times and save space on the papyrus. Writing in this manner was not just convenient for the scribe but was also an economic decision, as papyrus was rather expensive.
The texts written on the papyrus are part of a large corpus of funerary literature known as the Coffin Texts. Individual entries are called “spells” or “chapters,” and this section of Papyrus Gardiner III has three spells on it (CT 942–944). The texts are best known from the large number of Middle Kingdom coffins that are decorated with funerary offerings and funerary texts. The title “Coffin Texts” is not an ancient Egyptian title, but a term used by Egyptologists to refer to the entire corpus of funerary literature of this period of Egyptian history. Coffin Texts are also found, however, in tombs, on stelae and other burial equipment, and on papyrus. The Coffin Texts are first attested in the First Intermediate Period (ca. 2160–2055 bc) and are best known in the Middle Kingdom (ca. 2055–1650 bc), predating the well-known Book of the Dead. Funerary texts were an important part of Egyptian religion and burial equipment because they not only provided information about the afterlife, but also contained knowledge that the deceased would need after death. The Coffin Texts are of particular importance because they provide some of the first examples of funerary texts and literature intended for non-royal individuals. Although the provenance and owner of this papyrus are unknown (the owner’s name is not preserved), the paleography, vocabulary, spelling, and grammar of the text, along with the text’s layout, provide enough information to assign a date to the papyrus. keb

Hieroglyphs were generally used on temple walls, coffins, stelae, statues, and on some religious papyri, while cursive hieratic was usually used for administrative and literary functions and for religious texts on papyrus. This section of a Book of the Dead for a man named Ny-sw-ShuTefnut employs both scripts. On this document, hieroglyphs serve as captions to large-scale figurative scenes, such as that shown here, while hieratic is used for almost all the spells themselves and to caption smaller images. Many other contemporary Books of the Dead show this same patterning of hieratic and hieroglyphic writing, suggesting that the large figures were considered to be more formal, akin to scenes on temple walls, and thus were narrated by hieroglyphs, whereas the texts were literary and more appropriate for hieratic.
Presumably a team of artisans worked on this papyrus; a scribe who wrote the hieratic text, an artist who drew the images, and possibly a second scribe who added the hieroglyphs. Apparently, there was variation in how such teams worked. The vignettes (pictures that accompany the text) on Papyrus Ryerson were apparently done first, for the text in some areas is crowded into the available space. An unfinished Book of the Dead of Nespasef (in the Metropolitan Museum of Art) shows a different pattern. On that document, the hieratic spells were completed and spaces were ruled off for illustrations that were never inserted, one area bearing the notation “add the prescribed images.” Other features of the interaction of scribe and artist are observable on Papyrus Ryerson. The scribe who added the texts failed to place them by the relevant vignette, consistently being one or two spells off from the expected alignment of text and image. The section of Papyrus Ryerson shown here that portrays the weighing of the heart shows further lack of coordination between artist and scribe, for although the vignette was completed, Ny-sw-Shu-Tefnut’s name was not inserted into the image as would be expected. In the hieroglyphic text above the scale, the deceased is referred to vaguely as “the Osiris” rather than “the Osiris

emotic is the name of the most cursive script developed by the ancient Egyptians. The term “Demotic” comes from Greek δημοτικά “popular,” first used by Herodotus (fifth century bc) to distinguish this script from the “sacred” hieratic and hieroglyphic scripts. The Egyptians themselves referred to Demotic as sẖ n šʿ.t “letter” or “document writing.” Demotic came into use about 650 bc for writing contracts and administrative documents. By the Ptolemaic period (332–30 bc), it was also being used to write literary, scientific, and religious texts. Although many Egyptians learned to read and write Greek, and senior-level administration was carried out in Greek, both Egyptian and Greek were used for legal, literary, and religious texts throughout the Ptolemaic period. After Egypt was incorporated into the Roman empire, it became necessary to write legal documents in Greek, the language used in the administration, not Demotic. But Demotic literary and religious texts were being written and copied into the third century of our era. The latest-dated Demotic text is a graffito left at the Isis temple at Philae dated December 11, ad 452. Historically, Demotic developed from hieratic and, like hieratic, was written from right to left. Most Demotic texts were written in ink using a brush (or, later, reed) on papyrus or ostraca (potsherds or flakes of limestone). More formal documents, documents intended to have a longer life-span, were normally written on papyrus. In addition to the common use of papyrus and ostraca, Demotic inscriptions were occasionally written on wood, linen, and other materials; when a Demotic inscription was carved in stone or metal, the script became much more angular and the orthography was occasionally simplified (for an example of Demotic carved in stone, see the Demotic section of the Rosetta Stone, fig. 9.1). Demotic used both ideographic signs, including determinatives (see table 9.1), and phonetic signs, including a series of uniliteral or “alphabetic” signs (see table 7.1 above). Examples of the combination of signs found in words in Catalog No. 85 include ἰnḥ
“courtyard” (line 3 of text D), which begins (at the right) with phonetic ἰ, then has a biliteral ἰn followed by an ḥ (third sign from right), and house determinative (the pair of signs at the left end); and ʿnḫ “oath” (line 7 of text E), which begins (at the right) with phonetic ʿ (the first two signs at the right) followed by a stroke and ḫ (large round sign in middle) and man-with-hand-to-mouth determinative (the tall sign near the left end). Foreign words, including foreign names, were normally written using the alphabetic/uniliteral signs, as in the writing of the name of Alexander (the Great) (line 1 in text A), where the signs are, in order from right to left, the beginning of a cartouche (used to mark a royal name), Ꜣ, r, g, s, Ꜣ, n, t, r, and s followed

by the ending of the cartouche and the abbreviation ʿ w s for ʿnḫ wḏ̣ Ꜣ snb “may he live, be prosperous and healthy”). Egyptian names involve the same kind of ligatures (combining two or more individual signs into one) as other Egyptian words, for example, PꜢtἰ-nꜢ-nṯr.w “The Man Whom the Gods Gave” , which begins (on the right) with a ligature for the definite article pꜢ, a vertical stroke used here (and in names in general) for the verb tἰ “to give,” a ligatured writing of the plural definite article nꜢ, a ligature of the noun nṯr.w “gods,” a ligature of plural strokes, and the final dot (on the far left) used by this scribe to mark personal names. This name is a rather generic variant on a very common type of name in which the name of a particular god is used, for example, PꜢ-tἰWsἰr “The Man Whom Osiris Gave.” The traditional or historic writing of a word in earlier scripts formed the original basis for the writing in Demotic, which thus reflected historic orthography, not contemporary pronunciation. But Demotic soon developed its own orthographic conventions, distinct from those of hieratic. Through time, the number and extent of ligatures increased greatly, and, by the Ptolemaic period, the hieratic origin of the Demotic script is no longer clear in the Demotic. As an extreme example of the ligatures and cursiveness of Demotic, one can compare the Demotic word rmṯ “man” (Catalog No. 85, line 2 of text A), with its
ultimate hieroglyphic ancestor !Åá. By the Roman period, scribes frequently added phonetic (usually alphabetic) signs to earlier conventional spellings or replaced conventional historic spellings with “alphabetic” ones, as if they were indicating (changes in) pronunciation or providing phonetic aids to help in recognizing non-obvious word groups or ligatures. Scribes seem to have learned to read and write by memorizing words as units. There are distinctions in orthography and paleography that have been attributed to local scribal “schools” (e.g., Memphite vs. Theban), to differences in textual genres (e.g., literary vs. administrative vs. private), and to the skill and care of individual scribes (most of the texts that have been preserved were probably written by professional scribes; even people who were literate might hire or employ a professional for the sake of expertise, e.g., knowledge of proper legal terminology and clarity or elegance of handwriting) (see the
discussion of individual differences in handwriting in Catalog No. 85). Throughout the millennium during which Demotic was used, it was never the sole Egyptian script available (hieroglyphs being retained especially for formal inscriptions, hieratic for literary, and especially religious, texts) and during most of the period of its use it was not in official administrative use, either (Aramaic was used in the Persian period, Greek in the Ptolemaic and Roman periods; however, in both periods Egyptians, and especially temple personnel, frequently or even regularly used Demotic to communicate with the central administration). This led to many and various interactions between Demotic and other scripts and languages. For example, Demotic was used to add notes or glosses to a hieroglyphic or hieratic text. Some Demotic literary texts appear to be translations of earlier hieratic or hieroglyphic texts (e.g., Papyrus Carlsberg 1 and 1a, in which the hieroglyphic texts accompanying the cosmology on the ceilings of the tombs of the New Kingdom rulers Seti I and Ramesses IV (ca. 1297 and 1147 bc respectively) are quoted in hieratic and translated into Demotic, with added commentary); in other cases the hieratic and Demotic were used for different sections of a text (e.g., in the handbook describing the process of embalming a deceased Apis bull, Demotic is used in general, but more ritual passages seem to have been retained in hieratic; individual words or signs are occasionally written in hieratic even in the very late Demotic magical texts). Occasionally the scripts seem to share more equal status (e.g., the funerary texts in Papyrus Rhind are presented in hieratic and then in Demotic; on some private statues and funerary stelae the dedicatory inscription might be given both in hieroglyphs and in Demotic, although in other cases Demotic was restricted to the more personal information while hieroglyphs were used for the religious texts). Many Roman-period mummy labels are bilingual, Greek and Demotic, giving the name and place of origin/ residence of the deceased individual, usually in the form of a short prayer. The decrees issued by the senior Egyptian priesthood in honor of the middle Ptolemies, for example, the Rosetta Stone (fig. 9.1), present the formal decree in Greek, Demotic, and hieroglyphs.

Translation between Demotic and non-Egyptian languages is also well attested. Not only are there similarities and probably literal translations between legal texts in Demotic and contemporary documents written in Aramaic (Persian period) and Greek (Ptolemaic period), but there are also a number of literary texts that were translated between languages. During the Ptolemaic period, individual Greek words (names, titles, and professions) could be written in Demotic using the appropriate “alphabetic” signs (see the discussion of the writing of the name of Alexander, above). There is also one long text in Aramaic written using a very restricted inventory of Demotic “alphabetic” signs and determinatives. Similarly, Egyptian names and other words were written in Greek characters in Greek documents. Demotic legal documents frequently have a Greek notation at the bottom recording the registration of the document in the local records house. One Roman-period village in the Fayum has produced a large number of ostraca where Greek and Demotic are intermingled. One example is Ostracon Medinet Maadi/Narmouthis 60 (fig. 9.2), where the text is written in Demotic, from right to left, but with the Greek word pinaks
“board, plank; writing tablet” written, left to right, in Greek in the middle of line 2 of the Demotic. Demotic script was also the basis for writing the more cursive of the two Meroitic scripts used in Nubia. During the early Roman period Old Coptic, using the Greek alphabet and a more or less consistent set of Demotic “alphabetic” signs for sounds not represented in the Greek alphabet (e.g., Ó from g and ˆ from ‹), was developed for transcribing Egyptian into Greek. It could be used for glossing individual words written in a Demotic text or, rarely, as a standalone script for writing a text. Old Coptic standardized into the final Coptic alphabet by about the third century ad.

This Demotic contract is a so-called “annuity contract” made by a man named ʿnḫ-mr-wr to a woman named NꜢ-nfr(-mn)-ἰb-Ptḥ. Such contracts, made by a husband to his wife, appear to have had two major underlying aims: to assure that the husband will properly support the wife and her children and to assure that it is her children who will be his heirs. In a society in which, as a norm, men worked and acquired (disposable) income but women did not, this was an important guarantor of stability for both the family and the society. Catalog No. 85 is such an annuity contract, in which the man/husband acknowledges receipt from the woman/wife of ten pieces of silver for her “endowment.” She and the children she will bear the man are acknowledged as his heirs of all property he currently owns or will acquire, whether land, animals, legal documents, or “any private/personal(ly owned) thing at all.” He

promises to provide her with a specific amount of grain and silver every year for her (food) rations and clothing, which he must deliver to whatever house she prefers (this implies that he must continue to feed and clothe her even if she has left him or been thrown out of his house); she remains entitled to any arrears in his payments. He lists all his property, again whatever he has currently and whatever he may acquire, as security for her annuity. He acknowledges that he cannot return her silver to her and end the agreement but that if she wants the silver back, he must give it immediately (and thereby end the annuity and, presumably, the marriage). She also is assured that she will never be forced to travel to some “out-of-the-way” place to provide legal evidence with regard to this contract. The annuity contract (text A; see figure below) was written by a professional scribe at dictation from the person making the contract, in this case the man. The second person, in this case the woman, was present and heard the dictated statement and accepted the document only if his statement was acceptable. Thus, although the contract was made by one party to the other, the agreement was bilateral and subject to the approval of both parties. The scribe who wrote the document signed it after quoting all the statements by any of the parties to the contract (including relatives or others who might have had a vested interest in the property being transferred). Most Egyptian legal contracts end with a list of witnesses, people who were present for the dictation and can swear in court, if necessary, to the making of the document and to its contents. However, some documents,
including this one, include handwritten copies of the entire contract written out by individual witnesses rather than just the list of names. It is not clear why, in a minority of cases over a period of several hundred years, witnesses would write out the entire contract rather than simply signing their names. On this contract, four individuals, including one with the title “prophet of (the goddess) Neith,” copied/rewrote the entire contract (texts B–E). Each man who wrote one of these witness copies began by giving his name (or name and titles) and identifying himself as a “witness” to the “speech” which Party 1, the man, had made and which he, the witness, proceeds to copy. Where, in the original, the scribe signed his name, the individual writing the witness copy wrote “I wrote this.” The original contract written by the professional scribe occupied the top right-hand portion (text A) of the large papyrus (created by connecting ten individual sheets of papyrus). The first witness wrote his copy (text B) immediately under the original contract. The second witness began immediately under the first witness (text C), but had to move then to the top of the second “column” to finish his text. The last two witnesses (texts D and E) filled the remainder of this second “column.” Note that the second “column” is not as wide as the space occupied by the original contract, making for shorter lines and a generally more cramped feel for the second “column.” Although all five copies are written by men with fluid handwriting, each man’s handwriting is distinctive and includes individual minor variations of paleography (the shape of the individual signs

and words) and spelling/grammar. For example, a genitival preposition may or may not be written or the feminine ending t may be added to the number 7 in the regnal year date, as in all witness copies, but not the original. An example of orthographic variation is found in the writing of the phrase nt nb nt mtw y “everything which belongs to me.” The scribe of the original text wrote (from right to left) in the third line in a fine, old-fashioned calligraphic hand (with touches of hieratic) while the witnesses wrote (from line 3 of text C), which becomes the typical Ptolemaic period writing of the phrase. The “double loop” of nt in text A has become a single loop in text C while the “hieratic”-looking top element of nb in text A has taken its standard, more cursive, Ptolemaic form in text C . The variation between “early” and Ptolemaic handwriting is also seen in the word following this phrase, ḥnʿ “and”; compare . (A, line 3), written with three clear alphabetic signs ḥ + n + ʿ (see alphabet chart, table 9.2), with (B, line 3), (C, line 3), (D, line 4), and (E, line 6), where the first sign has become a straight line and the second and third signs have been ligatured (run together in the writing). The phrase mt.t rmṯ nmḥ nb.t n pꜢ tꜢ “any private/ personal(ly owned) thing at all,” mentioned above, is written in an elegant hand by the scribe of text A (line 2). The scribe of text B (line 2) clarified the “man-with-hand-to-mouth” determinative, the second (left-hand) sign in the writing of mt.t “thing” (texts A and B ; see the chart of determinatives, table 9.1), and wrote a much larger preposition n (texts A and B ); the phrase in texts D (line 3) and E (line 4) is damaged in parts, but one can still see that the writing is thicker and less elegant than that of the scribe of text A. Especially in text A, one can also see that a skilled scribe could use his brush to produce both thick and thin lines (e.g., in the writing of the word rmṯ “man” in text E ), adding some elegance to the script. In each copy of the text, the important key words are written larger than the rest of the text,
immediately indicating to anyone seeing it what kind of text it is and physically pointing out the different parts of the legal document. Thus, text A starts with a large ḥsb.t 7(.t) “regnal year 7” . About a third of the way along the first line is a large ḏ “(so-and-so) said” followed, after the name and titles, by a large preposition n “to” followed by the name of the second party. A little over two-thirds of the way along the line is a large dἰ “(you) caused” . The witness copies also write the large ḥsb.t 7.t “regnal year 7.” Because they are quoting the speech of Party 1, the man, rather than recording their own speech, the large ḏ is replaced by a large n ḏ “(he being a witness) to/ of the speech” (text D, line 1). The preposition n “to” and the verb dἰ may again be written large to identify the type of text and point to the individual parts of the legal document. Another aspect of the writing that is clearly seen in this text is the rhythm of dark ink lines just after the scribe has dipped his brush in the ink, followed by gradual lightening of the strokes until the ink is so light that the scribe dips his pen again. For example, in the middle of line 3 of text E , the darker ink at the beginning (i.e., the right-hand end) gives way to progressively lighter ink as the brush runs dry. Especially good and careful scribes would make the effort to avoid such sharp differences in ink tone by dipping their brush less fully but more frequently while writing a text of this sort, which not only formed an important legal document for the family, but which also, given the size and expense of the document, was a major familial investment. This document is part of a family archive, documents reflecting an individual’s or family’s economic interests and transactions, retained and stored by the individual or family because of their ongoing legal and economic importance. jhj

10. Ptolemaic HieroglyPHs
10. Ptolemaic hieroglyPhs
françois gaudard
T
he designation “Ptolemaic hieroglyphs” is used by Egyptologists to refer to the script employed by the scribes of Egyptian temples after the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great until the end of the second century ad. Also called figurative or cryptographic hieroglyphs, they are not only synonymous with difficulty, extreme complication, convolutions, obscure puns, and strange puzzles, but also and even more so with intense challenge and deep excitement. Their figurative nature misled early scholars into regarding the hieroglyphic script as purely symbolic. To the layman these signs probably look like usual hieroglyphs, but to an uninitiated Egyptologist their interpretation is like exploring a terra incognita, and for good reason. Indeed, during the Middle Kingdom and the beginning of the New Kingdom, the number of signs commonly used by the scribes totaled about 760, but in the latest periods of Egyptian history many new signs were created and the corpus of hieroglyphs grew to several thousand signs (see, e.g., Daumas et al. 1988–1995). Concurrently, there was also a significant increase in the number of phonetic values that could be attributed to a single sign. A hieroglyph that in classical Egyptian was read in one or two ways could now have up to twenty or even thirty different readings, as in the case of the sign —, usually identified as a pustule. Moreover, a single word could also be written in various and complicated ways, making the script all the more difficult to decipher. However, if it is true that the use of cryptography reached its peak during the Greco-Roman period, it was not restricted to that era. Indeed, sportive writings are attested, although rarely, as early as the Old Kingdom. They were used during the Middle Kingdom and also occurred in contexts including the royal funerary compositions of the New Kingdom inscribed in tombs such as those of Tutankhamun and Ramesses VI (see, e.g., Darnell 2004). It is in these early examples that the origins of the principles of
cryptography in the Ptolemaic and Roman periods must be sought. As unpredictable as such a system may seem at first sight, it was nonetheless logical and followed precise rules. What makes the signs so difficult to interpret is in fact the innovative approach used by scribes to apply old principles. Some of the ways through which signs could acquire their values were:
1) The “consonantal principle,” by which multi-consonantal signs could retain only the value of their strongest consonant (e.g., the sign B, usually read ἰb, could stand for the letter b, its weak consonant, namely ἰ, being dropped).
2) The “acrophonic principle,” by which multi-consonantal signs could retain only the value of their first consonant, regardless of whether it was strong or weak (e.g.,
the sign◊, usually read wn, could stand for the letter w).
3) The “rebus principle,” by which a word could be written using a picture of something that had the same sound (e.g., the
sign ≠from the word mn(t) “thigh” could stand for the phonogram mn(t) in the word mnmnt “herd of cattle,” the standard writing of which was ).
4) The “pars pro toto principle,” by which part of a sign could stand for the entire sign (e.g.,
the sign of the pupil } could stand for the
whole eye u, hence the writing of the
verb mꜢꜢ “to see” as }} instead of , a more traditional writing being ).
Other reasons, including direct representation, derivation from hieratic, or the combination of several of the above-mentioned principles, could also be at the origin of a sign’s value, but such a study is beyond the scope of the present discussion.1

One of the consequences of the application of these principles was a break with the traditional orthographic conventions, making the words much more difficult to recognize. For example, let us consider the word ršwt “joy,” which could be
written Q–!, with the gods Re ( Q) and Shu (–) standing respectively for the sounds r and šw, and the
goddess Tefnut ( !) for the final t. Also noteworthy
is the sign of the head r , which could stand for the number seven sfḫ, simply because the head has seven openings, namely two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, and a mouth. It also worked the other way around, and for the same reason the number seven
could stand for the word r tp “head.” Of course,
depending on the context, the sign r could be read tp “head” and the group be read sfḫ “seven,” since traditional writings were used concurrently with new ones. As mentioned above, there was also a significant increase in the number of phonetic values that could be attributed to a single sign. As a matter of interest, the traditional readings of the vulture hieroglyph d were mt, mwt, and sometimes nr, but in Ptolemaic hieroglyphs the same sign could be read as the phonograms m, n, nr, nḥ, š, štꜢ, šṯy, qd, t, ty, tyw, ṯ, d, or as the words wnm “right,” mwt “mother,” mkἰ “to protect,” nἰwt “city,” nrἰ “to fear,” nrt “vulture,” nṯrt “goddess,” rmṯ “man,” and rnpt “year.” The use of new signs and innovative combinations of signs were also frequent. For example, the vulture hieroglyph could be combined with the horns of an ox-. As a result, the new sign was read wpt-rnpt “New Year’s Day” (lit., “the opening of the year”), with the horns standing here for the word wpt “opening,” and the vulture for rnpt “year.” Note that the traditional writings of wpt-rnpt were or.. Another good example is the divine name Wnn-nfrw “Onnophris,” a designation for Osiris that could display several new forms, including, among others: 1)  ́ (a desert hare [wn] holding the sign of the heart and windpipe [nfr]); 2) (a flower [wn] within a coiled lotus [nfr]); 3) (two lotus flowers [respectively wn and nfr] within a cartouche, with the variants and ). Similarly, writings of the traditional title μÃμ∞ nswbἰty “King of Upper and Lower Egypt” were as vari
ous as , ,  ̊, , , or . Sometimes a single sign could even stand for an entire phrase, as in the case of the sign rendering the phrase dἰ ʿnḫ mἰ Rʿ “given life like Re,” traditionally written
oŒ
%
≈ Æ but replaced here with a cat (mἰ) wearing a solar disk (Rʿ) on its head and giving (dἰ) an ankh, symbol of life (ʿnḫ).2 In a quest for virtuosity in their theological exegesis, the ancient priests realized that the system could be pushed one step further. Indeed, in addition to being used for their phonetic values, the signs themselves, by their very shape, could also recall ideas and theological concepts. A well-known example is the name of the Memphite creator god Ptah, whose traditional writing ç
μè Ptḥ is also attested under the cryptographic form consisting of the
sign ! pt “sky” standing for ç p, the god l Ḥḥ “Heh” for è ḥ, and the sign 0 tꜢ “earth” for μ t. Note that for symbolic reasons these three logograms appear as pḥt, but the correct phonetic order, namely ptḥ, was easy to restore for someone in the know. The ingenious selection and disposition of the signs in the group depicting the god Heh with upraised arms, separating the earth from the sky, evoked the creation of the world performed by the god Ptah according to the Memphite Theology. Thus, with a single group of signs, one could both read the name of Ptah (Ptḥ) expressed in cryptographic form and be reminded of a major act of creation. This complicated process tended to be used in conjunction with a system by which the meaning of divine and geographical names, in particular, could be explained through sacred etymologies based on puns. By virtue of this principle of verbal analogy, the name of the god Amun ʾImn, whose pronunciation was similar to that of the word ἰmn “to be hidden,” could also be written using the sign of the man hiding behind a
wall %. On the basis of this etymology the god could be referred to as “the hidden one.” Another cryptogram of Amun, already known from earlier periods, was the graphic combination , for which various interpretations have been proposed. One of the most convincing is the following (see Van Rinsveld 1993): the sign 2, used for the word ἰw “island,” can also stand for the letter ἰ. As for the sign C, it is nothing but the standard writing of the letter n. In the group , note that C n is in 2 ἰ. Given that the preposition “in” corresponds to m in Egyptian, the phrase “n in ἰ” was said n m ἰ, which was also the name of Amun written backwards (nmἰ for ἰmn). Therefore, the name of the chief god of Thebes was hidden twice, first in the cryptogram and

again in the retrograde writing nmἰ, which perfectly fits the above-mentioned etymology of his name. As artificial and inaccurate as it may seem to modern eyes, this method was nonetheless extremely popular during all periods of Egyptian history. Depending on the nature of the texts, the Ptolemaic hieroglyphic script could exhibit greater or lesser degrees of complication. One can in fact distinguish between two types of scripts: the first type, which could be referred to as “common,” includes a certain percentage of new signs and phonetic values, but once these are known, texts written in such a script can generally be read without major difficulties. The other type of script, however, in which each sign is carefully chosen, is extremely complicated and would even pose a challenge to an experienced Egyptologist (see Sauneron 1974, p. 46). Texts of this latter type are well represented by two famous hymns inscribed in the hall of the temple of Esna in the late first century ad, one of them being composed almost entirely with signs depicting a ram and the other with signs depicting a crocodile (see, e.g., Leitz 2001). When confronted with such a profusion of subtleties, complications, and sophisticated signs, the reader may wonder about the motivations of the ancient scribes. While it might be tempting at first to see this system as a means of concealing sacred knowledge from the uninitiated, several indications seem to point in a different direction, making such
an explanation rather unlikely. Indeed, due to their placement high on the walls, several of the texts inscribed in temples remained illegible to the visitor and were obviously not meant to be read (see Sauneron 1982, p. 51). For this reason, there was apparently no need to hide their content, since they “were effectively answerable in detail only to the gods” (Baines 2007, p. 47). Moreover, important theological texts could be composed in a perfectly accessible script, while inscriptions of lesser importance were sometimes written in a highly cryptographic one (see Sauneron 1982, p. 52). All of this suggests that the use of such a script should best be viewed as part of an intellectual game rather than as a deliberate attempt at occulting any secret lore. Some scholars wrongly considered Ptolemaic hieroglyphs to be a degenerate product of a civilization in decline, whereas we are in fact dealing with the ultimate outcome of an age-old science, whose keepers’ boundless ingenuity and deep knowledge command respect and admiration.

The texts on this shroud exhibit cryptographic writings, also called sportive writings, characteristic of the Ptolemaic and Roman periods. At that time, mummies could be wrapped in
painted funerary shrouds. Unlike most shrouds from the Roman period, which tend to combine Greek and Egyptian influences, the present one is truly Egyptian in style. Its design is reminiscent

of some Third Intermediate Period cartonnage coffin decoration. It displays columns of text as well as protective deities. The style, the paint colors, and the level of detail and complexity of the inscriptions seem more in keeping with an earlier rather than a later date, which would favor a Ptolemaic dating. Only part of the decoration of the right side is preserved: Isis (upper register) and her sister Nephthys (lower register) are depicted as two kites to recall their role as mourners of the dead Osiris, with whom the deceased was identified. Isis is referred to as “the excellent god’s mother” as an allusion to the fact that she is the mother of Horus, and Nephthys is called “the foremost.” Both are said to be “offering the breath of life.” Between them, one can see a representation of a lozenge-pattern bead net, which often covered mummies in earlier periods. Despite their fragmentary condition, the texts of the present shroud, consisting mainly of offering formulae, are of particular interest. Indeed, they provide us with both unusual epithets of Osiris and some good examples of cryptography. Worth noting are the writing of the epithet mwt-nṯr “god’s mother” as (e.g., right and left columns) instead of the standard formôd, and that of the adjective wr “great” as Õ
μ
ó (left column) for . Also characteristic is the word ḫnty “foremost”

optic is the latest phase of the ancient Egyptian language. Grammatically, Coptic is closest to Demotic, but Coptic script marks a major departure for ancient Egyptian in that it is written solely with alphabetic signs. The earliest attempts at using an alphabet for Egyptian simply used Greek letters. Greek was the administrative language of Egypt from 332 bc onward and became common as a language of business and everyday life. Early experiments with alphabetic writing of Egyptian include explanatory glosses, rendering Egyptian words phonetically in Greek letters, in a few hieratic (cursive hieroglyphic) religious texts, and Demotic magical texts from the second century ad alongside a handful of Egyptian language texts written entirely in Greek letters. These texts show the advantages of using an alphabetic system (simplicity and precise indication of vowel sounds), but also show the limitations of using an unaltered Greek alphabet, in that Egyptian contained sounds not represented in Greek. Thus the Coptic alphabet, consisting of all twenty-four Greek letters plus six (or seven or more, depending on dialect) signs derived from Demotic, developed in the second and third centuries ad (fig. 11.1). Coptic, like Greek, was written from left to right only, marking a major departure from Demotic and hieroglyphs. Coptic developed as Christianity was becoming an important force in Egyptian life, and the Coptic alphabet’s relative lack of similarity to the earlier
figure 11.1. The Coptic alphabet and English pronunciation
“pagan” systems of writing made it attractive to this burgeoning religion. Indeed, the formation of Coptic as a literary language and means of expression owed much to the early translation of the Greek New Testament into Coptic as well as to the growth of monastic writers such as Pachomius and Shenoute, who pushed Coptic into new realms of expression and rhetoric. Coptic and Greek shared related scripts, and, for much of its history, Coptic co-existed in Egypt with Greek through the Arab Conquest of ad 641, and many literate Egyptians would have been bilingual. The rapid disappearance of Greek after the conquest and the relative increase in Coptic in the following centuries raise questions about just how deep this bilingualism went. Ultimately, Coptic was replaced as a language and script of business and daily life by Arabic — the ninth and tenth centuries saw a major decline in the everyday use of written Coptic, and it was effectively supplanted by Arabic for most uses by the eleventh century. But Coptic continued, and continues to this day, as a script and language of literature and liturgy in the Coptic church — no longer a living language (although there have been sporadic attempts in the past century at revival), but still an important part of Christianity in Egypt and, thanks to the large Coptic expatriate communities, throughout the world.

Coptic was written in a standard alphabetic system, but script styles varied depending on the type of document and training of the scribe. Official documents written by professional scribes tended to be written in a relatively standardized, highly cursive script, with frequent use of ligatures (combinations and joinings of letters) and abbreviations. Less official documents by nonprofessional scribes and literary texts tended to be written in non-cursive, uncial scripts with the individual letters kept mostly separate. These two Coptic ostraca (Catalog Nos. 87 and 88) come from roughly the same period in the western Theban region. Both are documents of daily life from
individuals and share other common features, but they show markedly different styles of writing. Shorter documents, such as receipts and personal letters like these, were often written in ink on sherds of pottery or chips of limestone. Both of these otherwise different kinds of document begins with a crossed rho — a standard beginning for any documentary text in Coptic, perhaps all the more important in documents such as these, from after the Arab Conquest in ad 641, as a mark of the writer being Christian. Catalog No. 87 is a tax receipt from the town of Jeme (the village built in and around the pharaonic temple at Medinet Habu) written in a cursive,

professional scribal hand (Wilfong 1992, pp. 92–93; Hasitzka 2004, p. 121, no. 1013). Hundreds of similar tax receipts survive from Jeme (many found during the Oriental Institute’s excavations at Medinet Habu) and nearly all were written within a twenty-year period (ca. ad 710–730) on a specific kind of pottery (fine ware with a buff or reddish slip). Catalog No. 87 records the payment of an unspecified tax by a man named Aaron, son of Johannes, in the amount of a “reckoned solidus.” A solidus (also known as a holokottinos and roughly equivalent to the Arab dinar) was the highest denomination of gold coin in circulation at the time; a “reckoned solidus” would be a payment
consisting of lower-denomination coins totaling a solidus. To understand the value (and burden) of such a tax payment, it may help to know that a solidus could buy ten to fifteen bushels of wheat, while a house at Jeme in this period might cost between four and eight solidi (Wilfong 2003–04). So a solidus was a substantial amount for the average Jeme inhabitant. The type of tax is not specified in the receipt, but the amount makes it likely that the tax was the “diagraphon,” a poll tax levied on adult male non-Muslims in Egypt after the Arab Conquest. Taxes were levied locally to meet expected payments to the Arab administrators of Egypt on a fifteen-year tax cycle known as the

“indiction,” instituted in the early fourth century ad under Byzantine rule. Thus, this document’s date to “year 2,” in theory, gives only its place in a repeating indiction cycle, and not an absolute date. But the presence of the well-known Psan, son of Basilios, as witness and the even better-known Jeme headman Petros as signatory allows us to date the ostracon more precisely to ad 719. Groups of Jeme tax receipts issued on the same day with the same signatures but to different taxpayers suggest that taxes were paid en masse at all-day sessions. Note how the last lines show the witness Psan’s pen running out of ink — clearly he did not want to have to take the time to dip his pen again to finish.
translation
Here is a reckoned solidus. It has come to me from you — Aaron son of Johannes — in the first payment of this second year. Total: 1 reckoned solidus. Written in the month of Mechir, day 2, Indiction year 2. I, Petros, the village
headman, sign this receipt. I am Psan, son of Basileos; he asked me, and I witnessed this receipt.
Catalog No. 88 is a personal letter, written in a non-cursive, uncial hand (Wilfong 1992, pp. 90–91; Hasitzka 2004, p. 51, no. 904). The writer was not a professional administrative scribe, but was literate and somewhat practiced. The pottery on which this letter was written is relatively coarse, ribbed ware, most probably from a wine amphora. Personal letters were often written on ribbed pottery, either because of its relative availability or because the ribs in the pottery served as useful guidelines for less-practiced scribes. The writer was most likely a monk, and possibly even a solitary monk living in the ancient tombs
in the western Theban hills. Monks of all sorts relied on family and friends for basic supplies and support, and the author of this letter was clearly dependent on Pkamê, the recipient, for a supply of four artabas of wheat (an artaba in this period was somewhat more than a bushel). The writer expresses clear irritation with Pkamê for not supplying this wheat sooner (he does so with a combination of word choice and the use of a special Coptic grammatical construction, the “second tense,” to indicate emphasis). Coptic personal letters are so often formulaic expressions of conventional greetings that a letter like this, consisting entirely of substance and expressing some emotion, is a rare document indeed. The writer refers to the letter itself, in asking Pkamê to hand over the wheat to the bearer of “this ostracon.” The ostracon is being carried on behalf of the writer to Pkamê by a third party; it is ambiguous whether the writer or the bearer is referred to in the phrase “from Kyriakos.” The use of someone to deliver the ostracon and pick up the wheat suggests that the writer was in a monastery or solitary monastic cell that he could not leave, and Pkamê was in Jeme or a nearby village. The closing of the letter, “Farewell in the lord,” is a standard ending for personal letters in Coptic.
translation
Since you have left me only in order that you should send the four artaba measures of wheat to me, be so good as to send them to me through the man who will bring this ostracon to you. Stop! You have been negligent in this matter! Give it to Pkamê from Kyriakos. Farewell in the lord.

12. the invention and development of the alphabet
12. the invention and development of the alphabet
joseph lam
O
f the various writing systems that emerged out of the ancient Middle East, the alphabet has undoubtedly exerted the most lasting influence. While the two other dominant systems of writing that were invented in the Middle East Mesopotamian cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphs — eventually died out along with their associated cultures (thus requiring them to be deciphered by modern scholars), alphabetic systems of writing have remained in use without interruption into modern times and are pervasive in the world today. In fact, with the notable exceptions of Chinese and Japanese, the most common languages of the world utilize alphabetic scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, Perso-Arabic, Devanagari, and Bengali) that are ultimately descended from the linear West Semitic alphabet. The functional advantage of the alphabet over other writing systems lies in its economy. In contrast to logographic systems, in which a given symbol denotes a word, or to syllabic writing, in which a sign represents a full syllable of sound, alphabetic writing is characterized by the graphic representation of phonemes, that is, the shortest contrastive units of sound in a language (consonants or vowels), thereby greatly decreasing the number of signs. As a consequence, typical alphabetic systems have on the order of tens of signs, whereas logographic and syllabic systems have on the order of hundreds. This would no doubt have made the system easier to learn and master. The earliest West Semitic alphabet was characterized, incidentally, by the exclusive writing of consonants, a system that exploits a feature in the phonological structure of all Semitic languages, wherein every syllable begins with a consonant. At the same time, one should not suppose that a simpler writing system led automatically to a high level of literacy, as is sometimes suggested. Learning a script is not the same as learning to read and write. The latter is a process that takes years even in modern times and is connected to a whole host of factors such as access to education and the functional role of writing in society.1 In fact, it is doubtful
whether literacy was at all a necessary skill for the vast proportion of people in antiquity. While it certainly seems reasonable to assume that the invention of the alphabet made the process of scribal training much easier, no immediate correlation can be made between alphabetic writing and broad literacy. The earliest evidence for alphabetic writing comes from the second millennium bc in the Sinai and Egypt. The Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions, first discovered2 by W. M. Flinders Petrie in 1905 (and supplemented by additional finds in subsequent decades), consist of linear pictographic symbols inscribed on statuettes, stone panels, and rock faces at Serabit el-Khadem, an ancient Egyptian mining site in the Sinai Peninsula. More recently, in the mid-1990s, two single-line rock inscriptions were discovered at the desert site of Wadi el-Hol, near Thebes in Upper Egypt,3 in a script that strongly resembles the ProtoSinaitic texts. Due to the lack of stratified archaeological contexts for these finds, absolute dates have proven difficult to establish, though some scholars place them as early as the beginning of the second millennium bc (Dynasty 12 in Egypt) on the basis of associated Egyptian material as well as historical considerations.4 The hybrid nature of these earliest signs gives us clues regarding the sociohistorical context for the origins of the alphabet. On the one hand, most if not all of these earliest pictographs have plausible connections to Egyptian hieroglyphic (and perhaps hieratic) symbols,5 implying that the inventors were influenced at some level by Egyptian writing (see fig. 12.1). On the other hand, the phonemes represented by these symbols are derived from the West Semitic (and not Egyptian) words behind the pictographs. For instance, the sign for a hand is used to denote the /k/ sound through the West Semitic word kaph for “palm” or “hand,” a word that also comes to be the name of the letter. (For comparison, the Modern Hebrew name for the corresponding letter is precisely kaph; note also the Greek letter name kappa.) This association of the letter name (kaph) with its initial

phoneme (/k/) is called the acrophonic principle (acro- “topmost” + phone “voice, sound”), and the fact that it is via the Semitic vocabulary that such a principle operates suggests that the linear alphabet arose for the purpose of writing a Semitic language. In fact, it is based on this assumption that the Sinai inscriptions have been partially deciphered,6 revealing intelligible phrases such as lbʿlt (“for the Lady”) and rb nqbnm (“chief of the miners”).7 The presence of Egyptian inscriptions in the vicinity of either Serabit el-Khadem or Wadi el-Hol would have provided sufficient impetus for such an invention to occur, if in fact one of these sites represents the ultimate place of origin. Though the paucity (and intractability) of the evidence prevents us from being too dogmatic
on the details, what we can assert with reasonable confidence is that the alphabet was invented among Semitic speakers in the Egyptian realm, inspired iconographically by hieroglyphic writing but not bound by its modes of expression.8 The presence of Asiatics in Egypt as various kinds of workers (e.g., builders, miners, mercenaries, etc.) in the Middle Kingdom is well documented and would furnish the broader sociohistorical backdrop for this remarkable innovation. Another collection of data coming from the second millennium is the Proto-Canaanite inscriptions, an umbrella term for a diverse and fragmentary group of texts (inscribed on pottery and other objects) hailing from various sites in Palestine, some

of which do have secure archaeological contexts. Though the archaeological evidence overall is spotty and inconclusive, two tentative reasons can be adduced for placing these later than the inscriptions from Serabit el-Khadem and Wadi el-Hol. First, within the Proto-Canaanite texts, one can observe a gradual evolution away from purely pictographic shapes to more abstract, stylized forms. Second, their context in Palestine puts them one step removed geographically from the Egyptian sphere, the presumed context of the alphabet’s invention. While the earliest datable Proto-Canaanite inscription, the Lachish Dagger (a highly pictographic four-sign inscription), can be attributed to the seventeenth century bc on archaeological grounds,9 the majority of the Proto-Canaanite objects come from the thirteenth century and later.10 Among these are the Izbet Sartah ostracon, part of which represents the earliest-known linear “abecedary” (a sequential writing out of all the alphabetic letters); several objects from Lachish, including an “ewer” (a pitcher in the shape of a vase), a bowl, and other pottery sherds; and a number of inscribed arrowheads from different locations, such as those found at el-Khadr near Bethlehem (Catalog No. 91).11
North of Palestine, in the region of modern Syria, little direct evidence exists for the linear alphabet before the first millennium bc; however, here we have additional data of a different kind. At the site of Ras Shamra, on the Mediterranean coast (near modern Latakia), in the ancient city of Ugarit (ca. thirteenth century bc), we find a fully functioning alphabetic system utilizing cuneiform signs (wedges impressed with a stylus on clay) rather than linear characters. This system, which appears not to have been based on Sumero-Akkadian syllabic cuneiform, was used not only for writing texts of all genres in the local West Semitic language of Ugaritic, but occasionally for other languages as well (e.g., Hurrian). Among the roughly two thousand Ugaritic texts (Bordreuil and Pardee 2004, p. 20) discovered at the site to date are a number of abecedaries, used in the context of scribal training,12 which give us a glimpse into the Ugaritians’ own internal conception of the alphabet (fig. 12.2). This alphabet consisted of thirty signs, with the first twenty-seven representing distinct consonantal phonemes, and the last three being variations on two of the other phonemes (#28 and #29 in the sequence were variants of ʾaleph [sign #1

in the alphabet], while #30 was probably a borrowing of an alternate form of samekh from contemporary Canaanite).13 What is notable is that the order of the first twenty-seven signs (ʾ, b, g ...) is consistent with the twenty-two–letter alphabetic order attested in the first millennium, leaving aside of course the five phonemes present in Ugaritic but not preserved in later Phoenician. Moreover, at least two of the signs (the “archaic” forms of {g} and of {s̀}, the aforementioned sign #30) can be seen as cuneiform imitations of their corresponding linear alphabetic counterparts (see fig. 12.3). For these reasons, it is not unreasonable to surmise that a linear alphabet of twenty-seven signs was also used in the northern Levant during this period, and that the Ugaritic alphabet was a conceptual adaptation of it for cuneiform writing. (The last three signs, #28–30, would have been added to accommodate the particular needs of scribal writing at Ugarit.) The twenty-two–letter alphabet would then represent a simplification of this earlier system, in keeping with the phonetic merging of various consonants occurring in later West Semitic.14 With the turn of the first millennium bc came the stabilization of the alphabet in terms of the
orientation of the letters and the direction of writing (right to left). As already intimated, this is generally associated with the Phoenicians, since the twentytwo–letter system that came as the result of this stabilization corresponds exactly to the phonemic inventory of the Phoenician language. When Hebrew and Aramaic speakers adopted this alphabet for their own texts, they did not create additional symbols for phonemes in their languages that were absent in Phoenician; they simply utilized the twenty-two available signs, making practical accommodation where necessary. Whether this was due to the perceived prestige of the Phoenician script or some other reason is difficult to ascertain. In any case, while the direction of writing and orientation of letters remained stable, the shapes of the letters continued to develop over the course of the first millennium, giving birth to distinct Hebrew and Aramaic scripts, and perhaps other separate orthographic traditions as well. In particular, the familiar “square” script, which grew out of the Aramaic script tradition, began to be used for writing Hebrew sometime in the Second Temple period and became the standard Jewish script (and is now used for Modern Hebrew).

12. the invention and development of the alphabet
The first-millennium stabilization of the alphabet in Canaan relates also to questions concerning the spread of alphabet writing to the Greeks and to the Arabian Peninsula. According to classical tradition, the Greek alphabet was borrowed from the Phoenicians, a scenario that would fit well with the appearance of the oldest Greek inscriptions in the eighth century bc. However, some scholars have argued for an earlier divergence from Proto-Canaanite (in the eleventh century), based on multi-directionality in early Greek writing15 (possibly implying that the transmission happened before the right-to-left direction became fixed) and on common characteristics in letter shapes. Such a hypothesis certainly has its merits, but it cannot be embraced unreservedly until further inscriptional data emerge in support of it.16 At the same time, while the earliest Epigraphic South Arabian texts come also from the beginning of the first millennium (ca. eighth century bc), there is more direct evidence, albeit tentative, to suggest a possible branching off of the South Arabian alphabet17 from Proto-Canaanite in the second millennium bc. This evidence comes in the form of two abecedaries in the cuneiform alphabetic script, one from Ugarit and one from Beth Shemesh in Palestine, conforming not to the familiar abgad order, but to the socalled halaḥam order (h, l, ḥ, m ...) known from much later South Arabian attestation.18 These admittedly slender pieces of evidence nevertheless provide a point of contact between Proto-Canaanite and a possible Proto-South Arabian alphabetic tradition in the mid-second millennium. More importantly, sporadic evidence of this kind, tantalizing as it is, reminds us of the still-partial nature of our current knowledge of the origins of the alphabet, an understanding that is sure to be refined in the future as further archaeological discoveries yield new surprises.
notes
1 A helpful correction to some misconceptions regarding alphabetic writing and literacy can be found in Rollston 2006, pp. 48–49.
2 I refer here to the first modern archaeological excavation of the material, though McCarter (1974, p. 56) notes how inscriptions from the area were known from at least the sixth century ad onward.
3 These inscriptions were discovered during the 1994–95 season of the Theban Desert Road Survey led by John Darnell (Darnell et al. 2005, p. 73).
4 For instance, Darnell and colleagues (2005, p. 90) attribute the Wadi el-Hol inscriptions to “ca. 1850–1700 bce” based on associated inscriptions in Egyptian. Similarly, others such as Orly Goldwasser (2006, pp. 131–34) posit a Middle Kingdom context for both the Serabit el-Khadem and Wadi el-Hol texts. The strongest challenge to this consensus in recent years has been Benjamin Sass (2004–05, 2008), who has put forward the possibility of a fourteenth-century date for the beginnings of the alphabet.
5 Hamilton (2006, pp. 269–75) insists on the derivation from both hieroglyphic and hieratic signs.
6 This decipherment was first achieved in brilliant fashion by Gardiner (1916).
7 For a summary of possible readings in the Proto-Sinaitic texts, see Sass 1988, pp. 46–49.
8 Goldwasser (2006, p. 135) holds that the inventors of the alphabet were not trained in Egyptian hieroglyphic writing and merely used it as an iconic model. At the other extreme, Darnell and colleagues (2005, p. 90) assert that these early inscriptions attest to a “fairly high degree of literacy in Egyptian.” Hamilton (2006, p. 293) adopts an intermediate position, stating that “[a] few of the early alphabetic writers may have had some, but not much scribal training ... [while] the rest [of the texts] appear to be of non-scribal quality, perhaps amateurish.”
9 Even Benjamin Sass (2004–05, p. 150), who has argued for a fourteenth–century genesis of the alphabet, acknowledges that “the Lachish dagger ... is the sole object among the [Proto-Canaanite finds] whose Middle Bronze pedigree is beyond reproach.” 10 See Sass 1988, pp. 151–56, especially the chart on p. 155. 11 On the el-Khadr arrowheads, see Milik and Cross 1954.
12 For a discussion of the Ugaritic abecedaries and their function, see Hawley 2008.
13 According to Tropper (2000, pp. 43–44), the Proto-Semitic reflex of samekh had already been deaffricated in Ugaritic (represented by sign #19), and so sign #30 was created to denote the affricate /`s/ in foreign and loan words. (In linguistics, an “affricate” denotes a class of speech sounds consisting of an initial stop followed by a release of air through a narrow passage, as with the /ch/ sound in the English word chat.)
14 For a much fuller discussion of these various points, see Pardee 2007.
15 Naveh (1973, p. 1) observes that “the archaic Greeks wrote in horizontal lines either from right to left, or from left to right, or in boustrophedon” (a kind of writing in which lines alternate between left-right and right-left orientation).
16 The strongest case for the borrowing of the Greek alphabet from Proto-Canaanite is that of Naveh (1973 and 1987, pp. 17586). For a recent critique, see Sass 2005, pp. 133-46.
17 The Old South Arabian alphabet consists of twenty-nine signs representing twenty-nine consonants, the most of any attested Semitic language.
18 For a discussion of the Ugarit abecedary in relation to the Beth Shemesh exemplar, see Bordreuil and Pardee 2001.

13. anatolian hieroglyphic writing
13. anatolian hieroglyphic writing
ilya yakubovich
A
natolian hieroglyphs are not to be confused with Egyptian hieroglyphs. The main features that the two scripts have in common include their use for carving texts on monumental objects and a large number of pictorial signs. In Anatolia, as in Egypt, many signs were used for writing whole words, and their shapes reminded the readers of the meanings of the respective words. Nevertheless, the two writing systems were used in different parts of the ancient Middle East and are not related to one another. The Anatolian hieroglyphic script functioned as a writing system in present-day Turkey and northern Syria between approximately 1400 and 700 bc. The Anatolian hieroglyphic script is known under various names. The term “Hittite hieroglyphs” was used in the late nineteenth century, when scholars had little knowledge about the languages of the area, and reflects the use of this writing system in the Bronze Age Hittite empire and the Early Iron Age Neo-Hittite states. Historians and archaeologists occasionally continue to employ this term, but from the linguistic point of view it is inaccurate, since the longer hieroglyphic inscriptions are all written in Luwian, a language closely related to, but distinct from Hittite. The more adequate term “Luwian hieroglyphs” has become more popular in the recent years among philologists. It has, however, its own drawbacks since the script was not created for writing Luwian, and the earliest inscription could be read in either Luwian or Hittite, as explained below. The designation “Anatolian hieroglyphs” has the advantage of being linguistically neutral, that is to say clearly distinguishing between the script and the languages with which it is associated. There are three main types of Anatolian hieroglyphs: phonetic signs, logograms, and determinatives. Phonetic signs were most commonly deployed not for recording individual sounds, but for rendering whole syllables of the structure “consonant+vowel,” e.g., pa, ti, su. In some cases, different signs could be used for the same syllable: thus, no less than seven signs could be used to write sa.
Logograms were special signs reserved for high frequency words, which would refer to their meaning rather than phonetic structure. Since we do not know the pronunciation of many Luwian words written with logograms, and since a number of specialists in Anatolian hieroglyphs happen to be classicists by training, the current convention is to use Latin capitals for writing logograms, for example, dominus “lord,” edere “eat,” sub “under.” Determinatives (or determiners) are frequently the same signs as logograms, but do not stand for particular spoken words, being instead appended in writing in order to clarify the meaning of other words. For example, the logogram tonitrus “Storm god” is usually written with the unpronounced determinative deus “god,” and the combination of the two signs is rendered in transliteration as (deus) tonitrus. Anatolian hieroglyphic inscriptions do not have a fixed direction of writing. Usually, a text is divided into horizontal lines, and if a particular line is written right to left, then the next one is written left to right, and vice versa. Scholars refer to this type of writing as boustrophedonic, meaning that the text moves along like an ox plowing a field. Because of this practice, the signs in odd and even lines of a text look like mirror images of one another (asymmetrical signs, like heads, face the beginning of the line regardless of the direction of writing). To make things even more complicated, each line tends to be two or three symbols “thick,” and thus individual words are likely to form two-dimensional clusters. One should also keep in mind that a number of Anatolian hieroglyphic signs have cursive shapes, which occasionally creep into the monumental inscriptions. The first-known specimens of Anatolian hieroglyphic writing come from the central Anatolian kingdom of the Hittites after the introduction of the Mesopotamian cuneiform to this region. It seemed odd to a number of scholars that this highly original and complicated writing system was developed in competition with an established form of writing. It was, therefore, suggested that the Anatolian hieroglyphs must have originally been

“My paternal gods loved me”
This is a quotation from a monumental decree of Halparuntiya, late ninth-century bc ruler of the Neo-Hittite kingdom of Gurgum in southwestern Turkey. In the lines above, individual words recorded in Anatolian hieroglyphs are aligned with their sign-by-sign transcriptions, transliterations, and translations. This example is sufficient to demonstrate the principal structural peculiarities of the Anatolian hieroglyphic script. Thus, the logogram = deus “god” is accompanied by the phonetic complement ni-zi-i indicating the plural number. The verb aza- “to love” is preceded by the determinative = lituus (graphically a crooked staff, symbol of authority in the ancient Middle East), which is otherwise generally placed in front of verbs and nouns related to cognition and perception. The sign , marked in transliteration by the vertical line | is a word-divider used with various degrees of consistency in individual inscriptions. The slanted line above the transliteration á and tá represents a modern convention for distinguishing homonyms, that is, á and tá are condidered to be the second signs to have the values a and ta respectively. Note that n is systematically omitted in writing in the middle of words before consonants.
invented somewhere else, for example, in the western Anatolian kingdom of Arzawa, and only later borrowed by the Hittites (Hawkins 1986). In my opinion, this hypothesis is neither logically necessary nor empirically plausible. On the one hand, a new writing system may be created not for pragmatic reasons but as a way of expressing nationalistic sentiments. On the other hand, the linguistic analysis of the Anatolian hieroglyphic script supports the
hypothesis that they originated in the Hittite-Luwian bilingual environment of central Anatolia. The most obvious parallel for a new script marking a new cultural identity in the ancient Middle East is the invention of the Old Persian cuneiform at the court of the first Achaemenid kings (ca. 520 bc). This happened at the time when both Mesopotamian cuneiform and the Aramaic alphabet were already in use in Iran. Presumably, the early Achaemenids

regarded deploying new sign shapes for writing Old Persian as an important propagandistic device. In a similar fashion, the Hittite kings may have viewed the use of the hieroglyphic script as a symbol of their cultural independence from Mesopotamia. This interpretation is all the more likely since the appearance of the first phonetic hieroglyphic inscriptions roughly coincides in time with the shift from Akkadian to Hittite as the principal language of cuneiform texts in the Hittite capital Hattusa in the fifteenth–fourteenth centuries bc (van den Hout 2009). In the case of longer texts recorded on clay tablets, the change of a written language would represent a sufficient statement of nationalistic self-assertion. By contrast, the short inscriptions on stamp seals largely consisted of personal names and, therefore, could in principle be read in any language. Therefore, the use of the new hieroglyphic script was the most efficient way of stressing their indigenous character. The available archaeological record confirms the hypothesis that the Anatolian hieroglyphic script originally evolved for making short inscriptions on personal objects. The stamp and cylinder seals from Anatolia and northern Syria dating back to 2000–1700 bc already feature a number of symbols that will later constitute a part of the Anatolian hieroglyphic inventory (Catalog No. 95). After the formation of the Hittite kingdom in about 1650 bc, individual symbols begin to be combined with each other for the purpose of rendering simple messages. Although the “Kubaba-seal” (Catalog No. 96) was probably carved in a later period, the interplay of signs on this object is typologically similar to the practices of the Hittite Old Kingdom. By the fourteenth century bc one can observe the emergence of a phonetic syllabary that made it possible to record unambiguously personal names, such as the name of Massanawiya (Catalog No. 97). But inscriptions of this type were not yet linked to the grammar of any particular Anatolian language. The final step, made in the thirteenth century bc, was the use of hieroglyphic signs for marking endings of nouns and verbs. Only at this stage do we observe the functional extension of hieroglyphic writing to other genres, such as monumental royal inscriptions, and its close association with Luwian. At the same time, the evolved script was conducive to making longer inscriptions on personal objects (Catalog No. 98).
In order to learn more about the region where the script under discussion was first created, it is important to determine the spoken language(s) of its inventors. It is common for many archaic scripts to use pictograms as phonetic signs in such a way that the beginning of a word depicted by a pictogram constitutes its derived sound value. Thus, in the early Canaanite alphabet, the letter b depicts a house, reflecting the fact that the Canaanite word for house is *bayt, k is a pictogram depicting a hand, since *kapp “(palm of) hand” begins with the sound k, and so on (see 12. The Invention and Development of the Alphabet, this volume). The analysis of Anatolian hieroglyphs suggests that some of the pictograms derive their phonetic values from the Hittite language, while others draw upon their Luwian equivalents, as illustrated in table 15.1. This implies that the creators of the script were equally familiar with the Hittite and Luwian languages. Therefore fourteenth-century Hattusa, where the extensive presence of native Luwian speakers can be confirmed through the analysis of personal names, references to the use of Luwian in Hittite administrative texts, and structural interference between Luwian and Hittite, emerges as the most likely venue for the phonetic elaboration of Anatolian hieroglyphs (Yakubovich 2009). Three bilingual inscriptions are to be highlighted in connection with the decipherment of the Anatolian hieroglyphic script. The seal of the western Anatolian king Targasnawa, inscribed in hieroglyphs and in cuneiform, allowed the British scholar A. H. Sayce to give the correct interpretation of the logograms for “King” (rex) and “Land” (regio) as early as 1880. This was the beginning of ancient Anatolian philology. The extensive Luwian and Phoenician bilingual inscription of Karatepe (southeastern Turkey), found in 1947, provided a solid confirmation of many hypothetical readings that were advanced by scholars of Luwian in the 1920s and 1930s. This discovery helped to establish the study of “Hittite hieroglyphs” as a universally accredited philological field. The discovery of short Urartian inscriptions both in Mesopotamian cuneiform and Anatolian hieroglyphic transmission on large vessels found at Altıntepe (northeastern Turkey) prompted the reevaluation of phonetic values of several important hieroglyphic signs (Hawkins, Morpurgo-Davies, and Neumann 1974). These “new readings” helped to establish a very close genetic relationship between the

Luwian language of the longer hieroglyphic inscriptions and cuneiform texts. At the same time, there remains much space for new interpretations specifying the values of individual Anatolian hieroglyphs. To illustrate the importance of this ongoing work, it is enough to refer to the fragmentary Iron Age inscription from the Antakya region mentioning Halparuntiya (Catalog No. 99). The name of the country ruled by this king was traditionally read as “Wadasatina,” but the recent work on the sign <ta4> confirmed its alternative phonetic interpretation as la (Rieken and Yakubovich, 2010). At the same time, a new inscription found in Aleppo features the name of the same country with the initial <pa> sign. This opens the possibility that the country of Walastina/Palastina (phonetically possibly “Falastina”), in the southernmost tip of Turkey and northern Syria, had a name related to that of the biblical Philistines, who settled in the southwestern part of present-day Israel (Lawler 2009, p. 24). Thus, minor philological discoveries pertaining to the Anatolian hieroglyphic writing are likely to have a substantial impact upon how we understand the history of the Levant in the Early Iron Age.

The majority of the Anatolian hieroglyphic signs have indigenous origins. Nevertheless, a small set of foreign signs that became widespread throughout the eastern Mediterranean may have influenced the development of Anatolian writing. The clearest example is the ankh cross, originally the Egyptian symbol of life. Its popularity throughout the eastern Mediterranean need not surprise us given its importance in modern popular culture. This cylinder seal, found in the Early Iron Age layer of Tell Tayinat but presumably coming from nearby Alalakh, illustrates that the ankh symbol had already been known in the Levant in the early second millennium bc. In the Linear B writing, used for rendering Mycenaean Greek, the cursive shape of the ankh symbol acquired the sound value za. It is possible that Greek ζόη “life” was a trigger
of this process, although this does not explain the vocalism of the Linear B sign. Beginning in the fifteenth century bc, we encounter a similar sign used with the meaning vita “life” on Hittite royal seals. Many scholars were convinced about the connection between this symbol and the Egyptian “ankh” (Laroche 1960, pp. 68–69). In contrast to this established theory, James Burgin, a graduate student at the University of Chicago, has recently adduced cogent iconographic arguments for taking the vita sign as a simplified adaptation of the image of the Hittite double-headed eagle. In my opinion, there is no real contradiction between the two points of view because the Egyptian symbol of life could influence the semantics of the genetically unrelated but outwardly similar vita sign. iy

96. Stamp Seal
Chalcedony
Iron Age, 1000–700 bc
Purchased in Berlin, 1929
2.2 x 1.8 x 1.2 cm
OIM A6812
This stamp seal of uncertain provenience came to the Oriental Institute collection in 1929. It is inscribed (from top to bottom) as (DEUS) ku-AVIS, which constitutes a reference to the Syrian goddess Kubaba. The first sign deus “god” is a determinative for gods or goddesses. The second one presumably refers to the phonetic value of the first syllable of the divine name. The third symbol is a logogram that literally means “bird,” which implies that a bird was Kubaba’s symbol in Syrian iconography. Interestingly enough, a bird of prey is also a symbol of the Phrygian mother goddess Cybele, whose name is possibly etymologically connected to that of Kubaba (Munn 2008). The monumental inscriptions from Carchemish contain the fuller spelling of the same theonym as (DEUS) ku-AVIS-pa-pa.
The inscription has close parallels on a number of Iron Age seals, none of which was documented in the course of controlled excavations (Hawkins 2000, pp. 577–80). The name of Kubaba appears on them either alone or together with the name of the sun god. This group is typologically quite unusual, since Anatolian hieroglyphic seals normally refer to the names of their owners and not to deities. Nonetheless, the fact that Kubaba’s name was correctly read for the first time only in 1931 (Laroche 1960, p. 77) strongly suggests that the seals of this group are genuine despite their uncertain origin. It is simply impossible to imagine that they were all falsified before their meaning became clear to modern scholars, especially given the fact that the earliest of them were found in the nineteenth century. For occasional cuneiform “divine seals,” offering a remote parallel to this group, see Collon 1987, p. 131. iy

Turkey, Chatal Höyük (Amuq), Level IIIb, quadrant v-13
2.3 x 1.9 x 1.0 cm
OIM A12728
This seal was found on February 10, 1934, on the northeast spur known as Area 1 on the mound of Chatal Höyük (Haines 1971). Level IIIb has been described as a residential area of irregularly laidout mudbrick complexes with packed earth floors and has been dated to roughly 1000–500 bc. The seal has a rectangular, tabloid form. It is lengthwise perforated with holes measuring 0.4 cm at the outside but slightly narrowing toward the inside. It was made of stone with a light beige color. The two large, carved sides are flat with rounded edges. The side with the inscription bears Anatolian hieroglyphic signs within a rectangular border measuring 1.95 × 1.55 cm. The signs have been carefully laid out over three “lines.” The three signs are centered, the middle sign wa/i filling the entire middle line. The two other signs are each placed in the center flanked by simple vertical incisions in line 3, and by a vertical incision and the sign for “man” (VIR) in line 1 in the following way:
| VIR DEUS | wa/i | i(a) |
This results in a name, deus-wa/i-i(a), which from the determinative vir must be a man’s name. Filling in the Luwian word for “god” massan(a/i)for the deus sign (word signs or logograms are customarily rendered in Latin) it can be read
as Mas(sa)nawiya or Massanawaya. The problem, however, is that names ending in -wiya are thus far exclusively attested for women. Reading the name Massanawaya leaves the -w- to be explained.
Another possibility would be to use the Hittite word for “god” šiu-, which could result in a name Šiwaya. When turned along its short side and turned 90 degrees to the left the engraving on the other side shows what seems to be a bird-like creature facing left. This engraving fills the entire surface and there is no trace of a border. Rectangular seals inscribed with Anatolian hieroglyphs of this kind are rare. The seal’s closest parallel is one now kept in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations in Ankara. Reportedly, it stems from the same general region, that is, Gaziantep or Kahramanmaraş, according to Ali and Belkıs Dinçol (1980, pp. 7f., 21f., pl. 5, no. 5; Mora 1987, p. 290, no. XIIa 2.28, pl. 87). According to their description it is of almost identical size (2.1 × 1.7 × 0.9 cm), form, and material. The inscription (piti-ya vir bonus) is likewise laid out symmetrically within a rectangular border with the signs for vir and bonus and an additional filler antithetically on either side although less carefully executed than the Chatal Höyük exemplar. It too has a perforation through its long side. However, as opposed to the seal from Chatal Höyük this seal has no figure engraved on its reverse and shows the same inscription on both sides in practically identical fashion. The date of the Ankara seal cannot be determined, since it does not come from a regular excavation, but it is usually dated to the thirteenth century bc (cf. Dinçol 1980, p. 17; Mora 1987, p. 346). The seal in the Oriental Institute’s collection was found in the Iron Age levels of Chatal Höyük. However, as opposed to the second millennium,

This seal was found on July 21, 1937, during Oriental Institute excavations. It has a gold setting along the edges with knob-like protrusions on both short ends. With those knobs the total length is 2.2 cm. The setting leaves the flat carved side on the bottom open and has small clamps pointing upward around the curved side to a height of 4 mm. Originally it probably was a ring. The very well-preserved inscription is finely incised and runs in an oval band formed by the gold setting on the outside and a single drawn line on the inside surrounding a recumbent lion in the center. The inscription reads:
za-a-wa/i SIGILLUM-za EXERCITUS-la/i/u-mu-wa/isa SOL SACERDOS (or SOL-sa SACERDOS)
The signs face inward and the inscription starts on the lower right just below the lion’s rear. The za-signs date the inscription to the Iron Age. After the SACERDOS or in between the SACERDOS and the za(-a-wa/i) there is a small hook (<) that might have been intended as marking the beginning (or end) of the inscription. If so, the text says “This is the seal of Kula(n)muwa, priest of the sun god.” It also possible (David Hawkins, personal communication) that the “hook” is a smaller variant of the sasign that we see at the end of the personal name (EXERCITUS-la/i/u-mu-wa/i-sa). In this case, the sa may be read as a case ending following sol and can be understood as “(This is the seal of Kula(n)muwa, priest,) blessed by the sun god.” This seal belongs to a small group of five socalled ownership seals (see Hawkins 2000, pp. 573,

14. the beginnings of writing in china

A
s anyone who has ever been to a Chinese restaurant knows, the experience can be daunting not only for the abundance of dishes listed on the menu (and often on the wall) but also perhaps even more so for the names of the dishes and especially for the way they are written. Despite the widespread belief that the Chinese writing system is pictographic or ideographic, I suspect that few patrons will be able to see the “beef strips” in the name or the “fish” in the many dishes containing the graph or its many derivatives. In fact, all four of these characters are pictographic, or at least were when they were first created over three thousand years ago. If we could imagine going into a restaurant in thirteenth-century bc Anyang, the time and place of the earliest-known examples of Chinese writing, we might be better able to pick out or especially (though we might be more likely to find “turtle” on the menu). However, their depictive qualities became progressively less apparent as the script developed, to the point that today it is probably misleading to refer to even them as pictographs, not to mention the 99 percent or more of current Chinese characters that depict primarily the sound of the word, such as , , , , , , and for “squid” (yóu), “abalone” (bào), “tuna” (wéı), “shark” (jiāo), “salmon” (guı ̆), “carp” (lı ̆), and “eel” (mán), among just the different kinds of fish that might be found on the menu of a Chinese restaurant in America.
That the Chinese script is the only one of the four ancient writing systems to remain in use today is both an advantage and a disadvantage in trying to describe it. As the examples depicting the forms of the character for “fish” suggest, the script in use today — whether the “simplified” script used in mainland China or the “traditional” script used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and most American restaurants — has evolved a long way from its earliest usage, both in the detail of individual characters and in the general system itself (fig. 13.1). On the one hand, the continuity of use allows us to trace that evolution with considerable confidence; there is no need for a Rosetta Stone for us — at least those of us trained to do so — to read the ancient script. On the other hand, because we know the script of one period, we run the risk of anachronism when we rely on that knowledge to read the script of another period. Descriptions of the script today are likely to misrepresent, to a rather considerable extent, that ancient script. Conversely, descriptions of the most ancient script now known will diverge, also to a rather considerable extent, from the later historical script. However, my assigned topic in this essay being the origins of writing in China, it is that most ancient script that I try to describe. As did writing elsewhere, writing in China began with picture writing, but eventually took a decisive turn toward depiction of sounds, if by “writing” we mean the visual record of language.

regard marks painted on Neolithic pottery as the beginning of writing. Some of these marks bear a certain resemblance to individual characters in the later Chinese script, such as the following from the mid-fifth-millennium bc site of Banpo, in presentday Shaanxi province, in the west of China:
However, most of these marks could be said to resemble characters in other scripts as well, and none of them occurs in any sort of linguistic context. Other scholars have focused on more complex marks found on pottery from the Dawenkou culture of eastern China some two millennia later, such as and , interpreting the first of these as depicting the sun rising over the horizon and the second as the sun rising over mountains. Without even asking why the second mark should depict the horizon as being over the mountain, we should simply note that these marks too do not occur in any sort of linguistic context. It is not until the oracle-bone inscriptions of the late thirteenth-century bc that we find grammatically connected marks that certainly record language (see Calaog No. 101). There is no archaeological evidence with which to address the related questions of how long before that time writing developed and in what contexts. (There are lively debates, especially among Western scholars, as to whether writing developed gradually or rapidly, and whether it developed exclusively in a “religious” context or, as in the ancient Middle East, it was tied to court administration, but these will have to be topics for another occasion.) Although the oracle-bone inscriptions are primitive in comparison with the Chinese script of today, they do reflect a fully mature writing system. These inscriptions on turtle-shell and ox bone (and thus known in Chinese as “shell-and-bone writing” [jiágu ̆wén]) (fig. 13.2) derive from divinations performed at the royal court of the last nine kings of the Shang dynasty (ca. 1220–1050 bc). It is doubtless an accident of preservation and discovery that these divination records are the earliest-known written records from China — there was almost certainly other writing at the same time done on the more perishable media of bamboo and wooden strips, and from slightly later there begin to be inscriptions on bronze vessels (as, for example, Catalog No. 100) — but it is
a more or less happy accident. Especially from the beginning of this period, the inscriptions concern a wide range of topics, from birth-giving to warfare, from settlement building to the harvest, from the weather to the king’s toothaches, and so, despite their limited context and more or less formulaic nature, the inscriptions provide a surprising amount of information about the cultural life of the time and, to a somewhat lesser extent, about the nature and sorts of writing that were possible. The inscriptions typically begin with a “preface,” which can indicate any or all of the following information: the day of the divination, the “diviner” presiding, and, in later examples, the place of divination. Then follows the divination proper, known since no later than the seventh century bc (and doubtless much earlier as well) as the “charge” or “command.” Except in the very earliest examples of divination, this charge was phrased as a declarative statement; thus, “We will attack such-and-such a state,” rather than “Should we attack such-and-such a state?” Although the effect of this declarative mode of charging the turtle may not have differed much from questioning it, especially through much of the Shang dynasty, when divinations were customarily performed

in positive–negative pairs (“She loves me” — “She loves me not”), the theological implications are interesting; in the subsequent Zhou dynasty (1045–249 bc), divination charges were formulaically phrased as prayers (“We will do such-and-such; would that it succeed”). Following the “charge,” the most complete inscriptions might include also a “prognostication,” almost invariably done by the king himself, and/or a “verification,” which indicates what actually did happen (almost invariably always confirming the king’s prognostication). There can also be separate inscriptions recording the crack “number,” which crack was to be “used,” and “bridge notations” (inscribed on one or the other of the two wing-like protrusions on the side of the turtle plastron) usually indicating who contributed the turtle and/or who prepared it. I will quote here just one very famous pair of divinations from the reign of King Wu Ding (reigned ca. 1220–1190 bc) regarding the birth-giving by one of his principal wives, the Consort Hao, the discovery of whose tomb in 1975 rates as one of the great accomplishments in the history of Chinese archaeology. The inscriptions illustrate well the four different portions of a full divination, and the rubbing of the plastron also displays well the cracks in the plastron (which is what the king examined in making his prognostication) and the numbers associated with them.
Crack-making on jiăshēn (day 21), Que divining: “Consort Hao will give birth and it will be advantageous.” The king prognosticated and said: “If it be a dīng day that she gives birth, it will be advantageous; if it be a gēng day that she gives birth, it will be extensively auspicious.” On the thirty-first day, jiăyín (day 51), she gave birth. It really was not advantageous; it was a girl.

It would be possible to use this pair of divination inscriptions to arrive at some far-reaching conclusions
about the nature of Shang life, but that too must be a topic for another time. For now, however, I turn my attention to an overview of the script. Discussions of the Chinese writing system usually begin with the Shuō wén jie ̆ zì or Discussion of Design Graphs and Analysis of Composite Graphs by Xu Shen (ca. ad 55–149), the earliest extant analytical dictionary in China. The postface to this dictionary of 9,353 different characters divides them into six categories, giving two examples for each. I provide a literal translation of the categories, as well as the translations used in the English edition of Qiu Xigui’s Chinese Writing, the most authoritative overview of the Chinese writing system, including especially its earliest periods (though note that Qiu did not define the fifth category, “Turning and Commenting,” saying that “it is basically unnecessary today to pay any attention to” it):
“Pointing at Affairs” or Semantographs:
shàng “above”; xià “below”
“Resembling Shapes” or Pictographs:
rì “sun”; yuè “moon”
“Shapes and Sounds” or Phonograms:
jiāng “river”; hé “river”
“Converging Meanings” or Syssemantographs:
wu ̆ “military”; xìn “trust”
“Turning and Commenting”: kăo “father”; lăo “aged”
“Loaning and Borrowing” or Loangraphs:
lìng “leader”; zhăng “elder”
The first two of these categories are, as both their literal translations and Professor Qiu’s more formal terms would suggest, what we would normally refer to as pictographs, in the first case more conceptual, in the second more realistic. Although the modern characters , , , and have again diverged sufficiently from their origins as perhaps to be unintelligible to the uninitiated, their original shapes should be more or less clear at a glance: , , , and . Characters of these two types make up about 10 percent of the characters in the Shuō wén jie ̆ zì, though they probably constitute a third or more of all deciphered oracle-bone characters. The category “Shapes and Sounds,” or phonograms in Qiu Xigui’s terminology, is far and away the

largest category in the Shuō wén jie ̆ zì, as it is also in the modern script. It too is largely unproblematic: it features characters composed of two or more components, of which one serves to indicate the semantic classification (and thus is often termed the “classifier” or “determinative”), and one serves to indicate the pronunciation (and is thus usually termed the “phonetic”). The two examples given by the Shuō wén jie ̆ zì, and , both meaning “river” ( usually being used for rivers of southern China, while tends to be used for rivers of northern China), both feature the classifier , which derives in turn from the character shuı ̆ “water” (originally written ), together with a component that indicates the pronunciation: in the case of , now pronounced jiāng (anciently pronounced *krông), the component is , now pronounced gōng (anciently pronounced *kông); in the case of hé (*gâi), the component is kě (*khâiɁ, which is in turn derived from *kâi). But for one feature, this category potentially would have led to the Chinese script becoming purely phonetic: the phonetic components tended not to be chosen at random, but rather were often chosen because they were semantically meaningful as well. Thus, for instance, the phonetic component for the word jiāng “river” is , which was originally the pictograph of a “spade” (there are other explanations of the character, but most of them involve a pointed excavating tool with a long handle). Other words written with this phonetic component include gōng “work,” gōng “attack,” hóng “goose” (for its long neck?), hóng “rainbow,” hóng “pink” (but originally deriving from “needle”), kōng “hollow, empty,” go ̆ng “to build” (a foundation), and so on. Similarly, the phonetic component for hé “river” derives originally from the pictograph of an ax handle, (subsequently written kē *kâi; the ax handle is perhaps better seen in the pictograph hé “to carry on the shoulder”: ), with an added “mouth” component, , to indicate that it was only being used for the sound. Other words written with the same phonetic component share this image: kě “draft pole” (of a chariot), gě “slender bamboo,” qí “chisel,” qī “to stand on one foot,” and so on. It is surely no coincidence that these two phonetic components, each in its own way originally words for long, narrow objects, were used to represent the sounds of the two words for “river,” which after all
is also a long, narrow object. Other phonetic components were certainly available, and some of them would have provided a closer match for the pronunciations *krông and *gâi (not to mention the later pronunciations jiāng and hé), but they would not have contributed as well to the meaning of the characters. The Shuō wén jie ̆ zì provides a special twofold analysis for some, though by no means all, such characters, terming them “‘Converging Meanings’ with one component ‘Also Phonetic’” (which, inspired by the terminology used in the English translation of Qiu Xigui’s Chinese Writing, might be termed a “phonophoric-syssemantograph”). Although the semantic contribution of many of these phonetic components has long since ceased to be apparent, it can often be divined at the earliest stages of the script. The fourth category of characters in the Shuō wén jie ̆ zì is “Converging Meanings” or syssemantographs in Qiu Xigui’s terminology. It refers to the joining together of two or more semantic components to arrive at a third, convergent meaning. The two examples that the Shuō wén jie ̆ zì gives are both problematic, but for different reasons. Xìn “trust” is composed of the component for “man” (rén ) and the component for “language” (yán ) and is said to mean “a man standing by his word.” While it may be that the “man” adds some meaning to the word (the character is also commonly written with components for “thousand” [qiān ] and “body” [shēn ], in both of which “man” is both a semantic and phonetic component), it is also clear that it also indicates the pronunciation of the word: xìn “trust” was pronounced *sins while rén “man” was pronounced *nin. This too would seem to be a phonophoric-syssemantograph, if not purely a “Shape and Sound” phonograph. The other example of this category, wu ̆ (*maɁ) “military,” is readily analyzed as comprising the components zhı ̆ (*təɁ) “foot” and gē (*kwâi or *kôi) “dagger-ax” (the oracle-bone form is ). It seems clear that neither component can readily serve as the character’s phonetic, but what meanings converge? According to the Shuō wén jie ̆ zì, following a much older gloss, the component zh ̆ı “foot” stands instead for its extended meaning “to stop,” and the two components together therefore mean “to stop fighting,” a counter -intuitive sense for “military” that surely owes more to later moral philosophy than it does to the intrinsic nature of

the language. In fact, in oracle-bone inscriptions it is more likely to have meant “armed soldiers on the march,” a sense as pictographic as it is convergent of two separate meanings. Because of these problems, perhaps the most influential Western accounts of the origin and early development of the Chinese language and script, those of Peter Boodberg (1937, 1940) and his student William G. Boltz (1994), have argued that no complex characters should be analyzed as lacking a phonetic component. This seems clearly to be wrong, especially for the early period of the language reflected by the Shang oracle-bone inscriptions. Rather, more reasonable is the suggestion of Qiu Xigui (2000), the leading Chinese authority on the topic, that groups these “Converging Meanings” characters together with those of the “Pointing at Affairs” and “Resembling Shapes” categories as all being pictographic. Among numerous examples of this category, Qiu Xigui cites three different characters combining different components with a “knife” (dāo ) component: yí “cut off the nose (as a punishment),” the archaic form of the character, , being a “knife” underneath the pictograph of a nose ( ; i.e., zì “nose”); shān (the oracle-bone form of which is ) “to excise” (as in to erase brush-written characters on bamboo strips by shaving them off with a knife), combining a “knife” with “bound bamboo strips”; and jié ( ) “to clean fish,” combining a “knife” with a “fish.” Another particularly pictographic example to add to these examples might be that for the word yuè “to cut off a foot (as a punishment),” one oracle-bone form of which is written (other examples replace the knife with a “hand” holding a “saw,” , and/or accentuate the victim’s remaining foot). Another allograph, , seems to replace the saw head and cut-off foot with the graph for “meat” ( ). It was this version that eventually became the conventional way of writing the character, though the “meat” was in turn replaced by the graphically similar “moon” ( ; i.e., yuè) and came to serve as the phonetic component of the character: yuè . The last two categories of characters as analyzed by the Shuō wén jie ̆ zì are relatively rare (especially the category “Turning and Commenting,” about which almost no one can agree and for which the Shuō wén jie ̆ zì provides almost no examples), but the category “Loaning and Borrowing” is not without interest. It
refers to one word for which a pictograph exists being used to write another homophonous word, usually one that would be difficult to depict (generally known as the rebus principle). Common examples are hé “to carry on the back” and hé “what” and jī “basket” and qí “he, she, it” (as well as a modal particle). Hé was originally written simply , the oracle-bone form clearly being a pictograph of a man carrying an ax handle , and thus is a good example of what I have termed above a phonophoric-syssemantograph, combining the two semantic components “man” (i.e., rén ) and “ax handle” (i.e., kē , itself a loan character for the word kě “able”), with kě also serving as the phonetic. Because it was more or less homophonous with the word hé “what,” the character was “borrowed” to write that word. Later in the development of the script, in order to differentiate the two different words, an extra semantic component (ca ̆o “grass”) was added to the character for the word “to carry on the back.” A similar process is seen in the case of jī “basket” and qí “he, she, it”: the original graph for jī “basket,” the pictograph , was borrowed to write qí “he, she, it.” Then, to differentiate the two words, the semantic element “bamboo” (i.e., ) was added to the character for “basket.” For several centuries, the pictograph continued to be used to write the word qí “he, she, it,” but by about 800 bc it too was modified with the added phonetic component jī (which eventually became graphically fused with the original pictograph, so that it was no longer distinguishable as a separate component). Another important pair of words that seems to have undergone a similar “borrowing” process and that illustrates several interesting developments with the Chinese script is diān (the archaic pronunciation of which was *tîn) “the crown of the head” and tiān (*thîn) “heaven.” Even though the Shuō wén jie ̆ zì defines tiān “heaven” as diān “the crown of the head,” still the relationship between the words has been only dimly recognized. Part of the confusion stems from the dictionary’s analysis of the character as “Converging the Meanings” of a horizontal line ( , not necessarily the character yī “one”) and the character dà “great,” understood as “the highest, above which there is nothing else.” In fact, the original form of the character for tiān “heaven” was , featuring a round top rather than a horizontal

line. It seems likely that this was originally a pictograph of a man accentuating the head and thus stood for the word diān “the crown of the head,” and that the character was then borrowed to write the nearly homophonous “heaven.” It is likely that from an early time the round head was also identified as the character dīng (*têng) “top of a nail head” (subsequently written as dīng , another case of “Loaning and Borrowing”) and served as the phonetic component of the character (an allograph of which is in fact dı ̆ng [*têngɁ]). This phonetic component was lost when the round head was replaced with a horizontal line, part of a gradual simplification of the script, with rounded and curved strokes tending to become squared and straightened, and otherwise made easier to write. As the above analyses show, the Chinese script as seen at its stage of development at the time of the Shang oracle-bone inscriptions was still strongly pictographic in nature, though it is important to note, and as some of the examples considered above show, it became ever less so. This has caused a controversy between paleographers, who tend to focus on written characters, and linguists, who focus on spoken language and for whom, indeed, language is only spoken; for most linguistic theories, writing is epiphenomenal and can be defined as writing only insofar as it renders speech. Yet, it is not hard to demonstrate that Shang oracle-bone inscriptions could and did render in writing distinctions that could be made in speech only less economically. For instance, consider the words mu ̆ “male,” written conventionally as , and pìn “female,” again written conventionally as ,
in both cases employing a phonetic component (tu ̆ in the case of mu ̆ , and bı ̆ in the case of pìn ) together with a “bovine” ( ) signific. In oraclebone inscriptions, however, these two phonetic components could be combined with an array of animals to indicate their gender: “bulls” or “cows” , to be sure, but also “rams” and “ewes” , “boars” and “sows” , “stallions” and “mares” , and even a “buck” deer: . There is no indication that these different characters were pronounced differently, or that they gave rise (at least directly) to different words in the later language. This is by no means an isolated case; similar examples could be shown for types of sacrifice (differentiating both the offerings and the vessels used to hold the offerings), for objects of hunting and trapping, and, in one notable case, even what was to be gotten in an attack on the western Qiang people: “cowries” or “heads” (both apparently allographs of fú “to capture”). It might well be said that this is an indication of an immature stage of the script. However, much later examples could also be adduced, as for instance in the early twentieth century when written differentiations of the pronouns “he” (tā ), “she” (tā ), and “it” (tā or ), or, for Christians, even tā “He” (i.e., Christ or God), were introduced for the single word tā that had always sufficed to indicate the generic third-person pronoun. It seems to me that this might be explained as a way in which the script has influenced the language itself, which, I would like to suggest, is not an entirely uninteresting phenomenon and should certainly count as a fine example of “visible language.”

Inside the bottom of the basin, an inscription of eleven characters runs from top to bottom in two columns reading right to left: Zhong Cheng zuo you bao yi yong xiang wang ni wei yong “Zhong Cheng makes his treasured vessel, to use to feast the king’s reciprocal immortalizing.”1 This brief text commemorates a celebratory event: the commissioning of this vessel to entertain the king by a court official or attendant named Zhong Cheng.

Like almost all bronze inscriptions, this text is countersunk in the metal.

Given the vessel’s extraordinary technical skill and artistry, it may seem curious that its message is visible only from above and would have been completely concealed when the tureen was filled with food. Yet being spiritually as well as physically integral to the vessel, these words would have been recognized by all participants, both living and dead, in a feast in which this vessel filled a prominent role. ep

These bits of turtle shell (the plastron or flat underbelly of the turtle) and ox bones bear some of the earliest examples of writing in China. They are records of divination — essentially the attempt to influence the outcome of future events — performed on behalf of the kings of the last portion of the Shang dynasty (ca. 1200–1050 bc) and concern a wide range of topics of concern to the kings. The shells (and bones) were prepared in advance of the divination by carving and drilling hollows into the back of the shell. Then, at the moment of the divination, a hot brand was inserted into a hollow, causing a stress crack in the shape of to appear on the front of the shell. (Number 1986.385, the largest piece exhibited here, provides a good illustration of such a crack, including the scorching of the shell caused by the hot brand.) The shape of this crack apparently indicated the result (positive or negative, auspicious or inauspicious) of the divination.

15. the development of maya writing
15. the development of maya writing
joel W. palka
L
ate Classic Period Maya writing (ca. ad 600800) is one of the best-understood scripts in ancient Mesoamerica. Maya inscriptions number in the thousands, and they are found from northern Yucatán down to Chiapas, western Honduras, and El Salvador. In this extensive region, the Maya built numerous cities with impressive stone-block temples and open plaza spaces with stone stelae and panels, surrounded by their agricultural fields and pole-and-thatch residential constructions. The Maya interacted heavily through trade, warfare, political alliances, and collective ritual, resulting in a shared culture and artistic tradition. The ancient Maya are well known for their finely made painted ceramics, jade carvings, incised shell, and sculpture that carry ornate inscriptions. We live in a time of exciting advancements in the decipherment of Late Classic Maya writing; in the last fifteen years, epigraphers have explored the linguistics of Maya writing and deciphered many more signs, leading to an excellent comprehension of Late Classic Maya inscriptions. Classic Period Maya texts (ca. ad 250–900) include calendars, classifications of objects, descriptions of events in the lives of elites, and even scribal signatures. The Classic Maya wrote mostly in a Ch’oltian Mayan language, although Yucatec Mayan is also represented in the script. The texts accurately represent language, including vocabulary, verb conjugation, syntax, and sounds such as glottal stops and long vowels. However, readers embellished or “performed” the narratives, especially with public monuments and during rituals. The Classic Period Maya script balances the use of logographs, or word signs, and syllables, hence, scholars labeled it “logosyllabic.” There are over three hundred signs in the Late Classic Maya script, many of which are standardized syllables and logographs. However, the scribes often varied the way they wrote, invented glyphs, and reorganized the signs, resulting in a great diversity in the script and its incomplete decipherment. Thus, it takes many years for students of Maya writing to memorize
the sign repertoire and even longer to write in the script. Surprisingly, we know little about the origins and earliest phases of Maya writing. By pondering the nature and distribution of Maya writing, clues to its origins can be revealed. The material and social contexts of Maya writing suggest that its origins cannot be traced to a single factor, such as for either religious, political, or economic purposes. Additionally, various early Maya scripts evolved pointing to their complex origins. It is also important to note that Maya text, image, and object are closely interrelated. The Maya scribes planned the hieroglyphs as painstakingly as they crafted the fine artifacts bearing the texts. Elite art became more extraordinary, socially important, and economically valuable once the fine calligraphy was added. In this essay, I discuss the historical background of Maya writing, then I explore the contexts in which Maya writing appears. It is on the topics of what and where Maya writing is seen that we may find intriguing clues toward its origins. Maya writing is found on everything associated with elites, including jade ear spools, carved bones, stucco building facades, ceramic vessels, and stone monuments. The context of Maya writing also indicates that its permanence was important. Maya texts were painted on paper, wood, cloth, and even human skin, but most of these inscriptions have not been preserved. Nonetheless, the extensive corpus of Maya writing exists because texts were purposely carved on non-perishable materials. Thus, records of events could be transmitted over generations, and the spoken words and writing itself, all symbols of power in Mesoamerica, would be preserved.

area of the Yucatán Peninsula. Known scripts include Olmec, Zapotec, Nuiñe, Teotihuacán, Maya, Isthmian, Aztec (Nahuatl), and Mixtec writing. Mesoamerican writing occurs on carved stone monuments, ceramics, murals, wood, and portable objects, such as jade, shell, and bone. Mesoamerican peoples created countless books and records on paper or animal skin, but only a few examples, which date to the late precontact and post-conquest periods, have survived. Mesoamerican scripts generally combine logographs and syllables. For instance, a Maya word for jaguar, balam, was written either logographically in the Classic period as a jaguar’s head, phonetically as bala-ma (the last vowel a is dropped), or the jaguar-head sign with a syllabic ba prefix or ma suffix acting as phonetic complements. The historical context of Mesoamerican writing illuminates the origins and nature of Maya script. The Maya were not the first literate people in ancient Mexico and Central America, since both Olmec and Zapotec scripts were invented earlier. Writing was more than likely invented in the Early or Middle Formative period (ca. 1200–600 bc) with the evolution of politically complex societies of the Olmec in the Gulf Coast region of Mexico, in addition to Guerrero, Oaxaca, central Mexico, and Central America. Olmec civilization had large settlements, hereditary elites, interregional trade, and elite art, all of which provided important pre-conditions for the development of writing. Numerous green stone plaques and celts owned by elites, such as the “Humbolt Celt” and “Tlaltenco Celt,” exhibit iconography and short inscriptions. Unfortunately, all early writing in Mesoamerica remains undeciphered, but the signs probably include noble titles, god names, and calendar dates. A few years ago, scholars reported an inscription on a serpentine block discovered during modern construction at Cascajal, Veracruz, near the Olmec site of San Lorenzo. Recent studies of the stone support its antiquity, and it may be associated with Middle Formative-period pottery and iconography. But the stone’s exact provenance and date are unknown. The incised signs resemble other Olmec hieroglyphs, they repeat in obvious patterns, and the text possibly has a top-down, left to right reading order similar to other Mesoamerican scripts. Ceramic figurines found by archaeologists at the site of Canton Corralito,
Chiapas, Mexico, dated to about 1300–1000 bc exhibit similar writing. Other examples of the earliest Mesoamerican writing are found in the highlands of Oaxaca, mostly on the monumental Danzante sculptures, which depict captives and sacrificial victims. Radiocarbon dates associated with the excavation of a stone mon ument at San José Mogote place the sculpture and its two glyph inscriptions at around 600 bc. Monuments at nearby sites, including Monte Alban, date the beginnings of writing here to about 500–200 bc. This script may record the Zapotec language.
early maya texts and contexts
Maya writing developed in the tradition of Mesoamerican writing initiated by the Olmec and Zapotec. More than likely, literate peoples in the Gulf Coast or highland Oaxaca influenced Maya writing. Early Maya writing occurs on the same media as other scripts, it probably represents language through logographs and syllables, and it more than likely records calendars and events in the lives of elites, perhaps rulers. However, while the Maya adopted writing from other Mesoamerican cultures and borrowed a few signs, such as the signs for “cloud” and “hill,” they invented their own hieroglyphs. The earliest Maya writing differs considerably from Classic to Postclassic times. Maya writing was widespread by about 100 bc and it was placed on everything. Interestingly, not one, but several early scripts were found throughout the Maya region. The presence of different scripts is intriguing since the Maya shared iconographic styles and material culture. Maya writing only became standardized through elite interaction and political expansion during the Classic period. Classic Maya texts are read in hieroglyph blocks from top to bottom and from left to right; the individual sign clusters within the blocks are read in a similar manner. The early Maya inscriptions are linear in organization, with fewer paired columns like in the Classic period, and we assume that they too are read from top to bottom and left to right. Human heads often face to the viewer’s left, perhaps to the beginning of of the sentence like in Egyptian and Classic Maya writing.

15. the development of maya writing
The earliest-known Maya writing, which dates to 400–200 bc, appears in murals on palace walls at the site of San Bartolo, Guatemala. One glyph may be read ajaw “lord/noble,” which is a common Late Classic Maya title. The painted glyphs flank depictions of anthropomorphic deities, and the signs may refer to these gods, their actions, or perhaps the names and titles of Maya lords. Scholars assume these texts are in a Maya language since some signs resemble later ones, and the writing is associated with Maya material culture and architecture. However, their linguis tic affiliation is a mystery. The easiest discernible signs in Maya writing are calendar dates, since they typically have numbers or coefficients from one to nineteen, and the named day signs are written in cartouches. Dots or fingers stood for the number one, rectangular bars represented the number five, a round moon-like glyph denoted “twenty” or “many,” and a cross-hatched lobed “fanlike” symbol meant “zero,” but these later two are more common in the Classic period. Other logographs represented calendar periods, such as twenty days and twenty years (of 360 days), that combined with coefficients to produce larger numbers. For example, during the Classic period, a bar placed immediately to the left of the sign for twenty Maya years designated “100 years.” Many of the earliest Maya inscriptions do not exhibit calendar dates with clear bar and dot numbers. Perhaps the numbers were symbolized by logographs, or possibly head variants as seen in some Late Classic texts.
Monumental Art
Maya writing on stone stelae, buildings, and murals or “public” contexts paralleled other early Mesoamerican scripts. Early Maya writing often occurs on carved stone monuments, like at the sites of El Baul, Chiapa de Corzo, Kaminaljuyu, El Portón, Chalchuapa, El Mirador, and Takalik Abaj. The scripts at these centers vary, which may be due to differences in language, local scribal practices, script chronologies, or localized writing traditions. The early stone monuments are concentrated in the Maya highlands, which speaks to the elevated cultural importance of writing in this area and perhaps to interaction with literate peoples in adjacent highland Oaxaca. Conversely, during the Classic period, carved monuments with writing predominated in the Maya
lowlands, including the sites of Uaxactun, Yaxchilán, Tikal, and Copán. The early Maya script predating the Classic period most likely records the names and titles of Maya elites or their gods. Numbered day and month signs in the Maya calendar occur on monumental public art, but they are more common in the Classic period. Importantly, the calendars not only marked the tim ing of rituals and events in the lives of the elite but also were likely used to track periods related to the Maya economy, such as market days, tribute schedules, and gift exchanges. Maya writing on monuments was paired with im ages of elites or deities indicating the close association between art and script. Furthermore, Maya calligraphy was well developed from the very beginning, which indicates an early origin date or direct diffusion of writing, and the high artistic quality of the script cannot be overemphasized. The hieroglyphs are prominently displayed next to images, and they are frequently large enough to see from a distance. Maya writing also occurs as high-relief carvings instead of incising or painting. The appearance of the writing suggests that it may have been used to appeal to the sensation of touch rather than just the senses of sight (seeing) and sound (reading). Touching the sculptures would accentuate the connection between art and writing, in addition to drawing attention to their beauty, importance, and permanence.
Portable Objects
Personal objects with carved or incised Maya script further exemplify the intersections of art, writing, touch, and permanency. Some of the earliest examples of carved Maya writing are on polished jade, bone, and shell objects. Like Late Classic Period examples, these early inscriptions probably include the objects’ owners’ names and titles, deity names, and signs related to the qualities of the objects themselves. Later objects of carved bone often display texts that mark the kind of object and ownership, such as u baak “his/her bone,” followed by the person’s name and titles. The redundant marking of objects with obvious labels, such as his/her “bone” or “jade” on objects made from these materials, is a fascinating aspect of Maya writing. The practice may be due to artistic reasons and for making words permanent. However, this early writing may also have

stemmed from economic activity and transaction recording, since fine objects with owners’ names in the Classic period were tribute payments or gifts to other elites. The objects with texts describing their qualities and owners would also have had higher cultural and economic value over non-inscribed ones. From the earliest times, elite Maya artists created the texts and designs simultaneously on portable objects and monumental art. It appears that some noble scribes added texts at a later date, sometimes centuries after the object was finished. For example, many early Maya inscriptions were added to the reverse of objects. The texts reinforced the artistic quality of the objects and made them more socially and economically important. These permanent words described the qualities, ownership, or deities asso ciated with the objects. If the objects were tribute items or gifts, then the givers’ or previous owners’ names and titles were forever visible for everyone to see, touch, and read. Maya elites held and manipu lated these objects, and therefore, the carved texts would be felt and not erased with use.
the rise of early maya writing
In summary, the first Maya writing developed from earlier Mesoamerican scripts in southern Mexico during a period of growth in complex regional polities and human populations. The texts did not exist before the rise of elites, who controlled political, economic, and religious domains, and it arose following extensive interregional interaction. The script exhibited fine calligraphic style and occurred on elite Maya material culture, indicating that educated elites learned and transmitted writing from region to region over time. Early Maya writing consisted of different scripts that were used locally by relatively small numbers of people in a restricted interaction sphere. Thus, the creation of early Maya writing may have been like the development of historic religious and nativistic texts around the world
by indigenous prophets following colonial subjugation, such as the Cherokee script. In this instance, Sequoyah created the Cherokee written syllables in the early nineteenth century following interaction with literate American colonists. In the Maya case, regional elites copied earlier literate Mesoamerican cultures and developed writing to possibly communicate religious and political information to gain local power and prestige following interregional interaction with other expanding Mesoamerican polities, including the Olmec and Zapotec. Additionally, Maya writing was integrated into the crafting of the objects themselves and their iconography, thus script, artifact, and art cannot be separated. Maya writing made objects more aesthetically pleasing and thus of greater economic and political value. The possible inclusion of personal names and titles in early Maya writing could have been important for recording economic transactions between elites, such as tribute payments and gifts. Inscriptions with calendar dates may have recorded these transactions underscoring the economic potential of Maya writing. The permanency of the carved texts was also crucial for social reasons. Inscribed texts could not be easily erased, and the words could be touched while the objects were being manipulated and read over many generations. Histories and words could be transmitted to descendents and viewers through time. The power of words and the person who reads or speaks them has always been central to Mesoamerican politics and religion. In this sense, early permanent texts may have been similar to writing on charms in ancient to modern Europe, where the preserved words empowered their creator. According to the nature and context of Maya writing, then, the origins and development of the script cannot be attributed to one, but rather to many, inter linked factors that involved interregional interaction and the religious, economic, political, and social life of the elites.

Limestone
Late Classic Maya, ad 700/800
Possibly Bonampak/Lacanha area, Mexico or Guatemala 21.6 x 41.9 cm
The Art Institute of Chicago, gift of Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Baker, AIC 1971.895
This sculpture seems to be the top portion of a stone cylinder or column. It depicts what appears to be a deceased ancestor (perhaps in the form of a mummy bundle) ensconced in the earth. His name glyph consists of a rabbit head with a curled element on top. The top hieroglyphic text states that an undeciphered object (perhaps this column) was likely erected in ad 670, some 29 years after the death of this presumed depicted ancestor (probably in ad 641). The side text states that the deceased ancestor’s later successor (and possibly grandson) completed a number of years in office as lord. His name (possibly “Turtle Back”) and titles (e.g., “Smoker/Incenser Lord”) are given and he is said to be from a place called “Bubbling/Gurgling/
Upwelling Water,” likely in the Usumacinta River region. This text demonstrates fairly common aspects of Maya hieroglyphic writing, such as elision of weak consonants and conflation of signs. jb
translation
Fifteen days, two “months,” and nine and twenty “years” [since] “Rabbit?” died on 2 Chikchan 8 Uniw, then a ??-bil is erected on 6 Ajaw 18 Ik’ Sihom. Six? “years” are completed in lordship [by] Ancestor-Turtle, the Smoker/Incenser Lord, Turtle-back?, he of Bubbling/Gurgling/Upwelling Water, [the Xukalnah Lord].

237
abecedary A sequential listing of the alphabetic letters of a writing system.
accusative case The marker of the direct object of an action in a sentence. Like other cases, the accusative must be marked to be described as a case (e.g., English distinguishes an accusative case in the personal pronouns: “Mary slapped him.”; “The dog bit me.”).
acrophony The use of a graph or sign to represent only the initial phoneme of the original value of the graph (adj. acrophonic).
acrophony is also used to describe the practice of naming letters using a word beginning with that letter (the Hebrew alphabet names its letters using acrophony, e.g., kaph “palm” is used to name the letter representing the phoneme /k/).
affix A morpheme that is attached to the beginning (prefix) or end (suffix) or inserted into (infix) a word stem to form a new word. Affixes can form derived words (e.g., shame-less; laugh-able) or inflected forms of words (e.g., look-ed; dog-s; buy-ing). agglutinative language Agglutination is where affixes are added to a word (e.g., aim-less-ly). Agglutinative languages employ agglutination widely throughout the language to express grammatical relationships. In agglutinative languages, verbs are not inflected, but affixes are attached to a base verb to express the various characteristics of the verbal action, including voice, person, and tense or aspect. Modern agglutinative languages include Hungarian, Turkish, and Japanese. Example Sumerian
šeš.ĝu10.ene.ra. “For my brothers.” šeš (noun “brother”)-ĝu10(1st person singular possessive suffix “my”)-ene(plural marker)-ra(dative case marker “to, for”)
Akkadian An extinct language belonging to the East Semitic branch of the Semitic language family. It is related to other Semitic languages such as Hebrew and Arabic. Akkadian and the related Eblaite language are the only known East Semitic languages. Akkadian appears in the written record in Mesopotamia from the midthird millennium bc to the first century ad. There are two major dialects of Akkadian, Assyrian and Babylonian.
allograph A variant form of the shape of a graph or sign (e.g., A, a, a, etc. in the modern Latin script).
allomorph A variant pronunciation of a morpheme based on neighboring sounds (e.g., English plural -s has an allomorph [z] when following a voiced consonant: dogs [z] vs. cats [s]).
alphabet A standardized set of basic written symbols (letters), each of which represents roughly a phoneme in a language.
Aramaic A Semitic language with a 3,000-year history leading into modern times. The Aramaic script was widely adopted for other languages and is related to the Arabic and Hebrew scripts. It was used as an administrative language of the Assyrians in the first millennium bc and was the everyday language in Israel during the Second Temple period (539 bc–ad 70).
Aztec (Nahuatl) The Nahuatl writing used by the Aztecs in pre-Columbian central Mexico was a primarily pictographic and ideographic system augmented by the rebus principle and syllabic signs. Some do not consider Aztec script to be true writing, but rather proto-writing because the system did not record complete sentences or phrases. The script was used to record Nahuatl, a language in the Uti-Aztecan language family. Modern Nahuatl is still spoken by about one and a half million indigenous speakers in central Mexico.
biliteral A single sign that represents a sequence of either two consonants, two semi-consonants (e.g., w or y), or a combination of both.
boustrophedon Writing alternate lines in opposite directions, also called bidirectional writing. The Greek term refers to the turns made by plowing oxen (adj. boustrophedonic).
case (cuneiform tablet) This refers to the way in which cuneiform tablets were organized and demarcated by the scribe. Sections of the tablet that were sectioned off by the scribe with straight lines are called “cases.” On the earliest tablets, cases were often square and contained one sign or a couple of signs. As time passed, more signs were included in each case, signs began to be written in order within a case,
and cases became more linear, marking the lines of a text. By the first millennium bc, lines of a text were no longer individually separated by the scribe into cases, though certain sections of a text were often marked, such as the end of part of a literary text or particular sections of administrative documents.
case (grammatical) A grammatical category used to identify and describe the relationship of different elements in a sentence (e.g., the accusative case marks the direct object of an action, and nominative marks the subject).
Ch’oltian Maya An extinct language from Mesoamerica written using Maya hieroglyphs that was spoken in eastern Chiapas and Guatemala. It belongs to the Maya language family and was thought to be a prestige dialect in the Classical period (ca. ad 600–800).
classifier See determinative.
consonantal writing Writing that ig
nores vowels, using consonants and semiconsonants (such as glottal stops, w, and y).
Coptic A script used to write Egyptian that developed through the adaptation of the Greek alphabet in the first century ad. Six or seven signs from the Demotic script were added to those of the Greek alphabet to represent Egyptian phonemes that Greek lacked.
cryptogram A figure, representation, or written symbol with hidden significance.
cryptography Writing in code or cipher (adj. cryptographic).
cuneiform A writing system used for several different languages in the ancient Middle East from the fourth millennium bc through the first century ad where signs were made by pressing a reed stylus into wet clay. Cuneiform is named for the characteristic wedge shape of the strokes made by the triangular end of a reed stylus. The name comes from Latin cuneus (plural cunei), which means “wedge.”
Demotic The most cursive script used by the ancient Egyptians. It developed from hieratic and was written commonly on ostraca or papyrus in ink with a brush or reed. The word “Demotic” comes from Greek and means “popular,” distinguishing it from hieratic and hieroglyphics,

which were known for their use in sacred contexts.
determinative A silent graphic device where a graph or sign is used to classify a word belonging to a particular semantic category.
Example In Sumerian and Akkadian, determinatives are used to mark words such as place names, personal names, divine names, city names, wooden and metal objects, and certain kinds of animals and professions.
diachronic Relating to the study of phenomena (such as of a language or culture) as they change over time.
Eblaite An extinct Semitic language centered at the city of Ebla, located in modern northern Syria, during the mid-third millennium bc. Eblaite was one of the first Semitic languages to be committed to writing and, with Akkadian, is one of the only known members of the East Semitic branch of the Semitic language family.
Elamite An extinct language with no known language relatives that was used by the Elamites, and which takes its name from Elam, a city located in modern Iran. Elamite was one official language of the Persian empire from about the sixth to the fourth century bc.
epigraphy The discipline of studying, deciphering, and interpreting inscriptions, especially ancient inscriptions.
epistolary Relating to or written in the form of a letter or correspondence.
faience (Egyptian) a non-clay-based ceramic composed of crushed quartz or sand with a surface finished by glass transition or vitrification. This process gives faience a variety of bright blue-green colors.
genitive case The marker, mostly, of possession, but it can be used to mark other grammatical functions depending upon the language (e.g., in Sumerian, the gentive case is marked by the morpheme -ak e2 dig̃irak “the house of the god” or “the god’s house”).
glottographic (system) Referring to a system of communication that represents speech so that the language is recoverable from the system itself. Also called “true writing.”
glyph A figure, symbol, or character engraved, incised, or carved in relief.
grammatology The study of writing systems and scripts, coined by I. J. Gelb. Graeco-Babyloniaca texts A small
group of school tablets from the turn of the current era that have an Akkadian or Sumerian text on the obverse with a
Greek transcription given on the reverse. The Greek transcriptions give indications of the pronunciation of both Akkadian and Sumerian, despite the fact that both languages had long ceased to be spoken. Amazingly, even though Sumerian, for example, had not been spoken in nearly two millennia, the Greek transcriptions reflect the language’s phonemic inventory and pronunciation. These texts date to the very end of the cuneiform tradition, sometime between 50 bc and ad 50.
graph The smallest definable segment in a stretch of writing or print, sometimes synonymous with sign.
hieratic A cursive script related to Egyptian hieroglyphics that was commonly written in ink on ostraca or papyrus with a reed brush.
hieroglyphs The written symbols of a pictographic writing system characterized by their use in ceremonial or monumental contexts, such as their use for religious texts, on temple walls, or on stone monuments. Egypt, Anatolia, and the Maya, among others, employed different and unrelated systems of hieroglyphic writing.
Hittite An extinct language used in ancient Anatolia (modern Turkey) during the second millennium bc. Hittite belongs to the Indo-European family of languages, which includes languages such as English, Greek, the romance languages, Hindi, and Russian.
homophony When words with different meanings have the same pronunciation. These words are called homophones or homonyms. Homonyms may or may not share a logographic sign or alphabetic spelling (e.g., bear [verb] vs. bear [noun]; flower vs. flour).
Horus name The oldest attested name of an Egyptian king. The Horus name (king’s name) was usually written inside of a representation of a palace facade, called a serekh, with the image of Horus sitting atop or next to the serekh.
Hurrian The extinct language of the Hurrian people, who inhabited northern Mesopotamia during the end of the third through the second millennium bc. Hurrian belongs to the Hurro-Urartian language family along with Urartian. It was the official language of the Mittani empire in the mid-second millennium bc.
iconicity The similarity, resemblance, or analogy between the form of a sign or graph and its referent.
iconography A visual representation, a symbolic representation, and conventional meanings associated with a visual image,
or the study of the visual arts and their subjects, meanings, and interpretations. ideogram/ideograph A sign or graph
that represents an idea or concept such as the graphs used to write “above” and “below” in Chinese (adj. ideographic).
infix An affix that is inserted into the middle of the word to which it is added.
Example Infixes, though common in many languages, are extremely rare in English. Infixation in English sometimes occurs with the plural for certain words, such as spoonful or passerby spoon<s>ful; passer<s>by.
inflection/inflexion The modification of a word to express different grammatical categories, such as number, gender, tense or aspect, case, etc.
isolate (linguistic/language) A language without any known language relatives, such as Sumerian. One commonly cited modern isolate is Basque, which is spoken in Spain and France.
Isthmian script A script used in and around the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico during the first few centuries ad. Some claim it to be descended from users of Olmec iconography and thus call it EpiOlmec, but Isthmian is a preferred label since it indicates the geographical range of the texts, but does not assume descent from Olmec.
lexeme The minimal unit of the vocabulary of a language (e.g., jump, jumped, and jumping are forms of the English lexeme jump). Lexemes can be one word or multiple words, as is the case with some idiomatic expressions (e.g., by and large “in general,” catch on “understand”). The individual parts of a multi-word lexeme are one word lexemes in other contexts.
lexical Relating to the words or vocabulary of a language, separate from its grammar.
lexicography The craft of compiling and writing dictionaries, and the scholarly endeavor of describing semantic (and other) relationships between words in the lexicon (vocabulary) (adj. lexicographic or lexicographical).
ligature A sign that combines two or more individual signs into one.
logo-consonantal (script) Where
logorams are extended phonetically to express the consonants of the words they represent, ignoring vowels (e.g., in Egyptian, sꜢ “duck” and sꜢ “son” could be written using the same graph, though they likely were pronounced with different vowels).

logogram A written symbol (sign or graph) that represents a word. Some logograms used in written English include % “percent” and & “and.”
logo-syllabic (script) Where logograms are extended phonetically to express syllables (e.g., Sumerian logograms a “water” and gi “reed” are also used to express the phonetic syllables a and gi/ge, respectively).
Luvian/Luwian An extinct Indo-European language spoken in Anatolia during the second and first millennia bc. It is closely related to Hittite. Luvian was written using both cuneiform and Anatolian hieroglyphs.
Maya script A logo-syllabic, hieroglyphic script used in ancient Mesoamerica during the first millennium ad to write mostly a Ch’oltian Maya language, part of a language family found in Mesoamerica. The Maya script is one of the best understood but not the earliest writing of ancient Mesoamerica.
Mixtec writing Mixtec writing incorporated pictorial representations of scenes and events with a logographic writing system. Mixtec is a tonal language, where difference in meaning is distinguished with variations in tone and vocal inflection. Thus, many of the phonetic symbols in Mixtec writing are used to represent tone. Mixtec belongs to the Oto-Manguean language family in Mexico. We have eight manuscripts that use Mixtec writing and cover a span from about ad 940 to 1550.
metonymy Where a word or concept is substituted for another word or concept to which it is closely related, or of which it is a part. This can be done either verbally (e.g., in English, “counting heads” means “counting people”) or visually in a script (e.g., using a pictograph of an animal’s head to represent the whole animal).
monosyllabic Consisting of one syllable. A monosyllabic language consists primarily of words that are one syllable in length.
morpheme The smallest unit of meaning in a language. Morphemes can be entire words (e.g., song, harm, walk) or parts of words (e.g., song-s, harm-ful, walk-ed). The latter are called bound morphemes because they only occur when combined with other morphemes.
morphogram A graph or sign that represents the most basic form of a morpheme regardless of pronunciation (e.g., English plural -s is written with the morphogram s despite the fact that in certain phonetic contexts it has the pronunciation [z]: dogs [z], birds [z] vs. cats [s], plants [s]).
morphography Using graphs or signs to represent morphemes based on meaning rather than sound.
morphology The structure and form of words as well as the linguistic study of those structures (adj. morphological).
morphophonemic A change in the pronunciation of a morpheme when in contact with other sounds (e.g., the English plural -s as pronounced in dogs [z] and cats [s]).
nominative case The marker, generally, of the subject of a verb or predicate verb (e.g., In Akkadian the nominative case is marked with the morpheme -um added to the end of a noun awīlum illik “the man went”).
Old Persian One of two attested Old Iranian languages alongside Avestan. Old Persian was first attested in the written record during the time of the Achaemenid dynasty (ca. 550–330 bc). The oldest Old Persian inscription is the Behistun inscription (ca. 520 bc), in which Darius (550–486 bc) takes credit for inventing the Old Persian cuneiform script. It was the first language deciphered that used a cuneiform script.
Old South Arabian A consonantal alphabetic script used around the southern edge of the Arabian Peninsula. It is believed to have split from the Proto-Sinaitic script as early as 1300 bc, but it is not attested until around the eighth century bc.
Olmec script A script used by the Olmec people in Mesoamerica, who lived in the tropical regions of Mexico from about 1250 to 400 bc.
orthography The study of spelling and the rules governing the use of written symbols in a standardized system (adj. orthographic). ostraca Pieces of pottery or stone.
Palaic An extinct Indo-European language attested in the Hittite capital of Hattusa during the second millennium bc.
paleography The study and scholarly interpretation of earlier, especially ancient, writing and forms of writing. In particular, paleography is the study of the physical characteristics of a script (adj. paleographic).
pars pro toto Latin for “(taking) part for the whole,” pars pro toto is where part of an object or concept is used to represent the entire object or concept (e.g., using a pictograph of an animal’s head to represent the entire animal or set of animals).
Phoenician An extinct Semitic language that was spoken in the coastal area of the
Levant in what was Canaan in ancient times, including parts of modern Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, and Malta. The Phoenician script was a non-pictographic consonantal alphabet that became one of the most widely used scripts. It was adapted to write Greek and Aramaic, which were both adapted further to write Latin, Hebrew, and Arabic.
phone Any speech sound in a language. Unlike phonemes, phones comprise all the speech sounds of a given language regardless of meaning or distinction between words.
phoneme Any one of the set of speech sounds that convey a distinction in meaning between words. (e.g., /b/ and /p/ are two phonemes in English bit and pit, bat and pat are distinct words because the first phoneme of each word is distinct.) One phoneme may have several pronunciations, or phones, that are regarded as identical by the speaker (e.g., in English, the phoneme /w/ can be voiced or voiceless without affecting meaning). The various pronunciations of a single phoneme are known as allophones.
phonemic Relating to the phonemes of a language (e.g., the phonemic inventory of a language is the inventory of all its phonemes).
phonetic Relating to the speech sounds of a language (e.g., the phonetic inventory of a language is the inventory of all its phones, or speech sounds).
phonetic complement A sign that gives part of the phonetic rendering of a logogram that has multiple readings (English writing often uses phonetic complements when writing ordinal numbers 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.).
phoneticism The phonetic representation of speech sounds.
phoneticize To represent speech with a system of graphs or signs corresponding to speech sounds (noun: phoneticization).
phonogram A graph or sign used to represent sound rather than meaning. This is in contrast to logograms (which represent words or morphemes) and determinatives (which are not pronounced).
phonographic (system) When a writing system uses graphs or signs that represent sounds (phonograms), such as an alphabetic writing system.
phonology The systematic use of sound to encode meaning in spoken language. The study of the way sound functions in any given language (adj. phonological).

pictography Writing using signs or graphs that express meaning through a graphic resemblance to a real-life object. These graphs are called pictographs or pictograms.
polyphony When words with different pronunciations are represented with the same sign or graph.
Example In Sumerian, the sign ka can be used to write several different words including ka “mouth,” zu2 “tooth,” dug4 “speak,” gu3 “voice,” and inim “word,” among others.
prefix An affix that precedes the element to which it is added (e.g., un-known).
protoliterate A term referring to the very earliest stages of writing in ancient Mesopotamia. The Protoliterate period includes, for example, the Uruk IV and Uruk III phases of writing and lasts up until about 2900 bc.
proto-cuneiform A term referring to the earliest phases of the archaic cuneiform script, including the Uruk IV and III stages of the script
Proto-Sinaitic/Proto-Canaanite A consonantal alphabetic writing system that was used in several inscriptions in the Sinai, Egypt, and Canaan during the second millennium bc.
radical Any one of the consonants or semi-consonants belonging to a root, or, in certain cases, the root itself (e.g., the Akkadian verb šapāru has three radicals špr).
rebus principle Extending the use of existing pictograms or graphs to represent other words, morphemes, and syllables with the same or shared sounds (e.g., in Sumerian, the sign da “side” can also be used to write the homophonous comitative verbal affix da “with”).
referent The entity in the external world to which a spoken or written expression refers. A referent can be a person, object, animal, or concept, among others.
root The base form of a word before inflection or the addition of affixes (e.g., in English, the root of mice is mouse, the root of singing is sing, the root of taxation is tax, etc.).
sealing A term used to refer to the impression made by a cylinder or stamp seal on wet clay.
semagram See determinative.
semantic Referring to the meaning of a word (e.g., semantic range = the range of possible meanings incorporated by a word).
semantograph A pictograph designed to represent a conceptual word, such as “above” or “below.”
semasiographic (system) Referring to a system of communication that only represents ideas. Semasiographic systems are not bound to speech, and thus the ideas represented can be verbally communicated in any number of ways in any language.
semiotics The study of signs and symbols, whether natural or artificial (adj. semiotic).
serekh An Egyptian word for a rectangular representation of a palace facade inside of which a king’s name was written.
sign A written character that conveys meaning through a word, morpheme, syllable, or one or more phonemes, sometimes synonymous with graph.
stylus A writing utensil used by impressing, etching, or incising the writing material. In Mesopotamia, reeds were cut to make styli, which were impressed onto wet clay to write cuneiform signs.
suffix An affix that follows the element to which it is added (e.g., love-ly).
Sumerian A language with no known language relatives that was used in ancient Mesopotamia. It died out as a spoken language at some point in the late third or early second millennium bc but continued to be used as a written scholarly language up through the first millennium bc.
syllabary A set of graphs or signs that represent syllables.
syllable The smallest segment of speech pronunciation that must contain one vowel and may or may not contain one or more consonants or semi-consonants.
syllabogram A written graph or sign that represents a syllable.
synchronic Relating to the study of phenomena (such as of language or culture) of one period without reference to historical antecedents.
syssemantograph A graph where two or more elements with distinct meanings are joined together to represent a third meaning (e.g., in Chinese “man” + “language” = “trust.” This combination is said to mean “a man standing by his word.”)
Teotihuacán script A Mesoamerican script named after the city Teotihuacán
in Mexico which began to be used around ad 350 or 450. It combined word signs of a nominal and titular nature with narrative or pictographic scenes, which make the signs difficult to identify and decipher.
tokens Considered precursors to writing, tokens are small clay counters used throughout Mesopotamia in various accounting systems in the fourth millennium bc. They can be simple (without markings) or complex (with markings and incisions).
transliteration The transcription of the graphs or signs of one writing system into those of another. Transliteration is used by modern scholars to represent cuneiform, hieroglyphs, and other ancient writing systems with more familiar alphabetic characters.
triliteral A single sign that represents a sequence of three consonants or semiconsonants (e.g., w or y).
Ugaritic An extinct Semitic language dating to the thirteenth century bc in Ugarit, located in the northwest of modern-day Syria near the modern town of Ras Shamra. It was written using a consonant-only alphabetic cuneiform script.
uniliteral A single sign that represents either one consonant or one semi-consonant (e.g., w or y).
Urartian The extinct language of ancient Urartu, the capital of which was located near Lake Van in eastern Turkey. Urartian was first attested in the ninth century bc and appears in the written record through the sixth century bc. It belongs to the Hurro-Uraritan language family with Hurrian.
verbal root The base form of a verb before inflection or the addition of affixes. For example, verbal roots in Semitic languages often consist of two or three (sometimes more) consonants because vowels as well as the reduplication or infixation of consonants are dependent upon the form of the verb. In Akkadian, *prs is the verbal root of parāsum “to cut, decide” (purus “Decide!”; iparras “He will cut”; iptarsū “They have cut”; and so on).
Yucatec Maya A Maya language spoken in the Yucatán Peninsula, northern Belize, and Guatemala, which is also represented in the Maya script.
Zapotec A family of related languages in Mesoamerica spoken by the Zapotec people from the southwestern-central highlands of Mexico. It is estimated that there are over half a million current speakers of Zapotec languages in the world. The ancient Zapotec script is hieroglyphic.
