‘...’pulad’ of Central Asia. The oasis of Merv where crucible steel was also
made by the medieval period lies in this region. The term ‘pulad’ appears in
Avesta, the holy book of Zoroastrianism and in a Manicheen text of Chinese
Turkestan. There are many variations of this term ranging from the Persian
‘polad’, the Mongolian ‘bolat’ and ‘tchechene’, the Russian ‘bulat’, the
Ukrainian and Armenian ‘potovat’, Turkish and Arab ‘fulad’, ‘farlad’ in Urdu
and ‘phaulad’ in Hindi. It is this bewildering variety of descriptions that was
used in the past that makes a study of this subject so challenging.’ (p.44)

"In the Muslim world of the 9th-12th centuries CE, the production of fuladh, a Persian
word, has been described by Al-Kindi, Al-Biruni and Al-Tarsusi, from narm-ahanand
shaburqan, two other Persian words representing iron products obtained by direct
reduction of the ore. Ahan means iron. Narm-ahan is a soft iron and shaburqan a harder
one or able to be quench-hardened. Old nails and horse-shoes were also used as base
for fuladh preparation. It must be noticed that, according to Hammer- Purgstall, there
was no Arab word for steel, which explain the use of Persian words. Fuladh prepared
by melting in small crucibles can be considered as a steel in our modem classification,
due to its properties (hardness, quench hardened ability, etc.). The word fuladh means
"the purified" as explained by Al-Kindi. This word can be found as puladh, for instance
in Chardin (1711 AD) who called this product; poulad jauherder, acier onde, which
means "watering steel", a characteristic of what was called Damascene steel in
Europe.“

"Bulat is a type of steel alloy known in Russia from medieval times; regularly being
mentioned in Russian legends as the material of choice for cold steel. The name булат is a
Russian transliteration of the Persian word fulad, meaning steel. This type of steel was used by
the armies of nomadic peoples. Bulat steel was the main type of steel used for swords in the
armies of Genghis Khan, the great emperor of the Mongolian Empire. The technique used in
making wootz steel has been lost for centuries and the bulat steel used today makes use of a
more recently developed technique...Carbon steel consists of two components: pure iron, in
the form of ferrite, and cementite or iron carbide, a compound of iron and carbon. Cementite is
very hard and brittle; its hardness is about 640 by the Brinell hardness test, whereas ferrite is
only 200. The amount of the carbon and the cooling regimen determine the crystalline and
chemical composition of the final steel. In bulat, the slow cooling process allowed the
cementite to precipitate as micro particles in between ferrite crystals and arrange in random
patterns. The color of the carbide is dark while steel is grey. This mixture is what leads to the
famous patterning of Damascus steel.Cementite is essentially a ceramic, which accounts for
the sharpness of the Damascus (and bulat) steel. "
