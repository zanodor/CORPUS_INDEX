Ante Diem XII Kalendas January
Modern Date : December 21st
Ante Diem XII Kalendas January
Twelfth Day to the Kalends of January
This day is for special religious
observance.
The Divalia
This day is the true Winter Solstice, though it was always celebrated
a few days later. This is likely because of the difficulty the ancients
had with precisely defining when the sun had begun its return to a
higher azimuth, as well as the inaccuracies of pre-Julian calendars,
which tended to slip back a few days a year.
This day is sacred to Dia, the goddess venerated by the Arval
brothers. This day was also sacred to Angerona, and she was
worshipped at the altar of the goddess Volusia, as was Dia. She is
the goddess of silence and is pictured holding her finger to her lips.
Her sealed lips represent a warning not to reveal the secret name (or
taboo) name of Rome, which some claim is Amor (Love, Roma
backwards).
This is also the fifth day of the Saturnalia. The Saturnalia is one of
the most festive and uninhibited that the ancient Romans celebrated.



It went on for seven days and encompassed the Winter Solstice, a
time of religious observance for cultures the world over. Feasts were
provided by the temples and were open to the public, the poor and
the homeless. Servants and masters were met on equal terms.
Unable to prevent the people's festive inclinations at this time of
year, the early Christian leaders moved Christmas to December and
claimed the celebration for their own. During the Saturnalia, rules
were set aside, schools were closed, and slaves could meet their
masters on equal terms. Human kindness was the theme and war
and the punishment of criminals was halted. The exchange of gifts
was universally practiced. Strenae, which were boughs to which
were attached cakes or sweetmeats, were exchanged by visitors and
guests. Other common gifts included wax candles (cerei) and
sigillaria, which were doll-like clay figures, a particular favorite of
children.
In Greece, Hercules and Ceres were honored this day (as Heracles
and Demeter).
Decima, the middle Fate in charge of the present, presides over
December, but the month may have received its name as the tenth
month of the Roman calendar. Vesta, patroness of fire also laid claim
to the month of December.
The Winter Solstice
The Winter Solstice, a celebration of the sun, called Yule (from Jol in
honor of Jolnir, another name for Odin), Midwinter, and Alban
Arthuan (Druidic) is celebrated today. This is the oldest of all
sabbats, 12000 to 20000 years old. Many sun gods were honored
today, Horus, Helios, Dionysus, and Mithras. Yule ends with 12th
Night when all the decorations are cleared away. The poor were



traditionally given money or presents during Yule. The needy could
ask for money, a practice known as "mumping" or "thomasing" in
honor of St. Thomas. Fresh food and drink was laid out as a feast for
roaming Yuletide ghosts. Holy and ivy, traditional Yuletide decorative
plants were adopted from Odin and Dionysus. The Christmas tree
may have been adopted from Yggdrasil.
The Winter Solstice is the last of the year's four Cardinal Festivals.
Sun enters Capricorn and Winter begins as the Sun reaches the 270°
point on the zodiac wheel, and begins his homeward swing toward
the 0° point, at the Spring Equinox. The Solstice is traditionally the
most important festival of the year as it marks the birth of the Solar
Child at the time of receding Winter light, and is thus the moment of
affirming faith in the re-emergence of earthly life in the Spring, and
also, symbolically, in the soul's survival beyond death. In the Tarot,
this relationship is signified by the contrast between the Hermit, a
Saturnian figure who wears a black robe and carries the lantern of
esoteric wisdom; and the exuberant child of the Sun card.
The Winter Solstice is unique among days of the year — the time of
the longest night and the shortest day. The dark triumphs but only
briefly. For the Solstice is also a turning point. From now on (until the
Summer Solstice, at any rate), the nights grow shorter and the days
grow longer, the dark wanes and the Sun waxes in power. From the
dark womb of the night, the light is born.
Many of the customs associated with the Winter Solstice (and
therefore with other midwinter festivals such as St Lucyʼs Day,
Saturnalia, Hanukkah, New Years and Twelfth Night) derive from
stories of a mighty battle between the dark and the light, which is
won, naturally, by the light. Other traditions record this as the time a
savior (the Sun-Child) is born to a virgin mother.



The Battle Between Old and New, Dark and Light
The Romans celebrated from December 17th to December 23rd with
the festival Saturnalia, during which all work was put aside in favor of
feasting and gambling. The social order was reversed, with masters
waiting on their slaves. The Saturnalia is named after Saturn, who is
often depicted with a sickle like the figures of Death or Old Father
Time. Astrologically speaking, Saturn is saturnine: gloomy, old,
dutiful and heavy. He was the god who ate his own children rather
than let them surpass him. For new life to flourish, for the sun to rise
again, it is necessary to vanquish this gloomy old fellow. Therefore,
the feasting and merriment of the midwinter season are religiously
mandated in order to combat the forces of gloom.
The day following the Saturnalia, was the Juvenalia, according to Z
Budapest in The Grandmother of Time, a holiday in honor of children
who were entertained, feasted and given good luck talismans. This
makes sense. After vanquishing the Old King, itʼs time to celebrate
the new in the form of children, the New Year's Baby, the Son of
Man.
The Birth of the Sun
Christʼs birthday was not celebrated on December 25th until the 4th
century. Before then, December 25th was best known as the
birthday of the Persian hero and sun-god, Mithras. The myth tells
that he sprang up full-grown from a rock, armed with a knife and
carrying a torch. Shepherds watched his miraculous appearance and
hurried to greet him with the first fruits of their flocks and their
harvests. The cult of Mithra spread all over the Roman empire. In 274
AD, the Roman emperor Valerian declared December 25th the
Birthday of Sol Invictus, the Unconquerable Sun.



Christ was also not the first miraculous child born to a virgin mother.
As Marina Warner points out, “the virgin birth of heroes and sages
was a widespread formula in the Hellenistic world: Pythagorus, Plato,
Alexander were all believed to be born of woman by the power of a
holy spirit.”
The union of a virgin and a supernatural force, like the couplings
between Zeus and various nymphs, was shorthand indicating the
presence of a miraculous child, a child with the powers of both
worlds. Dionysus is such a child, born of a union between Zeus and
Semele. One of the many male solar figures who are celebrated now,
at the onset of the winter solstice, is the famous British warrior hero
King Arthur, whose birthday is Dec. 21.
Parke in Festivals of the Athenians describes a women-only
midwinter festival, the Lenaia, which honored Dionysos. On this
night, Greek women “held their ecstatic dances in winter — fully
clothed in Greek dress, with castanets or the thyrsus, dancing
together with no male companions, human or satyr.” Graves calls it
the Lenaea, the Festival of Wild Women (a nice companion for the
Festival of Merry Women on Dec 14). He says a bull, representing
Dionysus, was cut into nine pieces, with one piece being burned and
the rest consumed raw by the worshippers. Dionysus was born in
winter, crowned with serpents, became a lion in the spring and was
sacrificed as a bull (stag or goat) in the summer because these were
calendar emblems of the old tripartite year. Marija Gimbutas in
Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe calls Dionysus a Year God.
Mithra was also associated with the bull (his initates were baptized
with the blood of a sacrificed bull) and shown with the emblems of
the zodiac surrounding him, suggesting that he is also a Year God.
The Lenaia occurred on the twelfth day of the Greek lunar month,



Gamelion, which falls in early winter. The twelfth day of a lunar
month (which begins with the new moon) always falls on a full moon
night. If we move this lunar festival to the solar calendar and count
from the winter solstice, the festival would occur on January 5th or
6th.
Until the fourth century, Christʼs birthday was celebrated on January
6th, on the same date when the Virgin Kore gave birth to the year
god celebrated in Alexandria with a festival called the Koreion. St.
Epiphanius complains about the hideous mockery of this rite but it
preceded the story of Christʼs birth. In the original ritual, the image
of the goddess, decorated with gold stars, was carried seven times
around her temple as the priests cried, “The Virgin has brought forth
the new Aeon!”
Although Aeon, or Eon, is now defined as “an indefinitely long period
of time; an age, eternity,” its Indo-European root aiw conveyed “vital
force, life, long life, eternity,” and the Greek form Aion meant
specifically “vital force.”
This description recalls the Egyptian ceremony re-enacting the birth
of Horus, the sun-god to Isis. All lights in the city were doused while
Isis circled the sarcophagus seven times, then brought forth Horus
who was called “the Light of the World.” Statues of Isis holding the
newly born sun god on her lap, presenting him to the world, are
similar to pose to later statues representing Mary and Jesus.
The return of the light is the most prominent feature of most
midwinter festivals. In Sweden on St. Lucyʼs Day, young girls don
white dresses and a wreath of candles and awaken their families with
cakes and song. Hanukkah, the Festival of Lights, is celebrated by
lighting candles over a span of eight days. The Christian custom of



the Advent wreath, with its four candles, one lit each of the Sundays
before Christmas, is another way of re-kindling the light.
The Christmas candle, a large candle of red or some other bright
color decorated with holly or other evergreens, was at one time a
popular custom throughout Great Britain, Ireland and Scandinavia.
One person, usually the eldest or the head of the household, is
designated as the lightbringer. She lights the candle for the first time
on Christmas Eve before the festive supper and during each of the
remaining evenings of the Twelve Days of Christmas. To extinguish
the candle, she snuffs it with tongs rather than blowing it out, since
that would blow the luck away. The candle sheds a blessing on the
household and so is protected from accidental quenching. It seems
likely that the candle also represented the coming year, just as the
weather of each of the twelve days of Christmas foretell the weather
of the corresponding month. It had protective or fertilizing powers
and was kept as a charm. In Denmark, during a lightning storm, the
remnant would be brought out and lit to protect the household.
Similar customs once surrounded the Yule log. The Yule log must
never be bought but should be received as a gift, found or taken
from you own property. Often the log to be burned at midwinter was
chosen early in the year and set aside.
Tradition varies about the type of wood to be used. Oak logs were
popular in the north of England, birch in Scotland and ash in Cornwall
and Devon. Ash is the only wood that burns freely when green and
the world-tree, Yggdrasil, in the Nordic tradition was an ash-tree. It is
important that the Yule log be the biggest and greenest log available
since the Christmas festivities will last only as long as the Yule log
burns.



In some parts of the Scottish highlands, the head of the household
finds a withered stump and carves it into the likeness of an old
woman, the Cailleach Nollaich or Christmas Old Wife, a sinister being
representing the evils of winter and death. She's the goddess of
winter, the hag of night, the old one who brings death. Burning her
drives away the winter and protects the occupants of the household
from death.
The Yule log is first brought into the house with great ceremony on
the eve of solstice, Mother Night. Usually it is decorated with holly
and ivy and other evergreens of the season. Some people prefer to
use the Yule log as a decoration and place candles on it instead, thus
transforming it into a candleabra like the menorah or the kinara. It is
lit with a piece of last year's log as described in Herrickʼs poem,
“Hesperides:”
Come bring with a noise
My merry, merry boys
The Christmas log to the firing
With the last year's brand.
Light the new block,
And for good success in his spending
On your psalteries play:
That sweet luck may
Come while the log is a-teendling.
In Italy, the Yule log is called the Ceppo. Boccaccio in the fourteenth
century described a Florentine family gathering about the hearth and
pouring a libation of wine upon the glowing wood, then sharing the
remaining wine, thus linking the Yule log with the custom of
wassailing, pouring out libations to the trees in the orchard.



The Yule log is left to burn all night, and, if possible, through the next
twelve without going out, although it may be extinguished with water.
The ashes are kept for good luck. They have magical properties and
can be scattered in the field to fertilize the soil or sprinkled around
the house for protection.
The Solstice Evergreen
Another ancient midwinter custom is decorating with greens. The
Romans decorated with rosemary, bay, laurel, holly, ivy and
mistletoe. The holly and ivy were both important midwinter plants in
Great Britain and Ireland, as seen in the mysterious medieval carol
which mentions the rivalry between them. Matthews in The Winter
Solstice provides the lyrics of a 15th century carol which refers to an
ancient battle between the two, with the Ivy representing the cold
gloominess of winter and the Holly King, the jolly spirit of the season.
The Christmas tree is of more recent origin. In her book, The Solstice
Evergreen, Sheryl Ann Karas says that the earliest record of an
evergreen being decorated comes from Riga in Latvia in 1519, when
a group of local merchants carried an evergreen bedecked with
flowers to the marketplace, where they danced around it and then
burned it. Another possible source is the custom in 15th and 16th
century Germany of hanging apples on a fir tree as a prop for the
miracle play performed on Christmas eve depicting Adam and Eve
being driven out of Paradise
Feast of Isis
In the Egyptian calendar, the same five days are the feast of Isis,
Queen of Heaven and Earth, wife and sister of Osiris (Mechir, day 6).
In west Mediterranean countries and now all over the Earth, Isis is
perhaps the most widely revered deity since the ancient Western



world, worshipped in various forms for some 4,000 years until her
power was rivaled by Christianity's Isis counterpart, the Virgin Mary,
and was ultimately suppressed by Islam. The rites of her revival are
best acted this year on the perfectly positioned weekend of Friday
the 24th and Saturday the 25th.
Soyala
Among the Hopi and Zuni peoples of the American Southwest, this
day begins the 20-day feast of Soyala, the annual festival of human
purification and renewal, counterpart to the rites of cleansing the
kivas and kachina images in the Shalako festival of Dec. 1-14.
Hertha
According to Hottes(1001 Christmas Facts and Fancies), the early
Germans considered the Norse goddess Hertha or Bertha, the
goddess of Domesticity and the home. They baked yeast cakes
shaped like slippers, which were called the slippers of Hertha, and
filled with gifts. Hottes writes:
"During the Winter Solstice houses were decked with fir and
evergreens to welcome her coming. When the family and serfs were
gathered to dine, a great altar of flat stones was erected and here a
fire of fir boughs was laid. Hertha descended through the smoke,
guiding those who were wise in saga lore to foretell the fortunes of
those persons at the feast. Hertha's altar stones became the
hearthstones of the home. We learn from this story why Santa Claus
comes down the chimney instead of at the door. It is a survival of the
coming of Hertha..."



St Thomas
Feast of St. Thomas, the famous doubting apostle who has been,
ever since he asked to check the wounds of Jesus just to be sure,
the patron saint and clown role of those who refuse to consider the
premise that once we believe it, we can see it. One of those early
saints given a feast day on or near the solstice for no apparent
historical reason, undoubtedly to divert attention from the pagan
rites associated with that date.
St Thomas grey, St Thomas grey
The longest night and the shortest day
St Thomas divine,
Brewing, baking, and killing of fat swine
On this day in England, poor women and children went "a
Thomassing" for the ingredients for the Christmas feast, particularly
wheat for frumenty and flour for Yule bread. Ghosts were permitted
to walk abroad from now until Christmas Eve.
Recent theories surround Thomas and his true role in Christianity.
Thomas in Greek means Twin, and it is thought that Thomas is the
twin brother of Joshua ben Joseph known as the Christ. Given that
this is his feast day it makes perfect sense to place it during this time
to preserve his memory. Gnostic scholars contend that Thomas also
known as James ben Joseph and Joshua ben Joseph were the
rightful Priest-Kings of Judea in the mode of Moses and Aaron. The
revolt of the brothers against Rome, the Maccabite dynasty of Herod
and the Pharisees of the Temple has come down to us distorted by
the Christian Mythos.



Beiwe/Rozhanitsa
Beiwe is the sun-goddess worshipped by the Saami, the indigenous
people of Finland. She travels with her daughter, Beiwe-Neia,
through the sky in an enclosure of reindeer bones, bringing back the
green plants for the reindeer to feed upon. On the Winter Solstice,
her worshippers sacrifice white female animals and thread the meat
on sticks which they bend into rings and tied with bright ribbons.
They also smear their doorposts with butter so Beiwe can eat the
rich food and begin her recovery.
Another Winter Goddess of the north is the Russian goddess,
Rozhnitsa. In the twelfth century, the eastern Slavs worshipped her
as an ancestor, offering her honey, bread and cheese — all bloodless
sacrifices, like those offered at the Haloa. In the 19th and early 20th
century, Russian women still embroidered and wove bright linens,
usually red on white, which depict the Goddesses of the seasons.
Although she does not mention the exact date of Rohanitsa's
festival, Mary Kelly (Goddesses and Their Offspring) writes about her
connection with the Winter season:
"Winter embroideries were made to honor the feast of Rohanitsa, the
Mother Goddess, held in late December. These cloths depict [her]
together with her daughter goddess, or with children who may or
may not be divine....[She] was often shown with deer horns
sprouting from her head or headdress....The horns are a sign that-
as tales and rock carvings confirm--in ancient times the Mother
Goddess gave birth to deer as well as children. For her feast, small,
white-iced cookies shaped like deer were given as presents or good
luck tokens."
