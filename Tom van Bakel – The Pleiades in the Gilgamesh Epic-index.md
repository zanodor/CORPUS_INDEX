The Pleiades in the Gilgamesh Epic
It was common in Sumer and Mesopotamia that when the sun passed a particular constellation everything took the shape of this constellation. For example, when the sun went through Leo, not only the sun god Utu took the shape of a lion, but also the moon god Suen, the storm god Enlil and the water god Ea. The same was true of the Pleiades, when the sun passed it everything was affected by seven, the number of visible stars in this constellation. The Flood Story from the Gilgamesh Epic provides a wonderful example of this.
The Babylonian version of the Gilgamesh epic originated between 4320 BC and 2160 BC. During this period new year began with new moon on the first of March when the sun went through the constellations Taurus and Pleiades. The surprising thing is that the whole Flood Story took place in this month, starting with the new moon and ending with the next new moon 30 days later. In this short essay I show how this Story fits into March and how seven, the number of the Pleiades, is incorporated into it.
It was customary for the gods to gather every month with the new moon to perfect the divine powers as we can read in the following verse:
A šir-namursaĝa to Ninsiana for Iddin-Dagan (Iddin-Dagan A): c.2.5.3.1
When standing in the heavens she is the good wild cow of An, on earth she instils respect; she is the lady of all the lands. She received the divine powers in the abzu, in Eridug; her father Enki presented them to her. He placed the lordship and kingship in her hands. She takes her seat on the great dais with An; she determines the fates in her Land with Enlil. Monthly, at the new moon, the gods of the Land gather around her so that the divine powers are perfected. The great Anuna gods, having
bowed before them, stand there with prayers and supplications and utter prayers on behalf of all the lands. My lady decrees judgments in due order for the Land. Inana decides verdicts for the Land together with Enlil. Her black-headed people parade before her.
In the beginning of the Flood Story the gods also gather at the new moon but now they decide not to perfect the divine powers, but to exterminate mankind:.
The Flood Story
‘You know the city Shurrupak, it stands on the banks of Euphrates? That city grew old and the gods that were in it were old. There was Anu,-lord of the firmament, their father, and warrior Enlil their counsellor, Ninurta the helper, and Ennugi watcher over canals; and with them also was Ea. In those days the world teemed, the people multiplied, the world bellowed like a wild bull, and the great god was aroused by the clamour. Enlil heard the clamour and he said to the gods in council, ‘The
uproar of mankind is intolerable and sleep is no longer possible by reason of the babel.’ So the gods agreed to exterminate mankind. Enlil did this.
The world bellowed like a wild bull, which indicated that this council happened in Taurus.



Then Ea passes the decision of the council on to the human Utnapishtim with the order to make a boat. The next morning Utnapishtim gathers his family and makes this boat in six days. The boat corresponds to the crescent of the moon, which at that time was seen as cow horns, a bowl or a boat.
But Ea because of his oath warned me in a dream. He whispered their words to my house of reeds, ‘Reed-house, reed-house! Wall, O wall, hearken reed-house, wall reflect; O man of Shurrupak, son of Ubara-Tutu; tear down your house and build a boat, abandon possessions and look for life, despise worldly goods and save your soul alive. Tear down your house, I say, and build a boat. These are the measurements of the barque as you shall build her: let hex beam equal her length, let her deck be roofed like the vault that covers the abyss; then take up into the boat the seed of all living creatures.’ ‘When I had understood I said to my lord, ‘Behold, what you have commanded I will honour and perform, but how shall I answer the people, the city, the elders?’ Then Ea opened his mouth and said to me, his servant, ‘Tell them this: I have learnt that Enlil is wrathful against me, I dare no longer walk in his land nor live in his city; I will go down to the Gulf to dwell with Ea my lord. But on you he will rain down abundance, rare fish and shy wild-fowl, a rich harvest-tide. In the evening the rider of the storm will bring you wheat in torrents.’ ‘In the first light of dawn all my household gathered round me, the children brought pitch and the men whatever was necessary. On the fifth day I laid the keel and the ribs, then I made fast the planking. The ground-space was one acre, each side of the deck measured one hundred and twenty cubits, making a square. I built six decks below, seven in all, I divided them into nine sections with bulkheads between. I drove in wedges where needed, I saw to the punt poles, and laid in supplies. The carriers brought oil in baskets, I poured pitch into the furnace and asphalt and oil; more oil was consumed in caulking, and more again the master of the boat took into his stores. I slaughtered bullocks for the people and every day I killed sheep. I gave the shipwrights wine to drink as though it were river water, raw wine and red wine and oil and white wine. There was feasting then as -there is at the time of the New Year's festival; I myself anointed my head. On the seventh day the boat was complete. -’Then was the launching full of difficulty; there was shifting of ballast above and below till two thirds was submerged. I loaded into her all that 1 had of gold and of living things, my family, my kin, the beast of the field both wild and tame, and all the craftsmen. I sent them on board, for the time that Shamash had ordained was already fulfilled when he said, ‘in the evening, when the rider of the storm sends down the destroying rain, enter the boat and batten her down.’
Utnapishtim built seven decks so the Pleiades incorporated in this boat. Moreover, he built the boat in six days, that was, in the first week of March, when the moon was waxing. On the seventh day the boat was complete.
In the second week, when the moon was still waxing, the land was swallowed up under the water. This started with the first light of dawn and lasted for six days and on the seventh day, so on the day of the full moon, everything stopped and all mankind was turned to clay.
The time was fulfilled, the evening came, the rider of the storm sent down the rain. I looked out at the weather and it was terrible, so I too boarded the boat and battened her down. All was now complete, the battening and the caulking; so I handed the tiller to Puzur-Amurri the steersman, with the navigation and the care of the whole boat. With the first light of dawn a black cloud came from the horizon; it thundered within where Adad, lord of the storm was riding. In front over hill and plain Shullat and Hanish, heralds of the storm, led on. Then the gods of the abyss rose up; Nergal pulled out the dams of the nether waters, Ninurta the war-lord threw down the dykes, and the seven judges of hell, the Annunaki, raised their torches, lighting the land with their livid flame. A stupor of despair went up to heaven when the god of the storm turned daylight to darkness, when he smashed the land like a cup. One whole day the tempest raged, gathering fury as .it went, it poured over the people like the tides of battle; a imam could not see his brother nor the people be seen from heaven. Even the gods were terrified at the flood, they fled to the highest heaven, the firmament of Ann; they crouched against the walls, cowering like curs. Then Ishtar the sweet-voiced Queen of Heaven cried out like a woman in travail: ‘Alas the days -of old are turned to dust because I commanded evil; why did I command thus evil in the council of all



the gods? I commanded wars to destroy the people, but are they not my people, for I brought them forth? Now like the spawn of fish they float in the ocean.’ The great gods of heaven and of hell wept, they covered their mouths. ‘For six days and six nights the winds blew, torrent and tempest and flood overwhelmed the world, tempest and flood raged together like warring hosts. When the
seventh day dawned the storm from the south subsided, the sea grew calm, the, flood was stilled; I looked at the face of the world and there was silence, all mankind was turned to clay. The surface of the sea stretched as flat as a roof-top; I opened a hatch and the light fell on my face. Then I bowed low, I sat down and I wept, the tears streamed down my face, for on every side was the waste of water. I looked for land in vain, but fourteen leagues distant there appeared a mountain, and there the boat grounded; on the mountain of Nisir the boat held fast, she held fast and did not budge.
In the third week of the month, in the period of the waning moon, the water subsides and after seven days Utnapishtim sends out a dove, a swallow and a raven. After the raven did not return, he threw everything open and made a sacrifice and poured out a libation on the mountain top. Seven and again seven cauldrons he set up on their stands:
One day she held, and -a second day on the mountain of Nisir she held fast and did not budge. A third day, and a fourth day she held fast on the mountain and did not budge; a fifth day and a sixth day she held fast on the mountain. When the seventh day dawned I loosed a dove and let her go. She flew away, but finding no resting-place she returned. Then I loosed a swallow, and she flew away but finding no resting-place she returned. I loosed a raven, she saw that the waters had retreated, she ate, she flew around, she cawed, and she did not come back. Then I threw everything open to the four winds, I made a sacrifice and poured out a libation on the mountain top. Seven and again seven cauldrons I set up on their stands, I heaped up wood and cane and
cedar and myrtle. When the gods smelled the sweet savour, they gathered like flies over the sacrifice. Then, at last, Ishtar also came, she lifted her necklace with the jewels of heaven that once Anu had made to please her. ‘O you gods here present, by the lapis lazuli round my neck I shall remember these days as I remember the jewels of my throat; these last days I shall not forget. Let all the gods gather round the sacrifice, except Enlil. He shall not approach this offering, for without reflection he brought the flood; he consigned my people to destruction.’ ‘When Enlil had come, when he saw the boat, he was wrath and swelled with anger at the gods, the host of heaven, ‘Has any of these mortals escaped? Not one was to have survived the destruction.’ Then the god of the wells and canals Ninurta opened his mouth and said to the warrior Enlil, ‘Who is there of the gods that can devise without Ea? It is Ea alone who knows all things.’ Then Ea opened his mouth and spoke to warrior Enlil, ‘Wisest of gods, hero Enlil, how could you so senselessly bring down the flood? Lay upon the sinner his sin, Lay upon the transgressor his transgression, Punish him a little when he breaks loose, Do not drive him too hard or he perishes, Would that a lion had ravaged mankind Rather than the f loud, Would that a wolf had ravaged mankind Rather than the flood, Would that famine had wasted the world Rather than the flood, Would that pestilence had wasted mankind Rather than the flood. It was not I that revealed the secret of the gods; the wise man learned it in a dream. Now take your counsel what shall be done with him.’ ‘Then Enlil went up into the boat, he took me by the hand and my wife and made us enter the boat and kneel down on either side, he standing between us. He touched our foreheads to bless us saying, ‘In time past Utnapishtim was a mortal man; henceforth he and his wife shall live in the distance at the mouth of the rivers.’ Thus it was that the gods took me and placed me here to live in the distance, at the mouth of the rivers.'
Then Gilgamesh also wants to obtain eternal life and Utnapishtim tells him that he must first try to stay awake for six days and seven nights..
Utnapishtim said, ‘As for you, Gilgamesh, who will assemble the gods for your sake, so that you may find that life for which you are searching? But if you wish, come and put into the test: only prevail against sleep for six days and seven nights.' But while Gilgamesh sat there resting on his haunches, a mist of sleep like soft wool teased from the fleece drifted over him, and Utnapishtim said to his wife, ‘Look at him now, the strong man who would have everlasting life, even now the mists of sleep are drifting over him.' His wife replied, ‘Touch the man to wake him, so that he may return to his own



land in peace, going back through the gate by which he came.' Utnapishtim said to his wife, ‘All men are deceivers, even you he will attempt to deceive; therefore bake loaves of bread, each day one loaf, and put it beside his head; and make a mark on the wall to number the days he has slept.' So she baked loaves of bread, each day one loaf, and put it beside his head, and she marked on the wall the days that he slept; and there came a day when the first loaf was hard, the second loaf was like leather, the third was soggy, the crust of the fourth had mould, the fifth was mildewed, the sixth was fresh, and the seventh was still on the embers. Then Utnapishtim touched him and he woke. Gilgamesh said to Utnapishtim the Faraway, ‘I hardly slept when you touched and roused me.' But Utnapishtim said, ‘Count these loaves and learn how many days you slept, for your first is hard, your second like leather, your third is soggy, the crust of your fourth has mould, your fifth is mildewed, your sixth is fresh and your seventh was still over the glowing embers when I touched and woke you.' Gilgamesh said, ‘What shall I do, O Utnapishtim, where shall I go? Already the thief in the night has hold of my limbs, death inhabits my room; wherever my foot rests, there I find death.'
Gilgamesh cannot do that and he sleeps the last six days and seven nights of the month of March. On the seventh day, so at the end of the month, Utnapishtim wakes him up and now Gilgamesh talks about his death. This corresponds to New Moon, because when the moon is dark Nanna-Suen is thought to be dead:
When the moon is dark, Nanna-Suen is thought to be dead. This is the ‘Day of Laying Down’ (Udnua). During this time, He goes into the Netherworld to judge the Dead.

The story was situated in March because in that month the rivers are increasing in volume, being fed by the melting snows at their mountain sources far to the north:
Myths of Babylonia and Assyria, by Donald A. MacKenzie:
‘In Babylonia there are two seasons--the rainy and the dry. Rain falls from November till March, and the plain is carpeted in spring by patches of vivid green verdure and brilliant wild flowers. Then the period of drought ensues; the sun rapidly burns up all vegetation, and everywhere the eye is wearied by long stretches of brown and yellow desert. Occasional sandstorms darken the heavens, sweeping over sterile wastes and piling up the shapeless mounds which mark the sites of ancient cities. Meanwhile the rivers are increasing in volume, being fed by the melting snows at their mountain sources far to the north. The swift Tigris, which is 1146 miles long, begins to rise early in March and reaches its highest level in May; before the end of June it again subsides.’ More sluggish in movement, the Euphrates,
which is 1780 miles long, shows signs of rising a fortnight later than the Tigris, and is in flood for a more extended period; it does not shrink to its lowest level until early in September.’

In addition, the water god Ea, who plays an important role in the Epic, is the presiding deity of March, de ‘Month of the Bull’:

In the Epic, Enlil makes it rain hard. On the next diagram we see that in Abu Kamal indeed the most rain falls in March, although the differences between the months of December to April are very small:

The meaning of the Pleiades
There are a number of striking stories with developments that take place in seven steps. One of these is ‘Inanna's descent to the nether world’. Before she went down, Inanna took with her seven divine powers:
She took the seven divine powers. She collected the divine powers and grasped them in her hand. With the good divine powers, she went on her way. She put a turban, headgear for the open country, on her head. She took a wig for her forehead. She hung small lapis-lazuli beads around her neck.
When Inanna came downwards the doorman Neti bolted the seven gates of the underworld:
‘Come Neti, my chief doorman of the underworld, don't neglect the instructions I will give you. Let the seven gates of the underworld be bolted. Then let each door of the palace Ganzer be opened separately. As for her, after she has entered, and crouched down and had her clothes removed, they will be carried away.’ Neti, the chief doorman of the underworld, paid attention to the instructions of his mistress. He bolted the seven gates of the underworld. Then he opened each of the doors of the palace Ganzer separately. He said to holy Inanna: ‘Come on, Inanna, and enter.’ And when Inanna entered, the turban, headgear for the open country, was removed from her head.
Then he opened each of the doors and said to holy Inanna: ‘Come on, Inanna, and enter’. And every time she had to hand over one of the divine powers. When she entered the seventh gate, the last dress was removed from her. Then the seven judges, rendered their decision against her and the afflicted woman was turned into a corpse and the corpse was hung on a hook:
When she entered the seventh gate, the pala dress, the garment of ladyship, was removed from her body. ‘What is this?’ ‘Be satisfied, Inanna, a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled. Inanna, you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld.’ After she had crouched down and had her clothes removed, they were carried away. Then she made her sister Erec-ki-gala rise from her throne, and instead she sat on her throne. The Anuna, the seven judges, rendered their decision against her. They looked at her -- it was the look of death. They spoke to her -- it was the speech of anger. They shouted at her -- it was the shout of heavy guilt. The afflicted woman was turned into a corpse. And the corpse was hung on a hook.



In the same myth, seven demons besieged Dumuzid until he died: ‘The demons seized him there by his thighs. The seven of them poured the milk from his churns. The seven of them shook their heads like .... And Inanna looked at him, it was the look of death.’
They followed her to the great apple tree in the plain of Kulaba. There was Dumuzid clothed in a magnificent garment and seated magnificently on a throne. The demons seized him there by his
thighs. The seven of them poured the milk from his churns. The seven of them shook their heads like ....... They would not let the shepherd play the pipe and flute before her (?). She looked at him, it was the look of death. She spoke to him (?), it was the speech of anger. She shouted at him (?), it was the shout of heavy guilt: ‘How much longer? Take him away.’ Holy Inanna gave Dumuzid the shepherd into their hands.
In a small segment of ‘The death of Gilgameš’ we read that even Gilgameš is ill for six days, on the seventh day he probably will die:
The death of Gilgameš Segment B 1-8.
3 lines fragmentary For six days, he ...... ill. ...... on his skin like resin. Lord Gilgameš ...... ill. ...... Unug and Kulaba. ...... the words spoken .......
We saw here that a sevenfold development led to death, but the opposite was also true: in a myth Enkidu descended to the underworld and there he saw that someone who had seven sons was allowed to sit at the table with the gods.
1. ‘Did you see him who had one son?’ ‘I saw him.’ ‘How does he fare?’ ‘He weeps bitterly at the wooden peg which was driven into his wall.’ 2. ‘Did you see him who had two sons?’ ‘I saw him.’ ‘How does he fare?’ ‘He sits on a couple of bricks, eating bread.’ 3. ‘Did you see him who had three sons?’ ‘I saw him.’ ‘How does he fare?’ ‘He drinks water from a saddle waterskin.’ 4. ‘Did you see him who had four sons?’ ‘I saw him.’ ‘How does he fare?’ ‘His heart rejoices like a man who has four asses to yoke.’ 5. ‘Did you see him who had five sons?’ ‘I saw him.’ ‘How does he fare?’ ‘Like a good scribe he is indefatigable, he enters the palace easily.’ 6. ‘Did you see him who had six sons?’ ‘I saw him.’ ‘How does he fare?’ ‘He is a cheerful as a ploughman.’
7. ‘Did you see him who had seven sons?’ ‘I saw him.’ ‘How does he fare?’ ‘As a companion of the gods, he sits on a throne and listens to judgments.’
Here we see the reverse, the one who has seven sons is exalted and as a companion he sits on a throne and listens to judgments.
I think these seven steps are related to the phases of the moon, which of course is the ultimate planet that is clearly constantly changing its shape: with new moon it is reborn, it washes to full moon, then it wanes and disappears or dies and with the dark moon it is thought to be dead. And then it is born again. (To be precise, the moon causes a rhythm of 7.4 days).
The lunar phase or Moon phase is the shape of the Moon's directly sunlit portion as viewed from Earth. The lunar phases gradually change over a synodic month (about 29.53 days) as the Moon's orbital positions around Earth and Earth around the Sun shift. The visible side of the moon is variously sunlit, depending on the position of the Moon in its orbit. Thus, this face's sunlit portion can vary from 0% (at new moon) to 100% (at full moon). Each of the four ‘intermediate’ lunar phases is approximately 7.4 days, with slight variation due to the Moon's orbit's elliptical shape.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase



In the same way, Inanna passes through seven gates until she finally dies, and Dumuzid who is besieged by seven demons before dying. But after being dead the moon is reborn and eventually grows to full moon.
When the moon is born again a festival is celebrated:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B): c.2.1.7
‘I founded the Tiraš shrine with as much majesty as the abzu. Each month at the new moon the great rites (?), my ‘Festival of An’, are performed for me perfectly in it.
And at the New Year, on the day of the rites, on the day of the disappearance of the moon the divine powers can be perfected and a Sacred Marriage is celebrated:
A šir-namursaĝa to Ninsiana for Iddin-Dagan (Iddin-Dagan A): c.2.5.3.1 When the black-headed people have assembled in the palace, the house that advises the Land, the neck-stock of all the foreign countries, the house of the river of ordeal, a dais is set up for Ninegala. The divine king stays there with her. At the New Year, on the day of the rites, in order for her to determine the fate of all the countries, so that during the day (?) the faithful servants can be
inspected, so that on the day of the disappearance of the moon the divine powers can be perfected, a bed is set up for my lady. Esparto grass is purified with cedar perfume and arranged on that bed for my lady, and a coverlet is smoothed out on the top (?) of it.
In the Ancient Near East, the New Year began on the first of March, when the days grew longer and the sun conquered the darkness. Again, it started at a specific time, namely in the morning of the new moon. In fact, a number of things started at the same time: in that morning a new moon was of course born, a new day was ‘born’ too, as well as a new week, a new month, and finally a new year. Again, between 4320 BC and 2160 BC this new year started in Taurus and therefore is started in Pleiades too.
We already saw that a Sacred Marriage was celebrated on the first morning of the new year and in the Epic of Gilgamesh Enkidu made love to the courtesan girl apparently on the same morning:
Holding her unto his breast. (’Twas thus that) Enkidu dallied Six days, (aye) seven nights, with the courtesan-girl in his mating.
Because of the Pleiades he spend seven nights with this courtesan-girl.
While Gilgamish (thus) is the vision revealing Enkidu sitteth before the hetaera, and she [displaying 2 her] bosom, Shewing [her beauty (?)], the place of his birth he 3 forgetteth. (So) Enkidu dallied (Thus) for six days, seven nights, with the courtesan-girl in his mating. Broke into [speech] then, the nymph, and (thus) unto Enkidu spake she: ‘(Yea, as) I view thee, (e’en) like a god, O Enkidu, shalt be, Why with the beasts (of the field) dost thou (ever) range over the desert? Up, for I’ll lead thee to [Erech] broad-marketed, (aye), to the Temple Sacred, the dwelling of Anu—O Enkidu, come, that I guide thee, Unto E-Anna, the dwelling of Anu, where [Gilgamish] (liveth), (He), the supreme of creation; and thou, aye, thou wilt [embrace him] Like [to a woman], (and e’en) [as] thyself thou shalt [love him]. O, rouse thee Up from the ground—’tis a shepherd’s bed 4 (only).’ Her utterance heard he, Welcomed her rede: the advice of the woman struck home in his bosom.



She one garment took off wherewith she might clothe him: the other 5 She herself wore, (and so) taking her hand like a brother 6 she led him (Thus) to the booths(?) of the shepherds, the place of the sheepfolds. The shepherds Gather]d at sight of him 7 (Gap of four or five lines.)
Column III. (How the Hetaera schooled Enkidu). He (in the past) of the milk of the wild things to suck was accustom’d! Bread which she set before him he broke, but he gazed and he stared: Enkidu bread did not know how to eat, nor had he the knowledge Mead how to quaff! (Then) the woman made answer, to Enkidu speaking, ‘Enkidu, taste of the bread, (for) of life ’tis; (forsooth), the essential, Drink thou, (too), of the mead, ’tis the wonted use of the country.’ Enkidu ate of the bread, (aye, ate) until he was gorged, Drank of the mead seven bumpers; his spirits rose, (and), exultant, Glad was his heart, and cheerful his face: [himself(?)] was he rubbing, Oil on the hair of his body anointed: and (thus) became human.
Because of the Pleiades he drank of the mead seven bumpers. But there is something else: at New Year Enkidu, who used to live like an animal, became a human after six days, seven nights, with the courtesan-girl. This means that these six days and seven nights completely changed him like the seven steps changed Inanna, the seven demons changed Dumuzid and the seven sons made the father sitting at the table of the gods.
To continue with the Story, because of the Pleiades Gilgamesh bolt the Seven portals of Erech:
(Gilgamish takes counsel with the Elders). (And now) [in] the Seven Bolt [Portal of Erech] Hearing [the bruit(?)] did the artisans gather, [assembled the people(?)], (There) in the streets of broad-marketed Erech, [in] Gilgamish’ honour(?)], [So did the Elders of Erech] broad-marketed take seat before him. [Gilgamish] spake [thus: ‘O Elders of Erech] broad-marketed, [hear me!] [I go against Humbaba, the Fierce, who shall say, when he heareth],
Under the influence of the Pleiades and Taurus Gilgamesh (?) shall put on seven garments and he is like a mighty wild bull:
The Fourth Tablet. The Arrival At The Gate Of The Forest.
’. . . [O, haste] thee, withstand him, he will not [pursue(?) thee], [We will] go on down into the wood not daunted, together (?)]. . . . Thou shall put on seven garments .. . . . putting on, and six . . . (?) . . . ‘ He like a mighty wild bull . . .
Flung he the Portal afar, and [his] mouth was fill’d (with his challenge), Cried to the Guard of the Forest: ‘Up (?) . . . !
And because of the Pleiades Ishtar didst dig for the Lion seven and seven deep pits to entrap him:
Breaking his wing: in the grove doth he stand, crying kappi ‘my wing!’ Lovedst thou also a Lion, in (all) the full strength of (his) vigour, (Yet) thou didst dig for him seven and seven (deep) pits (to entrap him).



And seven years of leer husks must needs follow after the onslaught of the Bull of Heaven:
Anu [made answer, (thus) speaking, and said unto] Ishtar, the Lady: ‘[If I the Heavenly Bull shall create, for which] thou dost ask me,
(Then) seven years of (leer) husks [must needs follow after his onslaught (?)].
Wilt thou [for man] gather [corn (?)], and increase [for the cattle(?)] the fodder (?).’
The Pleiades influenced everything, the wind became seven winds, the judge became seven judges at the bride became seven brides who married at New Year:
Column IV. (Enkidu, relenting, regrets his curse, and blesses the Hetaera). ‘ . . . . . . . . . . . may . . . restore to thy place! [(So, too), may monarchs and princes] and chiefs be with love [for thee] smitten; [None smite (?)] his breech [in disgust (?); against thee; and for thee may the hero] Comb out his locks; . . . who would embrace [thee], Let him his girdle unloose . . . and thy [bed] be azure and golden; May . . . entreat thee kindly (?), . . . . are heap’d his ishshikku May the gods make thee enter . . . . . . . . . . .
[Mayst thou] be left as the mother of seven brides . . .’
(Enkidu, sorrowful at his approaching end, sleeps alone and dreams). [Enkidu] . . . woe in his belly . . . sleeping alone, [Came] in the night [to discover] his heaviness unto his comrade: ‘[Friend], (O) a dream I have seen in my night-time: the firmament [roaring],
But in the following list, the seven is simply one of the numbers mentioned:
[(Then) when something] of morning had dawn’d . . . . (Five lines mutilated). Pitch did the children 4 provide, (while) the strong brought [all] that was needful. (Then) on the fifth day (after) I laid out the 5 shape (of my vessel), Ten gar each was the height of her sides, in accord with her planning(?), Ten gar to match was the size of her deck (?), and the shape of the forepart (?) Did I lay down, (and) the same did I fashion; (aye), six times cross-pinn’d her, Sevenfold did I divide her . . . ., divided her inwards
