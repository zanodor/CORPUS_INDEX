Huns and Xiongnu Identified by Hungarian and Yeniseian Shared Etymologies
By Jingyi Gao 高晶一 (Eesti Keele Instituut / Institute of the Estonian Language)
1. Introduction
The Hungarian language is academically considered a Uralic language, related to Mansi, Khanty, Estonian and Finnish, inter alia. However, only 21 percent of Hungarian word roots are derived from Uralic languages, while some 30 percent are of uncertain origin (Kenesei 2004: 134). The present study identifies that ten basic Hungarian word roots actually have etymological equivalents in the Yeniseian languages. It is reasonable to suggest that these etyma belong to a Hunnic substratum that is related to Yeniseian. On the Huns, de Guignes (1748) first suggested that they were an offspring of
the Xiongnu (匈奴, *xiuoŋ-na – Old Chinese according to Guō 1986/20101, *qhoŋ
na – Old Chinese according to Zhèng-zhāng 2003/20132) people with evidence from historical sources. De la Vaissière (2005) discussed the similarities between Hunnic and Xiongnu cauldrons, buried on river banks both in Hungary and in the Ordos. Érdy (2008) summarised eight archaeological connections and four ancient written sources to support this Hun-Xiongnu connection. On the Yeniseians, Ligeti (1950) first suggested that they were an offspring of the Xiongnu people with only one Xiongnu-Yeniseian etymology (Xiongnu *sak-dak ‘shoe’ ~ Ket sagdi ‘shoe’). Pulleyblank (1962) suggested the same with more evidence from phonology and etymology. Vovin (2000, 2002) supported the suggested Yeniseian-Xiongnu connection with more evidence from morphology and etymology. Vovin put forward the etymologi

The methodology of the Peking School is very conservative, in not relying on hypothetical Sino-X data, but solely by concentrating on attested Sinitic data. The Peking School is acknowledged by most linguists active in China. 2 This Old Chinese reconstruction is acknowledged by many innovative Chinese linguists.

cal link between the ethnonym Jie (羯, *ket – Old Chinese cited by Vovin, *kiat according to Guō 1986/2010, *kad – Zhèng-zhāng 2003/2013) and the Proto-Yeniseian root *keˀt ‘person, human being’. Gāo (2008: 9) discussed another chain of evidence, namely that the Xiongnu were genetically related to the Xia (夏) empire,
coinciding with Chinese historiography.3 The original meaning of the ethnonym Xia (夏, *ɣea – Old Chinese according to Guō 1986/2010, *ɡraas – Zhèng-zhāng 2003/2013) is glossed in the first Chinese standard dictionary as ‘person of the cen
tral states’.4 Thus this root could also be etymologically akin to the Yeniseian root meaning ‘person’ (2002-VWJ 1: 421: Proto-Yeniseian *keˀt: Ket kɛˀt ~ Yug kɛˀt ~ Kottish hit/xit ~ Assan hit/hɨt ~ Arin ḱit/qit/kit ~ Pumpokol kit). Both Xia/*ɣea and Jie/*kiat are thus related to the Xiongnu. Gao (2012: 243) contributed fresh new evidence: The successors of the Xia (夏) empire were provided with a small fiefdom called Qi (杞, *khiə – Old Chinese
according to Guō 1986/2010, *khɯʔ – Zhèng-zhāng 2003/2013).5 The ethnonym Qi/*khiə can also be etymologically related to the ethnonym Xia/*ɣea. It implies that both Xia/*ɣea and Qi/*khiə belong to the same Yeniseian root meaning ‘person’. The ethnonyms Jie/*kiat and Qi/*khiə are phonetically closer to the Yeniseian root, but their original senses are assumed. The ethnonym Xia/*ɣea is phonetically more distant, but its original sense is attested. These three ethnonyms together form a chain of evidence supporting a strong Yeniseian-Xiongnu connection. The present study identifies Hungarian and Yeniseian shared etymologies which can testify both the link between Huns and Xiongnu and the Yeniseian-Xiongnu connection.
2. Materials and methods
The present study uses methods employed in traditional etymology (cf. Rask 1818), that mean comparing word roots in attested lects. Basically, the Hungarian language
(with etymological links to the controversial Hunnic source, the Isfahan codex)6 is compared with the Yeniseian languages (Ket, Yug, Kottish, Assan, Arin, and Pumpokol). The etymologies of the Hungarian language are referenced in its authoritative etymological dictionary (1984-TESz). The Hunnic words are taken from a Hungarian-Hunnic glossary (Detre 2004). The etymologies of the Yeniseian

5 Shǐ jì 史記 fasc. 36: 杞東樓公者 夏后禹之後苗裔也 殷時或封或絕 周武王克殷紂 求禹之後
得東樓公 封之於杞 以奉夏后氏祀 (“Duke Dong Lou of the Qi fiefdom was the descendant of the Great Yu of the Xia-hou. During the Yin period, their fiefdom developed intermittently. When King Wu of Zhou had defeated King Zhou of Yin, he searched for the descendants of the Great Yu. When he had reached Duke Dong Lou, he assigned him to the Qi territory, in order to perform the sacrifice to the founders of the Xia-hou”). 6 Because this Hunnic source is controversial, the present study does not rely on it. Abandoning it, however, would not alter the present etymological study between Hungarian and Yeniseian.

languages are referenced in their latest etymological dictionary (2002-VWJ) and in the work by Starostin (1982). For a better relative comparison, etymological equivalents in some other languages (chiefly Uralic) are cited according to relevant etymological works (1988UEW, 2001-SSA, etc.). Non-English glosses are translated into English for the present study. The phonetic data are given in orthographies (in boldface and italic) or transcriptions (in italic). If a given word is longer than one morpheme, the targeted morpheme is underlined (if certain). In successive data, dialectal or authorial variants are separated by a slash /; grammatical variants or allomorphs are separated by a backslash \.
3. Results and discussion
01) Hungarian ég ‘sky’ (~ Hunnic Isfahan codex ige/igesi ‘sky’) is compared with Ket eˑs’/ēś ‘sky, god’, Yug es ‘sky, god’, Kottish ēš/eš ‘sky, god’, Assan öš/eč ‘sky, god’, Arin es/eš ‘sky, god’, Pumpokol eč ‘sky’, eg ‘god’ (2002-VWJ 1: 272273 “Proto-Yeniseian *es”). This etymon has also been identified in other languages: Kamass eš ‘god’, Koibal eš ‘god’. It can be postulated that this could be a Proto-Hunnic root which has entered Kamass and Koibal. We think the ending in Proto-Yeniseian should be -g instead of -s. It is more reasonable to develop from g to s, i.e. g ⇒ š ⇒ ś ⇒ s, not from s to g. ◇R
EFUTATION: Previously suggested etymological link from Hungarian ég ‘sky’ to “Proto-Finno-Ugric *säηe” ‘air’ [after Finnish sää ‘weather’, Komi si
̮
ne
̮
d/si
̮
nad ‘air’] is rejected due to both phonetic and semantic disagreements. It was already caveated in 2001-SSA 3: 244. 02) Hungarian tenger ‘sea’ is compared with Ket t࠴
́
ŋal’s’/tɨŋǝĺ ‘high’, Yug t࠴
́
ŋɨlsi/ tɨŋgɨl ‘high’, Pumpokol tokar-du ‘high’ (2002-VWJ 2: 309 “Proto-Yeniseian *thɨŋ(g)ǝl”). This etymon has also been identified in other languages, e.g. Old Turkic teŋiz ‘sea’, teŋri ‘sky’, Turkish deniz ‘sea’, Written Mongolian tenger ‘sky’, and it has been suggested as a loanword word from Turkic to Hungarian (e.g. 1984-TESz 3: 888). It can be postulated that this could be a Proto-Hunnic root meaning ‘extreme’, which has developed to (1) ‘the horizontal extreme of land, i.e. sea’ in Hungarian and some Turkic languages, (2) ‘the vertical extreme, i.e. high’ in Yeniseian, and (3) ‘the vertical extreme of land, i.e. sky’ in some Turkic languages and Mongolic. The Uralic, Turkic and Mongolic languages could be Hunnic-influenced languages. A similar etymological direction from Yeniseian to Turkic and Mongolic has been first suggested by Georg (2001). 03) Hungarian hegy ‘mountain’ (~ Hunnic Isfahan codex jagh ‘mounatin’) is compared with Ket qaˀj ‘mountain’, Yug χaˀj ‘mountain’, Kottish xei/khei ‘mountain’, Arin ena-háj ‘forest’, Pumpokol kónnoŋ ‘mountains’ (2002-VWJ 2: 78–79 “Proto-Yeniseian *qaˀj”). This etymon has not been identified in other languages. It can be postulated that this could be a Proto-Hunnic root. ◇REFUTATION: Previously suggested etymological link from Hungarian hegy ‘mountain’ to “Proto-Finno-Ugric *kaća” ‘end, top’ [after Finnish kasa ‘angle, corner’, Estonian (dialect) kadsa ‘lower end of the blade of ax’, Lappic gæčče/kiehtjē/ḱieš

(of an object)’] is rejected due to both phonetic and semantic disagreements. It was already rejected in 2001-SSA 1: 321. 04) Hungarian apa ‘father’ (~ Hunnic Isfahan codex atha ‘father’) is compared with Ket oˑp/ōp ‘father’, Yug op ‘father’, Kottish ōp ‘father’, Assan op/öb ‘father’, Arin iṕa/ɨpä ‘father’, Pumpokol ab ‘father’ (2002-VWJ 2: 50 “Proto-Yeniseian *ob(ǝ)”). This etymon has also been identified in other languages: Finnish appi\appe- ‘spouse’s father’, Lappic vuop'pâ/vuohppa/v ̊ıhp/vūhp/vuøhp ‘spouse’s father’, Mari ow ̑ǝ/owo ‘spouse’s father’, Mansi apā/up/op ‘spouse’s father’, Khanty up/op/üp/up ‘spouse’s father’ (1988-UEW 14 “Proto-Finno-Ugric *appe”); also compared with Old Turkic apa ‘ancestor’, Written Mongolian abu/aba ‘father’, Negidal apa ‘grandfather’, Korean abǝǯi/abi ‘father’, Middle Korean àpí ‘father’ (1984-TESz 1: 161–162, Cincius 1972). It can be postulated that this could be a Proto-Hunnic root which has entered some Hunnic-influenced languages. The Uralic groups that use it for ‘spouse’s father’ i.e. ‘father-in-law’, could have had a tradition of intermarriage with other Proto-Hunnic nations, thus absorbing the term from their spouses. Turkic and Negidal could have older Hunnic substrata, hence using it for ‘ancestor’ or ‘grandfather’. 05) Hungarian orr ‘nose’ (~ Hunnic Isfahan codex ore ‘nose’) is compared with Ket ɔ́ lɨn/ɔ́ lǝn/olgen/ólgen ‘nose’, Yug ɔ́ lɨn/ɔ́ lǝn ‘nose’, Arin árquj ‘nose’ (2002
VWJ 2: 38 “Proto-Yeniseian *olgǝn or *olǝn”. This etymon has not been identified in other languages. It can be postulated that this could be a Proto-Hunnic root. ◇REFUTATION: Previously suggested etymological link from Hungarian orr ‘nose’ to “Proto-Finno-Ugric *we̮ re” ‘mountain’ [after Finnish vuori\vuore- ‘mountain’, Udmurt v ̮ir/v ̑ǝr/v ̑ı ̣r ‘hill’, Komi ve̮ r/vu̇ r ‘forest’, Mansi wār-nā/wōr-nǝ/w ̄ɔr-ǝn/wor ‘in pine forest / on hunt’, Khanty wor/wŏr/or ‘ridge/forest’] is rejected due to semantic disagreements. It was already rejected in 2001-SSA 3: 475. 06) Hungarian hús ‘meat’ (~ Hunnic Isfahan codex kisjú ‘meat’) is compared with Ket iˑs’/īś ‘meat, fish’, Yug īs ‘meat, fish’, Kottish īči/iči ‘meat’, Assan ič/iči ‘meat’, Arin is/iži ‘meat’, Pumpokol híte/gíte ‘fish’ (2002-VWJ 1: 396 “Proto- Yeniseian *hitǝ or *itǝ”). This etymon has also been identified in Koibal: is ‘meat’. It can be postulated that this could be a Proto-Hunnic root which has entered Koibal. ◇REFUTATION: Previously suggested etymological link from Hungarian hús ‘meat’ to Proto-Iranian [compared Persian gušt ‘meat’, Kurdish goşt ‘meat’, etc.] is rejected
due to phonetic disagreements.7 07) Hungarian tó\tava- ‘lake’ (~ Hunnic Isfahan codex tava ‘lake’) is compared with Ket dɛˀ ‘lake’, Yug dɛˀ ‘lake’, Kottish ûr-têg/ûr-têx ‘[water-] lake’, Arin kurt’ú/kur-t’uk ‘[water-] lake’, Pumpokol dánniŋ ‘lakes’ (2002-VWJ 1: 185 “ProtoYeniseian *degǝ or *deˀǝ”). This etymon has also been identified in other languages: Estonian soo ‘swamp’, Finnish suo ‘swamp’, Livonian sūo ‘swamp’, Udmurt t ̮i/tȯ/t ̑ı ̣ ‘lake’, Komi t ̮i/tø ‘lake’, Mansi tō ‘lake’, Khanty tŏγ/tĕw/tuw ‘pond’, Nenets tō ‘lake’, Enets to ‘lake’, Nganasan túrku ‘lake’, Selkup tú/to/tū ‘lake’, Kamass tu

‘lake, river’, Koibal tō ‘lake’, Mator toa ‘lake’, Taigi to ‘lake’ (1988-UEW 533 “Proto-Uralic *towз”, without Finnic i.e. Estonian, Finnish and Livonian; 2001-SSA
3: 213–214, with Finnic8). It can be postulated that this could be a Proto-Hunnic root which has entered some Hunnic-influenced languages. 08) Hungarian út\uta- ‘way’ (~ Hunnic Isfahan codex hutu/utu ‘way’) is compared with Ket qɔˀt ‘way’, Yug χɔˀt ‘way’, Arin kat/kut ‘way’, Pumpokol koat ‘way’ (2002-VWJ 2: 123 “Proto-Yeniseian *qɔˀt”). This etymon has also been identified in other languages: Mansi āχt/e̯ kt/āγt ‘water way between two lakes or the a lake and a river / source, channel’, Khanty ɔγǝt/oχǝt ‘isthmus (between two waters)’, Nenets ŋūʔ\ŋūdan/ŋut ‘track, path’, Enets urī/uʔ\udoʔ ‘way’, Nganasan ŋoajā ‘way’, Selkup wuettэ/wattα/wat ‘way, track’, Kamass aʒ́ i/aći/aʒ́ e ‘way, track’. It can be postulated
that this could be a Proto-Hunnic root which has entered some Hunnic-influenced languages. 09) Hungarian hó\hava- ‘snow’ (~ Hunnic Isfahan codex hava ‘snow’) is compared with Ket qoˑ/qō ‘ice’, Yug χō ‘ice’ (2002-VWJ 2: 126 Proto-Yeniseian *qogǝ”). This etymon has also been identified in other languages: Udmurt k ̮im ‘thinner snow / hoop’, Nenets χawʔ ‘soft snow lying atop thin hard snow’, Kamass kamo ‘snow crust’. It can be postulated that this could be a Proto-Hunnic root which has entered some Hunnic-influenced languages. 10) Hungarian só ‘salt’ (~ Hunnic Isfahan codex sava ‘salt’) is compared with Ket tʌˀ ‘salt’, tʌɣet ‘to salt’, Yug čʌˀ ‘salt’, čʌgit ‘to salt’, Kottish ši-nčêt/či-nčét/ šinšet ‘salt’, Assan či-nǯet/ti-nǯet/ši-nčet ‘salt’, Pumpokol če ‘salt’ (2002-VWJ 2: 301 “Proto-Yeniseian *t’ǝgǝ”). This etymon has not been identified in other languages. It can be postulated that this could be a Proto-Hunnic root. ◇REFUTATION: Previously suggested etymological link from Hungarian só ‘salt’ to Proto-Iranian [compared
Ossetian cæxx ‘salt’, Digorian cænxæ ‘salt’, etc.] is rejected due to phonetic 9 disagreements. It was already rejected in 1988-UEW 839. Previously suggested etymological link from Hungarian só ‘salt’ to “Proto-Indo-European *sal” ‘salt’ [compared Ancient Greek ἅλς (hals) ‘salt’, Latin sal ‘salt’, etc.] is rejected due to
phonetic disagreements.10
8 The onset [s] in Finnic is odd. However, 2001-SSA (3: 213–214) insisted on the connection with an onset correspondence (s- ⇔ t-) that is supplied by another Uralic etymology: Estonian sulg\sule- ‘feather’, Finnish sulka ‘feather’, Lappic dol'ge/tål'kē/toilke ‘feather’, Mordovin tolga ‘feather’, Udmurt t ̮il ̮i/t ̑ǝl ̑ǝ/t ̑ıḷ ̑ı ̣ ‘feather’, Komi t ̮il/t ̮iv/tøl ‘feather’, Mansi tōl/towl/towǝl ‘wing’, Khanty tŏγǝl/tŏχǝt/tŏχǝl ‘wing, feather’, Hungarian toll ‘feather’, Nenets to ‘feather, wing’, Enets tua ‘wing’, Nganasan t́ụ/t́ụa ‘wing, feather’, Selkup tú/tu ‘wing, feather’, Mator tu ‘wing, feather’. This etymon is almost fully Uralic. 9 The coda [n] in Iranic is odd and illogical. 10 The coda [l] in Proto-Indo-European is odd and illogical.

4. Overview
Among these ten newly identified Hungarian and Yeniseian shared etymologies, a regular sound change can be concluded: The -ó\-ava- rhyme in Hungarian is correlated with the *-egǝ,-ogǝ,-ǝgǝ rhyme in Proto-Yeniseian (see Table).
Table 1. Hungarian and Yeniseian rhyme correspondence: -ó\-ava- ⇔*‐egǝ,‐ogǝ,‐ǝgǝ
Hungarian Hunnic Ket Yug Kottish Arin Pumpokol Proto
Yeniseian tó\tava- tava dɛˀ dɛˀ -tēg -t’uk dánniŋ *degǝ
‘lake’ ‘lake’ ‘lake’ ‘lake’ ‘lake’ ‘lake’ ‘lakes’ ‘lake’
hó\hava- hava qō χō -- -- -- *qogǝ
‘snow’ ‘snow’ ‘ice’ ‘ice’ -- -- -- ‘ice’
só sava tʌˀ čʌˀ ši-/či- -- če *t'ǝgǝ
‘salt’ ‘salt’ ‘salt’ ‘salt’ ‘salt’ -- ‘salt’ ‘salt’
A rhyme correspondence represents strict and composite interlinguistic sound correlations. A rhyme correspondence achieves that not only a single phoneme but also a composite rhyme is consistently correlated among related lects, thus ruling out chance resemblances. We can expect more rhyme correspondences in Hungarian and Yeniseian shared etymologies in further studies. All the newly identified Hungarian and Yeniseian shared etymologies belong to the basic vocabulary, and are primarily used in Hungarian. They could not be loanwords from Yeniseian to Hungarian, either from Hungarian to Yeniseian, due to their geographic distance. These Hungarian words should belong to the Hunnic substratum. The Hunnic substratum and the Yeniseian languages are descendants of Proto-Hunnic. The Hun-Xiongnu connection and the Yeniseian-Xiongnu connection are testified by the Hungarian and Yeniseian shared etymologies. These connections can be merged to a Hunnic continuity that includes the historical Xiongnu, the Huns, the Hunnic substratum of Hungarian, and the attested Yeniseian languages.
5. Conclusion
The present study has identified ten Hungarian and Yeniseian shared etymologies that belong to the basic vocabulary, and observes that a regular sound change can be stated in three Hungarian and Yeniseian shared etymologies. The regular sound change validates the etymological connection between Hungarian and Yeniseian. The Hungarian and Yeniseian shared etymologies support a Hunnic continuity that includes the historical Xiongnu, the Huns, the Hunnic substratum of Hungarian, and the attested Yeniseian languages.
