Acknowledgements
Numerous people over many years have helped me develop my ideas on the zodiacal structure of Mark's Gospel, but I am indebted especially to the following. To Dan Hodgkin, whose splendid drawings of the constellation patterns have added immeasurably to the book's appeal and intelligibility. To Paddy and Kate Symons, Michael Edwards, Eileen Harrington, Michael Barker-Caven, Rev. Catha! Courtney, Rev. Art Lester, and the late Michael Young, with all of whom, over cups of coffee, pints of Guinness, or �lasses of wine, I have been encouraged to clarify and defend my theories. Marlena Thompson, who has been cajoling me for years to put these ideas into book form, deserves special mention. To members of the Dublin Unitarian congregation who have listened to me express my maverick opinions over the past eleven years, with special thanks to Beta, (Rev.) Bridget, Chris, David, Dennis, Dorene, Patrick, Pamela, Kevin, Leila, Michael, Ruth, and Titania, on whom I tested the zodi acal theory in detail during the winter of 2006-7, and from whom came many useful suggestions about style and content. To Nick Webb and Caroline McArthur of Duckworth who have made their own significant and valued contribution to the book's final shape. To my wife, Morag, whose unfailing support, patience, and understand ing have enabled me to see this project through to a conclusion. Appearance in the above list in no way implies responsibility for the opin ions expressed in this book, or even endorsement of them. Any solecisms, anachronisms, or weird flights of fancy found in these pages are entirely my responsibility. Finally, I must stress that, although I am a minister in the Unitarian Church, I am not expressing specifically Unitarian opinions: this theory of the origin and structure of one of Christianity's primary documents will probably be as unsettling to Unitarians as it will certainly be to members of more orthodox churches.

Introduction
'{ ;od against man. Man against God. Man against nature. Nature against lllllll. Nature against God. God against nature - very funny religion.' Such, ,,n·ording to Joseph Campbell, was the verdict of the Buddhist sage, Dr. D. l. Suzuki, on the religions of the West, Christianity in particular. The same point has been made more recently by the American comedian Emo Phillips, In what has been voted the best religious joke of all time.
1 Jm·t• I saw this guy on a bridge about to jump. I said, 'Don't do it!' I It- ,.;aid, 'Nobody loves me. ' I smd, 'God loves you. Do you believe in God?' ·y..� ..
I said. 'Are you a Christian or a Jew ?'
' A Clrristian.'
I ..;aid, 'Me too! Protestant or Catlwlic?'
'f'rotcstant.'
I ...aid, 'Me too! What franchise? '
'lltlf'tist.'
I ..;aid, 'Me too! Northern Baptist or Southern Baptist?'
·Nnrtlwrn Baptist. '
I .�11id, 'Me too! Northern Conservative Baptist or Northern Liberal Baptist?' ·Northern Conservative Baptist. ' I s11id, 'Me too!

Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region Coundl of1879, or Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region Coundl of 1912 ?' ·Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region Council of 1912.' I s11id, 'Die heretic!' and I pushed him over.
l·:mo's joke brilliantly captures the unfortunate irony which must strike l'vcryone who casts even a cursory glance at the religious world: from the hlnody Middle Eastern conflict between Muslim and Jew to the internecine squabbles which set one Christian group against another, religion, which is meant, etymologically at least, to bind us together, seems to be a perpetual source of division.

It would be a mistake to suggest that the origin of all this conflict is purely theological. There are sociological, historical, geographical, political, and even ethnic factors to consider, but there can be no doubt that theology plays its part by providing some intellectual weapons by means of which the bat tles can be conducted. Theology is about words, and words are notoriously slippery. Written documents which attempt to eliminate ambiguity- insur ance policies, for example - are virtually unreadable, while narrative, which strives to engage the imagination, and which is perennially appealing, is never free from it. Unfortunately for those who crave clarity, much of the religious literature of the world, upon which most theology is based, is presented in narrative form, and since there are no hard-and-fast rules for the interpretation of stories, disagreement goes with the territory. What is one to make of those Bible stories which contain accounts of talking snakes, the parting of sea water, the sun standing still, a talking ass, and countless other incidents which, in another context, would be considered fanciful in the extreme? The rational response would be to say that such stories must have a symbolic meaning if they have any meaning at all- and try to investigate what the symbolism might be, but it would seem that some religious people tend to find narra tive and metaphor very difficult to approach in this way. For some reason, history is deemed superior to myth, and the factual is preferred to the fig urative, and as a result much of the intellectual activity of religious groups particularly Christian groups - has been concerned with translating the oblique language of spiritual metaphor into the univocal languages of history and science. The results have been disastrous because, as Joseph Campbell says, when a religion 'gets stuck in its own metaphors, interpreting them as facts, then you are in trouble' (Campbell, 1988, page 67). Evidence of such 'trouble' is not difficult to find. Galileo found himsell embroiled in it in the sixteenth century, when it was believed that Joshua's command to the sun to stand still was sufficient to refute the heliocentric theory; and since the middle of the nineteenth century, Darwin's theory of evolution has been attacked by those who hold a literal interpretation of the narratives in the early part of the Book of Genesis. So troublesome have these religious metaphors been throughout the cen turies, that many people of a more 'rationalist' disposition have suggested that it might be best to discard them altogether or, at the very least, to relegate them to the category of historical and literary curios where they can do little damage.



Introduction
Jefferson's Bible
Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States, was of this opin ion. Jefferson considered himself to be a rationalist, a child of the Enlightenment. He was a friend of the scientist and Unitarian minister, Joseph Priestley, who had taken his own brand of religious rationalism from Britain to America in the closing years of the eighteenth century, and Jefferson's intellectual heroes were the British empiricist philosophers John Locke and David Hume and the Frenchman Auguste Compte, who, in the wake of the French Revolution, had attempted to devise a 'religion of humanity', free from dogma, supernaturalism, miracle, prophecy, and rev dation: a religion dedicated to reason and informed by reason. Unlike many of his mentors, however, Jefferson claimed to be a Christian of sorts - at the time a strange claim to make in the light of his repudiation of all things supernatural. After all, wasn't the New Testament, the very foundation document of Christianity, just as full of troublesome narratives as the Old: the birth of Jesus from a virgin, for example, or the numerous miracles, or, most stupendous and incredible of all, the resurrection of Jesus from physical death? But for Jefferson and for those who thought like him, such things were not essential to Christianity, nor were they particularly useful metaphors; they were accretions which had accumulated, rather para sitically, around the elevated ethical system propounded by Jesus. They were the products of ignorance and superstition, and the task of scholars now, thought Jefferson, was to separate out the wheat from the chaff, to remove the fanciful from the factual, to strip away the 'mutilated, misstated and often unintelligible' bits of the Christian scriptures, the bits that had caused so much trouble, and so reveal 'the most sublime and benevolent code of morals which has ever been offered to man'. And since no one else seemed keen to take on the task, Jefferson decided
to do it himself, and in 1820, at the age of 77, he took his Bible and a pair of scissors and snipped out a scripture for himself. The task was easy, he said. The difference (between essential and non-essential, authentic and spurious) 'is obvious to the eye and the understanding ... and I will venture to affirm that he who, as I have done, will undertake to winnow this grain from this chaff, will find it not to require a moment's consideration. The parts fall asunder of themselves, as would those of an image of metal and clay' Uefferson, page 30). The result was 'The Jefferson Bible'. Its title should really be 'The Jefferson Gospel' bt'e<luse there is nothing in it from the Hebrew Scriptures, nor from the writings attributed to the followers of Jesus such as St Paul or St Peter.

11u· Gospel and the Zodiac
Jefferson would most certainly have agreed with John Lennon who was to proclaim, 150 years later, that 'Jesus was okay but his disciples were a bunch of thick buggers.' Consequently, Jefferson's Bible is extremely thin. In its recently published form it barely amounts to 110 small pages, probably less than half the length of the four Gospels as we have them. It contains some narratives, and all the great parables, but the bulk of it is devoted to the ethical teaching of the Gospels. It begins with the birth of Jesus, but there are no wise men, no star, no angels, no virgin; and the 'Gospel' ends with the words
Now in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid. There laid they Jesus. And rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.
So, there's no account of Jesus' resurrection; in fact, not a single miracle story appears in the whole volume.
The 'Cinderella' Gospel
Jefferson took most of his material from the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, both of which, in addition to the miracles of Jesus, contain lengthy sections devoted to Jesus' ethical teaching. Very little in Jefferson's volume is taken from the Gospel of Mark, principally no doubt because Mark is almost entirely composed of the kind of narratives which Jefferson found so troub ling. In neglecting Mark, Jefferson was merely continuing a centuries-old tradition. For example, St Augustine (354-430 CE) considered Mark to be the least valuable Gospel because, he said, it was merely an abbreviated version of Matthew and Luke. In addition, its somewhat rough-and-ready style, frenet ic pace, episodic quality, colloquial language, and unsophisticated syntax contributed to the indifference with which it was viewed. There is also an air of disrespect for some of the story's main protagonists which would not have endeared it to the leaders of the early church. Given these characteristics, it is possible that the early tradition associat ing the Gospel with the apostle Peter was the only reason it was accepted into the Christian canon of scripture. But this 'tradition', too, is based more on apologetics than on evidence, and it dl•vdnpl�d in order to lend apostolic authority to an account written by om• who was not an apostle.

Introduction
.tssumption that Mark was an abbreviation of Matthew and Luke, and to suggest that it was the earliest Gospel, it has never really lost its reputation ,,s the Cinderella Gospel. It may have the virtue of brevity, and the place it occupies within the whole gospel tradition may be of interest to scholars, but in public liturgy and private devotion it is still the least valued. This is particularly so among religious liberals who, like Jefferson before them, are uneasy about the strange and fanciful nature of Mark's narrative. Indeed, contemporary liberals have gone much further than Jefferson, and have been in the forefront of all critical research into the historical conun drums presented by the Gospels, from Albert Schweitzer's The Quest for the 1/istorical fesus at the beginning of the twentieth century, up to and includ ing the California-based 'Jesus Seminar' which, for two decades, has been .tllempting to sift what it considers to be the original, authentic words of ksus from the 'myth' and 'fiction' that have grown around them. The gen l'ral liberal assumption is the same as Jefferson's: the narrative portions of the Gospels are the least reliable historically and have little, if any, spiritual v.tlue since they are expressions of a primitive, 'magical', mythical world vil'W which has lost any relevance it may once have had. But Mark's Gospel is anything but primitive. Although in its present form it is probably incomplete, as we shall see, it is a highly sophisticated docu ment. rt is not a rudimentary biography of Jesus, nor is it a collection of his torical reminiscences exaggerated by constant retelling. It is, in fact, a series of dramatic 'parables' designed to accompany the spiritual seeker on the journey towards enlightenment or self-transformation. It has its origin in an t•soteric tradition which owes as much to the mystery schools of paganism ,,s i t does to Judaism. Most astonishing of all, it uses as its primary metaphor tlw yearly journey of the sun through the signs of the zodiac. Mark's Gospel
1� 11 ft'Xtbook of the spiritual journey written in an astrological code whiclt, when uttmvelled, completely transforms our understanding of the Gospel's original
1111111re and purpose. What, to Jefferson, was 'chaff' is really the purest wheat. Tlw 'mutilated, misstated and often unintelligible' passages of the Gospel story, which have been the cause of so much debate and division, and which l'nded up at the sharp end of Jefferson's scissors, are, as I shall show, its most original and imaginative elements. It's time to pick the discarded pieces off the floor, dust them down, and put them back in again.

Who is the Man with a Jar of Water?
TI1e Vision of 01rist tlzat thou dost see Is my Vision's Greatest Enemy: 17tine lias a great hook nose like thine, Mine has a snub nose like to mine: 17zine is thefriend ofAll Mankind Mine speaks in parables to tlze Blind: T11ine loves the same world that mine lzates, Thy Heaven doors are my Hell gates. Socrates tauglzt what Meletus Loatlt'd as a Nation's bitterest Curse, And Caiaplws was in his own Mind A benefactor to Mankind: Both read tlze Bible day and night But tlzou read'st black where I read white. (William Blake, The Everlasting Gospel)
Of all the controversies with which the Fathers of the early church enter tained themselves, few seem as irrelevant to the contemporary mind as that which concerned the duration of Jesus' ministry. For about eighteen cen turies the common assumption throughout Christendom has been that, between Jesus' baptism by John and his crucifixion by Pilate, three years elapsed. This is based on a legitimate inference from the number of Passover festivals mentioned in the Gospel of John, and it is difficult to see how any one could, or would even want to, challenge it. And yet it was a dispute over which a considerable amount of ink was expended towards the end of the second Christian century. Irenaeus, orthodoxy's first systematic apologist (writing about 185 CE), goes to great lengths to prove that Jesus exercised his ministry over many years in order to counter the contention of various Gnostic groups (principally the followers of Valentinus) that Jesus taught for one year only and, further, that ' he suffered in the twelfth month' (lrenaeus, page 200). An idle piece of pedantic squabbling, we might be tempted to conclude. But we would be wrong to conclude this. Till' nmtrovl•rsy was not just over any arbitrary twelve-month pl•riod. It nmn•nwd tlw solar Yl'.ll', which

begins at the spring equinox, and Valentinus' claim is absolutely startling: the career of Jesus is connected with the sun's annual journey through the heavens, and he implies that the various stages of it correspond with the signs of the zodiac. For Valentinus and his followers, the Gospel story is not a rudimentary biography of a single individual, pieced together from reminiscences of eye witnesses or those who had known eye-witnesses, but an allegory, in which the sun's cycle, from its 'birth' in Aries when spring begins, to its 'death' in Pisces twelve months later, symbolically reflects the spiritual cycle of the Gnostic initiate on his journey towards spiritual liberation or enlightenment. This is why Valentinus's claim that Jesus died in the twelfth month (March, the month of Pisces) was so crucial to his case, and why Irenaeus was at such pains to refute it. There is no reason to suppose that this and other Gnostic 'heresies', which lrenaeus condemns so roundly and, at times, parodies so shamefully in his five-volume work, were new ideas which had parasitically attached them selves to a history-based Christianity. Gnosticism was certainly not new in Jrenaeus's time. Although it flourished in the second Christian century, its roots go back much further, some scholars tracing its ancestry back to the rdigion of ancient Iran, others favouring an origin in Judaism. Whatever its precise origins, it was never a unified religious movement but an approach to spiritual matters which transcended conventional boundaries. It was dualistic, and generally associated the world of matter and flesh with evil. The task of the aspirant was to attain spiritual freedom by overcoming bondage to the flesh. Despite the variety of ways in which it manifested, Gnosticism was concerned with the interior life of the spirit, with 'illumina tion' which could be attained through prayer, meditation and the perform ance of specific rituals. God was to be experienced within the depths of the individual, rather than demonstrated rationally or objectified historically. 'Gnosis', which comes from the Greek word for knowledge, is not primarily rational knowledge, but 'insight'. 'Gnosis involves an intuitive process of knowing oneself. And to know oneself ... is to know human nature and human destiny ... Yet to know oneself, at the deepest level, is simultaneous ly, to know God' (Pagels, page xix). Manuscripts which have surfaced relatively recently, particularly the Nag Hammadi documents, discovered in 1945, are demonstrating that the con ventionally held view that Gnostic works are invariably later than the canon ical Gospels and of inferior literary quality can no longer be sustained. What is emerging is a picture of early Christianity which is, in Elaine Pagels' words, 'far mon' divNsc than orthodox sources choosL' to indicate' (Pa gl'ls,
7



TI1e Gospel and the Zodiac
page xxxiii). Out of this diversity sprang a variety of writings which were attacked (by people like Irenaeus) and, eventually, suppressed by the emer ging Catholic Church. In one of them, the Gospel of Thomas, the central fig ure is 'the living Jesus' who has a different relationship with his followers than does the traditional Jesus of Christendom. The latter is a uniquely divine figure whose sacrifice ensures the salvation of those who believe in him. The Jesus of Thomas's Gospel, however, 'comes as a guide who opens access to spiritual understanding. But when the disciple attains enlighten ment, Jesus no longer serves as his spiritual master: the two have become equal - even identical' (Pagels, page xx). Such thinking has always been anathema to orthodoxy. What is interest ing about it, from the point of view of the present study, is its antiquity. If, as Professor Helmut Koester of Harvard maintains, the Gospel of Thomas contains some traditions which belong to the 'second half of the first cen tury' (Pagels, page xvi), then such ideas were not later perversions of the orthodox, history-based scheme, so beloved of people like Irenaeus: they were contemporary with it. Perhaps they even preceded it. Indeed, it is no longer unthinkable for us to invert the customary view of the relationship between 'historic' and 'esoteric' Christianities. It seems increasingly likely that the former was a perversion of the latter, that the attempt to establish historical credentials for the Jesus story came some time after the story itself originated in the fertile imagination of some esoteric group, whose poetic account of the spiritual journey was transformed into history by people who had either misunderstood the story, or who were motivated by more cynically pragmatic political or ecclesiastical considerations. The gradual 'historicization' of imaginative religious stories is by no means restricted to Christianity. In TI1e Perennial Philosophy, Aldous Huxley points out that the same process has occurred in Buddhism, in which 'the Mahayana expresses the universal, whereas the Hinayana cannot set itself free from historical fact' (Huxley, page 62). He goes on to quote the oriental ist, Ananda K. Coomaraswary: 'The Mahayanist believer is warned - pre cisely as the worshipper of Krishna is warned in the Vaishnaivite scriptures that the Krishna Lila is not history, but a process for ever unfolded in the heart of man - that matters of historical fact are without religious significance.' Huxley laments the fact that, despite the efforts of Christian mystics Eckhart, Tauler, Ruysbrock, Boehme and the Quakers - who are themselves inheritors of the esoteric tradition, Christianity has never been 'liberated from its servitude to historical fact' and has 'remained a reli�inn in which the pure Perennial Philosophy has bt.•l'll ovl'rl,lid, now mon•, now lt•ss, by an
H



Who is the Man with a Jar ofWater?
Idolatrous preoccupation with events and things in time- events and things rq�arded not merely as useful means, but as ends intrinsically sacred and llldl•cd divine'. The suggestion that the Gospel story is not history but 'a process for ever unfolded in the heart of man' no doubt seems pretty absurd to those of us who have been raised on a flesh and blood Jesus readily locatable in time .md space. But, in fact, it is no more outrageous than the historical schema proposed to us by orthodoxy. Indeed, it is much less problematic, since it ln•t•s us from having to defend the historicity of incidents which are, to say llw least, unlikely. Only familiarity with such incidents and, perhaps, a sen lirncntal attachment to them, prevent us from declaring them fanciful. Virgins do not give birth; people do not walk on water; storms cannot be ,.,,lrned with a word; a few loaves and a couple of fish cannot feed thousands ,,, people; and people, once dead, do not come back to life again. hmdamentalist Christians, disregarding David Hume's assertion that we �hould doubt our senses before we doubt the consistency of nature's laws, ding desperately to the miraculous element within the Gospels, forlornly t•choing Tertullian's cry: credo quia absurdum, 'I believe because it is absurd'. And even scholars of a more liberal hue, who readily question Jesus' birth from a virgin and are prepared to interpret the other miracles symbolically or as exaggerations of natural incidents, still insist on a literal resurrection as lhe absolute minimum required belief for a Christian. Those for whom the historical details are of little or no consequence, who view the Jesus stories 111 their entirety as dramatizations of internal processes, are no more wel l'llme within orthodoxy than were their forebears who received the rough t•dge of Irenaeus's quill over eighteen centuries ago.
Gospel Discrepancies
To see the Jesus story as a collection of spiritual parables frees us from the rnt•ntal gymnastics involved in trying to explain factual discrepancies within lhe Gospels, and strange anomalies within the New Testament as a whole. For example:
• Was Jesus born in the reign of Herod the Great, as Matthew has it, or when Quirinius, the governor of Syria, ordered a census, as Luke asserts? (Herod died in 4 BCE; Quirinius's census occurred in 6 CE, some ten years later). • Did Jesus cleanse the Temple at the beginning of his ministry Oohn), or a t the end (Matthew, Mark and Luke)?



T11e Gospel and the Zodiac
• Did he heal hvo demon-possessed men in the country of the Gerasenes (Matthew), or just one (Mark)? • Did the crucifixion occur on the day of the Passover (Matthew, Mark and Luke), or the day before the Passover ijohn)? • Did the crucifixion begin at nine o'clock in the morning (Mark) or at mid day ijohn)? • Is it really possible that the normally prudent Romans would risk provok ing a riot by executing a popular Jewish preacher at the time of the Passover when Jerusalem would be bursting with pilgrims from around the known world? • Is it really possible that, during the busiest liturgical season of the year, the high priests would occupy themselves plotting the execution of Jesus? • Why is it that the apostle Paul, with the single exception of his account of the Last Supper in 1 Corinthians 11, never refers to an incident in the life of Jesus even when it would have helped his case immeasurably to do so? For example, in his account of his dispute with Peter over Gentile Christians (Galatians 2 and 3), why does he not mention Jesus' cure of the centurion's servant (Matthew 8:5-13), or the instruction at the end of Matthew's Gospel to 'go and make disciples of all nations ... teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you' (Matthew 28:19-20)? Did he not know of these traditions? Could it be that the Gospels come from a source of which Paul was entirely unaware?
The Historical Jesus
But the most valuable benefit to be gained from viewing the gospel stories as spiritual parables is that it frees us from the interminable and apparently fruitless search for the historical Jesus, which has exercised the ingenuity of scholars for at least two centuries. Albert Schweitzer's reluctant conclusion, that the historical Jesus is lost to us, must be upheld by all but the most ardent apologist for orthodoxy. The Gospels themselves furnish us with pre cious little biographical information, and questions concerning Jesus' physi cal appearance, his early life, his marital status, his personal predilections and his general character have been answered more by imaginative conjec ture or doctrinal expediency than by legitimate inferences from the actual text. Even his age at the time of his crucifixion, which today seems securely fixed at 33, has been a matter of some dispute. lrenaeus concludes, quite reasonably, from the passage in John's Gospel where the Jews say to Jesus: 'You are not yet fifty years old and yl't you clnim to have seen Abraham' Oohn H:57), that such languagl' is only fittingly applil•d to sollll'Oill' who has

p.tssed the age of forty. Further, he claims that, since Jesus came to save all pmple, he must have experienced every stage of life including old age. ln·naeus confidently asserts that he learned this from 'those who were nmversant in Asia with John the disciple of the Lord, affirming that John mnveyed to them that information' (Irenaeus, page 201). In our collective �ll'nlimental need for a relatively youthful Jesus we have conveniently dispensed with this item of tradition. The extra-biblical evidence for the existence of Jesus, which has been so boldly trumpeted by generations of apologists, turns out to be pretty thin when examined closely and dispassionately. The Roman authors, Pliny and Sul'tonius, both writing early in the second century, tell us very little more than that people calling themselves Christians -'followers of a depraved .md excessive superstition', according to Pliny (Pliny, page 405)- were prov mg troublesome in certain parts of the Empire. Tacitus, who was governor ',f Asia around 112 CE, refers in his Annals (Book 15, chapter 44) to the 'no toriously depraved Christians ... whose originator, Christ, had been executed 1n Tiberius's reign by the procurator of Judea, Pontius Pilate', but such a Ntatcment, made nearly eighty years after the supposed event, demonstrates only that some people were making the claim; it certainly does not substan tiate it. Nor can we glean anything of substance from Jewish sources. Philo of AIL·xandria, who died around 50 CE, tells us nothing of Jesus in his volu minous writings, although he does explain that the name Joshua - which is till' Hebrew version of the Greek name Jesus -means 'the salvation of the I .ord', and that it is 'the name of the most excellent possible character' (Philo, page 351). Here is a possible reason why the central character in the Gospel -;tory should be given such a name.* The celebrated passage in the works of the Jewish historian Josephus, which claims that 'about this time lived Jesus, a wise man, if one might call him a man', and which goes on to tell of his miracles, his condemnation to thl' cross and his restoration to life on the third day Gosephus, page 576), has ht•t•n identified as a much later Christian interpolation. Few, if any, scholars now accept this passage as genuine; its presence in the text is testimony to tlw fact that the historicizing tendency within early Christianity was so des perate to furnish evidence for a historical Jesus that it had to invent some. It has long been a fundamental contention of orthodox apologetics that the growth of Christianity is only explicable if its historical claims are

substantially true. After all, it is maintained, people are not prepared to die for a fiction. But this argument is based on the assumption that religious ideas are subjected to rational scrutiny before taking root in the hearts and minds of devotees, and this is plainly not the case, as the events at Jonestown and Waco demonstrate. Faith precedes justification. Indeed, we might say with the ancients, fides quaerens intellectum: faith seeks understanding, and attempts to furnish historical or rational evidence always follow the initial faith impetus. Mithraism-which is much older than Christianity-required no historical founder in order to flourish. It was, in fact, based on mytho logy and stellar symbolism, but this in no way impeded its growth or pre vented it from vying with Christianity for supremacy in the early centuries of the Common Era. Christianity spread for a variety of sociological reasons, principal among these being its appeal to the lower strata of society, and it eventually triumphed because it was adopted as a political expedient by the Emperor Constantine. There is no need to invoke either divine intervention or historical credibility to account for its appeal or its endurance. Mormonism furnishes a relatively contemporary example of the same phenomenon. Despite the extraordinarily implausible nature of its historical claims - angelic visitations, golden plates, ancient civilizations - it has, in less than two hundred years, become a world-wide religious movement with its own holy books, miracles, martyrs, and persecutions. It has also cre ated its own philosophical, theological, scientific and historical rationale; and the whole system is ably defended by scholars of no mean ability. It is probably the fastest-growing (Christian) religion on earth, with over twelve million adherents currently, but its success owes more to its aggressive pros elytizing, its simple certainties, and its comforting metaphysics than it does to the credibility of the supposedly miraculous events surrounding its incep tion. Successive attempts to discredit Joseph Smith's character and to demonstrate the fanciful, or even mendacious, nature of his story seem to have had little impact on the spread of Mormonism, even though informa tion and evidence are much more accessible to contemporary investigators than ever they were in the early days of Christianity. For obvious reasons, orthodox Christian apologists are unable to accept the historical claims made by the Mormons, and are perfectly willing to explain the success of Mormonism - and other religious movements - in sociological, political, or cultural terms; however, they often seem reluctant to accept that the same factors adequately account for the growth of their own system. It is certainly not my intention to try to prove that Jesus did not exist. 1 am perfectly prepared to accept that someone of that name was executed for blasphemy or for treason when Pont i us Pi lall' was �OVl'rnor of Judl•a.

••vt•n be possible that certain aspects of this man's life or career were in rorporated into the Gospel narratives. However, insisting that the Gospels hl' read primarily as history has given us a distorted view of their original nwaning and has led, in no small way, to their rejection by the contemporary world. Even liberal scholars, such as members of the California-based 'Jesus St•minar', have stripped the Gospels of much of their content in what I con 'lidl•r to be the mistaken belief that there is a bedrock of 'authentic' sayings .md incidents, which has been overlaid by mythology, exaggeration, error, or pious fancy. Literalism asks us to accept or reject the Gospels in their e • n t i rety as divinely inspired, inerrant narratives; liberal scholarship, on the ot her hand, has so eroded their content that we don't even need to make the d lurt to reject them; the scholars have done our rejecting for us. B u t, as Rudolf Steiner observed ninety years ago, a 'dialectical soul ' nnsti tution', i.e. a purely intellectual, ' left brain' approach, can make nothing of the Gospels, which, in the hands of the scholars, have become 'just a well-picked carcase' ( Steiner, page 97). The carcase has been picked even cleaner by the twentieth-century scholars, .md they have done so by making a number of quite arbitrary assumptions, which have been accepted almost unquestioningly as axioms in university departments. For example, Steiner alludes to Schmiedel's principle by which wt• could accept as authentic the incident in Mark where Jesus is considered ' lll.•side himself' by his family, but not the Transfiguration, where Jesus is Hhown to be the Son of God. (The first is probably authentic, so the reasoning �oes, because it presents Jesus unfavourably, the other is probably spurious ht•cause it exalts him.) Similarly, scholars realizing that the Jesus story is ,, li ttle strange to be considered as literal history, have adopted a new histor ic<tl category - geschichte - which maintains that the Gospel stories are not just a record of what happened (although, to some extent, they are this), but t hey are also faith proclamations, kerygmatic stories intended to bring pl'ople to belief. In effect, what they are saying is (to adapt Mr Spock's larnous dictum): 'It's history, Jim, but not as we know it.' We also learn that, since the Synoptic* Gospels (Matthew, Mark and Luke) Me, in the main, composed of apparently unconnected episodes, they must Ill.' compilations of remembered incidents, modified somewhat in the telling, collected by the individual evangelists, and strung together arbitrarily like ht•ads on a chain.

The Gospel and the Zodiac
Despite such academic concessions to liberalism, however, there are many who still claim that the Gospel texts show evidence of historical reminis cence. Paul Barnett argues that the Gospels provide numerous examples of details which could only have come from an eyewitness. For example, alone among the evangelists, Mark tells us that Jesus was 'asleep on a cushion' (Mark 4:38) before the storm arose on the sea, and that the Gerasene Demoniac was 'crying out and bruising himself with stones' (Mark 5:5). Barnett comments on these and similar passages:
These words of Mark leap from the page. To my mind they can only have come from the memory of someone who was struck by the drama of the scene or its colour, or sound or strangeness. Behind these words are the recollections of someone who had been present. (Barnett, page 92)
Barnett goes on to claim that details of time, place, and people, argue fac tual authenticity. This can hardly be sustained. Details are the stock-in-trade of all authors. We do not claim that Homer's descriptive powers show that he was present at the events he writes about, nor that the legend of Robin Hood must be true because Sherwood Forest is mentioned. I agree with Barnett that an air of verisimilitude pervades this Gospel, but this has more to do with Mark's skill as a writer than with historical veracity; and, as we shall see, some of the details in the text have a surprising provenance. Barnett's arguments really assume a kind of naivety on the part of Mark, suggesting that the unsophisticated nature of the document he produced must point to historical reminiscence rather than literary skill. But the ' unso phisticated' text is really an illusion. Mark's Gospel is, in fact, considerably more li terary than we might initially suspect: just as with Mark Twain's Huckle/Jerry Finn, we must not let the narrative style mask the artifice of the content. Consider, for example, the account of the Stilling of the Storm (Mark 4:3541). Barnett's claim that this contains eyewitness testimony can hardly be sustained when we realize that Mark's account is a reworking of a few verses from the Psalms. The reader is invited to compare Psalm 1 07: 23-30, with Mark 4:35-41 . It might be argued (and sometimes is, although not by Barnett) that what happened to the apostles on the Sea of Galilee was, in fact, a 'fu lfilment' of this passage in Psalms, and that here, as elsewhere, the Psa lms are as much prophecies as prayers. It is generally frui tless to argue against such a point of view, but we might remind the person who upholds it of the philosophi cal princi pll' calll•d Occa m's I�aznr, which l'lljnins us to t'xplorl' t he natural

Psalm 107: .23-30
Others went out on the sea in ships; t hl'Y were merchants on the mighty waters. They saw the works of the l .ord, his wonderful deeds in the deep. For he spoke and stirred up a h'mpest that lifted high the waves. They mounted up to the heavens .md went down to the depths; in their peril their courage melted .tway. They reeled and staggered l i ke drunken men; they were at t heir wits' end. They cried out to the Lord in their trouble, and he brought them out of their distress. l ie stilled the stonn to a whisper; lht• waves of the sea were hushed. They were glad when it grew calm, .md he guided them to their desired haven.
Mark 4:35-41
That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, 'Let us go over to the other side.' Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him. A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped. Jesus was in the stem sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, 'Teacher, don't you care if we drown?' He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, 'Quiet! Be still!' Then the wind died down and it was completely calm. He said to his disciples, 'Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?' They were terrified and asked each other, 'Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!'
l'x planation of a phenomenon before we have recourse to a supernatural one: it is far more likely that Mark wove his story out of Psalm 107 than that ( ;od prompted the Psalmist to write down a prophecy of an event that was to occur some ten centuries later. Exactly the same might be said of Mark's description of John the Baptist ( Mark 1:6), which owes more to the scriptural portrayal of Elijah (2 Kings I :H) than to supposed eyewitness testimony. However, the most striking l'Xample of this tendency to couch his story in Old Testament language and images can be found in Mark's account of the crucifixion. From 14:32 to the t•nd of chapter 15 there are numerous echoes of the Psalms, particularly l
'salms 22, 31 , and 41 . Do these Psalms contain prophecies of Jesus' death, or d id Mark write about Jesus' death using expressions found in the Psalms?
Mark and Homer
In addition to the motifs drawn from the Hebrew scriptures, however, it 'il'l'ms likely that Mark also uses the Homeric epics, the Odyssey and the Iliad, .ts modds for tlw construction of his narrative. This theory has recent ly been
IS



17te Gospel and the Zodiac
proposed by Professor Dennis R. MacDonald, who demonstrates convinc ingly that incidents in Mark reflect similar incidents in Homer, in both vocabulary and content. For example, Mark's story of the Stilling of the Storm, in addition to its obvious dependence upon Psalm 107, bears comparison with Homer's story of Aeolus's bag of winds in the Odyssey (Odyssey 10:169), and the similarities are so dense and sequential that they could not be accidental. MacDonald comments:
Many details in the story can be found in literary gales elsewhere, but some details are exceedingly rare. Of the hundreds of voyages in ancient literature, few involve a protagonist waking during a storm and rebuking culpable companions. Furthermore, the earliest evangelist provided distinctive flags to alert his readers to the presence of his model. Like Odysseus, who told stories to Aeolus while floating on an island, Jesus told stories floating on a boat. Only in this voyage among all the gospels does Jesus sail 'with other ships', a detail that points to Odysseus's twelve ships. Mark ends his tale with the disciples asking themselves who Jesus was, 'that even the winds and the sea obey him'. He is like Aeolus, the king of winds. (MacDonald, pages 61-2)
Similarly with Mark's account of the Passion and Death of Jesus. While acknowledging Mark's debt to the Hebrew scriptures, MacDonald says that these texts alone cannot account for the Passion narrative as we have it and proposes that Mark modelled several passages in his account- anointing at Bethany, following the water-carrier, Judas's betrayal, Jesus' agony in Gethsemane- after passages in the Odyssey, and that the Crucifixion is mod elled on the death of Hector in Iliad 22. MacDonald points out that 'model ling' does not mean plagiarizing. Students of rhetoric in both Greece and Rome were taught to imitate classical authors - Homer in particular -since, in the words of Quintilian, 'it is expedient to follow whatever has been invented with success' (MacDonald, page 4). But the art was to disguise one's reliance on a model in order to avoid charges of pedantry or plagiarism.
These disguises included altering the vocabulary, varying the order, length and structure of sentences, improving the content, and generat ing a series of formal transformations. Although students usually imi tated a single work, the experienced author borrowed from many ... Such eclecticism also disguised reliance on the primary target of imita tion. Skilled authors were bees that took the best nectar from many blossoms to produn• textual honey. According to St.'m'ca, such apian

authors should 'blend those several flavours into one delicious com pound that, even though it betrays its origin, yet it nevertheless is clear ly a different thing from that whence it came' . One achieves the height of imitation, however, when 'the true copy stamps its own form upon all the features which it has drawn from what we may call the original' so that 'it is impossible for it to be seen who is being imitated'. (MacDonald, pages 5-6)
Such imitations would often strive to be 'transvaluative', i.e. to put forward values which were different from and superior to those found in the origi rMI. This was called zilos in Greek, aemulatio in Latin, and was an attempt 'to "Pl'ak better' than the model, inviting the reader to 'judge the imitation su JWrior, whether in literary expression, philosophical acuity, or religious power' (MacDonald, page 6). MacDonald reckons that although the author ' •I Mark's Gospel has used the careers of Hector and Odysseus as models for lt•sus, he has not simply stolen from the epics, he has transvalued them:
Like Hector, Jesus dies at the end of the book, his corpse is rescued from his executioner, and he is mourned by three women. But unlike Hector, _Jesus is raised from the dead. (MacDonald, pages 3-4).
t.;irnilarly with the Calming of the Storm. Jesus and the apostles, like l ldysseus and his crew, are beset by turbulent winds; Jesus, like Odysseus,
rs asleep; Jesus has his head on a cushion, Odysseus covers his head with a doak. But unlike Odysseus, who has himself inadvertently let the winds out of t he bag, Jesus shows no carelessness and is able to calm the windstorm with a mere word. As we shall see in the chapter on Gemini, Mark not only echoes the l'salrns and the Odyssey in his account of the Calming of the Storm, he also I ncorporates elements from zodiacal mythology, so proving himself to be l nrly apian!* In the light of all this, Barnett's contention that Mark's Passion narrative "'•'Y have come into existence through 'the collaborative effort of Peter and
' Etjuillly pertinent to our contention that Mark's Gospel is structured on the zodiac, is the
r o•n•nlly proposed theory that 'the Iliad was created to preserve ancient knowledge of the heav '

(Wood, page 2)

The Gospel and the Zodiac
Mark back in the middle thirties' (Barnett, page 97), (i.e. that Mark is record ing the memories of Peter), is, quite frankly, preposterous. Even if we assume that the Old Testament references appear in order to lend authority and weight to the account, and that following the Greek models was a con temporary convention, we cannot escape the conclusion that we are dealing with a literary creation and not a series of reminiscences. Barnett's opinion is based more on apologetic concerns than on a dispassionate assessment of the text. There may be history in Mark, but, as Northrop Frye says, 'If any thing historically true is in the Bible, it is there not because it is historically true but for different reasons. The reasons presumably have something to do with spiritual profundity or significance'. (Helms, page 126) Such, in brief, are some of the unquestioned canons of contemporary Gospel scholarship, all of them - fundamentalist and liberal - springing from a desire to substantiate the common and apparently unassailable assertion that ' Christianity is essentially a historical religion'. Meanwhile, a bewildered and sceptical public looks on uncomprehend ingly, and those who seek spiritual succour look increasingly towards the Eastern religions, whose stories have not been butchered and abused quite so severely.
Non-Literalist Approaches
But there are now, and there have always been, those Christians who do not share this obsession with history.* Valentinus and other Gnostics in the very earliest years of Christianity, while not entirely rejecting the historical Jesus, did not spend their time in teasing out the details of his life or in ironing out the inconsistencies in the record. Indeed, Origen, writing in third-century Alexandria -a centre of Gnostic thought - even claims that the writers of scripture have scattered glaring historical inaccuracies throughout their texts in order to discourage the reader from taking the narrative too literally. He writes:
* There are many contemporary religious and quasi-religious movements which can claim a G nostic heritage. Christian Science, which does not iden tify 'the Christ' exclusively w i th Jesus, is in the Gnostic tradition, as are Quakerism and Uni tarianism, which both stress interior 'illumination' and the primacy of con science. More avowedly Gnostic are Theosophy, Steiner's Anthroposophy, Rosicrucianism and some branches of Freemasonry. Mormonism, which appears to have derived much of its theology from Freemasonry, has many Gnostic elements. The Liberal Catholic Church, which i s an offshoot of Theosophy, and the Church of Antiod1, are Christian churdws whkh offt•r tlw sacraments of t ra d i t i onal Catholicism in the conh•xt of a nondo�ma tk, < ;nnstk tlwolo�v.

(Sometimes) impossibilities are recorded for the sake of the more skil ful and inquisitive, in order that they may give themselves to the toil of investigating what is written, and thus attain to a becoming conviction of the manner in which a meaning worthy of God must be sought out in such subjects . . . He (the Holy Spirit) did the same thing both with the evangelists and the apostles - as even these do not contain through out a pure history of events, which are interwoven indeed according to
the letter, but whiclt did not actually occur. (Origen, page 315)
The example Origen gives is from the very first chapter of the Book of < ;l•nesis which tells us that God created light on the first day of creation, but t hat the sun, moon and stars didn't appear until later in the week. A curious o�nomaly, introduced deliberately, says Origen, so that we won't be tempted to take it literally, so that we will be forced to seek a deeper meaning to the ll·xt than the one which immediately suggests itself. Such 'deeper meanings' . 1 re what certain groups of Gnostic Christians sought. Historical questions concerning Jesus of Nazareth are largely irrelevant. What matters is the ' Christ principle', the spirit of illumination, God-consciousness, which Jesus is portrayed as embodying, but which we can discover and embody our selves. To such people, the original Gospel message is not seen as a procla mation of what God has accomplished once and for all in history through the .tgency of his Son. Nor is it an unreasonable and irrational 'call to faith' in a historically elusive Jesus. It is, rather, an allegory of the interior journey w h ich all who hope to achieve union with God must undertake. St Paul himself, considered a champion of orthodoxy, was not averse to llll(•rpreting the Hebrew scriptures allegorically. In 1 Corinthians 10 (verse ·I), he says, anachronistically, that the 'rock' from which the Israelites drank d u ring their wilderness wanderings was Christ; and in Galatians 4 he refers I n the story of Sarah and Hagar (Genesis chapter 21) as a parable to be u nderstood figuratively. However, the most consistent and comprehensive • · x ponent of the allegorical approach to scripture was Paul's contemporary, l 'hilo of Alexandria (whom we mentioned above in relation to the name ' loshua') . Philo's voluminous writings - 900 pages in double columns in a rln•nt edition - are devoted almost entirely to a verse by verse exposition of l l w ' hidden meaning' of the biblical stories. l ll'rc, for example, is Philo's interpretation of the 'six days of creation' :
And h e (the author o f Genesis) says that the world was made in six days, not because the Creator stood in need of a length of time (for it is n.t tu ral that God should do everything at once, not merely by uttering
19



The Gospel and the Zodiac
a command, but by even thinking of it); but because the things created required arrangement; and number is akin to arrangement; and, of all numbers, six is, by the laws of nature, the most productive; for of all the numbers, from the unit upwards, it is the first perfect one, being made equal to its parts, and being made complete by them; the number three being half of it, and the number two a third of it, and the unit a sixth of it, and so to say, it is fonned so as to be both male and female, and is made up of the power of both natures; for in existing things the odd number is the male, and the even number is the female; accordingly, of odd numbers the first is the number three, and of even numbers the first is two, and the two numbers multiplied together make six. It was fitting therefore, that the world, being the most perfect of created things, should be made according to the perfect number, namely six ... (Philo, page 4)
Allegorical interpretations of sacred writings are not the preserve of post Enlightenment sceptics and infidels; they are older than Christianity itself, but they have been neglected and disparaged by generations of literalists for whom 'truth' is synonymous with 'history'.
The Zodiacal Structure of Mark
What evidence is there in the Gospel text for Valentinus' contention that Mark's Gospel uses the sun's annual journey in the heavens as a metaphor of the interior journey? There is one very conspicuous clue. Towards the end of the Gospel, Jesus instructs two of his disciples to go into the city, where they will be met by a man carrying ajar ofwater (Mark 14:13). Who is this man, and why the necessity for such a strange meeting? Commentators have made a variety of suggestions, of which this, by William Barclay, is typical:
His disciples wished to know where they would eat the Passover. Jesus sent them into Jerusalem with instructions to look for a man carrying an earthen pitcher of water. That was a pre-arranged signal. To carry a water-pot was a woman's duty. It was a thing that no man ever did. A man with a water-pot on his shoulder would stand out in any crowd as much as, say, a man on a wet day with a lady's umbrella. Jesus did not leave things until the last minute. Long ago he had arranged a last meeting place for himself and his disciples, and had arranged just how it was to be found. (Barclay, Mark, page 331)
211



Wllo is the Man with a far of Water?
But such an explanation is hardly adequate. Had Jesus met the man before and set the whole thing up in advance? Barclay thinks so, but the Gospel tells us nothing about such a meeting. And what would be the point of such a sig nal? Barclay himself admits that it cannot have been an attempt to do things rovertly: meeting a man carrying a jar of water would have been like meet ing someone dressed like a harlequin - hardly a way to go unnoticed. To anyone familiar with zodiacal symbolism, however, the man carrying the waterjar is immediately recognizable as the symbol of the sign Aquarius. llut why should he appear at this point in the narrative? And why should other Aquarian images appear close by, images of social upheaval which would be announced by signs in the 'clouds of heaven' (Mark 13:26)? More intriguing still, why are these Aquarian images followed by an array of l 'iscean ones - betrayal, suffering, sacrifice - as the Gospel draws to a close? If these two signs, the final two of the zodiac, are so clearly evident, is it not just possible that the others are present, too? Indeed they are present. Not with the obvious pictograms of the signs (although at least one other of these 1s present), but with imagery and themes drawn from zodiacal mythology .md psychology. In fact, the Gospel can be divided with no trouble whatso t•ver into sections which bear the characteristics of each of the zodiacal signs. This only applies to Mark's Gospel. Although the other two synoptics (Matthew and Luke) contain much of the same material as Mark, the stories Ml' ordered differently. Similarly with John: there is no zodiacal order.

Zodiacal Divisions of Mark's Gospel
This is remarkable enough. Even more remarkable is the fact that Mark also i ncorporates themes from the 'decans', i.e. the constellations surrounding t he zodiacal constellations (see Appendix 2 for a list of the decans). Over half of these 36 constellations are alluded to in Mark's text. In addition, we will rl·gularly notice that, while Mark's stmcture is zodiacal, parallel stories in the ot her two synoptic Gospels sometimes show their zodiacal signature more 1•vidently than Mark. This seems to imply that all three evangelists had oll"CCSS to an earlier, clearly zodiacal document, and that while Mark has pre Sl'rved the original sequence, Matthew and Luke sometimes reflect the astro logical details better than Mark. It may be objected that the above sections are of differing lengths - from t h ree chapters in the case of Aries, to a few verses in the case of Virgo and Scorpio. There are a number of possible reasons for this, the most plausible l
wi ng that the Gospel we now possess is a truncated version of the original. The 'Secret Gospel' of Mark would lend support to this theory.
The 'Secret' Gospel of Mark
Su pport for the theory that Mark is in some way connected with esoteric t hou ght and that he employs a zodiacal structure is provided by the letter of l "lement of Alexandria (second century AD) to Theodore. In this letter, dis rovered by Professor Morton Smith in 1958 at the Monastery of Mar Saba, Clement castigates the 'unspeakable teachings of the Carpocratians' ( B.lmstone, page 341) who, apparently, had been saying things about Mark's ( ;ospd which Clement considered to be u ndermining to orthodoxy. He writes:
21



The Gospel and the Zodiac
Now of the things they keep saying about the divinely inspired Gospel according to Mark, some are altogether falsifications, and others, even if they do contain some true elements nevertheless are not reported truly. (Barnstone, page 341)
Clement goes on to explain that Mark, in addition to writing 'an account of the Lord's doings' for catechumens (i.e. beginners, those under instruction), also produced a ' more spiritual Gospel', and, what is more, that he knew of other teachings and traditions which he did not write down but which would 'lead initiates into the innermost sanctuary of the truth'. Clement then gives 'word for word' the text of the 'secret' passage and its location in the canonical Gospel. It is worth quoting in full:
And they came into Bethany. And a certain woman whose brother had died was there. And, coming, she prostrated herself before Jesus and said to him, 'Son of David, have mercy on me.' But the disciples rebuked her. And Jesus, being angered, went off with her into the gar den where the tomb was, and straightway a great cry was heard from the tomb. And going near Jesus rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb. And straightway, going in where the youth was, he stretched forth his hand and raised him, seizing his hand. But the youth, looking upon him, loved him and began to beseech him that he might be with him. (Bamstone, page 342)
Death and regeneration are, in astrology, Scorpionic themes and, interestingly, Clement tells us that this passage is located at the very beginning of what we
have designated the 'Scorpio section ' of this Gospel. Clement writes, 'After these
words follows the text, " And James and John come to him"', i.e. after chapter 10 verse 34. This fragment seems to support the theory that Mark's Gospel has under gone a number of revisions and that, in Barnstone's words, 'the canonical Gospel of Mark appears to be an abridgement of the Secret Gospel of Mark' (Barnstone, page 340). The fact that our present version of Mark does not have a satisfactory ending would also tend to support this view. Did the 'secret Gospel' end in a way that orthodox clerics found objectionable? If the Secret Gospel of Mark was, as its name implies, an esoteric work, then a zodiacal structure which is still preserved in the canonical version is not unthinkable. What seems to me increasingly likely is that all the canonical Gospels owe their origi n to an arcane or esoteric source whose original pur pose was to provide spiritual gu i dance for the coming ' m•w agt•', the Age of

Pisces (see next chapter). This original purpose became obscured by the his toricizing wing of the Christian church, but its presence can still be detected. Matthew and Luke reflect it in their infancy narratives, and Mark preserves it in the very structure of his Gospel.
Carrington's Calendrical Theory of Mark
The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me ... to proclaim the year of tl1e Lord'sfavour. (Luke 4: 1 8-19)
The structure of Mark's Gospel has been a point of contention since the earli l'st days of Christianity. Papias, who was Bishop of Hierapolis in South
Phrygia during the first thirty years of the second century, alludes to it in his work The Exposition of the Oracles of the Lord, which is no longer extant, but parts of which are preserved in Eusebius's Ecclesiastical History, written dur i ng the fourth century. Oaiming one 'John the elder' as his source, Papias informs us that:
Mark who was (or, who became) Peter's interpreter wrote down accu rately though not in order (or, without orderliness) all that he remem bered of what Christ had said or done. He did not hear the Lord, nor was he a follower of his; but at a later date, as I have said, he followed Peter, who adapted his teaching to meet the needs of his hearers, but not as if he was giving a systematic compilation of the Lord's oracles. Mark therefore made no mistake, but he wrote down some things as he remembered them, for he had one purpose in mind, not to omit any thing he had heard, and not to falsify anything in it. (Barclay, 1 966, page 120; emphasis added.)
l '.1 pias' denial of orderliness in Mark's Gospel continues to puzzle commen l .•tors, particularly orthodox ones, who tend to find Mark's chronological mder reasonably acceptable. Could it be that Papias is denying a zodiacal mder in Mark which certain Gnostic groups may have been claiming it to possess? From the point of view of the present study, however, the most significant t lwory about the structure of Mark was put forward in 1952 by Philip t ·,, rrington, the Anglican Archbishop of Quebec, in his book The Primitive 1 hristitm Calendar: A Study in the Making of tlte Marean Gospel. Carrington al.1 i med that Mark's Gospel is structured around the Jewish yearly cycle, and t ha t the individual units of the narrative have been arranged to reflect the
25



The Gospel and the Zodiac
principal festivals of the liturgical year. Carrington suggests that the starting point was the Jewish New Year in the autumn, but despite this he puts for ward an enormous amount of evidence which would link Mark with the solar cycle beginning in March. He tells us that although the Jewish New Year began in September, the months were counted from March. Nisan 1 was the first new moon after the equinox. He also points out that the Diatessaron, a digest of the four Gospels into one volume compiled by Tatian about 160 C.E, was not merely a lectionary but a calendar, too: 'Its beginning falls in the spring equinox, which agrees with the date of 25 March which seems to have become fairly settled in Rome ... as a sort of ecclesiastical New Year' (Carrington, page 29). l11e Clementine Homilies, too, which were com posed no later than the 170s CE, state that Jesus' ministry began in the spring and lastedfor a full year.
More pertinent still is the association of the Gospel of Mark with Alexandria, hotbed of Gnosticism. Carrington reminds us of Eusebius's con tention that Mark was the founder of Alexandrian Christianity, whose prin cipal heresies were ' Adoptionism' - the theory that Christ descended into the man, Jesus, at his baptism; and the 'docetic' heresy that the Christ did not die on the cross but someone else, probably Simon of Cyrene, died in his place. Such ideas would only find support in a gospel like Mark's, which lacks Birth and Resurrection narratives. The Alexandrian, Valentinus, preached such doctrines. As we noted above, he taught that Jesus' ministry lasted for twelve months and that these twelve months correspond to the hvelve signs of tlze zodiac (Carrington, page 52). This year-long ministry was attacked by Irenaeus in a kind of argument, which, says Carrington, indicates that the controversy was not a new one.
Who wrote Mark's Gospel?
In much Christian preaching and in many elementary expositions of the Gospels, the author of Mark's Gospel is assumed to be John-Mark, the son of Mary (Acts 12:12) and the cousin of Barnabas (Colossians 4:10). This is the Mark who accompanied Paul and Barnabas on their first missionary journey (Acts 12:25), but who turned back and was subsequently held in disfavour by Paul (Acts 1 5:36-39) . A certain ' Mark' is mentioned by the author of the Second Letter of Timothy (2 Tim. 4:1 1 ), and the author of I Peter refers to ' Mark, my son' (1 Pet. 5:13); these latter may be references to John-Mark, but we have no way of knowing for sure. Such uncertainty has not deterred some Christian writers from working these isolated texts i n to a composi tt• pic t u re of a young man w ho was cloSl' l'nough to those

who knew Jesus to write a brief but honest and reliable account of Jesus' l i fe and ministry. And one still reads and hears that the author of this Cospel was the young man in the linen cloth who ran away as Jesus was being crucified (Mark 14:51). However, such an attempt to identify the author of Mark's Gospel, and to locate him so precisely in time and space, owes more to fanciful apologetics than to evidence. The plain fact is that we have no idea who the author might be. Whatever Christian piety might assume, all four gospel authors are .monymous, an uncomfortable admission which even the most die-hard con servative Christian will have to make when pressed. Mark is usually associated with the apostle Peter, and popular piety has Mark and Peter together in Rome just before Peter's martyrdom. But, as we saw above, there is another tradition associating 'Mark' with Alexandria, .md this is a far more likely place for the Gospel's composition. Living in Alexandria around the time of Jesus were the Therapeutae, and l 'hi lo's glowing description of this group of Jewish monks and nuns should remind us that the Judaism out of which Christianity sprang was extremely d iverse and certainly not composed entirely of those who held to exoteric i n terpretations of the scriptures. According to Philo, they read biblical stories as allegories 'since they look upon their literal expressions as symbols t ,f some secret meaning of nature, intended to be conveyed in those figura t ive expressions'. They had in their possession the writings of 'ancient men . . . who have left behind them many memorials of the allegorical system of writing and explanation, whom they take as a kind of model, and imitate the gt·neral fashion of their sect; so that they do not occupy themselves solely in nmtemplation, but they likewise compose psalms and hymns to God in •·very kind of metre and melody imaginable.' They pray each morning ' w hen the sun is rising, entreating God that the happiness of the coming day may be real happiness, so that their minds may be filled with heavenly light' ( l 'hilo, page 700). For such people, an account of the spiritual journey based on the solar ' vcle would not be unthinkable and, in my view, Mark's Gospel - or the document from which the Gospel was derived - is more likely to have been mmposed as a text for use in this or some similar esoteric school than to h.1w been compiled as a fragmentary history or as a 'call to faith'.

In Charles Dickens' final, uncompleted work, The Mystery of Edwin Drood, the lawyer, Mr Grewgious, gazes meditatively at the stars 'as if he would have read in them something that was hidden from him'. Many of us would do the same, continues Dickens, 'but none of us so much as know our letters in the stars yet - or seem likely to, in this state of existence - and few languages can be read until their alphabets are mastered'. Dickens seems to imply that our understanding of the stellar language lies some way in the future, that the astronomical Rosetta Stone awaits the dis covery of secular science; or, perhaps, that such understanding belongs to a higher realm of existence altogether and will always elude us in our mortal state. Dickens' fanciful notion no doubt seems even more quaint to us than it did to his first readers. The idea that the stars might be trying to communi cate with us in an unknown tongue belongs in the realm, not just of fantasy, but of absurdity, we think. We know all about the incomprehensible stellar distances; we know that even those stars which look close together are really billions of miles apart; we know that those tiny points of light, whose flick ering seems to invite us into dialogue, are really unimaginably large balls of mute, incandescent gas, which are daily yielding their secrets, not to

li nguists, but to astronomers and physicists. Sean O'Casey's question 'What is the stars?' can only receive a prosaic answer from us, Mr Gradgrind's fact obsessed children, who live amid glaring street lights, under polluted skies, with a thousand distractions to keep our eyes firmly pointed downwards, and a culturally fostered suspicion of anything which cannot be weighed, measured, probed, or dissected. It has not always been so. In former ages, when people had time but no television, when the poetic imagination soared nightly beneath the star strewn heavens, our ancestors devised an intricate and beautiful stellar lan guage: astrology, a mixture of primitive science, sophisticated mythology, rudimentary psychology, and fatalistic prophecy, which was the lingua fran m of the ancient world. The language of the stars does not, as Dickens fan cied, belong to the future; one dialect of it, at least, has existed for thousands of years and has had considerable influence on many aspects of our culture.
The word 'influence' itself derives from an astrological world view, as do
disaster, lunatic, venereal, mercurial, saturnine, jovial. Astrology has exercised
the minds of some of the human race's most celebrated philosophers, artists, and scientists,* and although, latterly, it has become associated with fatuous newspaper horoscope columns, a small but dedicated band of contemporary a u thors and researchers struggles to re-establish its intellectual credibility. I fowever, for the most part, the scholarly world has chosen to forget about it. Such forgetfulness may not be too detrimental to our contemporary scien tific endeavours, but it can only give us a distorted view of the cultural prod ucts of the past. The celebrated historian of religion, Franz Cumont, for whom astrology was ' nothing but the most monstrous of all the chimeras begotten of superstition', admitted that it was 'indissolubly linked not only with astronomy and meteorology, but also with medicine, botany, etlmo graphy, and physics. If we go back to the earliest stages of every kind of learning, as far as the Alexandrine and even the Babylonian period, we shall I ind almost everywhere the disturbing influence of these astral mathematics'. He goes on to te11 us that 'this hallucination, the most persistent which has ever haunted the human brain', left its mark on the religious life of past genera tions, dominating the religion of Babylon, informing the highest phases of

ancient paganism, and 'by changing the character of ancient idolatry, it was to prepare in many respects for the coming of Christianity' (Cumont, page xvii and page xxiv). Given the widespread influence of astrology on virtually every aspect of life in the ancient world, it is strange that most orthodox Jewish and Christian commentators, failing to find any examples of a narrowly defined system of stellar divination in its pages, seem to assume that the Bible is uniquely free of astrology's influence. This leads to the curious irony of Christian fundamentalists sporting the Piscean fish logo on their lapels and on their cars, while loudly proclaiming that astrology is a tool of Satan. Some are even surprised to learn that the dates of Christendom's principal festi vals, Christmas and Easter, are determined by reference to astronomical cycles: Christmas is celebrated at the time of the winter solstice, when the sun enters Capricorn; and Easter Sunday is the first Sunday after the first full moon following the spring equinox, i.e. when the sun is in Aries. The major Jewish festivals are also based on solar and lu nar cycles. Thcst> are relativdy wl'll known, hu t other features of Christian - particularly

71te Forgotten LAnguage of the Stars
Catholic - liturgical and devotional practice have an astrological origin, of which few, if any theologians seem to be aware. For example, eating fish on Fridays did not originally mean refraining from meat in memory of the cru cifixion of Jesus (as many Catholics assume). It was a deliberate act of com nlUning with Christ; Friday was chosen for this because it was the day of Venus, the planet said by the ancients to be 'exalted' in Pisces, the sign of the Fish. The Feast of the Transfiguration of Jesus, when his face 'shone like the sun' (Matthew 17:2) is celebrated on 6 August, when the sun is in Leo, ' the sign of divine splendour', the sign which, according to the ancient .1strologers, was 'ruled' by the sun. The months of May and October, set .1side by Catholics as times to give special honour to the Virgin Mary, were not chosen arbitrarily: May is the month of Taurus, October the month of Libra, both signs being associated with the planet Venus, 'The Morning Star' (one of Mary's titles in the litany of the Blessed Virgin). The great feast days in honour of Mary, her 'birthday' on 8 September, and her 'Assumption into I leaven' in August, both owe their origin to astrology, as we shall see in the chapter on Virgo. November, for Catholics the month of the 'holy souls' in Pu rgatory, is the Scorpio month, chosen because Scorpio is associated with purgation, expiation and regeneration. The Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, (c.37-100 CE) tells us that certain parts of the Temple in Jerusalem were decorated with celestial and zodiacal i magery. The veil separating the inner and outer courts was decorated with symbols of the zodiac signs, the seven lamps before the altar of incense si).;nified the seven planets, and the twelve loaves that were upon the table signified the circle of the zodiac and the year Gosephus, page 1 07). So, before the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE, astrological symbolism could be lound at the very heart of Jewish worship. And the Jewish greeting mazzal tov, which means ' (may you have) fortunate constellations', demonstrates that contemporary Judaism still has some residual connection with constel l.llional astrology. The Bible itself came into being at a time when astral mythology was in nmstant vogue, and was written for the most part after the Jewish people h.1d spent fifty years of exile (586-536 BCE) in astrologically oriented Babylon. Si nce it was produced in such a context it would be remarkable if the Bible d id not show signs of astrological influence. There are many who would hold that, while this is true, the Bible only ll ll'ntions astrology in order to condemn it, and that there is condemnation 1 1f dh,inalion, astrological or otherwise, cannot be denied. The Book of l .l'viticus, for example, commands the death penal ty for all who have 'famil i.u- spirits', or who are wizards (Leviticus 20:27), and the prophet Jeremiah
11



The Gospel and the Zodiac
cautions his readers not to be 'dismayed at the signs of heaven' Geremiah 10:2). A thoroughly comprehensive condemnation of astrology can be found in Isaiah:
All the counsel you have received has only wom you out! Let your astrologers come forward, those stargazers who make predictions month by month, let them save you from what is coming upon you . . . (Isaiah 47:13)
The prophetic tradition i n general i s opposed to any doctrine o r divinatory technique that would undermine belief in the absolute power of God. For Isaiah or for Jeremiah there can be no intermediate powers exercising control in God's universe; and there can be no cosmic factors upon which human beings can heap the blame for their own shortcomings. The moral relation between man and God demands human accountability and this can only be intelligible if people have free will. But the Bible does not exclusively reflect this prophetic tradition. Elsewhere in its pages we can find traces of astrological thinking which indi cate that antipathy towards stellar 'influence' was not universal in ancient Israel. The most celebrated passage of this type occurs in the Book of Judges, where we learn that 'From the heavens the stars fought, from their courses they fought against Sisera' Gudges 5:20). This is the only occasion that the stars are credited with autonomous power, and the statement might owe as much to poetic licence as to a genuine belief in direct stellar influence. However, Rabbi Joel C. Dobin has done extensive work on the language of stellar reference in the Bible, and he concludes that there is a significant ' paranatural' usage of a word like ' heavens' which implies that 'these Heavens or their minions are called on to exhibit intelligence or awareness not in consonance with their natural place in the physical universe' (Dobin, page 92). What he means by this is that in a text such as ' " Be appalled at this, 0 heavens, and shudder with great horror" declares the Lord' Geremiah 2:12), there is a real implication that the heavenly bodies possess (figurat ively, of course), some measure of consciousness which transcends their objective status as lumps of rock moving around the sky. The Hebrew root MSL 'rule', which is often used in connection with the sun, moon, and stars ('The sun to govern the day . . . the moon and stars to govern the night ... ', Psalm 136:8-9) has, says Dobin, an ethical dimension 'which implies con scious and intelligent control of both self and subjects as well as leadership by example ... (which is) precisely the type of rulership ascribed by astrology to these heavenly bodies' (Dobin, page 89). There are passages in the Bible which certainly lead us to infer that the



The Forgotten Language of the Stars
!!tars are meant to signal God's will. In the first creation story, for example, we read that on the fourth creative day God made the sun, moon, and stars ' for signs and for seasons' (Genesis 1:14). The word translated as 'signs' is the Hebrew 'owth, which means 'something that points to something else'* and, in this context, it certainly has an astrological dimension. This statement perceives the celestial bodies as instruments of divine providence, as mes sengers from God to man. The star which the magi follow in order to find Jesus (Matthew 2:2) is a clear example of this concept. A similar idea can be found in the first verse of Psalm 19: 'The heavens declare the glory of God; and the skies proclaim the work of his hands.' There is no implication, here or elsewhere, that the planets and stars are to be worshipped, but there is a definite suggestion that, in some sense, they are a sacrament of God's presence. And when the psalm goes on to tell us that there is nowhere in the earth where their voice is not heard (verse 4), we can legitimately assume that behind such expressions lay a belief in the planets and stars as universal images of divine transcendence. The rest of the psalm leaves us in no doubt that the order in the heavens reflects the moral order of the universe, and that a God who creates such harmony must demand a l i fe of harmony from human beings.
The Zodiac in the Bible
Despite its unfortunate contemporary association with bead curtains, crystal balls and newspaper fortune-telling, there is nothing inherently magical about the zodiac. It is defined as a belt of the sky extending eight or nine dl•grees on either side of the ecliptic, the circle that the sun appears to trace i n its yearly journey around the earth. The constellations of the zodiac are t he groups of stars which provide a backdrop to this journey. So, when we say that the sun is 'in' the constellation Aries, for example, we mean that the stars of the constellation Aries are in the background at this particular stage of the sun's annual cycle. The Hebrews called the zodiac mazzaroth, a word which means 'separ ·•h•d', 'divided'; the singular mazzal denoting an individual constellation. ( 'hapter 9 of the Book of Job mentions 'The Bear, Orion, the Pleiades, and the ··nnstellations of the south' (verse 9). The Bear, A rish in Hebrew, refers to the

constellation Ursa Major; Orion is a very conspicuous non-zodiacal constel lation, and the Pleiades is a beautiful group of stars in the constellation Taurus. Later in Job we read:
Can you bind the beautiful Pleiades? Can you loose the cords of Orion? Can you bring forth the constellations (mazzaroth) in their seasons or lead out the Bear with its cubs? Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you set up God's dominion over the earth? (Job 38: 31 -33)
Even though the expression 'laws of the heavens' Gob 38:33) does seem to reflect a 'paranatural' use of the word 'heaven' of the type described by Dobin, we cannot assume from this passage an endorsement of astrology by the author of the Book of Job. However, we can deduce from passages like this that nowhere in the Bible is there any censure of the zodiac itself. Seiss w rites:
The wonder is that the Jewish prophets never once assail it [the zodiac] or speak one word against it, even when burdened with messages of the wrath and punishment of God upon heathenism and idolatry. Had this system been nothing but an outgrowth of the wild imaginations of man incorporated as it was with false religions then dominating all over the world, it is next to impossible to explain why it was not pre rninently singled out for prophetic malediction (page 178).
That the Hebrews regarded the zodiac as originating with God himself is implied in Job 26:13:
By his breath the skies became fair; his hand pierced the gliding serpent.
' Became fair' is from the Hebrew shiphrah, which means 'beautify', and the 'gliding serpent' is either a reference to the zodiac itself, which is often depicted as a snake with its tail in its mouth, or to the constellation Hydra, The Fleeing Serpent. This verse is an example of 'parallelism', a feature of Hebrew poetic style in which the second part of a verse repeats in modified form the sense of the first part. The implication, then, is that the spirit ('breath') of God has made the heavens beautiful by shaping the constella tions themselves; that God and not the disordered human imagination is the au thor of the zodiac. This sentiment is repeated in Psalm 1 47, where we read that God 'determines the nu mber of the stars and calls them each by name' (verse 4).



17ze Forgotten Language of the Stars
The author of the apocryphal book of Enoch (composed probably in the second century BCE) is even more convinced of the divine origin of the zodiac:
When I beheld them (the twelve constellations) I blessed; every time in which they appeared, 1 blessed the Lord of glory, who had made those great and splendid signs, that they might display the magnificence of his works to angels and to the souls of men; and that these might glori fy all his works and operations; might see the effect of his power; might glorify the great labour of his hands; and bless him for ever. (Enoch 35:3; See Prophet, page 135)
Archaeologists have uncovered zodiacs in the floors of ancient synagogues which clearly show the traditional astrological pictograms. The central fig lift' in the zodiac found in the Beth Alpha synagogue is of the sun in his char illI making his journey around the circle of the stars. The annual journey of the sun through the zodiac is a natural symbol for .111 journeys and, in particular, for the life-journey of the human being. The word 'zodiac' comes from the primitive root zoad, 'a walk, way, or going by steps' (Seiss, page 17),* and is related to the Greek word lwdos, 'road', and I he Sanskrit sodi, 'path'. It is worth remembering in this context that the early <.. 'hristians were said to be followers of The Way (Acts 24:14). The solar myth 11f the hero who goes out to meet a series of ordeals (usually twelve) before rl'turning in triumph is patterned on the sun's annual cycle. Gilgamesh is o.;uch a solar hero, as are Hercules and Theseus. Related ideas are found in l he Arthurian legends, in which the king sits in the centre of a round table surrounded by twelve knights. Such solar heroes usually have an unusual birth. Hercules, for example, ,although held to be the son of Amphitryon, was really the son of Zeus who, in l ime-honoured custom, had visited Amphitryon's wife, Alcmena, while her husband was away at the wars. Perseus was also sired by Zeus, who came to l 'erseus's mother Danae in the form of a golden shower. The Bible has its own solar myth in the story of Samson Oudges 13-16). Like the Greek heroes, and l ikl' Isaac (Genesis 21:1) and Samuel (1 Samuel Iff.), Samson's entry into the world is the result of divine intervention. His mother is barren, but is informed of the impending conception of a son by an angelic visitor Oudges 1:2-25). Samson's name in Hebrew is Shimshon, from the root Shemesh, sun. His

name means 'Sun-one' or, as Dobin has it, 'Belonging-to-the-sun' (Dobin, page 115). Today we would probably call him 'Sonny'. His concubine is the Philistine, Delilah, whose name comes from deliy, 'water-bucket', the same word as is used in Hebrew for the constellation Aquarius. In astrology the sun is said to Irule' Leo, the sign of the midsummer when the sun's rays are at their fiercest. Samson's first feat of strength is the killing of the lion (Leo) in the vineyards of Timnath. In Aquarius, a winter constellation, the sun, its power at its weakest, is said to be in its 1 detriment'. Delilah (Aquarius) clips Samson's mane (the sun's rays) and so brings about his downfall. He dies in the temple of the fish god, Dagon, between two pillars, echoing the sun's death in Pisces, the sign of the (two) Fish, and prefiguring the Piscean death of Jesus between two thieves.
Cosmic Harmony
In addition to being a natural symbol of the spiritual journey, the zodiac also provided the ancient poets with a symbol of regularity, order and harmony. The stars which make up the constellations of the sky appear immutably fixed in relation one to another, and although the sun, moon and planets have their own individual movements through the zodiac, their cycles can be charted, their positions predicted. Such an orderly procession must have fascinated the ancient world, contrasting sharply with the chaotic quality of earthly life, and providing a paradigm of that search for order upon which all human beings are engaged. Apocalyptic imagery, which can be found in both the Jewish and the Christian scriptures, springs in part from this perception of order in the night sky. Apocalyptic writing is often confused with prophecy since it pur ports to describe what will happen when God enters history in a decisive manner to vindicate Israel. However, the stylized imagery and the impossible nature of the supposed events mark apocalyptic writing more as a literary genre than as a realistic attempt to predict the future. The cosmic nature of the imagery is readily discernible. For instance, in Joel, we read:
I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and billows of smoke. The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. ' (Joel 2: 30-31 ).
And in Isaiah:
The stars of heaven and their constellations will not show their light. The rising sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light. (Isaiah 1 3: 1 0)
16



The Forgotten Language of the Stars
joel makes specific reference to celestial signs presaging the calamities that the day of the Lord will bring, and this echoes the verse in Genesis which declares that the stars are for 'signs and for seasons' (Genesis 1 :14). In addition, however, there is the underlying assumption in all such passages that dis order on earth will be accompanied by disorder in the heavens, that there is a nmnection between celestial and terrestrial events. This is an expression of the .mcient axiom 'as above, so below', and is fundamentally astrological. These themes appear in a different guise in other parts of the Bible. In Ezekiel chapter 1, a passage that has long perplexed scholars, the prophet's vision of the majesty of God is expressed in a welter of images which defy our ability to translate words into pictures. In the midst of this overwhelming ,may of metaphors, however, we read that out of the great cloud of God's glory 'came the likeness of four living creatures' (Ezekiel 1:5). It goes on:
Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a man, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle.
!'his is an image of the immutability of God expressed in terms of the four ' Fixed' signs of the zodiac: Aquarius, the Man; Leo, the Lion; Taurus, the Ox;
Fig. 3 'Christ in Majesty' (c. 1 220). Design from a psalter and prayer book carry ing the astrological symbols of the four Evangelists.

Scorpio, the Eagle.* Scorpio is variously represented in ancient writings as a scorpion, a snake, or, in this case, as an eagle. It is probable that the eagle's supposed ability to 'renew its youth' (see Psalm 103:5), to regenerate itself, identified it with Scorpio, the sign of regeneration. The image of God standing ' four-square' with his people, of the divine perfection coming to dwell on earth, is further explored by Ezekiel in the lat ter part of his book in which he describes his vision of the New Temple which will be built to replace the one destroyed by the Babylonians (Ezekiel 40:5ff.). The detailed measurements of the structure are reminiscent of the complex and precise instructions given for the construction of the Tabernacle (Exodus 25ff.) and for Solomon's Temple (1 Kings Sff.). All these passages describe tJ1e attempt to reflect the perfection of God in the things of time. Symmetry and harmony, which characterize the heavens, are to be expressed in wood and stone. Strachan says:
As the structure of the temple expressed the perfect harmony of the cos mos in architectural proportions equivalent to those of pure musical intervals, so its contents expressed the same universal harmony in its earthly form of the trees, food, and fragrance of Eden. (Strachan, page 34)
In the final drama of the whole Bible we read about the New Jerusalem which will descend 'out of heaven from God' (Revelation 21ff.). Once again the all-encompassing perfections of this cubic structure are a reflection of the harmony of the heavens which, in turn, reflect the perfections of God. John's constant repetition of the zodiacal number twelve - the twelve Tribes of Israel, the twelve Apostles, the twelve gates of the city - underlines the cos mic dimension of his vision. The jewels which are to adorn the foundation of the city wall are unquestionably astrological, and are related to the jewels that symbolized the Twelve Tribes of Israel in the breastplate of the high priest (Exodus 28:17-21).
The Number 7
The sacred n umber 7, which occurs in nearly 600 biblical passages (Davies, J., page 116), is probably associated with the idea of cosmic harmony. We learn from Genesis that God blessed and sanctified the seventh day (Genesis 2:3), and from Leviticus (chapter 2.'�) that the Jewish liturgical year was con

�tructed around septenary cycles. The seventh month, the seventh year, and t he 'seven by seven' year have great significance in Judaism. There have hl•en a good many attempts to explain why seven is so important: it is the number of planets (including the sun and moon) visible to the naked eye; it is the number of days in a lunar quarter; it is the number of visible stars in t he constellation Ursa Major which, since it never leaves the northern sky, was a natural symbol of permanence and indestructibility. These all seem plausible enough, and any or all of them could be the source of the number's symbolic reference. However, Joseph Epes Brown in his 17te Spiritual Legacy • •l tl1e American Indian notes that seven was also considered sacred on the American continent, and the reason he gives could well help to explain its i mportance in biblical symbolism:
The concept of the vertical axis explains the sacredness of the number seven to the Indians, and it is interesting to note that their interpreta tion is identical to that found in other major religions. In adding the vertical dimensions of sky and earth to the four horizontal ones of space, we have six dimensions, with the seventh as the point of centre where all directions meet. (Page 36)
For the Native American shaman, Black Elk, the 'point of centre where all directions meet' was Harney Point in South Dakota but, as he went on to remark, · .mywhere is the centre of the world' (Campbell, 1 986, page 34). The centre of the world is where you are, where I am; 'though the imagery is necessarily physical and thus apparently of outer space ... the inner connotation is .1lways ... psychological and metaphysical, which is to say, of inner space' (l ·ampbell, 1986, page 31). The individual human being is the meeting point • •f outer and inner space, a point of contact symbolized by the number seven, ,l fld the function of the spiritual quest is to reproduce the macrocosmic order 1 11 the individual microcosm. In biblical terms, then, the New Temple, the l loly of Holies, the New Jerusalem, become metaphors of internal transfor l llrltions rather than descriptions of physical structures. The temple we are bu ilding is the temple of our own spirit: for Mark, it is to be built according to the blueprint of perfection that we find in the skies.

changes from year to year with reference to the fixed stars. The movement does not amount to much - about one degree of arc in seventy-two years* but it has given rise to the concept of the Great Year, a period of 25,920 years, the time taken for the equinoctial point to travel throughout the circle of the constellations. Astronomically this phenomenon is known as the 'precession of the equinoxes' since the equinoctial point appears to go backwards through the constellations. Every 2,160 years (25,920 divided by 12) or so, the equinox moves from one constellation to another. At present it is moving from Pisces into Aquarius; at the beginning of the Christian era it was moving from Aries into Pisces, and, at the time of Abraham, from Taurus into Aries. According to Vera Reid, the approximate dates of these 'ages' are as follows:
Age of Leo Age of Cancer Age of Gemini Age of Taurus Age of Aries Age of Pisces Age of Aquarius
c10800-8640 BCE C 8640-6430 BCE C 6430-4320 BCE C 4320-2160 BCE c 2160 BCE-1 CE c 1-2160 CE c 2160-4320 CE
Each of these 2,160 year periods constitutes an 'age' - the Age of Aries, the Age of Pisces, the Age of Aquarius, and so on - each age representing a new phase in the spiritual history of the human race. According to this theory, the religious symbols of each new age reflect the zodiacal constellation into which the equinoctial point has passed. Biblical symbolism certainly seems to accord with this. The dominant symbol of the Age of Aries, which began c. 2,160 BCE, was the Ram (see Genesis 22:13), displacing the Bull which thereafter (among the Hebrews at least) became a symbol of wickedness and debauchery. The story of Moses, from his encounter with God in the fire (Exodus 3) to his forty years of wilderness wanderings, abounds in Arien imagery. Michelangelo, who was undoubtedly familiar with esoteric tradi tions, depicts him wearing ram's homs.t The Passover meal at which the lamb is ritually consumed commemorates the 'passing over' of the equinoc tial point from Taurus to Aries.
* In Luke 10:1 we learn that Jesus sent out 70 men to preach the gospel. However, the foot note in any reputable translation of the Bible will inform us that various ancient manuscripts give '72' (lrebdomi!konta dr10) and Strachan (pages 61 -62) believes that 72 is the original number. Could this particular episode of missionary activity be related in some way to 'one day' in the Great Year? t Most translations of Exodus 34:29 inform us that when Moses came down from Mount Sinaii 'he did not know that his face was radiant'. Such a translation is not faithful to the actual Hebrew, which tells us that his ftll"l' was 'hnmed' (karmr).

The word 'Passover' comes from the Hebrew word pesach which means ' t o hop, to skip over'. It may be related to a homophonous verb meaning 'to hobble', and when we remember that it is the very unsteadiness of the earth on its axis that gives rise to the phenomenon of precession in the first p lace, t h is understanding of Passover begins to make sense. Perhaps the Hebrews l..m•w more about the mechanics of the solar system than we general l y give I hl'm credit for. The New Testament was written as the Age of Pisces was beginning, 1111d the Gospels are full of fish references and symbols - 28 in all (St rachan, page 92). The name 'Jesus' is the Greek version of the Hebrew l o!-!hua, and the biblical Joshua was the 'son of Nun' Goshua 1 :1 ); ' Nun' nw<ms .fisll in Hebrew.

The Gospel and tlte Zodiac
The Greek word for fish, icl!tltus, was used as an acrostic for the first Christian creed:
IESUS Jesus CHRISTOS Christ THEOU of God HUIOS Son SOTER Saviour
17te Oxford Dictionary of tile Christian 01Urclt tells us that this acrostic probably originated in Gnostic circles because it is found in the Sibylline Oracles, and that 'in the fourth and fifth Centuries the fish became the emblem of the Eucharist and is frequently found in the paintings of the catacombs in com bination with bread and wine' (page 514). As we saw earlier, eating fish on Fridays, customary in Roman Catholicism until quite recently, was a type of spiritual communion with Christ. Friday was chosen for this because it is the day of Venus, the planet 'exalted' in the sign of Pisces. (Fria, from which Friday is derived, is the Norse equivalent of Venus. The Romance languages show the connection of Venus with Friday more clearly than English.)
Christian Fish Symbol
The fish symbol which adorns many a coat and many a car these days is a simple variation of the hieroglyph of Pisces (�), and the vesica piscis, a feature of much Christian art, shows figures within the overlapping lines of the Pisces hieroglyph. As Strachan comments, it is impossible to explain how such a 'cold blooded, apathetic creature of the waters' could come to sym bolize the noble and exalted Saviour without reference to astral symbolism. (pages 95-6).

All these are J 'l'llminent themes within the Christian story and are characteristic of the Virgin Mary: she and the Piscean Jesus stand as twin poles of the Virgo-Pisces axis. The coming age is that of Aquarius, the Water-Bearer, which many hope w i ll be a time of brotherhood and peace, when human values predominate ollld when collective responsibility for the environment and for the under privileged will be evident. The opposite constellation is Leo, symbolic of Indi viduality, and the coming age will be characterized by growing tension hdwt>t'n individual and group values.

The Gospel and the Zodiac
The Greek astronomer Hipparchus (second century BCE) is generally cred ited with the discovery of the precession of the equinoxes, but the phenom enon was observed long before Hipparchus provided an explanation for it. Alice Howell writes:
There is so far no way of knowing if the Chaldeans and Egyptians knew of the Ages. There is speculation that the ancient Egyptians might have known about them since the number 25,920 appears in the measure ment of the Great Pyramid. But as yet no definite proof exists beyond the indisputable fact that Egyptian symbols show each of the shifts from the Age of Gemini through the Ages of Taurus and Aries in their cosmogony, mythology and architecture. (Howell, page 133)
Joseph Campbell is completely convinced that the ancient world knew about precession before Hipparchus. His principal clue lies in what he calls the ' magic number 432' (Campbell, 1 986, page 38). This number, w hen m u ltiplied by 60 - the resting heart rate of a healthy man - gives 25,920, the number of years in the Great Year. He finds a link here between the rhythm of the individual human being and the rhythm of the universe: 432 is the number of that link and it can be traced in a variety of mythologies. The Kali Yuga of the Hindus is 432,000 years, and in Babylonian mythology (as reported by Berossos) the time between the rise of the first city, Kish, and the Flood is given as 432,000 years. About Icelandic mythology Campbell writes:
I discovered that in Othin's (Wotan's) warrior hall, Valholl, there were 540 doors through each of which, on the 'Day of the Wolf' (that is to say, at the end of the present cycle of time) there would pass 800 divine warriors to engage the anti-gods in a battle of mutual annihilation. 800 x 540 = 432,000. (Campbell, 1986, page 35)
The Bible, too, contains a reference to this number in a most unlikely place. In Genesis 5 we find a list of ten antediluvian patriarchs whose ages total 1 656 years. According to Julius Oppert, in 1656 years there are 86,400 seven day weeks. 86,400 divided by 2 = 43,200. Campbell calls this a deeply hidden reference 'to the Gentile Sumero-Babylonian, mathematical cosmology of the ever-revolving cycles of impersonal time with whole universes and their populations coming into being, flowering for a season of 43,200 (432,000 or 4,320,000) years, dissolving back into the cosmic mother-sea to rest for an equal spell of years before returning, and so again, and again, and again'
44



The Forgotten Language of the Stars
(Campbell 1986, page 35). Furthermore, 432 is the number which expresses the relationship between the great pulsing cycles of the universe and the pu lse of the human being, the mystic link between macrocosm and micro cosm. Its veiled presence in the Bible demonstrates that 'cosmic conscious ness', the perennial aim of the mystic, was not unknown to the seers of ancient Israel. The theory of astrological ages was accepted by Jung. It is, he says, ' a l ust-so story that proves itself by a thousand signs ... It was not I who i nvented all the fish symbols in Christianity; the fishers of men, the pis t'llli Cltristianorum ... To deny it would be to throw the baby out with the h.1 thwater' (Dean, page 306). Nor, we might add, were these symbols i n vented by a historian or quasi-historian intent on giving us some d e tails abou t the life of Jesus. The fish symbolism in the Gospels is .utded testimony that these documents had their origin in an esoteric t radition.
The Gospel in the Stars
In the nineteenth century, the works of J.S. Seiss enjoyed something of a vogue on both sides of the Atlantic, and his ideas are being represented by a number of modem writers. Seiss's basic thesis is that the zodiacal constella t ions and their ' decans',* the non-zodiacal constellations that surround them, tell the Christian story of salvation, and that God placed them in the �ky at the dawn of time as a witness to, and a prefiguring of, the gospel mes '"'ge. He further maintains that the interpretation of these signs has been the •·:.a: l u sive preserve of a ' superstitious and idolatrous astrology', and that pagan mythology has picked up but perverted the stories that the constella t ions were originally intended by God to tell. According to Seiss, the virginal mnceptions which abound in mythology are corruptions of the one genuine v t rginal conception in history, that of Jesus. l l owever, it is much more likely that the stories of heroes and ogres, gods an d devils, trials and ordeals, which we find in both the Bible and po��an mythology have a common origin in the zodiac. The zodiac was the .uwient picture book, and storybook, of the human race. The shapes per n•i ved there are not the products of arbitrary ' dot joining', but represent u n i versal and archetypal symbols of human spiritual awareness which h.IVl', over millennia, issued in both mythological and religious forms of

expression.* So, the story of Perseus is not a 'corruption' of the story of Christ's victory over evil (as Seiss supposed), it is just another expression of the universal longing for redemption which lies behind the Christian myth, too. The zodiac inspired the myth of the Twelve Labours of Hercules, which concerns the soul's journey of liberation, and this same literary impulse, translated into Jewish categories, has given us Mark's Gospel. The Gospel provides us with abundant clues that this is the author's purpose, and I hope to be able to point these out as we proceed. Seiss's work relies heavily on the theories of Frances Rolleston, which were published in 1863 in her book Mazzaroth. Rolleston investigated the meaning of the various star names - like Sirius, Rigel, Tegmine - which have come down to us from antiquity, and Seiss finds that some of these names, when translated into modem languages, can be related to the gospel story. What Seiss was not aware of is that sometimes these names reflect with astonishing accuracy the principal incidents of Mark's Gospel. For example, the Feeding of the Five Thousand and the Feeding of the Four Thousand occur in what I have called the Cancer section of the Gospel. In the constel lation Cancer is a star called Ma'alaph whose name means Assembled Thousands, and in Ursa Major (one of the ' decans' of Cancer) we find the star Phad, which is said to mean Numbered. There are a good many correspon dences of this type which we will point out in our analysis of the individ ual zodiacal sections. I t could well be that Mark has chosen to weave the names of the principal stars into his text as an added testimony to its zodiacal structure.
The relevance of this approach
The strength of any theory lies only in its ability to provide answers to pre viously intractable questions. I hope, in the following chapters, to show how a number of problems generated by the historical or quasi-historical approach to Mark cease to be troublesome. Among these are:
• The reason why Mark does not begin his Gospel with infancy narratives;
• Gettings writes; ' I t is suggested that the areas of sky marked out by certain star groups were first experienced as areas of spiritual i nfluence. It is likely that such 'experience' would not be available to all men, but would be available to those initiates who had endured the disciplines and spiritual enlightt>nments of those teachers in the mystery schools who wt>rl' tht> ml'ntors of the pre-Christian culture.

(Gettings, 1 987, page to2)



17re Forgotten Language of the Stars
• Why Mark has two 'feeding' stories very close together (Mark 6:3044;
Mark 8:1-9); • Why Jesus takes a very roundabout route to the Sea of Galilee in Mark
7:31; • Why the account of the Transfiguration (Mark 9:1-13), which many scholars have considered a misplaced resurrection story, is, in fact, in the right place; • Why Jesus curses the fig tree (Mark 11 :13); • Why the Last Supper is a Passover meal, in spite of the fact that no men
tion is made of any lamb.
This approach throws some light on the synoptic problem - i.e. the relation ships between the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke. As we shall see, the rommon assumption that Mark wrote first and that Matthew and Luke copied from him is untenable. It would seem that a more primitive docu ment, more clearly zodiacal than any of the Gospels we now have, preceded t he canonical Gospels. However, more important than any of the above, I hope to be able to make t he gospel story relevant to contemporary people. For too long the debate has centred on the historicity of the gospel accounts, and this has brought .tbout a polarization of opinion which has tended to obscure their spiritual v.t lue. Both sides - literalist and liberal - have rejected the poetic dimension. But, as Schopenhauer reminds us, history is the 'antithesis of poetry'. l l istory concerns only individual things; poetry concerns universal truths. By structuring his story on the zodiac, Mark has given it a cosmic dimension. I l is hero is an individual, like Abraham and Moses, but his message is uni VPrsal . The zodiacal way is the way we all must travel in the spiritual life. ksus may have walked the road before us but, as far as Mark is concerned, Ill' does not walk it on our behalf. Mark tells us that we must 'take up the •Toss and follow' Jesus (Mark 10:21); we have to 'drink the same cup, and be b.1 ptized with the same baptism' (Mark 10:38) if we want the same reward. Using timeless metaphors drawn from the zodiacal circle, Mark has given us .1 textbook of the spiritual life, a life lived in harmony with the universe, a I i ll' of holiness, wholeness, which can only be attained with great effort and at �·.rl•at personal cost. There is also the possibility that, as we learn about these 1 1 11 i versal principles, we are learning about the career of one, about whom h istory has bequeathed us little more than a name, whose life embodied t l wse principles, and whom we can call our brother and our exemplar. This interpretation is not intended as a red uctionist dismissal of the Jesus ·•h1ry as ' mere' zod iaca l myth. On the contrary: I consitkr tlw Gospel of

Mark to be a work of profound spiritual significance. I write as a Christian minister, albeit one who has more in common with Valentinus than with Irenaeus, and I accept that there is much more to this Gospel than my own analysis can account for.* While I would want to argue for the objective pres ence of a zodiacal scheme in Mark, I do not think for one moment that in describing this we are exhausting all dimensions of meaning within the text. After all, a story which for two millennia has captured the imagination of untold millions must have the poetic depth to inspire manifold interpreta tions. What follows is one of these.

A Note on Sources
Throughout the chapters which follow I quote frequently and extensively from Richard Hinckley Allen's book, Star Names: TI1eir Lore and Meaning, which. for over a hundred years, has been the definitive work on the mythology and astronomy of the constellations. It is a work of extraordinary scholar ship, and has been the foundation upon which all subsequent attempts to describe the heavens have been based. I have used the Dover edition, first published in 1963.
I have based my astrological descriptions of the signs and constellations on the works of three ancient authors:
I . Aratos, who wrote in Greek c. 300 BCE. His Phaenomena is mainly descrip tive of the constellation patterns. (Loeb Classical Library, Callimachus, Lycophron, Aratos, translated by A.W. Mair and G.R. Mair, 1921, Harvard University Press.)
2. Manilius, who wrote in Latin in the first century CE. I have used two ver sions of his Astronomica: the 1697 translation 'done into English verse', pub l ished by the National Astrological Library in 1953; and the Loeb Classical l .ibrary edition translated by G.P. Goold, first published in 1976. Manitius's work is the finest astrological poem ever written. I have quoted mainly from t lw earlier verse translation, simply because of its charm.
'\. Ptolemy, who wrote in Greek in the mid-second century CE, but whose work Tetrabiblos faithfully transmits the astrology of antiquity. I have used t lw Loeb edition, translated by F.E. Robbins, first published in 1940.
l 'he writer of the Gospel of Mark (or its predecessor) could well have been l.uniliar with the first two of the above works.
I have felt obliged to supplement these authors with delineations from more 1 11odem astrological writers in order to emphasize particular qualities of the ··i�ns not touched upon by the ancients but which are relevant to the sections 1 1l the Gospel under discussion. Dane Rudhyar's comments on the spiritual qu.tlities associated with each of the zodiacal signs have been included ht•ciluse they reflect with peculiar appositeness the various stages in Mark.

I11e Gospel and the Zodiac
Quotations and examples from individuals born under the various signs of the zodiac (e.g. Mother Teresa is mentioned and quoted from in the chapter on Virgo, her birth sign) are given when these seem relevant. They add a little colour, but they are in no sense essential to the argument, and may safely be dismissed by those for whom astrology is anathema. Anyone who thinks I may be bending the astrological factors to fit my thesis should obtain any elementary astrological textbook (e.g. Teacl1 YourselfAstrology, by Jeff Mayo) to check my statements. He or she will find that all my delineations of zodiacal characteristics are entirely in keeping with astrological tradition.
I recommend that before reading each of the following chapters, the relevant section of Mark shoul d be read, and to enable the reader to do this without having to refer to a separate volume, Appendix 1 contains a version of Mark's Gospel, divided into what I consider to be its zodiacal sections. It is my own translation, made in order to avoid copyright problems which might arise from reproducing a complete biblical book in one of the recog nized translations, but I make no claim to originality. It is simply a readable version of the text, free from distracting verse numbers. Other versions are readily available, and the interested reader might like to consult one of these. However, unless otherwise specified, biblical verses which appear in the body of the book are taken from the New International Version of the Bible, and are reproduced with permission.

uses the same names as the constellation groups but begins at the point of the spring equinox wherever this might be in relation to the fixed stars. This zodiac derives its symbolism from the year itself, from the drama of the conflict between light and darkness which has four climactic moments symbolized by the two equinoxes and the two solstices. Since the spring equinox now takes place against the background of the constellation Pisces, the two zodiacs have drifted apart and, to the confusion of everyone, a planet said to be in the sign Aries is, in reality, in the constellation Pisces. It is important for us to note, however, that at the time Mark's Gospel was written, the two zodiacs were virtually coincident: the equinox was occurring right on the cuspal division between Aries and Pisces. Consequently, Mark was able to use imagery derived from the year cycle (signs) and from the actual star groups in composing his Gospel. The constellational zodiac has no natural beginning or ending. However, according to Cyril Fagan (page 30), it was customary in the ancient world to begin the circle with Virgo, and Seiss considers this constellation to be the natural starting point, presumably because the myths that surround it con cern birth. The Gospels of Matthew and Luke are prefaced by such mythic birth stories. Mark's Gospel is not. It opens with a mature Jesus ready to embark on his public ministry, and no mention whatsoever is made of his physical birth or of his childhood. In trying to capture this theme of 'new beginning' Mark employs the symbolism of Aries, the sign of the springtime, when the cycle of growth on earth begins anew. The constellations began with Virgo, but the signs began with A ries. Ptolemy, who wrote only a hun dred years or so after Mark, and whose work reflects the astrological tradi tions of antiquity, tells us that 'although there is no natural beginning of the zodiac, since it is a circle, they assume that the sign which begins with the vernal equinox, that of Aries, is the starting point of them all' (Ptolemy, pages 59-61). It is possible that Mark knew of the virginal-conception stories since these would be part of the esoteric tradition inherited by all the evangelists. Such stories are a commonplace of mythology, and, when interpreted esoterically, relate to the birth of the spiritual life which, as the Gospel of John informs us, is not a physical birth but a 'rebirth' whose origin is not in the flesh (sarx) but in God Oohn 3). We might speculate that Mark chose not to open his Gospel with such stories, in spite of their appropriateness to his theme, because by placing them at the beginning of his narrative he would intro duce Virgoan themes out of sequence. Mark is concerned with spiritual rebirth and he uses the rebirth of the year in the springtime as his primary symbo l .

A ries (Mark 1:1-3:35)
Since the Jews did not accord the status of rabbi to anyone who was under t h irty years old, the Jesus we encounter in these early chapters of Mark is (we assume) in his late twenties, and in fact, Luke's Gospel tells us that Jesus w,1s 'about thirty years old when he began his ministry' (Luke 3:23). This is t he age when youth is over and a new seriousness enters our life. It approx imates to Dante's 'middle of life's journey,' and it is marked astrologically by t he 'Saturn return' when, at around 29, the planet Saturn has made a com pll'le circuit of the zodiac and has returned to the place it occupied when we wt.•re born. It signifies a change of outlook, a reappraisal of priorities; we hl•come more conscious of our mortality, and seem better disposed than hdore to search for spiritual meaning to our life. Traditionally, it is the age ''' which the Buddha too began his search for enlightenment.
Aries and Mars
W hen the vernal equinox occurs around 21 March each year, and the sun •·n ters the sign of Aries, a new optimism enters human consciousness. The bleakness of winter is past. As the daffodils bloom and new buds of life . t p pcar, nature herself seems to have found new hope. In the northern hemi "phere, where systematic astrology was developed, light has begun to tri u mph over darkness, the day over the night, life over death. It is a time of n•newed energy, of new beginnings, when, as Chaucer observed, 'folk long In go on pilgrimages'. This struggle of new life to establish itself in the midst of death and decay d taracterizes the sign Aries. God's creative activity was associated with 1\ rics in the ancient world, and some early authorities considered that the • ·.trth was created when the sun was here. Albumaser, writing in the ninth n•ntury, but no doubt reflecting a much older tradition, says that the cre · • t ion took place when the seven planets - Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn - were in conjunction in Aries, a belief reflected in I )ante's Infenw where we learn that ' the sun was mounting with those stars t h a t with him were, what time the Love Divine, at first in motion set those l w.1 u teous things'. To the Egyptians the constellation was known as Arnum, I11e Lord of tl1e 1 /l'ad, and to the Babylonians as Lu Hunga, I11e Hired Man (Campion, page 1 7) . Among the Hebrews, Aries was probably associated with the tribe of l<l·ubcn, called by Jacob ' my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my .,, rength' (Genesis 49:3). As we have seen (in 'The Forgotten Language of the ',t.�rs'), Judaism began when the equinox 'passed over' from Taurus to Aries (1 2000 un:), and many images within the defining stories of the Jewish

T11e Gospel and the Zodiac
scriptures - the ram caught in the thicket by Abraham, Moses' burning bush, the lamb of sacrifice, the wilderness wanderings, - reflect this constellation. It was when the sun was in Aries, during the month of Abib (a word meaning 'spring'), that the Exodus took place (Exodus 13:4), and thereafter this was to be 'the first month, the first month of the year' (Exodus 12:2). Later, the name of the month was changed to Nisan, and it still marks the beginning of the ecclesiastical year in Judaism, although it is the seventh month of the civil calendar. Like all the signs which mark the equinoxes and solstices, Aries is a Cardinal sign, a sign of initiatory action, of enterprise, and of leadership. It is also a Fire sign, with all the qualities of ardour, combativeness and vigour that this connotes. The glyph of Aries (ry"l) depicts the horns of the ram, the aggressive, combative, leader of the flock. It is also suggestive of the spring ing water, the source of all life and growth, which transforms the wilderness and brings vitality and health. Manilius, a near-contemporary of Mark's, tells us that those with Aries prominent in their nature are cursed with rav enous tempers, and go where fancy takes them, ploughing new seas and making the world their own. Astrologers have not changed much in their assessment. Isabelle Pagan, writing in 1911, has this to say about the Aries type:
He is the Captain, the Leader, Pioneer among men; going out in sym pathy to a new thought, rapidly assimilating fresh ideas, always in the van of progress in whatever kind of work - intellectual, artistic or prac tical - he may take up. He gets dose quarters in his battles, and when highly developed, fights best with his head; that is to say, in the field of thought . . . (Ariens) really enjoy facing and overcoming difficulties, and will go out of their way to challenge opposition. (Pagan, page 6)
Good contemporary examples of this Arlen tendency to 'challenge opposi tion' are not hard to find. Ian Paisley (born 6 April 1926), is adept at present ing both his religious and his political opinions in pugnacious style. In October 1988, protesting at the Pope's visit to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, he thundered:
This is the battle of the Ages which we are engaged in. This is no Sunday school picnic, this is a battle for truth against the lie, the battle of Heaven against hell, the battle of Christ against the Antichrist! (Cooke, page 4)

Aries (Mark 1:1-3:35)
St.'Cular Ariens can be equally confrontational. Daniel Dennett and Richard Dawkins, Darwin's latter-day champions, see themselves as combatants in the 'war' of science against religious obscurantism. Dennett, a neuroscientist and 'an intrepid Atlantic sailor' has, according to an article in the Obseroer l�evie-.v {12 March 2006), 'called out ... some of the biggest beasts in the aca demic jungle ... and has never once taken a step back' . Dawkins too is always up for an intellectual fight. They were both born at the end of March (Daniel Dennett 28 March 1942; Richard Dawkins 26 March 1941). There is something refreshingly unrefined, childlike even, about people who are strongly Arlen. They seem to have a desire to strip things down to t heir bare essentials coupled with an inability to tolerate too much ambigu i ty or ambivalence; to them, things are very much black and white, with few grey areas. The 'ruler' of Aries, the planet which is most obviously associated with it and which shares its characteristics, is Mars, the 'Red Planet', unanimously identified by the ancients as the harbinger of war and destruction. Its glyph (ci"), which shows the cross of matter dominating the circle of spirit, is sug �estive of aggression and power, and has been adopted almost universally ciS the symbol of masculinity. Ptolemy gives the following list of (positive) Martial qualities: 'noble, rommanding, spirited, military, versatile, powerful, venturesome, keen, headstrong, active, easily angered, with the qualities of leadership' ( Ptolemy, page 353).
The Spiritual Lessons of Aries
'Nothing will ever be attempted ifall possible objections must first be overcome. '
Dr Johnson
We can legitimately extrapolate from these ancient and modem descriptions t he intrinsic qualities of the sign's symbolism: beginnings, leadership, pio lll'ering, urgency, would all, to the ancient mind, be associated with Aries. These are all primary themes of the Gospel's first three chapters. The pace 1s frantic. Everything seems to happen quickly, with nobody having much l i me for pause or reflection. Mark's fondness for the word ' i mmediately' (c·u l/rus) is particularly apparent. Of the 40 or so times he uses the word in t he Gospel, eleven occur in chapter 1 alone. Peter and Andrew, James and John all leave their nets to follow Jesus, the latter two without any evident
word of goodbye to their presumably bewildered father or to the hired merr ( Ma rk 1 :16-20).

Tite Gospel and the Zodiac
It is remarkable how commentators down the centuries have inferred from this reference to 'hired men' that the family of James and John was quite well off. However, as we saw earlier, 'The Hired Man' is the ancient Babylonian name for the constellation Aries. This is not a biographical detail; it is an Aries 'flag'. Leaving the hired men also symbolizes leaving the age of Aries and entering the new age of Pisces. The call of the tax collector, Levi, expresses a similar idea (Mark 2:13-17). The Levites were the priestly tribe within Judaism, the tribe to which Moses belonged. They had helped Moses punish the people for the heinous crime of building a golden calf by putting about three thousand of their fellow Israelites to the sword (Exodus 32:28) . Thus they were instrumental in the symbolic change-over from the Age of Taurus (the Bull, the Calf) to the Age of Aries (the Ram, the Lamb). They were allocated no land at the time of Joshua's conquest, but were to receive tithes from other tribes instead. In Mark's Gospel, Levi is collecting taxes, not tithes, but he leaves all this behind him to follow Jesus. Just as the Levites had helped Moses in the time of the transition from Taurus to Aries, now, in the person of Levi who, along with Peter, Andrew, James, and John, was to become a ' fisher of men', they were to help Jesus in the transition from Aries to Pisces. Levi's father is appropriately called Alphaeus, a name which means Cl�anging. The speed with which these men follow Jesus has led some literalist com mentators to speculate that perhaps Jesus had met them before and was only then giving the signal for them to join him permanently. It's possible, but the Gospel gives us no indication of any previous meeting, and such a prosaic explanation misses the vital meaning which these incidents have by virtue of their location in the Aries section of the Gospel. While the urgent onward movement of these early characters obviously symbolizes the passage of the equinox from the constellation Aries to the constellation Pisces, and the beginning of the new age, it also teaches a valuable spiritual lesson: that the decision to embark on a life of self-discovery is not one to agonize over in interminable internal debate. The call to discipleship demands a quick response, a willingness to go out in faith, like Abraham and Moses, without the whole battery of assurances that we normally require before prudently making our important decisions. ' Now is the acceptable time,' writes St Paul: 'now is the day of salvation' (2 Corinthians 6:2). St Teresa of Avila, born under Aries (28 March 1515), was well aware of the dangers of procrastina tion: ' My own temperament is such that, when I desire anything, I do so with impetuosity' (du Boulay, page 8), she wrote, and she alerted her sisters in the religious life to the fact that ' many remain at the foot of the mountain who could ascend to the lop' .

Aries (Mark 1:1-3:35)
All the spiritual traditions emphasize the importance of making that ini tial decision to live the life of the spirit, and tell us that it has to be made before we attain intellectual conviction over metaphysical propositions. We can't wait until we know for certain that God exists, or that Jesus lived, or that this or that religion is true, before we embark upon the journey of self transformation. Such procrastination, said the Buddha, resembles the behav iour of a man who has been wounded by a poisoned arrow, but who resists the attempts of his companions to pull the arrow out until he has found out the name, the home town, the stature, the colour and the caste of the man who fired it. The Hindu sage, Sri Ramakrishna, puts it like this:
A wife once spoke to her husband, saying, ' My dear, I am very anxious about my brother. For the last few days he has been thinking of renouncing the world and of becoming a Sannyasin, and has begun preparations for it. He has been trying gradually to curb his desires and reduce his wants.' The husband replied, 'You need not be anxious about your brother. He will never become a Sannyasin. No one has ever renounced the world by making long preparations.' The wife asked, 'How then does one become a Sannyasin?' The husband answered, 'Do you wish to see how one renounces the world? Let me show you.' Saying this, instantly he tore his flowing dress into pieces, tied one piece round his loins, told his wife that she and all women were hence forth his mother, and left the house never to return. (Ballou, page 81)
!"hat the early apostles should hastily follow Jesus without checking out his references and demanding a police investigation into his background makes no sense to the cautious mind of the twenty-first-century literalist, but it is pl'rfectly in keeping with the advice given by countless spiritual mentors I hroughout the ages.
Baptism by John
llll'mes of beginning, starting again, turning one's back on the past are very 1 n uch in evidence in these early chapters of Mark. The Gospel opens with the words, 'The beginning (nrchc) of the gospel of Jesus Christ' (Mark 1 :1), and 1 1 1 his depiction of John the Baptist we can detect Mark's conviction that h'sus is qualitatively different from all his predecessors, John included. He is grl'ater than John, and John is not even worthy to loosen the strap of his san d , J I ( Mark 1 :7). John's baptism is performed with water: Jesus will baptize
SlJ



The Gospel and tl1e Zodiac
Fig. 6 The Adoration of the Lamb (Ghent Altarpiece), Jan van Eyck
'with holy spirit' (Mark 1 :8). At this point, Matthew (3: 1 1 ) and Luke (3:16) add 'and with fire', reflecting the Fire sign Aries even more closely than Mark, and although John's Gospel does not have an account of Jesus' bap tism by John the Baptist it does describe an encounter between the two men in which the Arien symbolism is clear. The passage runs:
The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him, and said, 'Look, the Lamb (amnos) of God who takes away the sin of the world'. (John 1 :29)
John himself, with his functional dress, his no-frills diet, and his uncom promising, confrontational message, is the very embodiment of Aries.* He represents the old dispensation, the religion of the age of the Ram which is now coming to an end. He dresses like Elijah, and he eats like Moses: the

Aries (Mark 1:1-3:35)
swarming locusts of John's desert sojourn echo the swarming quail con sumed by Moses in the Sinai wilderness; manna was not available to him, but wild honey would at least have the same taste (Exodus 16:31). He announces himself as one 'preparing the way', as a forerunner: legal istic, exoteric Judaism in the person of John was now giving way to another religious approach in the person of Jesus; the Ram was to hand over to the Fish. The 'head' of Aries was to defer to the 'feet' of Pisces, a process alluded to in John's remark about the sandal strap. The newly initiated son of God is immediately driven into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil (Mark 1:1 2-13). This is reminiscent of the other A rien figures of the Bible, Abraham and Moses, who leave the security of home and convention to enter the unmapped country which God will show them. The forty days of this experience echo the forty years that Moses and the Israelites spent in the wilderness (Deuteronomy 2:7), and are symbolic of t he spiritual journey which lasts for the full length of a person's mature life (between ages 30 and 70). Mark's brief account of this incident - Matthew's and Luke's are much longer - should not lead us to underestimate its sym bolic significance. 'The wilderness' represents all the terrors that beset the spiritual seeker. Henry James, himself born under the sign of Aries (15 April 1843), puts it like this:
Every man who has reached even his intellectual teens begins to suspect that life is no farce; that it is not genteel comedy even; that it flowers and fructifies on the contrary out of the profoundest tragic depths of the essential dearth in which its subject's roots are plunged. The natural i nheritance of everyone who is capable of spiritual l ife is an unsubdued forest where the wolf howls and the obscene bird of night chatters. (Quoted in Rushdie, 17Je Satanic Verses, page 397.)
I I is significant that this is undertaken at the Spirit's prompting, and that .mgels provide help for Jesus, just as God had ensured that the Israelites were fed in the wilderness, and that their clothing did not wear out ( DPu teronomy 8:4). The meaning is clear: to embark on the spiritual life is to 1.1y oneself open to all kinds of danger ('Satan' and 'wild beasts' are there), hut this is a God-ordained journey, and God's ministers will sustain the neo phyte on the way. These themes of newness continue as the narrative unfolds. Jesus begins his m inistry when John the Baptist has been imprisoned (Mark 1 :14). A new , ·hapter is opening. John, the last of the prophets of the Old Covenant, with his quaint garb, his frugal diet, and his apocalyptic message, has been
hi



The Gospel and the Zodiac
removed from the scene. The old is being replaced by the new. The heavens have been split open again, the voice of God has been heard once more (Mark 1:11), and a new message is about to enter human consciousness.
The Kingdom of God
The message is a simple one: the longed-for kingdom of God is lzere already (Mark 1:15). Of course, if Jesus was promising an economic or political utopia, he was completely mistaken; if anything, things were to get worse for the Jews, and two thousand years later a just and equitable political sys tem still eludes us. But the kingdom of God, to the mystic, is a state of being, not a social arrangement. Entry into the kingdom requires a complete change of mind, a willingness to re-orientate our perceptions. This is the meaning of the Greek word metanoia, which is generally translated as 'repentance', but which involves much more than regret for past actions. It implies a resolution to begin again from the beginning, to make afundamental alteration to tlw way one looks at the world, which St Paul calls 'transformation by the renewing of the mind' (Romans 12:2). Luke's Gospel tells us that 'The kingdom of God does not come visibly, nor will people say, "Here it is," or "There it is," because the kingdom of God is within you' (Luke 17:21). From the Gnostic Gospel of Thomas we learn, 'The kingdom of the Father is already spread out on the earth, and people aren 't aware of it' (saying 113), which means that the kingdom of God is not something that we can create with political action and economic redistribution (important though these may be), nor is it something that will be imposed upon us by divine inter vention; it is instead something we can discover by correcting our eyesight. The Sufis, Islam's mystics, tell the story of how Nasrudin, the 'holy fool', would take his donkey across a frontier every day, its panniers loaded with straw. The customs inspector suspected the increasingly prosperous Nasrudin of smuggling, but despite regular and extensive searches, he could never find any contraband. Years later, when both were retired, they met in the marketplace. 'I know you were smuggling something,' said the customs officer. 'What was it? You can tell me now.' 'Donkeys,' replied Nasrudin. The story illustrates the Sufi contention - shared by Jesus - that the mys tical goal, the kingdom of God, is nearer than is generally realized. In fact, it is here, 'at hand', but we are so busy looking for something else that we never find it. The mystic poet and painter William Blake, who stands in a similar esoteric tradition, writes:
And I know tha i this world is a world of i magina tion and vision. I set•



Aries (Mark 1:1-3:35)
everything I paint in this world but everybody does not see alike. To the eyes of a miser a guinea is far more beautiful than the sun, and a bag worn with use of money has more beautiful proportions than a vine filled with grapes. The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others only a green thing which stands in the way. Some see nature all ridicule and deformity, and by these I shall not regulate my proportions; and some scarce see nature at all. But to the eyes of the man of imagination, nature is imagination itself. As a man is, so he sees. As the eye is formed, such are its powers ... 'When the sun rises, do you not see a round disc of fire, somewhat like a guinea?' '0 no, no, I see an innumerable company of the heavenly host crying, " Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty"' ... If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things through narrow chinks of his cavern ... How do you know but every bird that cuts the airy way, is an immense world of delight, closed by your senses five? For everything that lives is holy. (Haddon, pages 1 2-13)
To see the world as Blake saw it is to become a citizen of the kingdom of God.
Newness
'I love to see a young girl go out and grab tile world by the lapels. Life's n bitch. You 've got to go out and kick ass. ' (Maya Angelou, born 4 April 1928)
The radical nature of Jesus' teaching is acknowledged by the people who witness the exorcism he performs in the synagogue at Capernaum (Mark ·1 :21 -28) . It is 'new' (kaine), qualitatively different, not just novel or recent (twos). Jesus teaches with authority, not like the scribes who slavishly fol lowed the traditions of the elders and taught by means of precedent. The calling of the Twelve Apostles (Mark 3:13-19) symbolizes the completeness of this break with the past: they are the new Sons of Israel, citizens of the kingdom which is already present to those with eyes to discern it.*
• Of the numerous attempts to ascribe the apostles to spl>eific signs of the zodiac, none has bt-t•n entirely successful. 'There art• two major reasons for this.

Jesus uses two images to describe the unprecedented nature of his own teaching: new cloth must not be used to patch up an old garment; and new wine must not be kept in old wineskins (Mark 1:21-22). The old garment and the old wineskins represent the religious teachings of the past; but following Jesus does not involve making adjustments and concessions to the past, it means leaving it behind. The spiritual life is a new life which will constantly be at odds with reli gious convention. Matthew's parallel account further underlines these themes.
Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, 'Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.' Jesus replied, ' Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.' Another man, one of his disciples, said to him, 'Lord, let me first go and bury my father.' But Jesus told him, ' Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead .' (Matthew 8: 1 9-22)
The conflict between old and new shows itself clearly in these three chapters. Jesus defies Jewish law by claiming to be able to forgive sins (Mark 2:5), by eating with tax-collectors and sinners (Mark 2:16), by not encouraging his disciples to fast (Mark 2:18), by picking ears of com on the Sabbath day (Mark 2:23), and by healing on the Sabbath (Mark 3:2). In all these incidents Jesus displays the Arlen qualities of courage, defiance, audacity. Nowhere are we further from the Sunday-school image of 'gentle Jesus meek and mild' than in this section of Mark's Gospel. He is shown freeing the people from the shackles of the past, from slavery to the religion of the past, from sickness and sin, which are the accumulated consequences of the past. And he does so with no regard for his own personal safety or reputation.
make any real zodiacal connection based on character or actions. The names give us some infor mation. James and John, called 'Sons of Thunder', seem to have a martial quality and could be associated with Aries and Scorpio, the Mars-ruled signs. They are the ones who impetuously leave their father to go and follow Jesus (Mark 1:20); they wish to call down thunder upon the Samaritan villages (Luke 9:54), and they are the ones who request power in the kingdom (Mark 10:35-45), a very Scorpionic thing to do, as we shall see. Philip, whose name in Greek means ' Lover of Horses', could be associated with Sagittarius, and Thomas, called in John's Gospel Didymus, the Twin, may represent Gemini. Judas is probably associated with Judah, and hence with Leo, but there is a strong case to be made for a Scorpio attribution: secrecy and betrayal are not generally thought to be Leonine characteristics. The names tell us little more than this. Peter's name ('Rock') associatl.>.s him with Taurus, but his impetuosity suggests Aries, and his vacillation indkates Pisces! Without recourse to legendary material - and imagination - we can go nu furthN.

The Aries Miracles
Your problem is you 're ... too busy holding on to your unworthiness. (Ram Dass, born 6 April 1931)
Although Jesus 'heals many people of various diseases' (Mark 1:34), there are four accounts of specific healings, each of which has an Aries signature. The Healing of the Leper (Mark 1 :40-45) emphasizes the newness of life to which the spiritual aspirant is called. Physical leprosy, which was incurable until the twentieth century, was the ancient world's most feared disease, and was characterized by wasted muscles, gross disfigurement, anaesthetized l imbs, progressive mental decay and certain death. Lepers had to live apart from the community and, in the Middle Ages, the priest would actually read the burial service over the Jiving leper. As William Barclay says, 'the leper was a man who was already dead, though still alive' (Barclay, Mark, page 45). Physical leprosy has been overcome by modem drugs (although, to our shame, there are still lepers), but spiritual leprosy is still as prevalent as ever it was. Leprosy here is a metaphor for that deadness of spirit and disen chantment with life, which so many have to suffer in the cultural and spir itual desert of prosperous societies. It is the 'living death' which the poets have told us about, in which, with Hamlet, we view existence as 'dull, stale, flat, and unprofitable', and with Macbeth as 'a tale told by an idiot'. Leprosy is the evangelist's term for that sense of futility and alienation that we experience in T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land, the 'inauthentic' exis tence of the existentialists, from which the power of the Christ within can release us. The Cure of the Paralytic (Mark 2:1-12), and the Cure of the Man with a Withered Hand (Mark 3:1-6), concern the most common disorder of the spir itual life - spiritual impotence. Its main symptom is that sense of powerless ness we feel in regard to the past. We tell ourselves - and we are told - that we are victims of our circumstances, our parents, our culture, our society. The claims of the past upon us are so great that we feel incapable of slough ing them off, of starting again, of taking control. We are borne along on a symbolic stretcher, carried by other people, unable to make our own decisions, tangled up in the web of other people's power and influence. 'It's too late to change, now,' we think. ' I've always done things this way.' This is spiritual torpor, and we've all got it, or had it. Jesus says two things to the paralysed man, which, as the story makes clear, are really the same thing: 'Your sins a re forgiven', and 'Take up your bed and walk!' 'Your sins are
65



Tire Gospel and the Zodiac
forgiven' is not uttered as some magical formula which will ensure a pas sage to heaven; it is a statement of fact. It means that the past is over, so leave it, don't allow it to cripple you, don't let it continue to blight your present or your future. And 'Take up your bed and walk!' means: 'Get up, grow up, stop being a victim, leave your comfortable but debilitating habits, and start to transform your life now'. This same idea is reinforced in the story of the man with the withered hand: what better image is there for the restoration of full control to one who is approaching life with a diminished sense of per sonal power? These are undoubtedly Arien themes, but Aries appears in an apparently inconsequential element, too. The paralysed man is lowered down to Jesus through the roof of the house. In the 'Zodiacal Man' Aries rules the head and so, by analogy, the top of anything, including roofs. What looks like a mem orable, authenticating detail is yet another zodiacal signature. The fourth miracle, the Cure of Peter's Mother-in-law, is dealt with below.

Aries (Mark 1 :1-3:35)
The Decans of Aries
Cetus, Perseus and Cassiopeia, the three non-zodiacal constellations which surround Aries (its 'decans'), are quite clearly reflected in these first three chapters of Mark. Cetus, the Sea-monster, is one of the largest constellations in the sky, extending 50 degrees in length and 20 degrees in breadth. It is associated mythologically with the creature sent to devour Andromeda, but which was turned to stone by the sight of the Medusa's severed head in Perseus' hand. The combat between Perseus and Cetus mirrors the challenge to the powers of evil which Jesus makes in these early chapters of Mark. He is tempted by Satan in the wilderness (Mark 1:13); he casts out an unclean spirit (Mark 1:21-8); he declares that the kingdom of Satan is at an end (Mark 3:26), and he implies that Satan has been 'bound' (Mark 3:27), clearly reflect ing the names of two stars in Cetus: Menkar, The Chained Enemy, and Diphda, The Overthrown, The Thrust-down.
The name 'Satan' (which means Adversary) occurs only six times in this Gospel, and four of them are in the Aries section. This is all the more note worthy when we consider the meaning of the name Algol, one of the principal stars in Perseus. Allen writes:
Algol, the Demon, the Demon Star, and the Blinking Demon ... the Demon's Head, is said to have been thus called from its rapid and won derful variations ... The Hebrews knew Algol as Rosh ha Satan, Satan's Head ... Astrologers of course said that it was the most unfortunate, violent and dangerous star in the heavens. (Allen, page 161)
( Algol was also associated by the ancients with beheading, another reason why the Arlen John the Baptist is said to have met this particular fate.) Aratos calls the constellation Perseus 'The Bridegroom' (i.e. the bride �room of Andromeda), the very term that Jesus uses in explaining why his disciples do not fast (Mark 2: 18-20):
Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, 'How is it that John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?' Jesus answered , 'How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them. But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.'

Fig. 8 Cassiopeia
The Cure of Peter's Mother-in-law (Mark 1 :29-31)
As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew. Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they immediately told Jesus about her. So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.
This short account of what is an unremarkable cure of an unnamed woman reads like an actual reminiscence, and many have assumed that it appears here because Peter was the source of much of Mark's infonnation. But the matter-of-factness of the story is deceptive, since it reflects, in a rather amus ing way, the constellation Cassiopeia, one of the decans of Aries. The mythological Cassiopeia was the wife of Cepheus and the mother of Andromeda whom Perseus had married after releasing her from the rock to which she had been chained by the sea-god Poseidon. Cassiopeia was even tually translated to the sky by her enemies the sea-nymphs but, because of her vanity and arrogance, was placed so close to the pole that she appears to be lying prone. As Milton has it in 11 Perrseroso:



A ries (Mark 1 :1-3:35)
... that starr'd Ethiop queen that strove To set beauty's praise above The sea-nymphs, and their power offended.
Aratos, describing the shape of this easily identifiable constellation two and a half centuries before the Christian era, said that she no longer sits comfort ably on her throne, but 'headlong plunges like a diver'. The Romans called the constellation Mulier Sedis, the Woman of the Chair. Mark's text says that Jesus and his apostles went to visit Simon 's mother in-law, but Matthew's Gospel uses Simon's other name 'Peter', and Peter, of course, means 'rock'. The woman was ' reclining' (katakrito - a word used for reclining at the meal table), in the grip of a high fever. Jesus cures her with a word and a touch and she gets up and waits upon them. The mother of the one chained ('married') to the rock (Peter} is Cassiopeia (the Reclining Woman} . Cassiopeia's husband is Cepheus and her daughter is Andromeda, names which are hinted at in the names Andrew and Cephas (the Aramaic version of Peter}. These few lines contain a series of puns which are lost on us, but which would have brought a little smile to people who had some familiarity with the skies. The 'transvaluative' spiritual message (see page 1 7) is clear, too: by rising up and serving Jesus and his friends, she is shown to be released from both the ancient curse, and the arrogance which original ly provoked it. The fever from which this woman was suffering was - and still is - a com mon complaint in that part of the world, and is a typical ailment of the Fire sign Aries. No doubt in the belief that like cures like, the remedy was typically Arlen, too. The Talmud gives detailed instructions about how it should be cured. An iron knife was to be tied by a strand of hair to a thorn bush, and on three successive days one had to repeat verses from Exodus chapter 3 (2-3, 4-5). Iron and thorns are both associated with Mars, the ruler of Aries; hair is taken from the head (Aries), and the Exodus passage is the account of Moses with the Burning Bush! Four clear indications of Aries. A fifth is in the name of the constellation Cassiopeia, which is derived from the Phoenician and means - appropriately for a feverish woman - 'The Rose-Coloured Face' !

Jesus rejects his family
The Aries section ends with the much-misunderstood passage concerning the family of Jesus. It reads:
69



17te Gospel and the Zodiac
Then Jesus' mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent some one in to call him. A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, 'Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you.' 'Who are my mother and my brothers?' he asked. Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, 'Here are my mother and my brothers! Whoever does God's will is my brother and sister and mother.' (Mark 3:31 -35)
Commentators have had difficulty w ith this passage because no amount of glossing can explain the callousness which Jesus seems to display. I f i t is a genuine h istorical incident, then Jesus shows a disregard for his family which, to the contemporary sentimental religionist, appears less than exempl ary . But we do not need to interpret it in this way. Instead we can view it as a symbolic rejection of all those inherited influences which subtly inhibit any attempt we might make to discover our own unique calling. The family is the carrier of culture and we are encouraged to obey its voice as we set the goals for our life. Refusal to conform takes enormous courage, particularly when one's particular family has all the trappings of apparent respectability and success. But as Arien Erich Fromm (born 23 March 1900) tells us, indi viduality has a high price: 'When one has become an individual, one stands alone and faces the world in all its perilous and overpowering aspects' (Fromm, page 23). This is too daunting for many. In his account of the spiritual requirements symbolized by Aries, Dane Rudhyar, one of the foremost astrological thinkers of the twentieth century, says that leading a spiritual life - which, whatever else it is, is a life of genuine self-discovery, of establishing individuality - is never easy because it 'implies an emergence from usually quite binding and possessive psychic and social matriCes: family, culture, religion, tradition, way of life' (Rudhyar, page 64), and this will often involve strenuous confrontation. The first three chapters of Mark dramatically describe the qualities required to effect just such an emergence from restrictive social ties. They are the qualities displayed by the archetypal Arien, Abraham, who found the ram caught in the thicket, and who left the land of his birth to go to a place that God would show him. They are the q ualities of Moses as he leaves the securities of Egypt in order to find the promised land. They art• the qualities of the Buddha as he rejects the luxuries of home in his pur suit of enlightenment, and of Huckleberry Finn as he travels down tlw river in search of himself. They are the qualities which all who seek to follow Jesus must cultivate as they prepare to embark on the interior journey.

- were certainly not born under Taurus.* This is a remarkable statistic, and although it may be dismissed as 'coincidental' by mathematicians, it should come as no surprise to students of astrology. Taurus is the sign which sym bolizes our relationship with the material universe, and so its sons and daughters should have a particular interest in attempting to define the nature of that relationship, which, on one level at least, is the function of philosophy. As Aries symbolizes the sprouting seed struggling for life amidst the forces of decay, so Taurus represents the next stage of the process: establish ing roots which will supply nourishment to the growing plant. After the primary impulse of the Cardinal sign comes the crystallization of Fixity. Symbolically, the raw energies of Aries are collected, shaped, and given d irection in Taurus. The momentum is slowed and practical issues have to be faced. This is a natural process of development for any activity: the force of the initial impulse is often tremendous, but it lacks effectiveness until it has encountered the real world of experience. In astrology, Taurus represents the 'real world'. In addition to being a Fixed sign, it is also an Earth sign concerned with life's tangible parapherna lia, such as houses and chattels, and also its sensual pleasures. It is the sign of the builder, and it is surely not without significance that some of the human race's grandest structures - including Stonehenge and the pyramids of Egypt - were erected during the astrological age of Taurus (c 4,000-c 2,000 BCE}. Taurus is the Bull, archetypal symbol of the earth and sacrificial victim of the devotees of Mithras, and of the nature-worshippers with whom the Hebrew prophets strove tirelessly, albeit vainly, for control of the popular mind. Its hieroglyph (tl) is the hull's head and horns. The Jews called Taurus Bayt, a word meaning 'house', and the building of Solomon's Temple ('The House of the Lord') was begun when the sun was in Taurus (1 Kings 6:1). Among the Jewish tribes it was assigned variously to Manasseh and Ephraim (the sons of Joseph), or to Simeon and Levi. Astrological writers have not been terribly kind to Taurus (despite its
• Karl Marx 5 May 1818; David Hume 26 April 1711; Ludwig Wittgenstein 26 April 1889; Immanuel Kant 22 April 1724.

Thomas Aquinas was called 'The Dumb Ox' by his student peers, and this almost certainly indicates Taurus.

association with philosophy), often depicting it as gross and materialistic, and those in whom its characteristics are most evident as slow-wi tted, rather dull, and fitted for work of a practical nature. 'Taurus,' says Carter, 'tends to agricultural pursuits' (Carter, 1925, page 68), although he is quick to point out that this assessment is based on traditional accounts of the sign. The tradition was probably very old even when Manilius wrote the following:
Dull honest Plowmen to manure the Field Strong Taurus bears, by him the Grounds are till' d, No gaudy things he breeds, no Prize for worth, But Blessed Earth, and brings her Labour forth; He takes the Yoke, nor doth the Plough disdain, And teacheth Farmers to manure the Plain: He's their Example, when he bears the Sun In his bright Horns, the noble toyl's begun; The useful Plowshare he retrieves from Rust, Nor lies at ease, and wants his strength in Dust. (Manilius 1697, page 124)
The Taurean philosophers don't generally plough the fields, but they tend to expound one version or another of 'no nonsense' materialism, whkh Britain's Radio 4 listeners seem to find congenial. Marx's 'dialectical materi alism', John Stuart Mill's Utilitarianism, and David Hume's scepticism, a l l bear the unmistakable signature o f Taurus. Thomas Reid was called ' t lw common sense philosopher'; Bertrand Russell was a thoroughgoing matl•ri a l ist, prepared even to reduce human thought to chemistry; <1nd Wittgenstein, who, in true Taurus style, designed and built a house in Vienna for his sister, summed up the anti-metaphysical bias of Taurus when he said, 'Whereof we cannot speak, thereof we must be silent'. The 'ruler' of Taurus is Venus, the beautiful Morning and Evening Star. Venus complements the positive, ' masculine' qualities of Mars. Its glyph (9), which has become the universal symbol of the feminine, shows the circle of spirit above the cross of matter, symbolizing the predominance of receptivi ty and nurture over aggression and enterprise. Ptolemy has this to say about the astrological nature of this planet:
Venus ... causes fame, honour, happiness, abundance, happy marriage, many children ... the increase of property ... she brings about ... succt'SSL'S, profits, and the full rising of rivers; of usefu l animals and tht• fruits of



TI1e Gospel a11d the Zodiac
the earth she is the pre-eminent cause of abundance, good yields, and profit. (Pages 185-7)
The association of Taurus with agriculture is very ancient and widespread. The Pleiades, a prominent and beautiful group of stars in the shoulder of the Bull, was used to mark the seasons in ancient times. Philo of Alexandria, Mark's contemporary, tells us that the rising and occultation of the Pleiades bring great benefits to human beings:
For when they set, the furrows are ploughed up for the purpose of sow ing; and when they are about to rise, they bring glad tidings of harvest; and after they have arisen, they awaken the rejoicing husbandmen to the collection of their necessary food. And they with joy store up their food for their daily use. (Philo, page 17)
The natives of the Tonga Islands used these stars to divide the year into sea sons, and Hippocrates 'made much of the Pleiades, dividing the year into four seasons, all connected with their position in relation to the sun'. They are the 'hoeing-stars' of South Africa, and 'take the place of a farming-calendar to the Solomon Islanders, and their last visible rising after sunset is, or has been, celebrated with rejoicings all over the southern hemisphere as betokening the waking-up time to agricultural activity' (Allen, pages 400401). Virgil, in his First Georgie, mentions how those farmers who don't refer to the Pleiades when planting usually pay a heavy price:
Some that before the fall oth' Pleiades Began to sowe, deceaved in the increase, Have reapt wilde oates for wheate.
The 'sweet delights' of the Pleiades are mentioned in the Book of Job Oob 38:31). This refers principally to their beauty, but there is also a possibility that it describes the sensual concerns of Taurus, the constellation of which the Pleiades is the most beautiful and conspicuous feature.
The Spiritual Lessons of Taurus
In the light of these testimonies to the Taurus/Venus association with farm ing, growth, abundance and fecundity, it can be no coincidence that in this clearly defined second section of his Gospel Mark has drawn together a nu mber of parables which, with one exception, arc concerned with these
74



Taurus (Mark 4:1-4:34)
very themes. (But the 'exception' is still related to Taurus, as we shall see.)* Mark's parable section begins with the Taurean figure of the sower going out to sow his seed:
'Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shal low. But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. Other seed fell among thoms, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain. Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, some multiplying thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times.' Then Jesus said, 'Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.' (Mark 4:3-9)
TI1e 'explanation' of this parable which Jesus is said to have delivered pri vately to his apostles (Mark 4:10-20), spells out what the Taurus phase of till' spiritual life demands of us: we need to have the Taurean virtues of endurance and stability in addition to the Arlen ones of enthusiasm and vigour. The seed that falls by the side of the road never even begins to put down roots. This is a warning that the spiritual impulse alone is not enough. The desire may be sown in the heart, but without adequate nurture it will easily be destroyed. Similarly with the seed that falls on the rocky ground : this flourishes for a while but, lacking any real foundation, it soon withers in the face of difficult circumstances. The spiritual life requires perseverann• and tenacity, the two most striking Taurean qualities. Isabelle Pagan writes of the Taurus type:
The chief characteristic of the highly developed Taurean type is his stability of character and of purpose. He is the steadfast mind, unshaken in adversity, and his is the power of quiet persistence in the face of difficulties ... in hard circumstances his patience and perseverance are marvellous. (Pagan, page 23)
l 'here is another side to Taurus, however, which is not so admirable from a •.piritual point of view, and which this parable clearly admonishes us to .tvoid: conformity with the world and its values. The thorns that choke tlw

'l11e Gospel and the Zodiac
plant are the 'cares of the age and the deceit of wealth' (Mark 4:19), which seduce the seeker from the things of the spirit. The realm of Taurus is the realm of the flesh and its appetites, and this is in constant warfare with the things of the spirit. Chaucer's Wife of Bath puts her own lasciviousness down to Mars rising in Taurus in her horoscope:
For certes, I am al venerien In feelynge, and myn herte is marcien. Venus me yaf my lust, my likerousnesse, And mars yaf me my sturdy hardynesse Myn ascendant was taur, and mars therinne, Allas! allas! that evere love was synne! (Wife of Bath's Prologue, lines 609-614)
In the Jewish scriptures we observe that the 'flesh-pots' of Egypt (Exodus 16:3) are a perpetual source of temptation to the newly freed Israelites. Their spiritual resolve is weakened by the 'sweet delights' of Taurus for which Egypt is the biblical symbol.* But for all that their bellies were full when they lived there, they were in bondage, the peculiarly seductive bondage of materialism which this passage in Mark warns us to break away from. As Fred Gettings reminds us, Taurus 'is always productive' (Gettings, 1972, page 39), but if this produc tivity is seen entirely in terms of dividends, shares, bank accounts and bull mar kets, then the spiritual journey will be cut short before it has really begun. Dane Rudhyar considers that the spiritual lesson of the Taurus phase is non-possessiveness because 'Where there is possessiveness ... there can be no spiritual living'. He goes on:
The zodiacal sign Taurus is traditionally thought to be a possessive sign, but its possessiveness arises from its concentration upon pro ductivity. In order to produce a rich harvest, limits have to be set to the field in which natural processes have to operate efficiently. There must be a concentration of efforts, a focusing will to keep away all interfering activity ... Possession, however, need not mean binding attachment. There is a level at which the Taurean capacity to produce fruits can operate, not in an 'indefinite' but rather in a multi-defined or universally operative manner. Thus one can transcend the 'This is mine' mentality. (Rudhyar, 1979, pages 66-7)
• Accordin!; to Philo of Alexandria, Egypt symbolizes ' the passions which exdh.' the body' (Philo, p<l!;l' 147).
76



Taurus (Mark 4:1 -4:34)
It is remarkable how the sentiments - and the imagery - of Rudhyar in this passage reflect those of the Markan parable under review. Both are designed to teach us that the Taurean attributes of endurance and tenacity will reap enormous benefits if they are applied to the spiritual and not to the material life, and that the 'sweet delights' of the world must never be allowed to deflect us from our spiritual purpose. The things of Taurus can be massive impediments to the life of the spirit, but they do not have to be, and cultivat ing a proper relationship with them is a vitally important spiritual task probably the hardest spiritual task we are called upon to undertake. Buddhism, with its emphasis on ascetic detachment and the eventual el imination of desire, offers one way of dealing with the material world, and is strongly connected with Taurus; both the birth and the enlighten ment of the Buddha are celebrated at the time of the May full moon, when the sun is in the sign of the Bull. The Taurean Karl Marx was also acutely a ware of the impediments that the lust of ownership places in the way of human spiritual and cultural development, and his celebrated dictum, ' From each according to his ability, to each according to his need', offers an economic and political solution to the perennial problems of attach ment and possession. The Jesuit geologist and mystic, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (born 1 May 1 881), expressed his Taurean commitment to the reality and importance of the physical world so clearly and so passionately that he was accused of pan theism by the heresy hunters among his fellow religionists. For Teilhard tht• world was holy, a sacrament of the divine, and a means by which we can all find our way to God. In Tile Divine Milieu he wrote:
Matter, you in whom I find both seduction and strength, you in whom I find blandishment and virility, you who can enrich and destroy, I sur render myself to your mighty layers, with faith in the heavenly influ ences which have sweetened and purified your waters. The virtue of Christ has passed into you. Let your attractions lead me forward, let your sap be the food that nourishes me; let your resistance give me toughness; let your robberies and inroads give me freedom. And finally, let your whole being lead me towards Godhead. (Pages 110-111)

77



The Gospel and tlte Zodiac
its association with the earth and with agriculture, Taurus was always considered by the ancients to be connected with light. Alice Bailey writes:
Light, illumination, and sound, as an expression of the creative force: these are the three basic ideas connected with this constellation. The 'interpreter of the divine voice' as Taurus was called in ancient Egypt, can be paraphrased into Christian terminology and called 'the Word made flesh'. It is an interesting sidelight on the power of the zodiacal influences to recall that the hull's eye lantern can be traced back to the hull's eye in Taurus, and the pontifical bull, or the papal enunciations which were regarded as interpreters of God's voice, is a tem1 in common usage today ... The consummation of the work that is undertaken in Taurus, and the result of the Taurean influence, is the glorification of matter and subsequent illumination through its medium.' (Bailey, 1974, pages 44-5)
For the mystic, the material world is neither an idol to be worshipped, nor a distraction to be despised; it is instead the very vehicle of our enlightenment. In the words of Gerard Manley Hopkins:
The world is charged with the grandeur of God. It will flame out like shining from shook foil.
Hopkins' fellow Jesuit, Teilhard de Chardin, echoes these sentiments:
Throughout my whole life, during every moment I have lived, the world has gradually been taking on light and fire for me, until it has come to envelop me in one mass of luminosity, flowing from within ... The purple flush of matter fading imperceptibly into the gold of spirit, to be lost finally in the incandescence of a personal universe ... This is what I have learnt from my contact with the earth - the diaphany of the divine at the heart of the glowing universe, the divine radiating from the depths of matter a-flame. (Teilhard de Chardin, page 13)
The light which breaks through the material world and leads us to enlight enment provides the mystical connection between Taurus and Light, but there is a more obvious astronomical one: in and around the constellation are some of the most spectacular sights in the night sky. In Akkadia Taurus was known as The Bull of Light, and Orion, one of tht' decans of Taurus, 'ad m i red in a l l historic ages as the most strikingly bri l l iant

Taurus (Mark 4:1-4:34)
of the stellar groups' (Allen, page 303), derives its name from the Akkadian Uru-anna, the Light of Heaven, and Seiss says that the name means 'He who Cometh Forth as Light, The Brilliant, The Swift' (Seiss, page 105). It is one of the most easily recognized sights in the heavens, and its clarity and brilliann· were the basis of Gerard Manley Hopkins' metaphor, 'for thou art abow, thou Orion of light,' in his poem I11e Wreck of the Deutschla11d. And Aldebaran, one of the most brilliant stars in Taurus, and principal star of the Hyades group, situated in the 'eye' of the Bull, was called by Ptolemy Lampadias, the Torch. Venus, the ruler of Taurus and the most brilliant sight in the evening and morning sky (after the moon), was called by the Greeks Phos, Light, and by the Romans Lucifer, I11e Ligltt Bearer. To the ancient occultists, Venus was the planet of inner light, illumination.
Fig. 9 The Nebra Disc (dating from c.1600 BCE). The Pleiades are at the top right.
In the shoulder of the Bull are the Pleiades which, although not espedal ly bright, are undoubtedly among the most observed and noted stars in thl' sky, inspiring astronomers, poets and myth-makers since the dawn of time. Many cultures throughout history have referred to the Pleiades as a • tl•n w i th her Chickens, another instance, says Allen, 'of the constant association ' •f the Pleiades with flocking birds, and here especially appropriate from their mmpact grouping. Aben Ragel and other Hebrew writers mentioned them, .,ometimes with the Coop that held them ... these also appearing in Arabic folk hll"l' and still current among the English peasantry.' (Allen, page 399) One is immediately reminded of the saying of jesus reported by Mattlww .md Luke:
·o Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers

her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!' (Luke 1 3:34. A parallel passage can be found in Matthew 23:37.)
(Matthew locates the saying in his general condemnation of the Pharisees but, in Luke, it appears close by the Parables ofthe Mustard Seed and the Leaven.) To the Hindus the Pleiades were said to represent Agni, the god of fire, and Allen thinks that Divali, the great Hindu Feast of Lamps, is held in October-November in honour of this constellation. However, some confu sion exists as to how many stars the naked eye can see in this group. Some say six, some seven. Keats calls them 'the Starry Seven' in Endymion, and in China they were worshipped by girls and young women as The Seven Sisters of Industry. Homer mentions six, Aratos seven, although he goes on:
Seven are they in the songs of men, albeit only six are visible to the eyes. Yet not a star, I ween, has perished from the sky unmarked since the earliest memory of man, but even so the tale is told. Those seven are called by name Halcyone, Merope, Celaeno, Electra, Sterope, Taygete, and queenly Maia. Small and dim are they all alike, but widely famed they wheel in heaven at mom and eventide, by the will of Zeus, who bade them tell of the beginning of Summer and of Winter and of the coming of the ploughing-time. (Aratus, page 227-8)
Ovid writes: Quae septem dici, sex tamen esse solen t (Allen, page 411).
Eratosthenes called it Plrias Eptasteros, the Seven-starred Pleiad, although he said that one of them is Panaphanes - 'All-invisible'. One of the stars of the Pleiades is hidden. According to the myth, the Pleiades were the seven daugh ters of Atlas, who had been changed into stars by Pleione. Six of them had been married to gods, but the seventh, Merope, had married a mortal, so her light was dim and rarely seen. All of which strikingly reflects the Parable of the Lamp in Mark 4:21-22:
He said to them, 'Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed? Instead, don't you put it on Its stand? For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed [phaner6tM], and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open [phaneron]. If anyone has ears to hear, let them hear.'
(Notice how Mark uses the words plmner6the and plraneron, verbs from the same root as parwphanes, the word used by Eratosthenes to describe the invisible seventh Pleiad.) Matthew's version, which is found in the Sermon on the Mount (5:14-1 6)
RO



Taurus (Mark 4:1-4:34)
is slightly different, but its verbs reflect the Greek name of Aldebaran, Lampadias, better than Mark's:
You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on a stand, and it gives light [/ampet] to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine (lampsat6] before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.
Since Aldebaran was called Oculus Tauri or The Bull's Eye, and even God's Eye, it is interesting to note that immediately after his version of the Parab(,. of the Lamp, Luke adds:
Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are good, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are bad, your body also is full of darkness. See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness. Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark, it will be completely lighted, as when the light of a lamp shines on you. (Luke 1 1 : 34-36)
This Parable of the Lamp refers to the Taurean tendency to keep itself to itself. Gettings comments:
On this level (the material), he is indeed the bull, guarding that which is his own, be it his pathetic strip of field, or his vast acres, his single cow or his herd ... He likes to be left alone in his field, lording it over his own, not caring over much for other people. (Gettings, 1972, page 39)
This proclivity towards insularity, the tendency to rest on laurels, and to bt.• satisfied with the status quo, is not spiritually productive. To be effective, thl� lamp has to be seen. To be productive, our spiritual life has to be focused outward, away from our own petty concerns. To rest content with what Wl' have achieved is to hide our light. We must press onward. The two sayings which follow (Mark 4:24-25) continue the Taurean themt.• of growth and productivity. The first has a karmic ring to it, telling us that what we give out will be what we get back. The second is one of the most ' difficult' sayings in the New Testament:
'Consider carefully what you hear,' he continued. 'With the measure you use, it will be measured to you -and even more. Those who have will be given more; as for those who do not have, even what they have will be taken from them.' (Mark 4:24-5)
81



The Gospel and the Zodiac
Thls seems to be a description of contemporary western economics, but we hardly expect to find it being endorsed by the Bible. However, the principle does not concern secular affairs. It relates to the laws of growth which gov ern the spiritual life, which do not favour an attitude of making do with what we have. The reward is to the one who is constantly discontented with his achievement and who presses on to even higher goals. As the medieval alchemists observed, 'You must have some gold before you can make more gold.'
Secrets and Parables
He also said, 'This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground. Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how. All by itself the soil produces grain - first the stalk, then the head, then the full kemel in the head. As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.' Again he said , 'What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it? It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds on earth . Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds can perch in its shade.' (Mark 4:26-32)
The agricultural imagery pervades the next two little sub-sections, which refer specifically to the kingdom of God. To the Jewish people of the time this term would probably have been understood as a literal kingdom which would be set up, on earth, by the promised Messiah. This had been the united testimony of the Hebrew prophets. Such a kingdom wou ld have an observable beginning and would be preceded by the kind of cosmic cata clysms that the apocalyptic literature (e.g. Joel 2) had so graphically described. However, these two similes in Mark seem to point in a different direction. The first one (Mark 4:26-29) tells us that the kingdom will grow in a way that defies our powers of observation and understanding, just as a seed grows in a field. l11e second (Mark 4:30-32) likens the kingdom to the tiny mustard seed which produces a plant of such prodigious size that all the ' birds of the air can settle in its shade'. Christian scholars genera lly associate these parables with the slow but inevitable growth of the Church, and assume that, in some way, the king dom of God and the Christian Chu rch are virtually synonymous. This is an obvious inference to make, but the obvious inferences are the misleading ones, because earlier in the chapter Jesus explains that the parables were not intended to elucidate anything, but were deliberately used to /rick meanings

Taurus (Mark 4:1 -4:34)
from profane ears. Strangely, Jesus was using parables to keep the crowd in the dark; he only explained the mysteries to his apostles:
When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables. He told them, 'The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables so that, "they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never under standing; otherwise they might tum and be forgiven!"' (Mark 4 : 1 0- 1 2)
Some scholars have suggested that Mark has mistaken the nature of the parable itself as a teaching vehicle, and saw it as a means of confusing ratht•r than enlightening. This hardly seems plausible. The parable was a universally used teaching method of the Jewish rabbis. Its object was to startle the heart•r into response and to entertain at the same time; it was not a riddle or puzzle intended to perplex. What seems far more likely is that Jesus' enigmatic remark is Mark's way of telling his reader that there is more in these stories than any purely exoteric interpretation can yield; that, as we saw in the Arit•s section, the kingdom is indeed within the individual and that the laws of its growth and cultivation are entirely different from those that operate within the secular world. Jesus' words here are only intelligible if we assume that the mystt•rit'S of the kingdom of God formed part of a body of esoteric teachings which was transmitted to a few, those 'inside the house' (Mark 7:17), but kept from tlw many, 'those on the outside' (Mark 4:11). Such an understanding was not foreign to the Fathers of the early church. For example, Origen writes:
I have not yet spoken of the observance of all that is written in tht• Gospels, each one of which contains much doctrine difficult to bt• understood not merely by the multitude, but even by certain of tlw more intelligent, which Jesus delivered to 'those without' while reserv ing the exhibition of their full meaning for those who had passed beyond the stage of exoteric teaching and who came to Him privately in the house. And when he comes to understand it, he will admire tht• reason why some are said to be 'without', and others ' in the hous{'' . (Besant, page 63)
l{l'ferences to this esoteric teaching are also made by Polycarp of Smyrna anJ l ·ll•ment of Alexandria. Their combined testimony seems to point towards a ·gnnsis', a hidden (probably oral) spiritual wisdom kept from catechumens hut preserved by ini tiates. If this is so, then the link between Gnosticism and



Tile Gospel and the Zodiac
the Gospels is more real than orthodox scholars are generally prepared to admit. When Mark's two final Taurean parables are viewed as metaphors of the spiritual life, rather than as allegories about the growth of the church, the paradoxical nature of the kingdom becomes evident. The first one tells us that spiritual growth does not come by concentrating on its cultivation. It is a by-product of other things. Just as the seed grows while the farmer sleeps, so our spirituality increases as we go about our normal affairs. Victor Frankl has expressed this in psychological terms as follows:
The more (a person) forgets himself - by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love - the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself. What is called self-actualization is not an attainable aim at all, for the simple reason that the more one would strive for it, the more he would miss it. In other words, self-actualization is possible only as a side-effect of self-transcendence. (Frankl, page 133)
Krishnamurti (born 12 May 1895) says much the same about true happiness which, like Frankl's 'self-transcendence', is a good secular synonym for what Mark understands by 'the kingdom of God'. Such states are not the product of material accumulation or of self-conscious spiritual 'development'. They come upon us unawares, but when they do they have enormous transform ing power, not only for the one who experiences them, but for all with whom he or she comes into contact. The one in whom the seed of the spirit is planted can have an effect which transcends his own existence. He is truly 'a creative individual (in whose) action there will be the seed of a different culture' (Krishnamurti, page 155).

The Greek prefix dys- (as in dyspepsia) and the Latin dis- (as in dishon ourable) are both derived from 'duo' . The cognate bis- gives a pejora tive sense to such modern French words as bevue ('blunder', literally ' two-sight') .

of division - a word, incidentally, in which our old enemy 'two' makes another decisive appearance. (Huxley, pages 11-12).
Since it is the primary contention of all mystical philosophy that reality is unitary, and the primary aim of all spiritual practice is to recognize this unity, it is fitting that any treatise on the spiritual life should contain a sig nificant meditation on unity and division. Mark's Gospel contains such a meditation in its third section, where we are introduced to themes inspired by the constellation Gemini, the Twins, the first of those constellations called by Ptolemy 'hi-corporeal', 'double-bodied' (disoma), and by modern astrologers ' Mutable'. He describes them thus:
The bicorporeal signs, Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces, are those which follow the solid signs and are so called because they are between the solid and the solstitial and equinoctial signs and share, as it were, at end and beginning, the natural properties of the two states of weather ... The bicorporeal signs make souls complex, changeable, hard to apprehend, light, unstable, fickle, amorous, versatile, fond of music, lazy, easily acquisitive, prone to change their minds. (Ptolemy, pages 67-9)
Since these characteristics cover four zodiacal signs, we cannot claim that they all belong exclusively to Gemini. In fact, few astrologers today would accept that love of music, laziness, amorousness, or acquisitiveness were typically Geminian traits, but the rest seem particularly apt and feature prominently in any delineation of the Geminian type. Jeff Mayo lists the characteristics which most astrologers would accept as typifying this sign:
Adaptable, communicative, versatile. Incessantly on the go, restless, inquisitive, liking variety and change, contriving ingenious methods for transmitting anything from here to there. In this way he is the ideal middle man, mediator. Nervously excitable, inconsistent, witty, chatty, never dull. (Mayo, 1964, page 43)
All these are really manifestations of 'duality', a factor present in all the mutable signs, but particularly evident in Gemini, because Gemini is also an Air sign, and Air is the element through which mutability or changeableness best expresses itself. The glyph of Gemini (IT) is a graphic representation of its nature: two poles, parallel but separate..>, joined at top and bottom, depict ing a perpetual conriict between two quite distinct natures, and expressing

the ' irrepressible restlessness by which man divides himself and widens his experience' Oones, page 59). At its best i t represents versatility, and the abil ity to be, with St Paul, all things to all men; at worst, inconstancy and even duplicity. St Paul's Geminian qualities are further underlined by the numerous roles - spokesman, theologian, letter-writer, and missionary - which he played in the development of early Christianity, and by his volte-Jace on the road tn Damascus which changed him from a fervent persecutor of the new faith tn its most ardent devotee. His confession of moral turbulence in Romans 7 is a perfect expression of Geminian duality and Mercurial inconsistency.* HL• was even mistaken for an incarnation of Gemini's ruler, Mercury (Hermes in Greek), by the people of Lystra (Acts 14:12). Mercury (¥) whose metal used to be called 'quicksilver', represents tlw whole of the cerebro-spinal system and the nerves, the 'message-bearers' of the body. It also rules the brain which, psychologists tell us, is 'bicameral', split into right and left hemispheres. The left hemisphere is rational and logical, the right affective and creative. Mercury is the fastest-moving planet in the solar system, which is probably why, in mythology, it came to repreSt.·nt the messenger of the gods. Ptolemy considers that when Mercury rules " horoscope the native w i ll be 'thoughtful, learned, and inventive', bu t he also lists the potential negative qualities:
. . . u tter rascals, precipitate, forgetful, impetuous, l ight-minded, fickle, prone to change their minds, foolish rogues, wi tless, sinfu l, liars, u ndiscriminating, unstable, undependable, avaricious, unj ust, and, in general, unsteady in judgement and inclined to evil deeds.

The Gospel and the Zodiac
Geminian mutability is often expressed as mobility. Jesus has travelled before, but only in Galilee: now he and his disciples get in a boat in order to travel across the Sea of Galilee to the country of the Gerasenes, and apart from the fact that this incident takes place during a journey, there is little or nothing here that might immediately indicate the sign Gemini. However, our inability to detect the sign's presence really testifies to our ignorance of the iconography of the skies. The Hellenized audience for which Mark was writing would not have been as slow to understand as we are. Castor and Pollux, the twin stars of the constellation Gemini, were the patrons ofseafarers. Seiss writes:
In the Grecian temples they were represented as mounted on white horses, armed with spears, riding side by side, crowned with the cap oftl1e hunter, tipped with a glittering star. ... After their return from Colchis it is said that they cleared the neighbouring seas from pirates and depred ators and hence were honoured as the particular friends and protectors of navigation ... It is further said tiUlt flames of.fire were betimes seen play ing around their heads, and that when this occurred the tempest which was tossing the ocean ceased, and calm ensued ... They were assigned great power over good fortune, and particularly over the winds and waves of the sea. (Seiss, pages 112-3, emphasis added)
The ship which took St Paul from Malta to Syracuse (Acts 28:11) was called 'Castor and Pollux'. It is likely that this was a common name for vessels in view of the fact that these gods were supposedly favourable towards mariners. The constellation was often symbolized by two stars over a ship. Homer, in his Hymn to Castor and Pollux, wrote:
Ye wild-eyed muses! sing the Twins of Jove, . . . . . . . . . . . . ... mild Pollux, void of blame, And steedsubduing Castor, heirs of fame. These are the Powers who earthbom mortals save And ships, whose flight is swift along the wave. When wintry tempests o'er the savage sea Are raging, and the sailors tremblingly Call on the Twins of Jove with prayers and vow, Gathered in fear upon the lofty prow, And sacrifice with snow-white lambs, the wind And the huge billow bursting close behind, Even then beneath the weltering waters bear The staggering ship - they suddenly appear,

Gemini (Mark 4:35-6:29)
On yellow wings rushing athwart the sky, And lull the blasts in mute tranquillity, And strew the waves on the white ocean's bed, Fair omen of the voyage; from toil and dread, The sailors rest rejoicing in the sight, And plough the quiet sea in safe delight. (Translation by Shelley, Allen, pages 227-8)*
There are a few details in the story which underline its Geminian theme. The word for the storm used by Mark is laelaps, but Laelaps is also the name of the hound of Actaeon in Greek mythology, a name associated witlt tlte constel
lation Canis Miljor, one oftile decans of Gemini (Allen, page 117). Jesus tells the
storm to cease with the word si6pa - 'be quiet!' - echoing the Spartan name for Gemini, to Sio. And the 'cushion' upon which Jesus' head was resting long believed to be a detail provided by Peter - echoes the headgear of the Geminian Twins, or the flames of fire which were supposed to issue from their heads. The Greek word generally translated 'cushion' is proskepllalaiorr, which simply means ' (that which is) towards the head' . In TI1e Golden Ass, by Apuleius, Lucius recognizes that two young actors were playing Castor and Pollux by their helmets 'shaped like the halves of the egg-shell in which they were born to their mother Leda, and with spiky stars painted on them - the constellation of the Twins' (Apuleius, page 264). The relationship of this story to Gemini does not end here, however. As a spiritual parable, this little incident expresses the notion of fragmentation and scattering that the sign symbolizes. The turbulent waters represent the l'motional and spiritual turbulence that the neophyte experiences when faced with the diversity of life's options. This can result in action without di rection, movement to no purpose, going fast only to be standing still. The parable teaches us that calm is a prerequisite for the spiritual life. The 'mas ld, the Divine Self, within each of us is 'asleep' and needs to be awakened so that we can direct our attention towards our goal and not be caught in the frantic rush of activity which dissipates our energies and weakens our

resolve. As Elijah discovered, God is not in the wind, or the earthquake, or the fire, but in 'the still small voice'. (1 Kings 19:11-12) Similar sentiments, with similar imagery, are expressed in the Bhagavad Gita:
The mind That gives itself to follow shows of sense Seeth its helm of wisdom rent away, And, like a ship in waves of whirlwind, drives To wreck and death. Only with him, great Prince! Whose senses are not swayed by things of sense Only with him who holds his mastery, Shows wisdom perfect. (Arnold, page 13)
This passage shows Jesus' power over the element of Air (the wind). During the course of the Gospel he will display his power over all four of the ancient elements.*
The Gerasene Demoniac
I was living an extremely burdensome life, because in prayer I understood more clearly my faults. On tire one hand, God was calling me; on the other hand, I was following the world. All the things of God made me happy; those of the world held me bound. It seems I desired to harmonise these two contraries - so inimical to one arzother - such as the spiritual life and sensory joys, pleasures, and pastimes. In prayer 1 was having great trouble, for my spirit was not proceeding as lord but as slave. And so I was not able to shut myself within myself (which was my whole manner ofprocedure in prayer); instead, I shu t witltin myself a thousand vanities. Thus 1 passed many years, for now I am surprised how I could l1ave put up with both and not abandon either the one or the other. (Teresa of Avila, Bielecki, pages 43-4)
This same theme is explored in the next section, the story of the Gerasene Demoniac (Mark 5:1-20). As Jesus and his companions leave the boat, they are confronted by a man with 'an unclean spirit' who lives among the tombs, and is so violent that no chains are strong enough to bind him. Seeing Jesus in the distance, the man runs and worships him. Jesus commands the demon

to leave, but the man cries out, ' I beg you, in God's name, don't torment me.' The story continues:
Then Jesus asked him, 'What is your name?' 'My name is Legion,' he replied, 'for we are many.' And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area. A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside. The demons begged Jesus, 'Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them.' He gave them permission, and the evil spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned. (Mark 5:9-1 3)
It is significant that the number of pigs should be given as 2,000, since this does not correspond with the name 'Legion'. A Roman legion was normally 6,000 strong. It may well be that Geminian duality is reflected in the nurnlx•r, but the pig itself, while not generally associated with Gemini, does haw ont• significant Geminian characteristic in that it lras a split hoof, completely dividt•d (Leviticus 11:7). With the benefits of modem psychiatric knowledge, we cannot fail to st.•e i n the man with the two thousand demons an example of that most Geminian of conditions, schizophrenia, or split personality. In fact, the tl'rlll 'multiple personality' would be a better description. This is an actual mental disorder, but we do not need to restrict the use of the term to describe those in whom the symptoms manifest so dramatical ly. We a n• all 'split personalities' since, as Aldous Huxley tells us, the complex human personality is made up of 'a quite astonishingly improbable com bination of traits'. He goes on:
Thus a man can be at once the craftiest of politicians and the dupe of his own verbiage, can have a passion, for brandy and money, and an equal passion for the poetry of George Meredith and under-age girls and his mother, for horse-racing and detective stories and the good of his country - the whole accompanied by a sneaking fear of hell-fire, a hatred of Spinoza and an unblemished record for Sunday church going.

November 1991, the Guardian newspaper printed an assessment of the man by British journalist Geoffrey Goodman. Goodman asked how it had been possible for Maxwell to fool so many people for so long. He continues:
My own theory from observations of the man at close quarters during the year and a half I worked for him at the Daily Mirror is that he was at all times at least 20 different people at once. It was usually impossi ble to know which one I was dealing with at any one moment - and I later came to the conclusion that he wasn't sure either. The 20 different personalities were in constant struggle with each other ... (The Guardian 6 December 1991, page 21)
The practitioners of Assagioli's system of personality integration, Psychosynthesis, often refer to the crowd-like nature of the human psyche. And Geminian Salman Rushdie (born 19 June 1947) writes:
0, the dissociations of which the human mind is capable, marvelled Saladin gloomily. 0, the conflicting selves jostling and joggling within these bags of skin. No wonder we are unable to remain focused on any thing for long; no wonder we invent remote-control channel-hopping devices. If we turned these instruments on ourselves we'd discover more channels than a cable or satellite mogul ever dreamed of. (Satanic Verses, page 519).
P.O. Ouspensky, who claims to be following an ancient esoteric system, tells us that the fragmented personality is the normal condition of all human beings:
Man is divided into different I's or groups of I's which are unconnected with one another. Then if one I knows one thing, a second I another thing, a third I yet another, and they never meet, what kind of under standing is possible? ... This is the state of an ordinary man's being, and it proves that as he is, he cannot have understanding. Understanding always means connecting things with the whole, and if one does not know the whole, how can one connect? (Ouspensky 1957, page 137)
Ouspensky likens this condition to a house full of servants without a master to control them. Each one does as he pleases, with no one performing the duty to which he was originally assigned: the cook works in the stable, the housemaid in the kitchen, the footman in the garden, and so on. What is



Gemini (Mark 4:35-6:29)
required is a controlling 'I', a steward who will integrate the separate func tions, and see that each is carried out correctly. This process of integration, says Ouspensky, is a lengthy one, but so important that it is a prerequisite of all spiritual progress. Human inconsistency has fascinated and perplexed the more reflective among us since the beginning of time, and we can all say, 'My name is Legion', with the demon-possessed man, or 'I am large, I contain multi tudes', with Walt Whitman. 'When a man lacks discrimination, his will wan ders in all directions, after innumerable aims', says the Hindu classic tlw Bllagavad Gita. But the spiritual writers do not stop at mere observation; the object of all spiritual practice, whatever the tradition, is the transformation of Legion into Union, the fashioning of a coherent and consistent unity from the 'two thousand' fragments of the personality, the multiple diversions and distractions - both internal and external - which manifest as dilettantism and indecision. In doing so, however, one has not to destroy the individual elements: the glyph of Gemini, we remember, has parallel lines, separate, but joined. What is required is equilibrium and harmony among the warring members, not denial or sublimation. If we can achieve this, we can avoid the distorting and disfiguring effects of self-deception, symbolized so graphic ally in Mark's story as self-inflicted bruising and wounding. (The star Saiplr, in the constellation Lepus, one of the decans of Gemini, is said by Fleming to mean 'Bruised'.) This difficult movement towards simplicity, and not the pleasant cultiv.1tion of 'nice feelings', is what, in large part, any genuine spiritual practicl' attempts to effect. Aldous Huxley maintains that the saint is characterized by simplicity and singularity of purpose, quali ties which are completely at odds with the lifestyle and appetites of sophisticated and mentally actiw people like us, who constantly seek novelty, diversity, and distraction. Tht• actions of the saints, says Huxley, 'are as monotonously uniform as tht•ir thoughts; for in all circumstances they behave selflessly, patiently, and with indefatigable charity' . Their biographies, he goes on, are of no interest to us lx'Cause 'Legion prefers to read about Legion' (Huxley, page 55); complt•xity .md contradiction fascinate us; simplicity leaves us unmoved. One final point: Matthew ltas two demoniacs in his version of this story (Matthew 8:28-34), which seems to be an even clearer indication of Gemini than Mark's one. This 'doubling' by Matthew is generally explained as dd ib l'rate exaggeration of the Markan account in order to emphasize the grt•at power of Jesus. However, it might just be that Matthew is here drawing on ,, version of the story which preserves the original zodiacal motif in a morl' obvious way than that given by Mark.



TI1e Gospel and the Zodiac
Jairus's Daughter and the Woman with the Blood Flow
Upon Jesus' return to Galilee, he encounters Jairus, the synagogue official, whose twelve-year-old daughter is desperately ill. On the way to Jairus's house, Jesus is approached by a woman who has been suffering a vaginal blood flow for hvelve years. She reaches out and touches his clothing, and is immediately cured. After commending the woman's faith, Jesus and his companions proceed to Jairus's house. On the way they are met by some people who report that the girl is now dead but, on arrival at the house, Jesus tells them all that she is not dead, she is asleep. The final part of the story runs as follows:
After he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was. He took her by the hand and said to her, 'Talitha koum!' (which means ' Little girl, I say to you, get up!'). Immediately the girl stood up and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished. He gave strict orders not to let any one know about this, and told them to give her something to eat. (Mark 5:40-43)
TI1is is one of the few places in the Gospel where Aramaic words (Talitha koum) are used. Aramaic would have been the first language of Jesus and the apostles, and this has given rise to the conventional idea that Mark is here preserving actual, remembered, words. There is, however, another possible explanation: Jesus' words are given in Aramaic in order to emphasize them. This command is not just to Jairus's daughter, but to us all. Like her, we are 'asleep'. We have no will, no resolve, no purpose. The Geminian fragmenta tion of our nature only exists because we are unaware of it. We believe we have a controlling centre, an ' I', when in fact we are composed of hundreds of l's, each with its own agenda. The first step in overcoming this is, as Ouspensky says, 'awakening, since the chief feature of our being is that we are asleep. By trying to awake we change our being, (Ouspensky, 1957, page 46).
Geminian Ralph Waldo Emerson (born 25 May 1803) puts it like this in his essay 'The Preacher':
All that we call religion, all that saints and churches and Bibles from the beginning of the world have aimed at, is to suppress this impertinent surface-action, and animate man to central and entire action. The human race are afflicted with a St Vitus's dance; their fingers and toes, thei r nwmbers, tlwi r senses, their talents, a n• su�wrfl uously active,

Gemini (Mark 4:35-6:29)
while the torpid heart gives no oracle. When that wakes, it will revol u tionise the world. Let that speak, and all these rebels will fly to their loyalty. Now every man defeats his own action, - professes this but practices the reverse; with one hand rows, but with the other backs water. A man acts not from one motive, but from many shifting fears and short motives; it is as if he were ten or twenty less men than him self, acting at discord with one another, so that the result of most lives is zero. But when he shall act from one motive, and all his facul ties play true, it is clear mathematically, is it not, that this will tell in the result as if twenty men had co-operated, - will give new senses, new wisdom of its own kind; that is, not more facts, nor new combinations, but divina tion, or direct intuition of men and things?
'Awakening' is a consistent theme of all the world's spiritual traditions. Thf' Buddha is ' the awakened one' . Huxley writes:
In one of the Pali scriptures there is a significant anecdote about the Brahman Orona who, 'seeing the Blessed One sitting at the foot of a tree, asked him: " Are you a deva?" And the Exalted One answered, " I am not." "Are you a gandharva?" " I am not." " Are you a yaksha?" " I am not." " Are you a man?" " I am not a man." On the Brahman asking what he might be, the Blessed One replied, "Those evil influences, those cravings, whose non-destruction would have individualisl�d me as a deva, a gandharva, a yaksha (three types of supernatural being), or a man, I have completely annihilated. Know therefore that I am a Buddha"' (i.e. I am awake). (Huxley, page 54)
Enlightenment, for the Buddhists, is simply waking up. The most obviously Geminian feature of the story of Jairus's Dau ghter is the way in which it is told: it is the only miracle story in tl1e Gospels wlric/1 com /lines hvo quite separate elements. Nineham writes:
What we have here is without precise parallel in the Gospel - an inci dent broken into by another incident which takes place in the middle of i t. (Nineham, pages 156-7)
I n add ition, however, we should consider the name 'Jairus' ( laeirio�) which means, appropriately, 'Jehovah Enl ightens', but which also bears more than ,, passing resemblance to the name of t he brightest star in the night sky, Siri us (in Greek Seirins), the Dog Star, which is found i n Ca nis M.tjor, lllll' of

the Geminian decans, and whose name means The ChiefOne, the Leader. Jairus,
we are told, is the ardtisu1Ulg6gon, the Leader or Ruler of the Synagogue. And, as
Ptolemy reminds us, the heliacal rising of Sirius at the summer solstice presaged the beginning of the Egyptian New Year and theflooding of the Nile (Ptolemy, page 1%), thus connecting this star with the constantly menstruating woman. In addition to being a possible zodiacal reference, Mark's double use of the number twelve provides us with further evidence that we are meant to link the two females, and that this double story is not just a narrative acci dent. The woman with the blood-flow has been sick for twelve years (Mark 5:25), while the little girl is twelve years old (Mark 5:42). The contrast between the young girl and the older woman reflects two of the decans of Gemini, Canis Major and Canis Minor, The Big Dog and The Little Dog, but Mark's narrative is also playing with contrasting features of the astronomy and mythology of Gemini's stars, Castor and Pollux. Although 'twin' stars, Castor and Pollux differ in brilliancy, and at the time Mark was writing Castor was the brighter of the two, a situation which, strangely, has been reversed in the last three centuries. In the myth, they were the sons of Leda. Castor had a human father and was therefore mortal, but Pollux had been sired by Zeus and was immortal. Such was their love for each other that they eventually agreed to share immortality, living and dying alternately. In an ancient Euphratean representation they are depicted as the sun and moon, the one rising as the other sets: consequently, they came to symbolize the eternal battle between vitality and decay, youth and age, life and death, themes which are clearly echoed in Mark's narrative. By linking the two stories Mark is once more emphasizing the theme of unity. The young girl is the daughter of a prominent official and so we can assume that her family is prosperous as well as powerful. The woman with the blood-flow is older and, what is more, on the lowest stratum of society. Because it was forbidden for a Jewish man to have any sexual relations with his wife during her menstrual period (Ezekiel 18:6), this lady would have had to forsake the society of men for the duration of her illness. The two women represent opposite poles of Jewish society: rich and poor, young and old, illustrious and outcast. In the power of the Christ they are united.*
• Immediately following his account of this dual miracle, Matthew tells two more stories which are not found in Mark hut which express the Geminian theme: The Healing of the Two Blind Men (Matthew 9:27-31), and the Cure of the Mute (Matthew 9:32-34). Geminian d uality is obvious in the first; the second relates to Gemini's rule over speech and communication gener ally. Luke does not have these two stories, probably blo>cause he copied from a version of Mark which, like canonical Mark, does not have them either. The fact that Mattht•w has them is yet another indication that the version of Mark that he used w,ls longer and more ,·nmprehensiw than canonical Mark and, what is more, at t iml'S more ch.>.uly zodiacal in its lheml'S.



Gemini (Mi1rk 4:35-6:29)
Kith and Kin
In classical astrology Gemini is associated with brothers and sisters. Tht• third house of the horoscope, over which Gemini has 'natural' rulership, i!' generally consulted by astrologers for information about sibling relation ships. Mayo writes of the Third House:
Its sphere of life has a correspondence with the principle of Mercury and the adaptive and communicative attitude of Gemini. Hence, it relates to activities and matters connected with one's need to relate and adjust oneself to the immediate environment created by circumstances, involving near relatives such as brothers and sisters, and casual acquaintances, neighbours. Activities will be of a close communicative nature, short journeys, direct mental contact. (Mayo, 1964, page 78, emphasis added)
The symbolism is quite easy to understand: Gemini, the twin, represents all those who spring from the same source as ourselves, who are our ' twin selves', whether actual twins or not. In addition, since Gemini rules those who are separate but joined, its association with the immediate family becomes apparent. In view of this we can see the reason why Jesus rejects thl• demoniac's request to become his follower, and enjoins him instead to tell his friends (taus sous - 'all yours'), those closest to him, what the Lord has done for him (Mark 5:20). It also enables us to see the significance of the episode which opens chapter 6 of Mark. Jesus returns to his home town only to be rejected by those closest to him. The people who knew him as a boy cannot understand where his wisdom comes from, and even his own broth ers and sisters were 'offended at him' (Mark 6:3). Jesus rebukes his critics with the famous words:
Jesus said to them, 'Only in their own towns, among their relatives and in their own homes are prophets without honour.' He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. He was amazed at their lack of faith. (Mark 6:4-6)
As we saw at the end of the Aries section, those who are bent on the spiritual life will meet most opposition from their closest kin. 'I am astonished by thl• harm that is caused by dealing with relatives,' writes St Teresa. She goes on: 'I know through my own experience, as well as that of others, that in time of trial my relatives helped me least.' (Bielecki, page 56) The 'true rl.'lalives'

of Jesus are not those who claim kinship by accident of birth. So, the true spiritual companion is one who shares our ideals, our attitudes and our aspi rations: whether or not he shares our name is irrelevant.
'Two by Two'
The narrative continues with Jesus sending out the disciples 'two by two' (Mark 6:7). Their mission is to preach repentance, to heal the sick, and to cast out demons. They are not to take anything with them for the journey except a staff, and they are to wear only sandals; they are not to wear two coats (Mark 6:8-9). It is appropriate that the apostles are sent out to proclaim the message of the kingdom in this section, since Gemini, and its ruler, Mercury, both concern communication. This passage might well describe an actual commissioning, but its position among so many incidents which express the duality-unity theme tends to lend it symbolic value. The apostles are to con duct their mission 'in twos', acknowledging, perhaps, the inherent duality of the individual, but the fact that they are not to wear two coats is a possible warning against double-mindedness and inconsistency. This is further emphasized in the command to 'remain in one house' in each city that they visit (Mark 6:10), not to flit about from place to place like those whose lives have no direction or purpose. The warning that those towns which reject the apostles' message will suffer a worse fate than Sodom and Gomorrah (Mark 6:11), contains another clear Geminian reference: Sodom and Gomorrah, known as the twin towns of the plains, are, like Castor and Pollux, always referred to together. They are not mentioned anywhere else in this Gospel.
The Death of John the Baptist
The final episode in the Gemini section illustrates the dangers of Geminian inconsistency. In the story of John the Baptist's death (Mark 6:14-29), we encounter King Herod, a man who cannot make up his mind.* With Gemini, says Carter, 'there is a lack of decision and a good deal of wavering' (Carter, 1925, page 69). He had married Herodias, the former wife of his brother, Philip, and had locked John the Baptist in prison for speaking out against such an illicit union. Herod was certainly ambivalent in his approach to
• Josephus in his History of the Jews (Book 18 chapter 5) mentions the death of John the Baptist at the hands of Herod, but he doesn't tell us how he dit•d. The beheading - the divi· sion of the body into two pieces - is probably Mark's invention. Even the head on a pl.1tter looks like an astrological detail - the l'arlh s urrounded bv l ht• circle of tlw zodiac - r.1ther than a hisloriGII om•.

John: he feared and admired him, and would often listen to what he had to say, but his vanity and vacillation, twin pitfalls of Gemini, led him, at his birthday celebrations, to make the reckless promise which brought about John's death. He makes his step-daughter the Geminian offer of halfhis king dom for dancing so well, but gives her John the Baptist's head instead. This is a cautionary tale depicting the catastrophic results which follow when Wl' are incapable of exorcizing the legion of contradictions which inhabit our carnal selves.

Cancer (Mark 6:30-8:21) 'Be Thou Open!'
My religion is kindness. The Dalai Lama (born 6 July 1935)
John the Baptist and Jesus
The entry of the sun into Cancer, on or around 21 June each year, marks the time of the summer solstice, the point of the sun's maximum northerly declination, and the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere. From this point onwards the days will gradually, but inexorably, shorten as the sun sinks lower in the sky. This is what Manilius calls ' the hinge of the year, the blazing turning point' when the sun is 'recalled, and bends back the length of day'. This notion of 'reversal' seems to be common to all the crea tures - including the Tortoise, the Crayfish, and the Lobster, in addition to the Crab - which have been held to represent this constellation. For Christians, this time of year has always been associated with John the Baptist, and his birth is celebrated on 24 June, three days after the summer solstice, and six months before the celebration of the birth of Jesus at the time of the winter solstice, on 25 December. John, we are told in Luke's Gospel, was six months older than Jesus (Luke 1:36). Mark has nothing about the birth of John, but it is curious that he should recount his death (see previous
100



Cancer (Mark 6:30-8:21)
chapter) precisely at the point in the narrative when Gemini crosses into Ca11cer.
This could be purely fortuitous, of course, but it could well be, as I suspl�d, that mid-summer has been in some way connected with John from the wry beginning of Christianity, at least from the time the Gospels were written. I f this is so, then the implication is that Jesus was always associated with thl· mid-winter solstice, too, and that the celebration of his birth on 25 Decembt�r was part of the Christian mysteries from the earliest days, and was not simply a later concession to paganism, as is generally thought. The association of the solstitial axis with the stories of the birth of Jesus undoubtedly owes something to the ancient name for the constellation Cancer, given by Aratos as Karkinos, and expanded by Eratosthenes to Karkinos, Onoi kai Phatnc, Tlw Crab, the Asses and the Manger; and the Latin Praesaepe, often rendered a!:l ' Beehive', but more appropriately as ' Manger' is still the conventional name of the cluster of stars in the centre of this otherwise inconspicuous constellation. Jesus and John are always contrasted in the Gospels. In the first chapter of Mark, John represents the passing Age of Aries which is giving way to tlw new Age of Pisces, but there is also a contrast based upon the symbolism of the two solstice points. Jesus, ' the light of the world', is said to be born at thl· time of maximum darkness, when the light begins to grow; John is born when it starts to wane. Hence the Baptist's enigmatic words in John's Gospel, ' He must increase, I must decrease' (John 3:30) In the ancient world, Cancer and Capricorn, the two solstitial signs, were considered the 'gates' of incarnation: the human soul incarnates in Cancer, the divine in Capricorn. Homer alludes to this in book 13 of the Odyssey, where Odysseus encounters two gates in the cave at Ithaca. Chapman trans lates the passage thus:
(There) runs a cave..... .
To which two entries were: the one for man, On which the North breath'd, the other for the gods, On which the South; and that bore no abodes For earthy men, but only deathless feet Had there free way. (lines 164-7)
The neoplatonist Porphyry, in his commentary on Homer, expounds the astrological significance of this passage:
These two gates are Cancer and Capricorn; but Plato calls them entrances. And of these theologists say that Cancer is the gate through
101



The Gospel and the Zodiac
which souls descend; but Capricorn that through which they ascend. (Quoted in 17te Astrological Journal, volume 46 No. 2. page 59.)
If men are born in Cancer and gods are born in Capricorn, we can better understand the contrasting roles of John the Baptist and Jesus in the Gospel narrative. John represents everything that is good and noble in the human being. He preaches justice, equity, and stability, the sort of principles that any religious liberal might be expected to endorse. 'Among those born of women there is no-one greater than John the Baptist,' says Jesus, 'yet the one who is least in the kingdom ofGod is greater than he' (Luke 7:28). John epitomizes the human virtues, but Jesus, who tells us not just to share what we have, as John does, but to give it all away, epitomizes a qualitatively different way of being. John shows us how to live a human life: Jesus shows us how to live the divine life. John represents the old covenant, the Mosaic Law which takes us to the borders of the Promised Land. But Moses and his Law do not take the people over the threshold; Joshua is the one who makes the final conquest, just as Jesus (whose name is a Greek version of the Hebrew name Joshua) leads us into the kingdom of God.
Cancer and the Moon
The signs which mark the solstices and the equinoxes - Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn - are called Cardinal signs, each one of them associated with a different element. Aries is Cardinal Fire; Cancer is Cardinal Water, Libra Cardinal Air, and Capricorn Cardinal Earth. In the beautiful, simple imagery of the zodiac we see the tension that is produced i n Cancer by the union of Cardinality with Water: the Cardinal signs denote pioneering activity, lead ership, whereas Water represents the 'shrinking, fearful, self-protective instinct' (Carter, 1925, page 64). Herein lies the paradox of Cancer, so famil iar to all of us: just at the point of maximum opportunity to press forward and achieve our goals we retreat fearfully into the securities of the past. The Crab is the perfect symbol of this. It is one of the most absurdly constructed creatures, a walking paradox, with its skeletal system on the outside protect ing its soft and vulnerable interior flesh. Its movement Lacks the consistency of direction which marks the movement of most other creatures. Instead it scuttles, apparently uncertain of its destination, and, just to be on the safe side, it carries its house along with it. Its tenacious claws enable it to grab and hold all those things it needs to make its life bearable. Such things give us a clue as to how the ancient world saw the Cancerian type: energetic but cautious; concerned with home and family; trapped in
1 112



Cancer (Mark 6:30-8:21)
the past while constantly threatening to break away from it; sensitive and caring beneath a thin but hard shell of aggressive self-protection. Manilius, rather unkindly perhaps, dwells on Cancer's grasping nature, and its ability to 'sell the world's produce to the world, to establish commercial ties between so many unknown lands, and to search out under foreign skil'S fresh sources of gain' (Book 4, lines 165-71). Psychologically, says Mayo, Cancer represents 'the primitive urge to protect and to nourish, especially the feminine desire to receive into the womb and to possess'. (Mayo, 1 964, page 45). The glyph of Cancer (e:D) is generally thought to represent tlw crab's claws, but many see it as a representation of the breasts, symbols of nurture and care, and of the transmission of nourishment from one genera tion to the next. Physiologically, it is said to rule the stomach and the digestiw system generally. These traits and concerns can often be detected in individuals who haVl' Cancer strongly marked in their horoscope. They manifest in an astonishin� variety of ways, but the underlying themes are evident and consistent. Bowr 'Iron' Mike Tyson (born 30 June) typifies the aggressive shell hiding the vul nerable interior; in his Metamorphosis, Franz Kafka (born 3 July) describes tlw transformation of Gregor Hamsa into a giant hard-shelled beetle, and in Tlw Trial he explores the essential isolation of the individual human bdng; Thoreau (born 12 July) lived the life of a recluse, barely moving from tlw place of his birth; and the British writer, Colin Wilson (born 26 j unl'), attained some celebrity with his first book 11Je Outsider. Even the philo sopher Leibnitz (born 1 July) expressed Cancerian images in his ' monads', the theory that reality is composed of discrete and impermeable entities. However, few people typify Cancer as completely as Marcel Proust (born 1 0 July), who spent much of his time in his room, wrapped in a cocoon of bedclothes, and was constantly troubled by his stomach. His great work is the multi-volume Remembrance of 17Jings Past, a paean to reminiscence, sparked by eating a little cake called a madeleine, and when asked which manual profession he would take up should he need to, he replied, in true Cancerian fashion, 'I think I would become a baker. I t is an honourable thin).\ to give people their daily bread.' (de Botton, page 201) Such traits can also be perceived in Cancerian nations. A merica, ' born on the fourth of July', seems to epitomize the sign. Reagan's 'Star Wars' pro gramme, conceived as a 'protective shell' around the USA to keep out all l'llemy missiles, struck a Cancerian chord deep in the American psyche. Tlw llag, mom, and apple-pie are all Cancerian themes, demonstrating a national mmmihnent to collective security, family v a l ues, and a fu l l stomach. l 'opcorn, that most American of foods, symbolizes the lll't'd for a bu nd.ltKt'
un



The Gospel and the Zodiac
and the desire to be able to eat forever and never get full (or fat!). A talent
for trade has enabled the American people to fill their coffers to overflowin� and to seek out new markets in an attempt to appease the god of economic growth. Add to this a tendency towards sentimentality, a preoccupation with genealogy and, at times, an insularity of which President Monroe would have approved, and you have all the major characteristics of the sign Cancer embodied in one nation. The spiritual challenge of Cancer, then, lies in coming to terms with our own need for security, which tends to chain us fearfully to the past and renders us incapable of jettisoning all the accumulated detritus that we consider indispensable to our life. It challenges us to open ourselves up, to remove the shell of conditioning and expose our vulnerable underside, to break through the barrier which shuts out the unfamiliar, and which serves as a defence against novel and alien experience. We construct our personal carapace out of family, tradition, and fear and we keep it in place by averting our eyes from the horizon and fixing our gaze downward. We become fierce protec tors of our inheritance and eager collectors of anything which might cushion us or our offspring against life's capricious reversals. The symbolism of the moon (J>), which 'rules' Cancer, further underlines these themes. The sun and the moon are the two primary celestial symbols, representing opposed, but complementary, aspects of life. The sun is positive, shining with a light of its own; it is constant, always the same shape in the daytime sky. It is the yang or ' masculine' energy of the conscious mind which pushes outward. The moon, on the other hand, is negative, shining with reflected light; it seems inconstant, in a state of flux, and so has come to be associated with the 'feminine' yin energy of the turbulent, unpredictable unconscious. In classical astrology, the moon symbolizes the feminine side of us all, the tender, nurturing, protecting instinct. It particularly stands for the mother, our individual, personal mother, and the collective source of all life, Motherhood personified. The moon represents all organizations and institutions, such as churches and schools, which have a mothering role, and which we honour with such titles as Mother Church or Alma Mater. Mayo sees the moon as representing 'the mediator between past and present' by means of which 'are created protective forms of habit patterns, instinctive behaviour and response'. The moon's readily observable cyclic rhythm has led to its association with 'the ebb and flow of sensation and emotional experience . . . . that maintains the periodical need for a man to withdraw into past experience, memory, or to draw on the past'. In addition, and crucial to what follows, the moon is said to govern 'taste and drinking, the stomach, bdly, and the womb' (Mayo, 1904, page I R) .

Cancer (Mark 6:30-8:21)
The Spiritual Lessons of Cancer
This section begins, in characteristic Cancerian fashion, with a withdrawal. The apostles have returned from their mission and have begun to tell Jesus of their experiences. He senses their weariness and suggests that they accompany him into a secluded place to rest for a while (Mark 6:30-32) . However, their movements are being monitored, and great crowds of people run ahead of them (Mark 6:33). The story continues.
When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things. (Mark 6:34)
The crab-like urge to retreat into seclusion after an active sortie is in no St'nsc a bad thing, and the text does not imply that it is. It simply suggests that it is impossible. For those on the spiritual path there can be no inactive period . Concern for those in need, and compassion for those in distress must takl• precedence over even legitimate personal requirements. This is Jesus at his most 'maternal', responding to the needs of others regardless of the cost tn himself. The shepherd who, as John's Gospel tells us, will 'lay down his lifl• for his sheep' Gohn 10:11), is as apt an expression of the essence of Canccrian protectiveness as it is possible for us to devise. Jesus has shown compassion before (Mark 1:41, 5:19), but only to individuals: now he takes pity on whole groups. He tells his disciples to give the people something to eat but, on makin� enquiries about available food, they report that they only have five loaws and two fish (Mark 6:38). Jesus commands them to have the people sit down on the grass (Mark 6:39):
So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all. They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish. The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand. (Mark 6:40-44)
This remarkable miracle is repeated, almost verbatim, a little later in tlw Gospel (Mark 8:1-10). There are slight differences, however, and these help us to understand why two similar events (not two accounts of the saml' event, as some scholars suggest) should be placed so close together. To begin w i th, the two events occur in very d ifferent places. The fi rst is in Galill•c: no
105



The Gospel and the Zodiac
change of location has been indicated since Jesus was preaching 'round about the villages' near his home town (6:6). However, the second feeding occurs in Gentile territory, 'on the coast of the Decapolis' (6:31 ) . Furthermore, a s i f to underline that the Jew-Gentile theme i s important, Mark uses two different words for 'basket' in his twin accounts. In the 'Jewish' feeding he uses the word kophinos, which Abbot-Smith informs us means 'a basket, probably of wicker-work, such as were carried by Jews for food' . ln the 'Gentile' feeding, the word is spl1u ris which is a more generic term, with no Jewish connotations. The numbers also are different and, therefore, of significance. ln the Feeding of the Five Thousand, twelve bas kets of surplus are collected from five loaves; in the Feeding of the Four Thousand, seven baskets from seven loaves. It is more than likely that five and twelve specifically indicate Jews: the five books of Moses comprise the Pentateuch, the foundation of Jewish religious life, and the twelve is an obvi ous reference to the twelve tribes of Israel. Similarly, seven and four could obliquely refer to the 'seventy Gentile nations'*which were scattered around the 'four quadrants' of the earth. Taken together, the two stories are designed to show that compassion has no racial boundaries. But there is more to them than this. In breaking the bread Jesus anticipates the actions he will perform at the Last Supper (Mark 14:22), when he gives his followers the spiritual food they will require to sus tain them in tribulation. This link gives us a clue to the meaning of these two feeding stories: Jesus dispenses the spiritual manna to all who wish to receive it, regardless of religious affiliation, and there is such abundance that no one has to go hungry or to hoard provisions for future consumption. God's bounty is everywhere for those who have eyes to see. The presence of fish in both these stories should alert us to the Piscean motif which runs through this Gospel, and which reaches a climax in the final section. Fish is the symbol of the new age of Pisces which the death of Jesus will inaugurate. To eat fish is to commune with Christ, a fact which was not lost on the early Christians who ate fish each week on Friday, the day of Venus, the planet exalted in the sign Pisces. The catacombs contain many examples of bread and fish as symbols of the Eucharist.

Cancer (Mark 6:30-8:21)
The Decans of Cancer
The names of stars in the constellation Cancer and its decans seem, mort• than coincidentally, to be reflected in these stories. Ma'alapll in Cancer is said by Fleming to mean 'assembled thousands', and Praesaepe, Cancer's central cluster, which means 'the Manger', can also mean 'the Pen', ' the Fold', 'tlw Enclosure', ' the Beehive', a notion echoed in Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, two of Cancer's decans. Seiss contends that these two constellations, the Great and Little Bears, have been wrongly named by the Greeks because they confused the name of the principal star in Ursa Major, Duba/1, with tlw word Dob, 'bear' . He continues:
But ' Dubheh' or ' Dubah' does not mean bear, but a collection of domes tic animals, 'a fold', as in the Hebrew word 'Dober'. The evidence is that, according to the original intent, we are to see in these constella tions not two long-tailed bears but two sheepfolds or flocks, the collected and folded sheep of God's pasture. (Seiss, pages 125-6, emphasis added)
Alkaid, a star in Ursa Minor, means, according to Fleming, 'The Assemblt•d', and Alpherkadain means 'The Redeemed Assembly'. The less fanciful Alll•n also notes that early commentators considered The Folds an appropriate titll· for these constellations (page 449).
Walking on the Water
The other decan of Cancer is Argo, the mythological ship which carril•d Jason (another variation of Jesus/Joshua) and the Argonauts in their qtwst for the golden fleece. Manilius, in his survey of the constellations, describes the Argo as the ship quae vicerat aequor, 'the ship which conquered the water' (Book 1, line 623), a feat which Jesus repeats by walking on the surface of tlw lake (Mark 6:45-53). Since water has perennially symbolized the emotional nature of the human being, this action shows that Jesus has conquered thosl' irrational, turbulent forces which reside in the unconscious and constantly threaten to overwhelm us, and has attained that serenity of spirit which markc; the enlightened individual, and which is the goal of all spiritual aspirants. As we read in the Blm:�avad Gita:
Not shaken by adversity, Not hankering aftl'r happiness;

(The World's Bible, page 29)
The rest of the section faithfully reflects those Cancerian motifs which we outlined earlier. Jesus demonstrates his concern for others as he heals the sick in Gennesaret (Mark 6:53-56), and shows his contempt for man-made traditions in his argument with the Scribes and Pharisees over food laws. His opponents are scandalized by the fact that Jesus' disciples do not perform the ritual washings before they eat (Mark 7:1-5), but Jesus attacks them mer cilessly, declaring their customs bogus and their motives mercenary (Mark 7:6-13). Nothing, he says, that a man puts into his stomach can render him defiled; defilement consists in what comes out of a man. His actions defile him, not his food (Mark 7:14-23). The food motif is not exhausted yet. At the end of the Cancerian section, Jesus and his disciples once more put to sea in a boat (Mark 8:13). The disciples have only one loaf of bread with them. The story continues:
The disciples had forgotten to bring bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat. Be careful,' Jesus wamed them. 'Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and that of Herod.' They discussed this with one another and said, 'It Is because we have no bread.'
IOH



Cancer (Mark 6:30-8:21)
Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them: 'Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hard ened? Do you have eyes but fail to see. and ears but fail to hear? And don't you remember? When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?' 'Twelve,' they replied. 'And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many bas ketfuls of pieces did you pick up?' They answered, 'Seven.' He said to them, 'Do you still not understand?' (Mark 8: 14-21 )
Nineham calls this 'a truly remarkable incident' (page 213) in view of the fact that the disciples are at their most obtuse and Jesus at his most enigma tic. They talk about loaves of bread after witnessing two stupendous feed in� miracles; he refuses to give a direct answer to any of his own questions. It hardly seems possible that, as it stands, this passage describes a real his torical incident. Could even the dullest among us show so little insight as tht• apostles here display? What seems more likely is that this episode has bct•n constructed by Mark along the lines of similar dialogues in John's Gospel (e.g. John 3) in which lack of comprehension is a literary device designed to prompt further elucidation. Here in Mark, however, there is no elucidation. In fact, Jesus himself, not some uncomprehending listener, is askin� tlw questions. And, in the light of all that has preceded this incident, he cannot be asking these questions of the apostles. He is asking them of us. This d is cussion is not so much a record of the spiritual blindness exhibited on om• particular occasion by a specific group of people. Instead, it describes the darkness and ignorance in which we all find ourselves as we try to assua�c our spiritual hunger with physical food. This is the point at which Mark h•lls us that we do not live on bread alone, that our life is about more than food and our body about more than clothing (Matthew 6:25). But our carnal nature can only understand tangible, edible, saleable objects, the accu mula tion of which is the concern of the Pharisees and Herod, symbols hl•n• of materialism and greed. The yeast* symbolic of corruption, and of tra d i t ion, represents the insidious and subtly pervasive attractiveness of the world's commercial values which have perennially offered us a counterfeit of gen uine spiritual sustenance. This passage asks us to consider whether we who have been apprised of the miracles of God, which are so abundantly evidl•nt

in nature and in life, are still of the opinion that happiness consists in a full stomach.
Opening Up
This section also contains the lovely story of the Syro-Phoenician Woman who begs Jesus to heal her daughter. Jesus refuses at first, declaring that it is not right to give the children's food to the dogs (Mark 7:24-27). 'Yes,' she says, 'but even the little dogs under the table get to eat the children's crumbs' (Mark 7:28). Cancer 'rules' dogs, particularly the faithful, protective, domes tic variety, and Alice 0. Howell tells us that in the Glastonbury Zodiac ' it seems that instead of a crab for Cancer there was a dog' (Howell, 1990, page 136). The Greek text specifies that the woman was talking about 'little dogs' (kunaria), and it is interesting that Manilius considers the constellation Procyon, The Little Dog, to be a decan of Cancer and not, like Seiss et al, of Gemini. He says:
But when the Crab hath doubled Ten Degrees, And rear'd seven more, bright Procyon leaves the Seas. Inclines to Weave strong Nets, to train the Hound, To know the Breed, and to improve the Sound. (page 161)
Could the woman's reply contain a veiled reference to a constellation that Mark considered a decan of Cancer? This is not unlikely. The decans loosely surround the zodiacal constellations and, in some cases, might be said to belong to one as to another. In fact, Manilius's list of decans is quite different from that of Seiss, and this discrepancy could indicate some measure of dis agreement in the ancient world. However, as far as I am aware, this is the only occasion on which Mark seems to follow the tradition represented by Manilius over the one that Seiss inherited from the tenth-century Arab astronomer, Albumaser. There are, in fact, quite a number of 'dogs' in this part of the sky, and 'Caesius mentions Catuli and Canes l.Jlconicae, the Lapdogs or Puppies, and the Spartan Dogs, as titles for both of the Bears' (Allen, page 450).

This roundabout journey (see map), which has been compared with travel ling from London to Cornwall via Manchester, has given literalist commen tators untold headaches. The general consensus seems to be that it shows Mark's lack of geographical knowledge and probably indicates that he was not a native of the area. However, it is quite obviously a joke by Mark - a reference to the scuttling crab's inability to get directly to its destination. The NIV tries to make sense of it by translating it: 'Then Jesus ldt thl•

vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis', but this is not completely faithful to the Greek. Cracking the shell of exclusiveness is the theme of the next incident, the Cure of the Deaf and Dumb Man (Mark 7:31-37), which takes place after Jesus has made a curiously crab-like journey back to the sea of Galilee. Jesus' Aramaic command to the deaf man's ears expresses the hard task of the Cancerian phase of the spiritual life: 'Ephplmtha, that is, be opened.' At first sight these two incidents - The Cure of the Syro-Phoenician Woman's Daughter and the Healing of the Deaf Mute - look like two separate miracle stories, and they are usually interpreted as such in conventional biblical commentaries. But they need to be taken together to get the full impact of what the Gospel writer is trying to convey. The woman who approaches Jesus is a Gentile, i.e. a non-Jew. She asks Jesus to cast a demon from her daughter, but Jesus refuses her request ini tially because, he says, it is not right for him to give the children's food to the dogs. This, of course, is a terrible insult, and the fact that it is uttered by Jesus himself has proved quite embarrassing to Christian commentators, who try to soften it a little by saying that the word used is rather an affectionate term for a dog, and anyway, Jesus was really only testing the woman's faith. Does Jesus really come out of it better if we assume that he is playing some sort of game with this distressed woman? U she had been unable to respond cleverly to his insult, would he have refused to heal her daughter? The significance of this story only becomes apparent when we read it in con junction with the story which follows. After putting his fingers in the man's ears and touching his tongue with spittle, Jesus says the Aramaic word Ephphatlia, and the man finds himself able to hear properly and to speak coherently. It is unusual to find Aramaic words or phrases in the Synoptic Gospels. Aramaic was the first language of the Palestinian Jews, and so would have been the language of Jesus and the apostles, and commentators regularly point out that it is present in the Gospels - which were all originally written in Greek - because these would have been the actual words that Jesus said. But, as we noted in the story of Jairus's Daughter, it is possible that Aramaic is used for emphasis in the Gospel of Mark; that the Gospel writer is saying, 'I'm writing this word in another language, so pay attention to it. It's important.' The word Ephphatlia means 'Open up!' What Jesus is saying to this deaf man is what he is saying to all of us. This man was suffering from a physi cal deafness; we are suffering from spiritual deafness. Our ears are closed to the words of those who live in close proximity to us, but whose traditions are different from ours. We don't hear what they are saying, and so our opin ions are garbled and worthless. The Jewish exclusiveness displayed by Jesus



Cancer (Mark 6:30-8:21)
in his encounter with the Gentile woman dramatically illustrates our own clannishness, our refusal to listen attentively to the unfamiliar voices. It is only when we are prepared to open up that our prejudices can be eroded; and only then that the impediment in our speech will be removed and our opinions will be worth listening to. This theme is explored further in the final scene of this section, the Cure of the Blind Man (Mark 8:22-26). As Jesus enters Bethsaida a blind man is brought to him and, in response to the man's entreaties, Jesus restores his sight. This seems to be just another example of Jesus' amazing power to heal. But the story is different from all the other miracles recounted in tht' Gospels, because it is the only one in which Jesus is shown failing at his first attempt. He takes the man to one side, rubs spittle on his eyes, and asks him, 'What do you see?' ' I see men but they look like walking trees,' the man replies. Jesus rubs the man's eyes again, and this time his sight is restored and he can see everything clearly. This tiny little story was left out of the Gospels of Matthew and Luke even though the authors of these Gospels undoubtedly knew about it. They prob ably didn't include it because they seem to have had a pressing need to show Jesus in a favourable light, and giving an account of an incident in which ht• fails to achieve his purpose immediately does not do justice to his remark able powers. But they failed to understand the significance of the story, as have numerous commentators who, for want of something relevant to say, spend their time explaining that Jesus took the man aside because he was concerned for his dignity, and how spittle was considered to have healing properties in the ancient world. Liberal commentators, desperate to find a naturalistic explanation for the miracle, will even suggest that Jesus had mough medical knowledge to realize that this man had cataracts, and that rubbing his eyes with spittle would remove them. All of which miss the point. The blind man, like all the characters in tlw Gospels - when the Gospels are read as psychological, spiritual treatises and not as historical reminiscences - is you and I. We have received the first rub of the spittle, and we can see, but we don't see people, we see walking trees - or, in contemporary language, ciphers, zombies, humanoids. We recognize their general shape and their mobility, but we have yet to grant them fully human status. What we need is a second metaphorical rub of the eyes to cor rl'Ct our vision, to remove the residual film which prevents us seeing people ,,s they really are, as ends in themselves, and not as means to our own ends. J·:instein expresses the same sentiment as Mark, but less dramatically and more philosophically, as follows:

The Gospel and the Zodiac
A human being is part of a whole called by us ' universe', a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts, and feelings as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. (Goldstein, page 126)
The function of all spiritual practice - from whatever tradition it comes - is to help us to narrow the gap between self-awareness and other-awareness, to remove that residual film from our eyes which is deluding our sight. And while it is important to stress that this applies to everyone, regardless of their zodiacal sun sign, it is appropriate to give the final word in this chap ter to Helen Keller (born 27 June 1880), who bore the physical burden of Cancerian isolation in a way expected of few people. That she overcame it, both physically and spiritually, is wonderfully consoling - and challenging - to us all.
Those who have been mentally blinded ' in the gradual furnace of the world' can, and must, be pressed to look for new capabilities within themselves and work out new ways to happiness. They may even resent faith that expects nobler things from them. They say in effect, ' I will b e content i f you take m e for what I am - dull, o r mean, o r hard, or selfish.' But it is an affront to them and to the eternal dignity of man so to acquiesce. How often it comes over us that there is much in us which our nearest friends cannot know - more than we dare or care or are able to lay bare, more of feelings, more of power, more of manhood. How little we know ourselves! We need limitations and temptations to open our inner selves, dispel our ignorance, tear off disguises, throw down old idols, and destroy false standards. Only by such rude awakenings can we be led to dwell in a place where we are less cramped, less hin dered by the ever-insistent External. Only then do we discover a new capacity and appreciation of goodness and beauty and truth. (Keller, pages 202-4)

Leo (Mark 8:22-9:29) 'Who Am I?'
Jesus said: 'One who knows everything else, but who does not know lrim�>r�(. knows nothing. ' (Gospel of Tiromas, Saying 67)
Leo and the Sun
'The sign of Leo,' says Ptolemy, 'as a whole is hot and stifling', and from a purely meteorological point of view, he is absolutely right. The days from late July to late August are the dies caniculariae of the Romans, the 'dog-days', named after Sirius, the Dog-star, whose heliacal rising, four hundred Yl'ars before the Christian era, corresponded with the sun's entrance into the con stellation Leo and marked the hottest time of the year. It is a time when Wl' can do little more than follow the advice of Hesiod: 'When Sirius parches head and knees, and the body is dried up by reason of heat, then sit in till' shade and drink.' Leo, the second Fire sign, is the sign of the sunshine. It is the only one of tlw twelve zod iacal signs said to be ' ruk•d' by the sun, and althouAh Cann•r

marks the point of the sun's greatest northerly declination, Leo marks its point of maximum power. Its metal is gold, the royal metal, and in the zodi acal man it corresponds with the heart, the 'central fire' of the body, upon which all the other organs depend. For the Jews it represented the tribe of Judah, 'the lion's whelp', according to Jacob's blessing (Genesis 49:9) . Indeed the Lion, whose mane is reflected in the glyph of Leo (dl.), has been associat ed with this constellation from the earliest times and in various cultures, in part no doubt because 'the sunne being in that signe is most raging and hot like a lion' (Allen, page 253), but also because the dignity, pride, indolence, individualism and sense of innate superiority which, in folklore at least, the lion displays are often manifest in those people who are born at this time of the year. The Greek solar hero, Hercules, whose twelve labours reflect the signs of the zodiac, wears the skin of a lion, and his most memorable labour is the slaying of the Nemean Lion. Hercules' Hebrew counterpart, Samson (whose Hebrew name means 'Sunny'), kills a lion with his bare hands in the vineyards of Timnath, and eats honey ('liquid sunshine' as it has been called) from its carcase Gudges 14: 5-9). 'The sons of the Lion,' writes Manilius, 'are filled with the urge to adorn their proud portals with pelts . . . and (to) swagger about in the heart of the capital with droves of beasts', which, making concessions for cultural differ ences, agrees entirely with more modem assessments which detect in the sons and daughters of Leo a fondness for self-display, vanity, and aristocratic individualism. Charles Carter says that in Leo 'there is the temptation to say, " For mine is the kingdom, the power and the glory", to which the bombastic Italian dictator (Mussolini, born 29 July 1883) so completely succumbed' . But what sometimes manifests negatively at the level of human character is only a reflection of the essence of Leo, 'the sign of divine splendour', whose ruler, the sun, has ever been a symbol of deity 'not as a vain and self-seeking mag nate but as a source of tender affection and loving fatherhood for all upon whom its rays may shine' (Carter, 1 965, page 71) . In essence, then, Leo concerns identity; not just awareness o f the ego and its constant struggle to draw attention to itself, nor even of the 'personality', the mask we wear in life's theatre, but the real identity of the human person as a child of God, as a soul of infinite value. 'We are stardust, we are golden', sang Joni Mitchell at Woodstock, echoing the Psalmist who tells us that we are 'a little lower than the angels' (Psalm 8). This individuality is symbolized, astrologically, by the sun, the source of all life, which 'implants in the soul at length the mastery and direction of its actions, desire for substance, glory, and position, and a change from playful, ingenuous error to seriousm•ss, decoru m, and ambi tion' (Ptolemy, Book I V,

The Spiritual Lessons of Leo
I am all at once what Christ is, since he was what I am, and This Jack, joke, poor potsherd, patch, matchwood immortal diamond,
Is immortal diamond. (Gerard Manley Hopkins, born 28 July 1844)
On a journey to Caesarea Philippi,* Jesus asks his disciples, 'Who do peopll· say that I am?' The text goes on:
They replied, 'Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.' 'But what about you?' he asked. 'Who do you say I am?' (Mark 8:28-29)
Conventionally, this episode is read as a record of an actual discussion between Jesus and his disciples in which the Lord reveals the secret of his own unique status as the Christ (or Messiah)t of Jewish expectation. But such an approach is fraught with problems, as scholars have discovered . To begin with, Mark's Jesus is manifestly not the Christ of Jewish expectation. Unlike Matthew and Luke, Mark does not say that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, the city of David, which Micah had predicted would be thL' Messiah's birthplace (Micah 5:2). In addition, it is unlikely that Jesus was of the Davidic line; as an inhabitant of Gaillee in the north his ancestry would hardly be from the tribe of Judah which was located in the south of the coun try, around Jerusalem. The only individual who calls him 'Son of David' in Mark's Gospel is blind! (Mark 10:46-52), and Jesus seems to repudiate this title in chapter 12 (verses 35-37), a passage which has proved very problem a tical for most conventional exegetes. Most telling of all, however, is the fact that Jesus does not fulfil the role of Messiah in any way that was even remotely comprehensible to the Jews, which is why the Jewish people to this day have difficulty in accepting him as such. The Messiah was to be a literal leader who, as Psalm 2 deda res, would ' Break (the heathen nations) with a rod of iron, (and) dash them in

pieces like a potter's vessel' (verse 9), which the Jesus of the Gospels does not even attempt, let alone achieve. The conventional Christian response to this is to claim that the Jewish people were wrong to expect this kind of Messiah, and that the nature of the real Messiah is to be found in the Suffering Servant Songs of Isaiah 52-53. However, nowhere in Mark do we find references, other than exceedingly oblique ones, to this section of Isaiah. It is Matthew who quotes from these verses, in an attempt to give Jesus better Messianic credentials (Matthew 12:15-21 ) . He makes Jesus a clear personification of the Suffering Servant, whereas for Jewish exegetes the whole nation of Israel was, and is, the embodiment of this Old Testament figure. Such anomalies have led commentators to make all manner of speculation about Jesus' role as Messiah. Wrede, for instance, writing at the beginning of the twentieth century, considered that this section of Mark's Gospel was really an attempt to come to terms with the fact that Jesus had never claimed to be the Messiah in his lifetime, and the title had only been accorded him, by his followers, after his death. Hence the secrecy motif which pervades these verses. However, there is no need to resort to such reasoning, depend ent as it is upon an overly literal view of what it means to be the Messiah. That there is secrecy here there can be no doubt, but it is not the secrecy born of expediency. Mark's secret is the same as Paul's:
[It is] the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the saints. To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. (Colossians 1 :26-27, emphasis added)
This section of the Gospel attempts to teach us that Messiahship is not embodied in one individual, historical character, but that it is a status which all potentially share. To be the Messiah, the Christ, to be agents of transfor mation in the world, we have to become fully persuaded of our relationship with God, and fully committed to the welfare of others who are equal sharers in divine sonship and daughtership. 'Who do you say that I am?' is not a question asked, once and for all, by Jesus of Peter; it is the question that all of us must ask ourselves at some time or another; and we must keep remind ing ourselves of the correct answer. The Fourth Gospel has no account of Jesus' question to Peter, but it explores the theme of identity even more comprehensively than the synop tics. Jesus uses the expression 'I am' on a number of occasions - ' I am the bread of life' (6:48); ' I am the Good Shepherd' (10:1 4); ' I am the resurrection and the life' ( 1 1 :25); and, in conversation with the Jews, he ma kes the aston ishinH claim, ' Before Abraham was, I am (l'go 1•imi)' . This is not just a claim

Leo (Milrk 8:22-9:29)
to pre-existence; it is nothing short of a claim to identity with God who, in the Book of Exodus, had revealed himself to Moses as ' I am who I am' (Exodus 3:14). Most of Christendom interprets this to mean that Jesus alone has this om• ness with God, a position which undoubtedly hinders all genuine dialogm· with non-Christian faiths. But this is not the only possible interpretation. For Gnostics, and for all who accept the perennial philosophy in one or other of its guises, 'I am' refers to the awareness of identity with God which can bl• experienced by all who discover the Christ within.* On such an interpretation, 'the Christ' is not a single historical figure but the eternal principle of mystical unity with the divine which, says Thomas Hickey, has been discovered and proclaimed 'by saints and sages, poets and wise people, throughout history, and ... is recorded in the sacred books, mythologies and literatures of all cultures' (Hickey, page 33). It can be found in the Hindu Upanishads, which came into existence hun dreds of years before the Christian era. In the Chandogya Upanishad the seeker, Svetaketu, is informed by his father about the nature of the Self:
In the beginning there was Existence alone - One only without a second. He, the One, thought to himself: Let me be many, let me grow forth. Thus out of himself he projected the universe; and having projected out of himself the universe, he entered into every being. All that is has its self in him alone. Of all things he is the subtle essence. He is the truth. and that, Svetaketu, THAT ART THOU. (Prabhavananda, pages 68-9)
Tat Tvam Asi, 'that art thou', expresses the identity of the Self with Brahman, Being itself, the source of all existence. The Gnostic Gospel of Thomas is firmly in this mystical tradition, teaching that 'we came from the light, tlw place where the light came into being on its own accord' (Barnstone, pagl' 303). Later in the same document we read, 'Split a piece of wood and I am there. Lift up the stone and you will find me there' (i.e. there is nowhen• tiMI the Christ is not). The similarity between such ideas and eastern mystical philosophy can be clearly seen, and may give us a clue as to why the naml' of Thomas, who was traditionally considered to be the Apostle to India, came to be associated with this Gospel.

The Gospel and the Zodiac
times by ex-Dominican priest Matthew Fox, in terms which, no doubt unwit tingly, reflect the leonine themes of this section of Mark's Gospel:
'What good is it to me if I am a king and do not know I am a king?' asks Meister Eckhart. The name 'Christ' means 'the anointed one'. All of us are anointed ones. We are all royal persons, creative, godly, divine, persons of beauty and of grace. We are all Cosmic Christs, 'other Christs'. But what good is this if we do not know it? Everyone is a sun of God as well as a son or daughter of God, but very few believe it or know it. The ones who do Meister Eckhart calls 'the enlightened ones'. (Fox, page 137)
'Son' and 'sun' are accidental homophones in English, but this is not their only connection. Leo, the fifth sign of the zodiac, ruled by the sun. has natural affinity with the fifth house of the horoscope, which in traditional astrology concerns offspring. It can be no accident that this Leo section of Mark contains a number of Father-Son references: the voice of God on the mount of Transfiguration declaring 'This is my beloved Son, listen to him,' (9:7), and the incident of the man with the demon-possessed son, which ends the section (9:14-29). God makes a similar claim to the paternity of Jesus in the Aries section (1 :11), and Aries is the sign of the sun's exaltation. In Luke's genealogy of Jesus (Luke 3:23), Jesus' grandfather is said to be Heli, which is a contraction of the Greek word for 'sun' - ltelios. Matthew, in his parallel account, has even more father-son references. He has Peter declare that Jesus is 'the son of the living God' (Matthew 16:16), and in the next verse Jesus calls Peter 'bar Jonah' - son of Jonah, named for the prophet of old who refused to obey God's command to preach to the people of Nineveh, and ended up in the belly of the great fish. This could be an allusion to Peter's Piscean character because, despite his ironic nickname ' Rocky', he displays all the characteristics of the vacillating Pisces. In this passage, Peter represents the sons and daughters of Pisces - the citizens of the new age - to whom Jesus is revealing the secrets of the kingdom of God. The 'rock' upon which Jesus will build his community (ekklesia) is not the man, Peter, as generations of Roman Catholics have believed, but the state ment Peter makes about the identity of the Messiah: 'You are the Christ, the son of the living God' is to be the unshakeable foundation of the new community, and is the key to the kingdom of God. Those who possess this knowledge of their own true identity transcend the conventions of inherited morality and live from their own divine centre, in accord with the values of the kingdom of God, but having a self-derived authority like that of Jesus who 'taught
1 20



Leo (Mark 8:22-9:29)
with authority, and not as the scribes'. Such people can make their own rules. As Edward Carpenter writes:
Once you really appropriate this truth (i.e. your identity with God), and assimilate it in the depths of your mind, a vast change (you can easily imagine) will take place within you. The whole world will be trans formed, and every thought and act of which you are capable will take on a different colour and complexion. (Carpenter, page 303)
The discovery of our own 'royal' nature, momentous though it is, is not thl• end of our efforts, as the Gospel goes on to show. Jesus predicts that suffer ing and death lie ahead, and not for him alone, but for all who would come after him (Mark 8:43). Paradoxically, the Leo phase of the spiritual journey does not involve aggrandizement but abasement. The Christ-like individ ual cannot pursue worldly wealth and glory: his treasure is his soul, his divine life, over which the things of the world will constantly try to throw a veil (Mark 8:35-37). As Alice Bailey points out, a prerequisite of living the divine life is ' the crucifixion of the lower self and the conquering of individual self assertion' (Bailey, 1974, page 74) symbolized mythologically by the slaying of the Nemean Lion, and by the destruction of ' the serpent of illusion', Hydra, one of Leo's decans, which represents that which 'veils and hides the soul' .
Fig. 12 Hydra, ' the fleeing serpent'
The lion and the serpent, Hercules' adversaries in the Greek myth, become the Devil, or Satan, in the Christian story. As we learn from the First Epistle of Peter, 'Your enemy the devil prowls around li ke a roaring lion looki ng for
1 21



11te Gospel and the Zodiac
someone to devour' (1 Peter 5:8); and in the Book of Revelation we read about ' that ancient serpent called the devil or Satan, who leads the whole world astray' (Revelation 12:9). Unless the devil, the false, egotistical self, is conquered, no progress is possible in the spiritual life. As Leonine Carl Jung was wont to say: ' the death of the ego is the birth of everything else', a sen timent echoed by Aldous Huxley (another Leo, born 26 July 1894), who tells us that
'Our kingdom go' is the necessary and unavoidable corollary of 'Thy kingdom come'. For the more there is of self, the less there is of God. The divine eternal fullness of life can be gained only by those who have deliberately lost the partial, separative life of craving and self-interest, of egocentric thinking, feeling, wishing and acting. (Huxley, page 114)
This is the meaning of the 'crucifixion' predicted by Jesus. Dane Rudhyar (page 71) says that a tendency to self-dramatization, to 'feeling quite special', accompanied by a growing sense of spiritual achieve ment, are the pitfalls associated with the Leonine phase of the spiritual journey (Rudhyar, page 71), which is why Jesus explains that suffering, not self-glorification, is a necessary consequence of Christhood. Peter's reluctance to accept this prompts Jesus to say 'Get behind me, Satan', and to tell him that his ideas are not of God but of men (Mark 8:33). Peter represents all those who have not yet moved beyond the point of 'feeling quite special' . Like the blind man (Mark 8:22-26), he can see, but not clearly; and like the rest of us, he has still to learn the lesson of self-crucifixion. There may well be an allusion to the constellation Corvus, The Raven, one of the decans of Leo, in Jesus' rebuke of Peter. In his Metamorphoses, Ovid tells the story of the raven who, on reporting unwelcome news to his mas ter, has his former silver colour changed to black. The story concludes:
Then he turned upon the Raven, 'Wanton babbler! see thy fate! Messenger of mine no longer, Go to Hades with thy prate!'
According to Allen, it was from this story that the name Garrulus Proditor 'Talkative Betrayer' - came to be associated with this constellation.

Leo (Mark 8:22-9:29)
Son of Man
Throughout this section of the Gospel, Mark has Jesus refer to himself by this strange title which, originally, meant nothing more than 'human being' . In Psalm 8 (verse 4), for example, the psalmist asks:
What is man, that you are mindful of him? The son of man, that you care for him?
This is a perfect example of ' parallelism', a consistent feature of Hebrl'W poetry, in which the second part of a statement echoes the first. These lines also reflect a Hebrew idiom in which 'son of' means 'one who exhibits the nature of', as in such expressions as 'son of kindness' (ben chesed) in the Old Testament, or 'Sons of Thunder' (boanerges, a Greek transliteration of an Aramaic word) in the New. In Ezekiel, the term 'son of man' is used on numerous occasions to mean nothing more than 'person' or 'human being' . Even in Daniel, where 'son of man' seems to take on an apocalyptic charac ter (Daniel 7:18, 22, 27), there is still no indication that the term refl•rs prophetically to an individual messianic figure. I ndeed, as J.L. Mckenzie points out in his Dictionary of the Bible, 'son of man' refers to Israel in the Book of Daniel. Attribution of this title uniquely to Jesus is a development of later Christian theology, but this interpretation has its problems. The princi pal one concerns passages like Mark 8:38, which refers to the son of man 'coming in the glory of his Father with the holy angels'. If this foretells a lit eral second coming of a glorified Jesus, then it was not fulfilled since we arl' later informed that many present would not die until they had experienced this 'return' along with the coming of the kingdom of God 'with power' (Mark 9:1). Only by interpreting the 'coming of the son of man' and tlw 'coming of the kingdom' as poetic expressions of internal, spiritual transfor mations are we freed from the literalist's preoccupation with looking up at the sky.
The Transfiguration
Clory and faith, kingship and selfhood are the Leonine themes explored throughout this section of Mark, bu t nowhere more so than in the account of the Transfiguration. Six days* after the Caesarea Philippi episode, jesus

takes Peter, James and John into a high mountain where he is transfigured before them:
And his clothes became dazzling white, like snow, whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them. And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses who were talking with Jesus. (Mark 9:3-4)
Jesus' true identity as God's son is made known in an unambiguous way to the frightened and bewildered onlookers, who respond by asking whether they should build three ' tabernacles', one each for Jesus, Moses and Elijaht (Mark 9:5). These three ' tabernacles' (Greek skenas - tents, dwellings) reflect the three-fold phases or locations of the sun: rising, midday and setting, and so symbolize the three-fold nature of deity. Manly Hall writes:
God the Father, the Creator of the world, is symbolized by the dawn. His colour is blue, because the sun rising in the morning is veiled in blue mist. God the son, the illuminating one sent to bear witness of His Father before all worlds, is the celestial globe at noonday, radiant and magnificent, the maned Lion of Judah, the Golden-haired Saviour of the world. Yellow is His colour and His power is without end. God the Holy Ghost is the sunset phase, when the orb of day, robed in flaming red, rests for a moment upon the horizon line then vanishes into the darkness of night to wander in the lower worlds and later rise again tri umphant from the embrace of darkness. (Hall, pages 135-6)
In this wonderfully dramatic episode Mark declares that the Messianic status of Jesus is ratified by two of the greatest figures from Jewish history, repre senting the Law and the Prophets, twin cornerstones of biblical religion. Their endorsement is particularly important since both were supposed to return to earth at the dawn of the Messianic age (see Deuteronomy 18:18, and Malachi 4:5-6). But it is God himself who finally, and decisively, proclaims Jesus as his son and tells the onlookers to listen to what he has to say (Mark 9:7).
editorial gloss, or an arbitrary linking phrase. According to Genesis, six is the number of cre ative days, and on the sixth day God created human beings (Gen 1 :26-31). Six symbolizes human nature in its original, ' unfallen' state, when our relationship with God, in whose image we were created (Genesis 1 :27), was most evident. Six is also the number of points on the Star of David, which is composed of two con-penetrating triangles, one pointing up to heaven, the other down to the earth, thus symbolizing the union of human and divine. The appearance of the number six in a passagl' designed to teach us about till' true naturl' of ,, human being is, therefore, singularly appropriate.

The Gospel and the Zodiac
In this poetic epiphany Mark is telling us that Jesus, in his true nature - the nature he shares with all of us - fulfils all the conditions of Christhood, and that the Jewish heritage, properly understood, points towards this, too. In this episode Matthew, once again, is more 'astrological' than Mark: he says (Matthew 17:2) that Jesus' face 'shone like the sun' (elampsen to prosopott autou has lw llelios), as clear a reference to Leo and its ruler as one could wish for.* Fruitful comparison can be made between the Transfiguration and the revelation of Krishna's divine form in the Hindu classic the Bhagavad Gita, which was already about 400 years old by the time the Gospels were writ ten, and would most certainly have been known to those sages from whom the Gospels eventually sprang. Its message is 'that each human life has but one ultimate end and purpose: to realize the Eternal Self within and thus to know, finally and fully, the joy of union with God, the Divine Ground of Being':
0 conqueror of sloth, this very day you shall behold the whole universe with all things animate and inert made one within this body of mine. And whatever else you desire to see, that you shall see also. But you cannot see me thus with those human eyes. Therefore, I give you divine sight. Behold, this is my yoga power. (Sanjaya, the narrator:) ... When he had spoken these words, Sri Krishna, master of all yogis, revealed to Arjuna his transcendent, divine Form, speaking from innumerable mouths, seeing with myriad eyes, of many marvellous aspects, adorned with countless divine ornaments, brandishing all kinds of heavenly weapons, celestial garlands and the raiment of paradise, anointed with perfumes of heavenly fragrance, full of revelations, resplendent, boundless, of ubiquitous regard. Suppose a thousand suns should rise together into the sky: such is the glory of the Shape of Infinite God. (Novak, page 24)
In the constellation Leo there are a number of stars whose names (as inter preted by Seiss et al) reflect the Transfiguration incident quite strikingly: the second star in Leo is AI Giebha, said to mean the exalted, tire exaltation, while Zosma, situated near the lion's tail, is the shiningforth, the epiphany, and while we may dismiss these as fanciful or anachronistic, there can be no doubt about the appropriateness of the name of the constellation's principal star, Regulus, Tire Ki11g, sometimes called 'Cor Leonis', 'the Heart of the Lion'. Allen writes:
• The Feilsl of l ht• Tr.msfi�uration is n•lt•hr.th•d in tlw ( ·,, l holk l r.u l i t ion 1111 h August, when 1111' �1111 is i n lht• t't'lllf<' of llw si1�n of 1 .<'<'

Leo (Mark 8:22-9:29)
Regulus was so called by Copernicus ... as a diminutive of the earlier Rex, equivalent to the f3amAICTJ<OS of Ptolemy ... Thus, as Sharru, the King, it marked the fifteenth ecliptic constellation of Babylonia; in India it was Magha, the Mighty; in Sogdiana, Magh, the Great; in Persia, Miya11, the centre; among the Turanian races, Masu, the Hero; and in Akkadia it was associated with the fifth antediluvian King-of-the-celestial-sphert!, Amil-gal-ur ... In Arabia it was Malikiyy, Kingly; in Greece, f3am.Aunc01; aOTIJp; in Rome Basilica Stella; with Pliny, Regia; in the revival of European astronomy, Rex, and with Tycho, Basiliscus. (Allen, pages 255-6)
The very ancient and widespread association of this star with kingship and glory stems from its status as the leader of the so-called 'Royal Stars', Regulus, Formalhaut,* Aldebaran and Antares, which rise approximately six hours apart, and so seem to divide the sky into quadrants. According to Allen, in antiquity these stars were associated with the four climactic points of the year, the equinoxes and the solstices, and Regulus was associated w i t h the summer solstice, when the sun i s at the highest point i n its annual jour ney through the heavens.
The Boy with the 'unclean spirit'
When Jesus comes down the mountain and returns to his disciples, he finds a great crowd has gathered. A man has brought his son to be hl•aled, hut the disciples of Jesus seem powerless, and the man approaches Jesus him self, begging him to cure his son who, he says, is oppressed by a ' d u mb' (alalos) spirit, which regularly takes hold of him, causing him to foam at the mouth and to gnash his teeth. ' How long has this been going on?' asks Jesus. 'From childhood,' replies the man. 'It often throws him into the fin• and into the water, trying to destroy him.' Jesus tells him that all things are possible to one who has faith, and the man utters the famous words, ' Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief.' Then Jesus rebukes the spirit, which convulses the lad, before coming out of him and leaving him as if dead. Jesus takes the young man by the hand and lifts him up, and thPn tells the astonished disciples that this kind of spirit can only be exorcizl•d by prayer and fasting.
• Fonnalhaut is found in the constellation Piscis Australis, which lies opposilt• Leo, .md j, one of the decans of Aquarius.

11te Gospel and tlte Zodiac
Mark's version of this story illustrates the importance of faith - a charac teristic quality of all three Fire signs, but particularly of Leo and Sagittarius. 'If the affirmation of Cancer is Ifear, that of Leo is I ltavefaitit', writes Charles Carter (1965, page 71). But faith in this context cannot possibly mean 'faith in doctrines' or even 'faith in Jesus'. It refers to a particular kind of con fidence in one's own power as a child of God, the power of the Gtrist wit/tin, in the light of which everything is possible. 'It's not a question of whether I can help you,' says Jesus to the man, 'it's more to do with whether you can help yourself' (verse 23), the implication being that any power Jesus might possess is available to anyone who, through spiritual discipline ('prayer and fasting'), comes to realize his or her own essential divinity. It is the paltriness of our self-understanding which renders us impotent, cowering in the face of adversity. 'Man is a god in ruins,' says Emerson, and only when we reacquaint ourselves with our true nature will we be able to exercise those powers which are our birthright. In these days, when a reputable scientist can declare, 'I think we follow the basic law of nature, which is that we're a bunch of chemical reactions running around in a bag' (Dean Hamer, quoted in Time magazine, 29 November 2004), and when politicians of right and left can view people as expendable economic entities, the Gospel teaching about the inherent divin ity of the human being needs to be affirmed with all the energy we can muster.
'Moonstruck'
Matthew's version of this story (Matthew 17: 14-21) adds another dimension. According to Matthew, the young man is not harbouring a 'dumb' spirit, as Mark says, he is 'moonstruck' (seleniazetai), a term which has perplexed com mentators and translators, so much so that the boy's condition is generally considered to be epilepsy, since epileptic seizures were thought to be influ enced by the moon. But the Greeks had a perfectly good word for epilepsy epilepsy! - and, presumably, Matthew could have used this word if he had wanted to. However, there is the intriguing possibility that Matthew used this word for a different reason, a reason connected with Leo's principal star Regulus, which lies directly on the ecliptic, the sun's apparent path in the sky (and the belt of sky through which all the planets, including the sun and moon, seem to move), which means that it is occulted (hidden) by the sun every year (around 22 August) and even morefrequently l1y tilt' moon. Regulus, 'the little king', 'the prince', symbolizes the brrandeur of the human soul, which perceiv�s its own royal nature on the Mount uf ·rransfiguration bu t

which, on descending the mountain, is brought once more into the conflicts and uncertainties of daily life where it begins to doubt itself. After bein� illumined by the sun it is struck by the moon, tossed to the earth, buffeted 'between the fire (sun) and the water (moon)', losing faith in its own inherent divinity, as it becomes re-entangled in the minutiae of mundane existence. Whereas the sun rules maturity, ' giving mastery and direction to action,' the moon, by contrast, rules infancy, ' with its changeability and the imperfection and inarticulate state of its soul' (Ptolemy, IV, section 10). To the ancient astrologers the moon represented flux and inconstancy, but also habit, the instinctive, deadening, thoughtless, reactive, response to experience. Whenever we are at the mercy of instinct or of habit, when we are swayed by prejudice, or when we act automatically and without thought, we arl' 'moonstruck'. Sadly, but realistically, this is the normal human condition, and it can only be overcome, as the Gospel text clearly tells us, by consistl•nl spiritual practice.

Virgo and Mercury
We noted in the chapter on Aries that in the ancient world, Virgo was con sidered to be the leading constellation in the zodiac circle. The association of Virgo with birth and children makes it an appropriate starting point for any symbolic account of the spiritual journey. Our spiritual life begins not with our natural birth, but with our rebirth, which is not brought about by physi cal urges but by the Spirit of God working within us. 'Unless a man is born again,' says Jesus to Nicodemus, 'he cannot see the kingdom of God' Oohn 3:3). The Jews called this harvest* constellation Bethulah and associated it with the tribe of Asher, of whom Jacob had declared 'his bread shall be fat' (Genesis 49:20). Symbolically, Virgo is the 'house of bread' which, in

The Gospels of Matthew and Luke an• both prefaced by stories in which these themes are prominent. Mark, who has chosen to structure his narrative around the yearly cycle, beginning w ith Aries, has to introduce them halfway through. The ancient zodiacs invariably depict Virgo as a woman holding soml' thing. In the Egyptian zodiac of Denderah, for example, the figure is drawn carrying a distaff, and when she represents the Egyptian goddess, Isis, slw appears with wheat-ears in her hand, or clasping the young Horus in her arms. In the middle ages, this ancient figure reappeared as the Virgin Mary with the child Jesus, and in Titus Andronicus Shakespeare alludes to it as 'tht• good boy in Virgo's lap' . The image of Isis with Horus in her arms has become, in Christian icono graphy, the Virgin Mary carrying the child Jesus. Joseph Campbell writes:
When you stand before the cathedral of Chartres, you will sec over one of the portals of the western front an image of the Madonna as the throne upon which the child Jesus sits and blesses the world as its emperor. That is precisely the image that has come down to us from most ancient Egypt. The early fathers and the early artists took owr these images intentional ly. (Campbell, ·1 988, page 222)

T11e Gospel and the Zodiac
Albertus Magnus (thirteenth century) thought that Jesus was born under the sign of Virgo. Equally ancient (and equally unlikely) is the idea that the glyph of Virgo (TI)) is composed of the initials of the Blessed Virgin (MV, ' Maria Virgo'). But the association of this constellation with Mary is more ancient than either of these quaint notions, as the calendar of the Roman Catholic Church testifies. The Feast of the Assumption of the Virgin is cel ebrated on 15 August, and the Birth of the Virgin on 8 September. On or around the first of these dates, as the sun leaves the constellation Leo and approaches Virgo, the powerful rays of the rising sun apparently eliminate the fainter lights from Virgo's stars: the Virgin is 'assumed' into the glory of the sun, or as the Book of Revelation has it, she is 'clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head' (Revelation 12:12, emphasis added). On 8 September, the Virgin is 'born' as her stars once more become visible at sunrise.* Mary's 'Virgoan' qualities can be found in the Gospel of Luke, where she is portrayed as the 'handmaid' (he doul€ - 'slave') of the Lord' (Luke 1 :38), one who embodies the great virtues of humility, service and self-effacement. Manilius gives us a picture of this aspect of the Virgo nature:
But modest Virgo's Rays give polisht parts, And fill Men's Breasts with Honesty and Arts, No tricks for Gain, nor love of Wealth dispense, But piercing Thoughts, and winning eloquence . . . But bashful Modesty casts down their Eyes, The best of Vices, yet 'tis still a Vice, Because it stifles, checks or nips like Frost, A blooming Vertue, and the Fruit is lost. (Manilius, 1697, pages 125-6)
Modesty, which Manilius sees as both the strength and weakness of this sign, is a key characteristic of Virgo, sharply contrasting the assertiveness and bombast usually associated with Leo. Virgo is an Earth sign, connected with the harvest, but it is also a Mutable sign, and mutability and earth are strange bedfellows. Earth is the element that responds least well to change, and love of variety is not as evident in Virgo as it is in the other Mutable signs. Mayo considers that the Mutable-Earth combination produces people who are 'self-repressive, passive, restrained, with qualities of practicality, adaptability and variableness' (Mayo, 1964, page 46), qualities which manifest

as an ability 'to collate and catalogue, to create order, to systematize' (Carter, 1925, page 73). People in whom the Virgo principle operates strongly gener ally shun the limelight, but they are excellent workers, well able to provide a practical structure for someone else's grand, but hazy and unformed, idea. Manilius says that the stenographer (scriptor) comes under Virgo, 'one who can record in novel notation the long speech of a rapid speaker' (Book 4, line 199), and the association of Virgo with secretarial work continues down to the present day. This aspect of Virgo as the devoted servant has been well described by Charles Carter:
It is not the sign of leadership but of service; it does not aim at brilliant results but at useful ones. It is patient and does not tum from routine drudgery; it hates show and shuns responsibility and publicity. It is not ambitious but is satisfied with a straight job and a fair wage. (Carter, 1965, page 73)
If we translate the elements of this somewhat unflattering psychological por trait into spiritual categories we can see that the Virgo phase of experience is characterized by service, discipleship, living out the precepts laid down by the spiritual master. In the modem era no one has exemplified these better than Mother Teresa of Calcutta (born 27 August 1910), whose practical, 'hands-on' approach to religion has had such a marked influence on the con temporary world. Although her shrewd self-promotion, her high profile and her considerable leadership qualities seem to indicate the importance of other factors, her image and her public utterances seem almost invariably to reflect her birth sign.
A sacrifice to be real must cost, must hurt, must empty ourselves. The fruit of silence is prayer, the fruit of prayer is faith, the fruit of faith is love, the fruit of love is service, the fruit of service is peace. (Mullan, page 122)
Leo Tolstoy (born 9 September 1828), who in his later years was drawn towards an analysis of the religious nature of the human being, extolled the simple, rational, practical aspects of religion, free from supernaturalism, and concentrating almost exclusively on behaviour: ' Let all the world practise the [teaching) of Jesus and the reign of God will come upon earth,' he wrote. The strongly developed critical faculties associated with Virgo manifest on the spiritual level as the principle of discrimination, of making those choicl'S which will provide a secure fou ndation for tlw living ou t of the spir

Virgo (Mark 9:30-9:50)
itual life. The making of such discriminations demands painstaking effort and it is often a very costly affair, since all choice involves loss. So, the Virgo phase of the spiritual life is not simply the passive acceptance of inherih•d principles, the sheep-like, unquestioning adherence to a system which w i l l enable u s t o rest from the agonizing choices that life calls us to make. Genu irw discipleship demands that we appropriate spiritual values by constantly re evaluating them in the light of our growing knowledge and experience. The 'simple faith' which refuses to make such discriminations is not a commend able spiritual state, but a manifestation of laziness masquerading as piety . Mark will address these issues in the Virgo section of his Gospel. The 'ruler' of Virgo is the planet Mercury (t), which is also said to be 'exalted' in this sign. Mercury, in fact, is the only planet which is exal tl•d in a sign it is said to rule, and so it has a double connection with Virgo. Mercury, in either its Geminian or Virgoan guise, is the ' mental' planet si rKl' its operations are to do with the making of connections between the multi farious aspects of experience, but, what is more to the point of our present study, it is the planet said to have affinity with childhood. Ptolemy writes:
In the following period of ten years, Mercury, to whom falls the second place and the second age, that of childhood, for the period which is hal f the space o f twenty years, begins to articulate and fashion the intelligl•nt and logical part of the soul, to implant certain seeds and rudiments of learning, and to bring to light individual peculiarities of character and facul ties, awaking the soul at this stage by instruction, tutelage, and t he first gymnastic exercises. (Ptolemy, page 91)
In A s You Like It, Shakespeare reflects the ancient tradition of the Seven Ages of Man, the idea that each period of life is governed by a particular planet. His 'young boy, creeping like snail unwillingly to school' is governed by Mercury, the god of learning and communication.

I11e Gospel and the Zodiac
And by tl1e Vision splendid Is on his way attended; A t length the Man perceives it die away, Andfade into the light ofcommon day. (Wordsworth, In timations of Immortality)
On a psychological level Virgo has little in common with Leo, the sign that precedes it in the zodiac. However, spiritually, they represent two sides of the same coin. We noted in the previous chapter that coming to a realization of our own divine nature necessitates accepting that other people share the same intrinsic status. Such a realization produces a sense of the immanence of God in all things and, especially, in all people, in the light of which we can only be humble. This is one of the numerous paradoxes of the spiritual life, whose laws operate in a manner quite different from the ordinary laws of physical life. In the Leo section, Jesus informs us that in order to save our life we must lose it (Mark 8:35), and that suffering and self-denial are a neces sary part of following Christ (Mark 8:34): we can only realize our true divinity by relinquishing it. In the Letter to the Philippians (2:5-8), St Paul expresses it thus:
Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus, who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death - even death on a cross!
This is the principle of kenosis, self-emptying: our divine nature is only real ized to the extent that we serve the divine in other people. In the Gospel of Mark, no sooner are we apprised of Jesus' glory (Leo) than we are given clear instructions about the necessity of humility (Virgo) . These instructions appear in the form of a dialogue which takes place between Jesus and the apostles immediately after the Cure of the Boy with the U nclean Spirit (Mark 9:14-29), and the Second Prediction of Jesus' Passion and Death (Mark 9:30-32). The apostles have been arguing about which of them was most important. Jesus sits down and says to them:
'If anyone wants to be first, he must be the very last, and the servant of all.' (Mark 9:35)
He further reduces their sense of self-importance by taking a child in his arms and explaining that rl>eciving such a child is receiving Christ, and



Virgo (Mark 9:30-9:50)
receiving Christ is receiving God {Mark 8:36-37). The child stands as a per fect symbol of Virgo: Mercury rules childhood, and, as we have seen, the child is a central figure of this constellation. We might note that Matthew reflects the Virgoan character of this passage even more clearly than Mark:
'Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the king dom of heaven.' (Matthew 1 8:4)
For both evangelists the child represents humanity in its simplest and lcnst affected state. This was a particularly apt image at the time the Gospels Wl'fl' being written, when children had little or no status in the community, but it
Fig. 1 6 '.Jesus .1nd t h e Children', b y l ll'inrkh l lofman.

I11e Gospel and the Zodiac
applies today too. Children are vulnerable, trusting, open, free from guile, until the 'shades of the prison-house' begin to form around them and they have to learn to compromise with the world. Being childlike, and receiving the kingdom of heaven 'like a child' (Mark 10:13-16),* are central themes of this Gospel, and it might be as well to explore the meaning of these images in a little more depth, since it is likely that more than innocence and lack of guile is being alluded to.
Religious Experience and Childhood
In the mid-seventies, the Religious Experience Unit at Oxford University conducted a survey of (initially) 2,000 people, asking the question: 'Have you ever been aware of or influenced by a presence or power, whether you call it God or not, which is different from your everyday self?' Rather more than 36 per cent of the people approached answered affirmatively, from which figure it was predicted that 'about fifteen million adults in this coun try (England) would say the same; that is to say, over a third of the popula tion aged sixteen or over' (Hay, page 113). Edward Robinson was struck by the number of respondents, some 15 per cent, who claimed to have had such an experience in childhood, and this prompted him to compile a book containing dozens of examples of these early intimations of transcendence. For example, one 57-year-old lady writes:
The most profound experience of my life came to me when I was very young - between four and five years old ... My mother and I were walk ing on a stretch of land in Pangboume, Berks, known locally as 'the moors'. As the sun declined and the slight chill of evening came on, a pearly mist formed over the ground. My feet, with the favourite black shoes with silver buckles, were gradually hidden from sight until I stood ankle deep in gently swirling vapour. Here and there just the
• Mark 10:13-16. This occurs in what I have called the Ubra section of the Gospel, which seems somewhat unfortunate from the point of view of my main thesis. This is one of the few places where the zodiacal themes appear slightly out of sequence, but I am reluctant to attrib ute this seeming d iscrepancy to some copyist's error, particularly since Matthew preserves the same general order (see Matthew 19). Libra is a comparative newcomer to the zodiacal circle, and its stars have been associated with both V irgo and Scorpio. 'lhe Roman goddess of Justice, Astraea, who is an obvious Libran figure, was frequently identified with Virgo, and Libra was originally known as the 'hom' or 'claw' of the Scorpion, so, as Deborah Houlding informs us, 'the symbolism of this constellation has swung between allegiance with the imagery of the Scorpion and the Maidt•n,' (http:/ / w ww.skyscript .co.uk/ libra myth.html).

very tallest harebells appeared above the mist. I had a great love of these exquisitely formed flowers, and stood lost in wonder at the sight. Suddenly I seemed to see the mist as a shimmering gossamer tissue and the harebells, appearing here and there, seemed to shine with brilliant fire. Somehow I understood that this was the living tissue of life itself, in which that which we call consciousness was embedded, appearing here and there as a shining focus of energy in the more diffused whole. In that moment I knew that I had my own special place, as had all other things, animate and so-called inanimate, and that we were all part of a universal tissue which was both fragile yet immensely strong, and utterly good and beneficent ... This is without doubt the (experienct•) which has laid the deepest foundation of my life, and for which I feel the profoundest gratitude. (Robinson, E., page 11)
I have quoted this beautiful passage at length because it typifies so many of the experiences described in Robinson's book, and because it exemplifies so perfectly the book's main thesis: that in childhood we are as open to spiritual experience as at any other time of our life, but that such early experienCl•s have a purity unsullied by adult rationalizations and untouched by the con straints of conventional religion. As Matthew informs us, God has kl·pt thl· things of heaven from the wise and prudent, and revealed them to men• children (Matthew 11:25). This view of childhood as an exalted state is not a nostalgic denial of childhood's problems, but an affirmation of the sensitivity to the holiness of life which our growing involvement with the world tends to obscure. 'The child tends to grow out of his direct awareness of the om• Ground of things; for the habit of analytical thought is fatal to the intuitions of integral thinking' (Huxley, page 22). As Jesus takes the child in his arms (Mark 9:36), echoing the oldest images of the constellation Virgo, he is, in Yl'l another paradox, showing us that the world is best understood by those who have lived in it least; that this virginal, untainted state is a prerequisite for understanding the things of God. To become as little children is to cultivall• what the Buddhists call 'beginner's mind', a willingness to look at the world with fresh eyes. This is well illustrated by the following Zen parable:
A very clever University professor went to visit Nan-in, a Buddhist holy man. The professor wanted some advice on how he should live a spiritual life. ' I have been studying for many years,' he told the holy man. 'I have read hundreds of books; I have sat at the feet of many gurus; and I have attended many d ifferent places of worship; but I haVl' never found what I am looking for. So now I have come to Sl'l' you.'
J: \9



The Gospel and the Zodiac
Nan-in looked kindly at the professor. 'Would you like a cup of tea?' he asked with a smile. 'Yes, please,' replied the professor. Nan-in prepared the tea and began to pour. The professor's cup was filled to overflowing, but Nan-in continued to pour the tea until it spilled out on to the saucer, and then on to the table. 'What are you doing?' asked the astonished professor. 'The cup is full. No more will go in!' 'Just like you,' said Nan-in. 'Your head is so full of theories, scrip tures, ceremonies, and philosophies that there is no room for anything else. Before I can start to teach you, you must empty your cup.'
The virginal, 'empty' state is necessary if we are to bring to birth the God who lies dormant within the soul. The ancient church called Mary T11eotokos, a Greek term meaning 'God-bearer', and the Catholic Church, which pre serves the vocabulary of these ancient mysteries but which has largely forgot ten their meaning, honours her with that title today. But, as Meister Eckhart said in the twelfth century: 'Mary is blessed, not because she bore Christ phys ically, but because she bore him spiritually, and in this everyone can become like her' - a sentiment echoed by Angelus Silesius in the seventeenth century, who wrote: 'Though Christ were yearly born in Bethlehem and never had birth in you yourself, then were you lost forever' (Bailey, 1934, page 270). Mark's text goes on to describe two dangers of the Virgoan stage. The first of these is perfectionism, which can manifest as insularity or the 'holier than thou' mentality. Mayo calls this the Virgoan need 'to be "pure" and free from the influence of others' (1964, page 47). The disciples tell Jesus that they have forbidden someone, not of their company, from casting out devils in Jesus' name. Jesus disapproves of their action and tells them to let the man alone, because 'whoever is not against us is for us' (Mark 9:40). He goes on to indicate that even the smallest gesture of support for the things of God will not go unrewarded (Mark 9:41). All expressions of service and humility, regardless of their motivation or origin, will foster the growth of the king dom. Matthew preserves this saying of Jesus, but he places it in a different context, and in his zeal to preserve the purity and authority of the church, he completely reverses the sense: 'He that is not with me is against me' (Matthew 12:30), he has Jesus say. Virgoan exclusiveness, the need to stay aloof from the encroachments of 'paganism', started early on in the church's history, but it is a need that is totally absent from Mark, except insofar as he tells us to avoid indulging it. llw second warning of this section concerns Virgoan passivity or, as

Virgo (Mark 9:30-9:50)
Carter has it, ' lack of spiritual aspiration and appreciation' (Carter, 1 968, page 29), and echoes the constellation Coma Berenice, 'Berenice's H a i r ' . Berenice was the wife o f Eueregetes, an ancient king o f Egypt. A s her hus band was preparing to set out on a perilous journey she vowed that, should he return safely, she would cut off her hair, of which she was extremely proud, and offer it as a sacrifice to Aphrodite. On the king's return, Berenice kept hl•r promise, placing her shorn locks in the temple of the goddess. Mark's text, which makes much of sacrificing precious body parts, reads as follows:
If anyone causes one of these little ones - those who believe in me - to stum ble, it would be better for them if a large millstone were hung around their neck and they were thrown into the sea. If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out. And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it orr. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell. And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell, where "their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched". Everyone will be salted with fire. Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with each other. (Mark 9:42-50)
In this series of blood-curdling sayings, Jesus informs his folloWl'rs 111.11 discipleship demands the most strenuous exercise of the will in a constant battle to maintain spiritual integrity. It is not simply a matter of withdraw ing from life and insulating oneself in the kind of religiosity which ta kl•s refuge in prudishness and convention; the kind of pseudo-spirituality which believes that cleanliness is next to godliness, and that going to bed early nnd disapproving of bad language fulfil the duties of the spiritual life. On till' contrary, the spiritual life is a l ife of crisis - choice, discrimination, decision - which demands, in Dane Rudhyar's words, 'the purification of desire and the steeling of the essential will', as well as 'strength, courage, inner still nl'SS, an unemotional and unglamorized type of devotion' (page 1 24). Without such qualities we are cold-blooded and insipid, and, like salt that has lost i t s saltiness, fit only to be discarded. With them w e becomt:• suitably pure, v i r ginal receptacles from which the Christ may be born in the soul.
The Parable of the Lost Sheep
Matthew adds the parable of the Lost Sheep (Matthew 1 8 : 1 1 -14) immt•d iatdy after these warnings about indifference
141



The Gospel and the Zodiac
Fig. 17 Bootes, 'The Coming One, the Shepherd'
(For the son of man has come to save the lost.) What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them is lost, won't he leave the ninety-nine and go into the mountains to look for the one that has gone astray? And believe me, if he happens to find it, he will rejoice more over that sheep than over the ninety-nine which didn't wander. (emphasis added)
This is a reference to the constellation Bootes, one of the decans of Virgo. Bootes, one of the oldest named constellations, is mentioned in the Odyssey, and has been identified for 3,000 years, and possibly longer. Its name has many possible derivations, but Pastor was one of its titles in the ancient world (the French still call it Bouvier), probably because the kite-like shape of the constellation resembles a human figure who seems to be eternally shepherding the stars around the North Pole. Its most prominent star, Arcturus, the fourth brightest star in the sky, was caJied the Shepherd of the Heavenly Flock, or the Shepherd of the Life of Heaven, in the ancient civi lizations of the Euphrates. In Greek mythology, Boeotus was one of the twin sons of Poseidon who were aba ndoned and left to die on Mount Pelion but who were rescued and
1 42



Virgo (Mark 9:30-9:50)
raised by a herdsman. Boeotus was later reclaimed by his grandfather ,md went on to inherit part of his kingdom. Seiss writes:
We have here the figure of a strong man, whom the Greeks named Bootes, the ploughman. But he and the so-called plough are set in opposite directions. Neither does a man plough with uplifted hand in the attitude of this figure. The name thus transformed into Greek has i n i t a Hebrew an d Oriental root, Bo, which means coming; hence, thl• coming One or the One that was to come ... Bootes is not a ploughman at all, but the guardian and shepherd of the flocks ... The brightest star in the constellation of Bootes is also called Arcturus, the guardian or keeper of Arktos, a word which in its Oriental elements connects with the idea of enclosure, the ascending, the happy, tire going up upon 1111' moun tains. (Seiss, page 32, emphasis added)
Seiss's etymology may be strange, but Jesus' statement ' For the Son of man is come (elthen) to save that which was lost', which immediately precedes tlw parable, and the reference to the mountains within the parable, ct•rta i n l y seem t o substantiate i t . The story has a n obvious relationship w i t h tlw Virgoan concern for the details; most of us would be content that ninety-nim· were safe, and we wouldn't be inclined to jeopardize that safety by Sl'l'king out the straying sheep. But God, who notices even the fall of a sparrow, and numbers the hairs on your head (Matthew 1 0:29-30) looks after tht• sma l l matters a s well a s the bigger picture. A s Virgoan Mother Teresa said, ' Lillll• things are indeed little, but to be faithful in little things is a great thing.'

Libra (Mark 10:1-10:31) Maintaining the Balance
Jesus said: 'Wilen you make tlw two into one, you will be called sons of men.' (Gospel of Tiwmas, Saying 106)
Libra and Venus
The entry of the sun into Libra marks the autumnal equinox in the northern hemisphere, when day and night are equal once again. This is the mid-point of the year, the moment of equilibrium, when the forces symbolized by the day and the night are in perfect counterpoise. This has happened before, of course, when the sun dttered Aries in the springtime, but there is a differ ence between these opposite but complementary points: at the spring equi nox the point of poise occurs before the daylight begins to dominate; in the autumn this is reversed and the balance-point presages the forthcoming massing of the darkness. The eternal interplay of light and darkness is symbolized in the zodiac itself, which, on one level, is nothing more than the yearly cycle projected on to the sky. The first six signs, then, come under the dominion of the daylight and can be said to represent the light of individual consciousness struggling
1 44



Libra (Mark 1 0:1-10:31)
to establish its identity. This process is associated with the sun, the giver of light. It begins in Aries, the sign of the sun's exaltation, and reaches its cli max in sun-ruled Leo. The signs which follow the autumnal equinox, how ever, are characterized by the gathering darkness and have to do with thl• group into which individuality has to be incorporated, if not submerged . These are the 'social' signs which begin with Libra, the sign of the sun's 'fall' or 'depression', and which reach their point of maximum powl•r in Aquarius, the sign (in modem astrological jargon) of the sun's 'detriment'. In ancient Egypt Libra was associated with Maat, the goddess of cosmic harmony and justice, whose special task was to weigh the hearts of the dl•ad on the scales of justice balanced against an ostrich feather, and she is usually depicted with a feather in her headdress. Those who failed her test wert• 'heavy hearted'; those who passed, ' light hearted' . Among the Greeks, notably Hipparchus, Libra was Zugos, Tile Yoke, tlw very word used by Matthew in a passage immediately following Jesw;' declaration that God has revealed the secrets of the kingdom to infants (Matthew 11 :25-30). Mark uses a word from the same root (stmzezt,-.:numi) when he writes: 'What God has joined - yoked - together, let no man separah•' (Mark 10:9). Among the Jews, the tribe of Issachar, described in Jacob's blessing (Genesis 49:14) as 'a strong ass crouching down between two burdens', is generally associated with Libra. The glyph (:!!:) represents both the setting sun and the crossbeam of a pair of scales, reflecting Libra as the balancl' point or fulcrum of the year. It is not too difficult to see how this notion of balance can be extended to encompass such things as justice, the law, and paying one's debts, the very categories with which Manilius deals in his description of Libra:
Libra, whose scales, when Autumn turns the Signs, And ruddy Bacchus treads the juicy Vines; In equal Balance, poise the Night and Day, Teach how to measure, and instruct to weigh . . . Besides, he'll know the Niceties of Law; What guard the Good, and what the Guilty awe, What vengeance wait on Crimes, with Skill declare, His private Chamber, still shall be the Bar. What he determines, that for Right shall stand, And Justice weigh'd her Balance in his Hand. (page 1 26)
1 45

But legal matters are not the only areas over which Libra is said to have dominion. The image of the balance can be applied to any sphere of life in which we find the interaction of complementary forces, principal among which is the relationship between male and female in marriage. Libra, the sign of the sun's fall, represents the subordination of one ego to another in a perpetual struggle to maintain a fragile harmony. As Aries represents the consciousness of self, Libra symbolizes 'the other', the one with whom our ego has to make the biggest compromise, the one with whom we have to learn the hard lessons of mutual concern and love. Mayo considers that Libra symbolizes ' the primitive urge for unity and relatedness with others ... and the need to conform to an ideal pattern of community life' (Mayo, 1964, page 49). The spiritual lesson of the Libra phase involves our willingness to move from isolation into participation, a movement symbolized by marriage but not restricted to it. Such primary unions are microcosms of the greater unity and harmony of the ideal society in which the Libran principle of jus tice operates to guarantee equity, fairness, and balance in all areas of com munal life. The 'ruler' of Libra is Venus (�) caUed by astrologers ' the lesser benefic' Oupiter is ' the greater benefic'), since it symbolizes good fortune, health, material prosperity, and physical beauty . In Greek mythology Venus is Aphrod i te, the goddess of love, who rules young manhood and young

Libra (Mark 10:1-10:31)
womanhood, the stage of Shakespeare's 'lover, sighing like a furnace'! At this stage, says Ptolemy, there is 'an activity of the seminal passages' and 'an impulse toward the embrace of love' (page 445). However, the sensual ity and materialism which characterize the planet's association with Taurus, while undoubtedly present in Libra, seem to manifest in a less gross form. In its Libran aspect, Venus is the planet of grace, art, style and refinemL•nt. Ptolemy gives us an exhaustive list of this planet's attributes:
If Venus alone takes the domination of the soul, in an honourabll· position she makes her subjects pleasant, good, luxurious, eloquent. neat, cheerful, fond of dancing, eager for beauty, haters of evil, lovl•rs of the arts, fond of spectacles, decorous, healthy, dreamers of pleasant dreams, affectionate, beneficent, compassionate, fastidious, l'asily conciliated, successful, and, in general, charming. (Ptolemy, pa�l' 357)
Although Ptolemy does go on to mention a few possible faults (such as 'erotic' and 'timid'), these are not of the worst kind. From the point of view of nornMI human society, then, Venus represents all those things we would considl'l' desirable and praiseworthy. From the point of view of the spiritual li(t•, however, these things are not enough, as we shall see.
The Spiritual Lessons of Libra
At the beginning of chapter 10 Mark takes up the Libran themes by describ ing an altercation between Jesus and some Pharisees over marriagl'. In .m attempt to trap Jesus into making an injudicious reply, they ask him about the legality of divorcing one's wife (Mark 10:1-2):
'What did Moses command you?' he replied. They said, 'Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away. ' 'It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law.' Jesus replied. 'But at the beginning of creation God "made them male and female". For this rea son a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife. and the two will become one flesh. So they are no longer two. but one. Therefore what God has joined together (sunezeuxen - yoked), let man not separate.' (Mark 1 0 :39)

The Gospel and the Zodiac
For its time, this is indeed radical teaching. Marriage was not a sacred institution in the ancient world and divorce was commonplace, even among the Jews, for whom monogamy was the ideal. The Jewish scriptures com pared Yahweh's fidelity to Israel with the tender concern of a loving husband for his wife (e.g. Hosea 2), and the prophet Malachi has God declare, 'I hate divorce' (Malachi 2:16). Such an ideal was, apparently, more honoured in the breach than in the observance, and Moses' teaching allowing divorce enabled the more unscrupulous to practise a kind of serial monogamy which would have had devastating consequences for the women involved. Theoretically, divorce was open to both parties but, given the general status of women at that time, it was hardly an option for the female. William Barclay describes the situation as follows:
One thing vitiated the whole marriage relationship. The woman in the eyes of the law was a thing. She was at the absolute disposal of her father or of her husband. She had virtually no legal rights at all. To all intents and purposes a woman could not divorce her husband for any reason, and a man could divorce his wife for any cause at all. 'A woman,' said the Rabbinic law, 'may be divorced with or without her will; but a man only with his will.' (Barclay, 1975, page 151)
Getting a divorce was very simple. The man had to give his wife a 'bill of divorcement' in the presence of two witnesses. This stated: 'Let this be from me thy writ of divorce and letter of dismissal and deed of liberation, that thou mayest marry whatsoever thou wilt.' The passage from the Pentateuch to which the Pharisees refer in their dis cussion with Jesus can be found in Deuteronomy 24:1. The text states that a man may divorce his wife 'if she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her'. The prevailing opinion among rabbis at the time of Jesus was that this was a specific reference to adultery, but certain rabbis, following Rabbi Akiba, considered that 'finding no favour' in one's wife could simply mean that one no longer thought her attractive. According to Barclay, the rabbinic school of Hillel taught that a man might divorce his wife if:
she spoiled his dinner by putting too much salt in his food, if she went in public with her head uncovered, if she talked with men in the streets, if she was a brawling woman, if she spoke disrespectfully of her hus band's parents in his presence, if she was troublesome or quarrelsome. (Barclay, 1975, page 1 52)

Libra (Mark 1 0:1-10:31)
Divorce, it seems, was possible on the flimsiest of pretexts. Whether Jesus' restatement of the ideal was intended to be a blankl't condemnation of all divorce or, at least, all remarriage after divorce (Mark 10:11-12), as the Catholic Church has interpreted it, is difficult to say. It was obviously a point of contention within the early Church because Matthew's account of this event (Matthew 19:9) shows Jesus disapproving of divorn• 'except for adultery' (pomeia). This seems to be a concession, probably made as a result of top-level deliberation about the practicality of a total ban. What is certain, however, is Mark's teaching that we cannot regulate our primary relationships simply by referring to what the law tolerates. There is <1 law that transcends the culturally conditioned statute book, a law that is written into our very being, which demands integrity in our intimall' li fe .ls ,, condition of spiritual growth. Under this law we must relate to anotht•r <ls ,, 'thou' to be loved and cherished, not as an 'it' to be used and then discanil-d . It is this obvious sense of the text that Christianity has proclaimed down the centuries, but the mystical traditions preserve another dimension tn m.u riage which transcends its function as a social institution. The 'sacred marri.l,.;t•' symbolizes a return to a supposed prelapsarian condition of the human racl' when, 'in the beginning, God created them male and female' (Genesis I :27). when the twin principles of spirit (male) and matter (female) were joined in harmonious unity and balance - the image of God - before being sundt•rl'd by the Fall. A secular version of this myth of primordial unity is found in Plato's Symposium in which a certain Aristophanes refers to a time wlwn humans were androgynous, male and female physically joined togl'llwr in one circular whole, u ntil their powers became so great they had to be cut in two by Zeus; human love, says Aristophanes, is the attraction between tlw separated halves. But joining the separate parts of the self is, in tlw Mysteries, a spiritual not a physical quest, in which each individual strives to balance the various polarities within him or her self, to become a compleh• human being 'in whose nature spirit and matter are both compll'tl'ly developed and perfectly balanced, the divine man who unites in his own person husband and wife, the male and female elements in nature, as God and man are one in Christ' (Besant, page 270). This 'sacred marriage/ was the goal of the Gnostic aspirant. In the Gospel of Thomas, Jesus teaches his disciples:
When you make the two one, and when you make the outside like the inside, and the above like the below, and when you make the male and female one and the same, so that the male be not male nor the female female tht•n will you t•nter the Kingdom. (Saying 22)

The Gospel and the Zodiac
This is the teaching that would have been imparted to those ' inside the house', i.e. to initiates, but it has been lost in the legalism of Christian ortho doxy's literal approach to the text.
Balance
The importance of personal balance is stressed in Taoism, the most Libran of the world religions, in which the unity of opposites, the yang and the yin, within the psyche is a condition of personal growth and social harmony. I n the teaching o f H u a Hu Ching w e read:
In ancient times, people lived holistic lives. They didn't over-emphasise the intellect, but integrated mind, body, and spirit in all things. U nderstand that true growth comes from meeting and solving the problems of life in a way that is harmonising to yourself and to others. If you can follow these simple ways, you will be continually renewed. Unless the mind, body, and spirit are equally developed and fully integrated, no (wisdom) . . . can be sustained. When the body is emphasised to the exclusion of the mind and spirit, they become like trapped snakes: frantic, explosive, poisonous to one's person. All such imbalances inevitably lead to exhaustion and expiration of the life force. (Novak, pages 171-2)
The Rich Young Man
The more goods people possess, the greater the tedium.
(St Teresa of Avila)
The section devoted to marriage is followed by the story of the Rich Young Man (Mark 10:1 7-31). He comes running up to Jesus, kneels before him, and asks, 'Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?' Jesus says to him: 'Why do you call me "good"? Only God is good' (Mark 1 0:18). This reply has been a source of acute embarrassment to the Church, since it seems to under mine the status of Jesus as 'God incarnate' . And the embarrassment was felt early on. Matthew has Jesus say, ' Why do you ask me about what is good?' (Matthew 1 9 : 1 7), •' sl ight bu t significan t change, which dol'S less damage to
l �l l



Libra (Mark 1 0:1-10:31)
Jesus' image as a divine figure. But this passage has nothing to do with Jesus' ontological status, and Mark's version is absolutely crucial to a propt•r understanding of the text. By repudiating all claim to 'goodness' which, in its conventional sense, is used to describe someone who operates comfort ably within the mores of society, Jesus is teaching that 'becoming good', while it might be a by-product of the spiritual life, is not the object of it. This is precisely the lesson he wants to teach the young man. The story continues:
'You know the commandments: "Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal , do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honour your father and mother."' 'Teacher,' he declared, 'all these I have kept since I was a boy: Jesus looked at him and loved him. 'One thing you lack,' he said. 'Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me: At this the man's face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth. (Mark 1 0: 19-22)
This young man epitomizes everything that is noble and virtuous in Judaism. According to the conventional wisdom of the time, his prospt•rity is a reward for his scrupulous observance of the law, and stands as a guar antee that he is speaking the truth about honouring his contractual agreement with God: as Psalm 37 testifies, the Lord is good to the righteous. MoreoVl'r, the man is lovable. Jesus instantly recognizes that his dutiful approach to lift• has in no way diminished his attractiveness as a human being. We might assume that he possesses all the characteristics of the Libra-Venus personality as outlined above, and today the man would be hailed as a great model of religious piety, an enviable figure, an exemplary citizen. For Jesus, however, the man has one major failing: he is too committed to a l ife of ease to be a serious candidate for the spiritual life which demands that we relinquish our attachments to fleshly pleasures, even the innocent ones. Jesus would have agreed with Wittgenstein, who said somewhere that whatever life is about, it certainly isn't about having a good time. Contemporary Christianity is as astonished by this teaching as Jesus' apostles were (Mark 10:24). Throughout history, worldly success has bt•en considered a reward for virtue, and the evangelists of today who condemn what they consider the 'paganism' of modem society while preaching that 'God wants us to be prosperous' might well reflect on this passage in Mark. In recent years, it would seem that every single TV evangelist in America has produced a book or a series of tapes with some variation on tht• title 'Tiw Bible's Plan For Your Prosperity', each of which no doubt includes some thing about God's plan for the evangelist's prosperity, too. For jesus, how ever, riches, while not wicked, are inimical to real discipleship (10:24), and
1 51



I11e Gospel and the Zodiac
to the rewards that such discipleship will bring (Mark 10:30). The spiritual life cannot be lived amidst the distractions and temptations that invariably accompany wealth. As Schopenhauer says, 'People need external activity because they have no internal activity. Where, on the contrary, the latter does exist, the former is likely to be a very troublesome, indeed execrable annoyance and impediment'(Schopenhauer, page 178). A similar sentiment was expressed by St Teresa of Avila:
It's as if a person were to enter a place where the sun is shining but be hardly able to open his eyes because of the mud in them. The room is bright, but he doesn't enjoy it because of the impediment of things like these wild animals or beasts that make him dose his eyes to everything but them. So, I think, must be the condition of the soul. Even though it may not be in a bad state, it is so involved in worldly affairs and so absorbed with its possessions, honour, or business affairs, that even though as a matter of fact it would want to see and enjoy its beauty, these things do not allow it to; nor does it seem that it can slip free from so many impediments. If a person is to enter the second dwelling place, it is impor tant that he strive to give up unnecessary things and business affairs. Each one should do this in conformity with his state of life. (Bielecki, page 49)
When Jesus told the rich young man to give his wealth to the poor he was not thinking so much about the material advantage to the poor, as about the spiritual advantages to the man himself. In losing his living he would find his life. There would follow, says Annie Besant, 'the joyous discovery that the life thus won is won for all, not for the separated self, that the abandon ing of the separated self has meant the realizing of the Self in man, and that the resignation of the limit which alone seemed to make life possible has meant the pouring out into myriad forms, an undreamed vividness and full ness' (Besant pages 149-50).*
• Annie Besant comments on the story of the Rich Young Man: 'This text has been variously explained away, i t being obviously impossible to take it in its surface meaning, that a rich man cannot enter a post mortem state of happiness. Into that state the rich man may enter as well as the poor, and the universal practice of Christians shows that they do not for one moment believe that riches imperil their happiness after death. But if the real meaning of the Kingdom of Heaven be taken, we have the expression of a simple and direct fact. Fur the knowledge of God which is Eternal Life Gohn 1 7:3) cannot be gained till everything earthly is surrendered, cannot be learned until everything has been sacrificed. Thl• man must give up not only earthly wealth, which henceforth may only pass through his hands as steward, but he must give up his inner wealth as well, as far as he holds it as his own .1ga inst the narrow gateway. Such has ever lx>en a condition for initiation, and poverty, obediem·e, chastity, has been the vow of tlw nmdidate.' (pagt• 39)
1 52



Libra (Mark 1 0:1 -10:31)
The spiritual message of Libra, then, is not just that we should strive for harmony in our social relations. The harder, and the higher, ca11 of this si�n bids us leave everything, husband, wife, mother, father, land, business (Mark 10:29), in order that we may enter into a newer, nobler relationship with all things and a11 people. In such a relationship we participate in the world's redemption by suffering with and on behalf of others and so brin� ing into our daily waking life 'that sense of unity with others which (we) experience in the higher realms of being' (Besant, page 151). In such a rela tionship the paradox of the Gospel is realized and the spiritual reward far outweighs the material sacrifice (Mark 1 0:30). The life and work of Mahatma Gandhi (born 2 October 1869) is almost a textbook example of Libran preoccupations. He trained as a lawyer, was obsessed with matters of justice, and lived a life of such frugality that, at his death in January 1948, his possessions, which were worth no more than a few pounds, could be contained in a couple of plastic bags. Although a Hindu, he was a lover of the Gospels and this (potentially) very rich man gave everything to the poor and followed the Christ with a light heart.
The Decans of Libra
Fig. 1 9 Till' Cross



The Gospel and the Zodiac
In addition to the Libran themes of law, relationships and wealth, this sec tion of Mark's Gospel reflects the decans of the constellation Libra quite clearly. These are The Cross, The Crown, and Lupus, The Wolf or The Victim. The Cross is the Southern Cross, not visible in northern latitudes today because of the gradual shifting of the heavens. It was last seen in the horizon of Jerusalem about the time that the Gospels were written, and although neither Ptolemy nor Manilius refer to it (Ptolemy considered it part of Centaurus), Allen says that it was well known to the 'early races of mankind who 5,000 years ago could see the Cross from latitudes very much higher even than that of Italy' (page 186), and that 'the ancient Persians, who knew the Cross well, celebrated a feast by its name' (page 190). The Crown is Corona Borealis which, in Greek mythology, was the crown given to Ariadne by Dionysus. There is a possible allusion to these two constellations in Mark 10:21, where taking up the cross and 'treasure in heaven' (a 'crown of glory'?) are linked.
Fig. 20 The Crown
Matthew's parallel account does promise the apostles that they will 'sit on twelve thrones' (Matthew 19:28), which seems a little closer to the idea of a crown than Mark's version. Matthew also mentions that the apostles will judge* the twelve tribes of Israel (Matthew 19:28), reflecting the legal aspect
• Addison devoted the t OOth number of the T11tler - that of 29 November 1 709 - to ' that sign in the heaven which is called by the nanw of the Balance', and to his dn•am therof in which hl' saw the Goddess of Justice descend ing from tlw nmsh�ll.llion to rL·gul<ltl' the <1ff<1 irs of nll'n; the
1 54



Libra (Mark 10:1-10:31)
of Libra more specifically than Mark, and carrying more than a hint of tlw Egyptian goddess of justice Maat, whose task it was to judge the dead. The third decan of Libra is Lupus, the Wolf, but Seiss tells us that t lw ancient world was in some doubt as to what it represented, and that tlw Arabs used a word in connection with it which means to be slain, destroyL•d . When the young man walks away from Jesus he is said to be lupomt'IW� 'dejected', 'pained', 'grieved', ('heavy-hearted'?) - a participle of the Gn•L•k verb lupeo. Lupus is Latin, of course, but such a cross-language pun is not out of the question since Mark and his audience would be familiar with both liln guages. This may not be a veiled reference to Lupus, but it does seem r<1 t lwr an odd coincidence that one of Mark's few uses of this word (another is in 14:19) can be found so close to ideas which can readily be associated w i t h t lw other two decans of Libra.
The Three Predictions of the Passion
Mark's use of lupeo in these two separate contexts could also be a nwans of linking the two sections. The Rich Man walks away 'grieved' (Mark 10:22); at the Last Supper the apostles are said to be 'sorrowful' (Mark 1 4 : 1 9) wlwn they hear that one of their number would betray Jesus; and, using a word from the same root (perilupos) Jesus is described as 'deeply grieved' in t lw Garden of Gethsemane (Mark 14:34). What makes it likely that such an l'l:·ho ing of themes is deliberate is the fact that the decans of this whole centr,tl st•t· tion contain nine images, most, if not all, of which are taken up in the final drama of the Gospel. The table on the next page illustrates this. The three predictions of the Passion, Death, and Resurrection of Jesus are found in these three central sections of the Gospel. It is likely that Mark has placed them here because the decans of these three signs seem to poi n t us forward to the actual Passion narrative. I admit that some of the corn�spon dences seem a little strained, but most are peculiarly apt. In addition, no other decan groups contain such striking echoes of the events of Holy Wt•t•k, as a glance at Appendix 2 will show. If Mark did have some such idea in mind it may help us explain why the three very similar predictions of the Passion come so close together in the narrative.

Scorpio and Mars
The scorpion, says Seiss, 'is the most irascible and malignant insect that liws, and its poison is like itself'. Whatever the truth of this, there can be nu doubt that the zodiacal sign Scorpio has something of a corresponding repu tat ion for evil, which astrological writers throughout the ages have tended tn express in the most uncompromising terms. For example, John Gadbury, writing in 1675, tells us that the person in whom Scorpio manifests strongly will display 'falsity, arrogance, ambition, ingratitude, boasting, lyin�, lechery, perjury, revenge, (and) all manners of vice and lcwd nl•ss' (Gettings, 1972, page 96). Shakespeare's Macbeth, and lago with his ' motiveless malignity' seem to embody at least some of these cha ral'leris tics but, fortunately, in real life, such types are rare, and certa inly dn not constitute one twelfth of the human race! What Gadbury's list dcscrilws is not an individual but a series of potential manifestations of the pri mary princi ple of Scorpio: intt•nsity of emotion.

The Gospel and the Zodiac
Scorpio is a Water sign, and Water symbolizes the affectional nature, that part of us that operates more by instinct than by judgement. It represents the repository of all those unconscious urges and desires over which our con scious control is limited. If we add to this the principle of Fixity, we can see how Scorpio comes to represent these unconscious forces at their most ungovernable. It is the sign of intensity, of power, of the irra tional impulse which can be enormously creative or destructive. Scorpio symbolizes the depths, the interior caverns of the personality into which we have barely even begun to shine a light. The glyph of Scorpio ( Tn. ) 'vaguely resembles the legs and tail of the scor pion, which is essentially a creature of darkness, secretive, hiding in the shadows' (Mayo, 1 964, page 49). The glyph is also similar to that of Virgo, (ll}), with which sign it has much in common and 'with which, according to legend, it was at one time united, the sign Libra not having at that time been introduced into the zodiac' (Carter, 1965, page 78). (This may well be the reason why Virgoan themes of service are reiterated in the Scorpio section of the Gospel.) Mythologically, the sign is associated with the underworld, the place of the dead, Sheol, the tomb to which we go, and the womb from which we come. It symbolizes the profound mystery of life and death which eludes all ratiocination, and so has come to symbolize rebirth, resurrection. The ancient northern peoples celebrated their festivals of death at this time of the year, and these I inger still in Hallowe'en, and in their Christian counterparts, All Souls' Day and All Saints' Day; November, the Scorpio month is, in Catholicism, the month of the 'Holy Souls', when Catholics are encouraged to pray for the dead. It is supposedly the time when the veil between the world of the living and the world of the dead is at its thinnest. Scorpio is the polar opposite of Taurus. In Taurus (April-May) the bloom ing crops appear above ground; in Scorpio (October-November), the dying vegetation is ploughed back into the earth where it rots to produce the nutri ents in which the new seeds can take root. In Taurus, we were taught in parables; in Scorpio, we are introduced to the deeper mysteries of the kingdom of God, mysteries which are foreclosed to all who stand 'outside' . The snake is often taken as a symbol of this sign: in the Egyptian Zodiac it is represented by the huge serpent, Typhon, and in Hebrew mythology it is associated with the tribe of Dan, 'a serpent by the way, an adder in the path' (Genesis 49:16), and the constellation Serpens is one of the decans of Scorpio. The snake epitomizes the Scorpionic dimension of human life, its ability to emerge from its own skin symbolizing our own mysterious origins from the womb, our inevitable descent into death, and our potential for rl'bi rth into new life. Campbl'll says that the serpent:
1 '1H



Scorpio (Mark 10:32-10:52)
represents immortal energy and consciousness engaged in the field of time, constantly throwing off death and being born again. There is something tremendously terrifying about life when you look at it that way. And so the serpent carries in itself the sense of both the fascina tion and the terror of life. (Campbell, 1988, page 53)
To the Jews, Scorpio was also represented by the eagle, which was thou�ht to be capable of 'renewing its youth' (Psalm 1 03:5) and which 'symbul iZl'S the power within man ... to rise above the temptations of his lower naturl'' (Mayo, 1964, page 49). Scorpio writers like Robert Louis Stevenson, Allwrt Camus, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Sylvia Plath* seem particularly conn•nwd to explore ' the lower nature' of the human being, but always with tlw re.ll · ization that 'evil and darkness have to be redeemed and not simply ct•nsu n•d or legislated away' (Wright, page 1 33) . Redemption through su fh�ring personal or vicarious - is a consistent theme of Scorpio writers of both lilt•r · ature and theology. Sexuality, generation, death and regeneration are obviously part of lhi� matrix of associations, and it is interesting that the ancient world percl'iwd a connection between sexuality, power and death which it has taken deplh psychology to rediscover. In Shakespeare's time, the orgasm was cal lt•d .1 'little death', and today feminists are telling us that many sex-acts haw mon• to do with power and domination than with pleasure. Power, in fact, is a central theme of Scorpio: power to destroy, puwt•r tn recreate. Manilius tells us that:
... Scorpio's Tayl displays A double Influence from his forked Rays: For when that first appears, the peaceful Child Shall Cities raise, and be inclin'd to build; The World shall see him with his Plow surround The Place design'd, and mark the fatal Bound; Or he shall wast what others Pains did raise, Where populous Cities stood, there Beasts shall graze Or Harvest grow; he leads to these extreams, And Power, agreeing, waits upon his Beams.

11ze Gospel and the Zodiac
Even Gettings, who deplores the negative associations that have gathered round this sign, will admit that the Scorpionic type is 'essentially practical, jealous of honour, tending to be domineering . . . (who) can relate perfectly when it is a matter of leading or dominating ... (and) who can never take sec ond place' (Gettings, 1972, pages 97-8) . Such power is not always negative, of course. Surgery and medicine come under Scorpio, too, for obvious reasons. The physician, w hose symbol is the Scorpionic serpent twined round the caduceus, is the one who has power over life and death, who can restore the weak to health and give vitality to the moribund. Like Pluto, he guards the way to the underworld and lets enter whom he will. In modem astrology, the planet Pluto (�) is said to be the 'ruler' of Scorpio, but this planet was unknown to the ancient world and Mars (cf) was considered the ruler. For Ptolemy, the ' destructive and inharmonious' qualities of Mars are consistent with the fact that the two signs it rules, Aries and Scorpio, are in 'square' (90-degree) relationship with Cancer and Leo, the signs ruled, respectively, by the moon and the sun (Ptolemy, page 81). We noted the characteristics of Mars in the chapter on Aries, and these apply as much to Scorpio as they do to Aries, but the Fixed Water sign has difficulty externalizing them and so they tend to operate more covertly than in Aries. In its Scorpionic mode of expression, Mars has less of an outlet and this is symbolic of explosive power, at times as deadly as the scorpion's sting. Ptolemy also tells us that Mars rules the genitals, and that it:
assumes command of manhood for the space of fifteen years . . . He introduces severity and misery into life, and implants cares and troubles in the soul and in the body, giving it, as it were, some sense and notion of passing its prime and urging it, before it approaches its end, by labour to accomplish something among its undertakings that is worthy of note. (Ptolemy, page 81)
The Spiritual Lessons of Scorpio
Power, whether vested in many or a few, is ever grasping and, like t/ze grave, cries, 'Give, give!'
(Abigail Adams, born 11 November, 1 744)
This desire to 'accomplish something worthy of note' characterizes the chal lenge of the Scorpio phase of the spiritual life. rt is a natural human need to be first and to achieve some measure of (:elehrity for our dforls, and in the
l hO



Scorpio (Mark 1 0:32-10:52)
secular world such ambitions are lauded and encouraged. However, as this section in Mark teaches us, such things are not to play a part in our spiritual life. James and John approach Jesus, asking that he do for them whatt•ver they request. He asks what they want, and they reply:
'Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory.· (Mark 1 0 :37)
This is a clear expression of the Scorpionic reluctance to play second fid d h•, and Jesus roundly condemns it. He tells them that spiritual reward is not simply conferred, like a knighthood; it has to be earned through sufferin�. I f they wish to share his glory they have to follow his path, 'to drink from my cup and be baptized with my baptism' (Mark 10:38). The path of discipleship is not an easy one to tread. The nature of this path has been explained three times now. ThL•st• t h n·t• predictions of the Passion, Death and Resurrection (Mark 8:31 ; lJ::l0-.12; 10:32-34) are set pivotally in the Gospel, in order to emphasize till' undt•rly· ing Piscean character of the narrative as a whole. Pisces is the sign of the new age which will be characterized by the Piscean qualities of suffering and renunciation. Every human being ('son of man') has to be tried by su ffl'ring in order to share in the glory of Christ. We all have our own route to Ca l v a ry, ' the place of the skull'. Suffering and death are a condition of our h u m a n nature, part o f what Wordsworth calls 'the still, sad music o f humanity ' . l )ur mortality guarantees our suffering, and the lesson of this Gospel is th.lt Wt' must accept that this is so and go on anyway. Out of it comes new life, not necessarily a life beyond the grave, although this is not ruled out, but a m·w awareness of, and a new response to, the life we are presently living. Tlw moon, which spends three days in shadow before it emerges new onn• mort•, is a symbol of the indomitable and heroic urge of all life to renew itsl'lf in spite of the inevitability of death. At the end of Dostoyevsky's masterpiece Crime and Puni�!Jmcn l, Raskolnikov muses on his sufferings in precisely these terms:
He did not know that the new life would not be given him for nothing, that he would have to pay dearly for it, that it woul d cost him great striving and suffering. But this is the beginning of a new story - till' story of the gradual renewal of a man, the story of his gradual rt•genl'r ation, of his passing from one world into another, of his initiation into a new unknown life.
IfiI



The Gospel and tlte Zodiac
The lesson of Scorpio is that before we can ascend we have to descend, and it is significant that the Scorpio section of the Gospel takes place as Jesus and his apostles approach Jericho (Mark 10:46). Jericho is the ideal place for teaching about 'descending' and 'ascending', since it is the lowest place on earth, 825 feet below sea level. Before the ascent to Jerusalem (2,500 feet above sea level), comes the descent into Jericho. In the light of such considerations, the urge to grasp for the ephemeral and tawdry baubles of the secular world is indeed vain. Jesus has already taught us that we need to renounce our attachment to our sense of self i mportance (Leo), and to wealth (Libra), and he has advocated the virtue of self-abnegation (Virgo). In the Scorpio section, he teaches us to renounce our need for power over others. The apostles are indignant at James and John's request, presumably because they coveted seats in glory for themselves, and so Jesus calls them to him and explains:
You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them. and their high officials exercise authority over them. Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. (Mark 1 0 :42-45)
The word ' ransom' (lutron) has been taken by later Christian theology to refer to Christ's sacrificial death on the cross by which the price of men's sins is paid to God, but such an idea owes little to Mark and more to Paul, and to those Scorpionic theologians St Augustine (born 13 November, 354) and Martin Luther (born 10 November 1483) for whom a once-and-for-all transaction seemed very appealing. But, in the Gospel context, it is more likely to refer to the redemptive nature of all suffering, and to the nobility - and possibility - of suffering on behalf of someone else. Since Scorpio is related to 'shared resources' and ' inheritance' it concerns those intimate, unseen bonds by which living and dead are connected to each other, which ensure that ' no man is an island', that karma is a reality, and that the effects of our thoughts and actions extend beyond ourselves in time and in space. Our call, then, is not to personal ambition and power, but to service and to suffering which are the only means by which any kind of transformation - individual or collective - can be effected. Dane Rudhyar addresses these very themes in his chapter on Scorpio:
(The mystical way) . . . asks moreover that all forms of ambition be relin quished - and ' spiritual' ambition may be the most dangerous, withal
1 62



Scorpio (Mark 10:32-10:52)
most subtle, kind of ambition ... There should be no feeling whatsoewr of competition in one's endeavours, especially if one is part of a group of seekers or disciples. It does not matter if one appears to be first or last, for the competitive spirit is a form of violence, and there can be no violence in the soul of the true disciple on the spiritual Path. The zodi acal sign Scorpio tends to be associated with violence and competition, because the Scorpio type of person is often too emotionally and person ally involved in making of human relationships what to him or her is a 'success'. (Rudhyar, pages 75-6)
It is entirely consistent with the rest of the Gospel story that James and John should be the ones to request positions of power in the kingdom. Tlwy were nicknamed 'sons of thunder' by Jesus (Mark 3:17), and they an• tlw ones who, in Luke's Gospel, ask Jesus to command fire from heaven to con sume the inhospitable Samaritan villages (Luke 9:54). They appear to be trm• sons of Mars! We might also note that Matthew tells the story of their rcqu,•st for power rather differently from Mark: in his desire to present the apostl,•s as worthy characters, he has their mother make the request on their lwhalf (Matthew 20:20-28).
Blind Bartimaeus
Before Jesus reveals his true identity at Caesarea Philippi he cures a blind man whose perception of human nature is faulty (Mark 8:22-26). Before ' rid ing triumphantly into Jerusalem,' he performs a similar miracle. Bartim<wus is begging by the roadside outside Jericho, crying out: 'Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!' (Mark 10:47). It is significant that a man making such ,, cry is blind. His name is also significant. Bartimaeus means 'son of Timaeus', which, in Aramaic, would mean 'son of defilement', but tinu�. i n Grl'l'k, means ' honour' and Mark is obviously capitalizing upon the ambiguity. 'Son of David!' is a conventional messianic title, and the blind Bartimcaus Sl'l'S Jesus as a candidate for the role of literal Messiah, the one who will saVl' Israel from her enemies. But, as Mark will later explain (1 2:35-7), the Messiah is not a specific historical figure descended from David. The whole of this Gospel is designed to teach us that salvation does not come through military victory but through the Piscean virtue of self-sacrifice. Nor is it dl'l iVl'n·d through the agency of any one person, but achieved by all who arc prepared to take the way of the cross. Disabused of his erroneous ideas, symboliz,•d both by the regaining of his sight and by the discarding of his cloa k, ' tlw sn11 of defilement' is transformed into a ' son of honour' . Tlw lw��ar has lwconw

a disciple, and Bartimaeus is now able to move out of the depths of Scorpionic Jericho and 'follow Jesus in the way' (Mark 10:52).
Scorpio Themes in the 'Secret' Gospel of Mark
The Scorpio section of the Gospel is quite short, which is surprising when we consider that Scorpio symbolizes a number of matters - life, death, healing, initiation, regeneration - which are of great relevance to major themes of this Gospel. It could well be that something is missing from our version of Mark. Could it be sheer coincidence, then, that the letter of Clement of Alexandria (second century AD), which was discovered by Professor Morton Smith at the Monastery of Mar Saba, should mention, and quote, a passage from another version of Mark which deals explicitly with the raising up of a dead man, and which, Clement tells us, was to be found just before the words ' And James and John come to him' (Mark 10:34, i.e. the beginning of the Scorpio section)? The passage is quoted above in full (page 24). It seems authentic, reflecting many of Mark's stylistic idiosyncrasies. For example, the word 'straightway' (eutlms), a favourite of Mark's, appears twice in this short narrative, and his habit of stringing his sentences together with 'and' ... 'and' ... 'and' is clearly evident. Why some versions of the Gospel would omit it is not immediately apparent; after all, John gives an account of the raising of Lazarus Oohn 1 1), and the synoptic Gospels all mention the raising of Jairus's daughter, and so the objection cannot have been to the idea of raising someone from death. Intriguingly, Clement himself gives us a clue: at the end of the account of the young man's resurrection from death, Clement, still quoting from the 'Secret' Gospel, goes on:
And going out of the tomb they came into the house of the youth, for he was rich. And after six days Jesus told him what to do and in the evening the youth comes to him, wearing a linen cloth over his naked body. And he remained with him that night, for Jesus taught him the mysteries of the kingdom of God. And thence, arising, he returned to the other side of the Jordan. (Bamstone, page 342)
' Resurrection from death' is not to be taken literally. Within the pagan mys teries, and within Gnosticism, it was an allegory for spiritual rebirth through initiation. The young man is taught 'the mysteries of the Kingdom of God', echoing Jesus' statement to the apostles in the Taurus section of the Gospel - Taurus is the polar opposite of Scorpio - that 'the secret of the Kingdom of God has been given to you, but to thos£' on the outsidt�, l'Vl'rything is sa id in

Scorpio (Mark 1 0:32-10:52)
parables' (Mark 4:11-12). 'The other side of the Jordan', to which the youn� man repairs, is the 'Promised Land', Gnostic enlightenment. Perhaps thi!i 'initiation allegory' was considered too sacred to be seen by profane eyl'S. Perhaps, too, certain people had been misinterpreting the nakedness. Thi!i is suggested by what Clement writes next:
After these words follows the text, ' And James and John come to him', and all that section. But 'naked man with naked man', and all the othl'l' things about which you wrote, are not found. (Bamstone, page 342)
What these 'other things' might be we have no way of telling, but sinn· Clement refers earlier to the 'unspeakable teachings of the Carpocratinns' and their 'blasphemous and carnal doctrines', we can legitimately condudl· that some people saw hints of sexual activity here. It could well be, then, tiMI Mark's Gospel originally explored the themes of Scorpio more extl•nsivdy than our present version of the Gospel would suggest, but that n•rtain p.ls sages were excised to prevent their being interpreted in ways that Wl'l'l' potentially damaging to a nascent orthodoxy.
The Serpent Holder
Fig. 22 Ophiuchus
l 6!i



The Gospel and the Zodiac
One of the decans of Scorpio is Ophiuchus, The Serpent Holder,* the mythology of which seems to be reflected in this 'secret' passage of Mark. Ophiuchus is Aesculapius, the son of Apollo, and Coronis, who was famed for restoring Hippolytus to life, using blood from the side of the goddess of justice and from the Gorgon. Ovid's hymn in honour of Aesculapius brings out the Scorpionic themes of death and rebirth admirably:
Hail, great Physician of the world! All hail! Hail, mighty infant, who in years to come Shall heal the nations and defraud the tomb! Swift be thy growth! Thy triumphs unconfined! Make kingdoms thicker and increase mankind: Thy daring art shall animate the dead, And draw the thunder on Thy guilty head: For thou shalt rise, but from the dark abode Rise up victorious, and be twice a god. (Metamorphoses, Book 2, Dryden's Translation)
In the 'secret' Gospel of Mark, the Christ is the 'great physician of the world', the one who 'defrauds the tomb' and who 'animates the dead' by initiating the young man into the secrets of the Kingdom of God.
.. Ophiuchus and Serpens are always taken together in the ancient authors. Manitius says that those born when Ophiuchus, 'encircled by the serpent's great coils, rises ... will receive snakes into the folds of their flowing robes, and will exchange kisses with these poisonous mon sters and suffer no harm' (Astronomica, Book 5, lines 389-393). This seems highly reminiscent of the promise given by the resurrected Jesus in the so-called 'longer ending' of Mark, which does not appear i n the earliest manuscripts. Could this be a misplaced fragment from a more com prehensive Mark, and did it originally appear in the Scorpio section? The text reads: 'TheSt' signs will accompany believers: in my name they will cast out demons, speak in new tongues, take snakes in their hands, even if they drink deadly poison, it will not harm them, and they will plan• tlwir hands on �kk peoplt•, and t hey will gel well' (M.uk 1 6: 1 7-Hl).

barriers of convention, to move outwards and onwards in the search for wisdom and truth. Its glyph (K') expresses this perfectly: the arrow directed to the heavens, symbolizing the power of man's aspirations and the deadly earnestness of his quest. Ptolemy designated Sagittarius a 'hi-corporeal' sign, 'two-bodied', a concept that had mythological expression in the Centaur, half man, half horse, a symbol of the warfare between the spiritual and carnal aspects of the individual person. These weird creatures were almost always considered to be savage, with the exception of Aesculapius's teacher, Chiron, who was renowned for his kindness and wisdom, who gave his life to save Prometheus, and who represents the eventual triumph of the human over the bestial. What separates the human from the beast is, in part, what Sagittarius rep resents: the restless pursuit of spiritual values which constantly presents the seeker with new challenges and new journeys. Emily Dickinson (born 10 December 1830), who travelled little physically, but whose mental voyages were extensive, summed up the Sagittarian quest in this lovely poem:
This world is not conclusion. A Species stands beyond Invisible, as Music But positive, as Sound It beckons, and it baffles Philosophy, don't know And through a Riddle, at the last Sagacity, must go To guess it, puzzles scholars To gain it, Men have borne Contempt of Generations And Crucifixion, shown Faith slips - and laughs, and rallies Blushes, if any see Plucks at a twig of Evidence And asks a Vane the Way Much Gesture, from the Pulpit Strong Hallelujahs roll Narcotics cannot still the Tooth That nibbles at the soul - . . .
1 !1H



Sagittarius (Mark 1 1:1-1 1 :26)
On a less soul-nibbling level, however, Sagittarius represents acts of dcrrin� do, swashbuckling heroism, taking a chance, having a gamble, anything, i n fact, which takes the individual out o f convention's groove and gives a bit o f momentum to his life. All long 'journeys' - spiritual, religious, philosophi cal, as well as physical - are Sagittarian, so it is entirely appropriatt• that Sagittarius came to be associated with the horse, the primary means of a l l long-distance land travel in the ancient world, and Hippotcs, 'On Horseback', was one of its names among the Greeks. It is this connection with the horse that Manilius concentrates on in his description of the Sagittarian type, but he also gives us a hint of the sign's reputation for being undaunted, and for pressing onwards hecdlt•ss of danger:
The double Centaur different Tempers breeds, They break the Horse, and tame the fiery Steeds; They love the sounding Whip, the Race, the Rein, And whirl the Chariot o'er the dusty Plain: Nor is their Humour to the Fields confin'd, They range the Woods, and tame the Savage Kind.
For in the Frame, in double forms exprest, The Man is uppermost, and rules the Beast; His bow full drawn implies, his Rays impart, Strength to the Limbs, and Vigour to the Heart. Quick active Motions, full of warmth and heat, Still pressing on, unknowing to retreat. (page 1 27)
Eleanor Kirk, writing in 1894, explores the fiery nature of Sagitta rius i n the following terms:
People born in this sign have a tendency to fly all to pieces over a smal l matter, are quick to anger, but quickly over it, combative and deter mined to have their own way. As enemies Sagittarius people go to extremes ... They are unreasonable in their desire to help those they love, and zealous and over-sanguine in whatever they undertake. Tht•y arc unwilling to wait for proper times and seasons, and desire to rush through every piece of work as soon as it presenlc; itself. (Gettings 1972, page 1 62)

17te Gospel and the Zodiac
The Sagittarian phase of the spiritual life is the point at which we learn to act confidently and courageously to make our vision a reality. Blake's 'New Jerusalem' can only be created by means of the bows, arrows, spears, chariots and swords which symbolize the Sagittarian challenge to all those powers, like sloth, indifference and habit, which enslave the human spirit, and with which we are called to do battle. This requires the other Fire-sign virtue, faith, because all ventures of this kind must be undertaken without any cer tainty as to their eventual outcome. As Blake puts it in Auguries ofInnocence:
He who doubts from what he sees Will ne'er Believe, do what you Please. If the Sun & Moon should doubt, They'd immediately go out.
'The Sagittarian Higher Mind,' says Dane Rudhyar, is ' mind plus will, plus faith and vibrant openness to ever-new possibilities' (Rudhyar, page 77). The one who enables himself to become a vehicle for the Sagittarian 'Higher Mind' becomes a genuine avatar, one who can 'stimulate, mobilize or fasci nate human beings into doing what the latter would otherwise be unwilling and too inert to do'. Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter (ll.), which in classical astrology is called 'the Greater Benefic' because of its association with all things that expand the mind and which lift us out of our spiritual torpor. Ptolemy considered Jupiter to be associated with elderly age, when wisdom brings 'honour, praise, and independence' . When this planet governs the soul:
he makes his subjects magnanimous, generous, god-fearing, honourable, pleasure-loving, kind, magnificent, l iberal, just, high-minded, digni fied, minding their own business, compassionate, fond of discussion, beneficent, affectionate, with qualities of leadership. (page 447)
There is a negative side to Jupiter and to Sagittarius, however. Since they both represent the desire to expand the horizons of the human person, they have an obvious connection with religion, but all religion can lose its exploratory character and degenerate into ritualism and formalism. When it does so, the spiritual aspirations of the genuine seeker can be lost in the pseudo-spirituality of ecclesiasticism and sacerdotalism: Jupiter is as much the planet of pomp and hierarchy as it is of quest and faith.

Sagittarius (Mark 1 1:1-1 1:26)
The Spiritual Lessons of Sagittarius
This section begins with a striking and dramatic presentation of the Sagi ttari.u 1 symbol as Jesus, astride a colt, becomes the embodiment of the Centaur. ]l'SUs sends two of his disciples into the village where they are to find a colt 'on which no one has ever sat', and bring it to him. The text continues:
They went and found a colt outside in the street, ('where two roads meet' amphodon) tied at a doorway. As they untied it, some people standing there asked, What are you doing, untying that colt?' They answered as Jesus had told them to, and the people let them go. When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on it. Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut* in the fields. Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, 'Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest!' (Mark 1 1 :7-1 0)
The cry of the people, ' Hosanna', means 'Save, we pray' in Hebrt•w, but tlw salvation they seek is not the kind that Jesus will offer. Jesus brings tlw sal · vation of the wise teacher, Chiron, who d ied that Prometheus might li VI', not the bogus salvation wrought by insurrection and war. Mark has married Hebrew and Greek motifs extremely sucn•ssfu l l y i n this incident. In addition t o the image o f Chiron, he has woven into llw l1.·xt strands from Psalm 45, the Royal Wedding Song, in which the bridPgroom, with his sword upon his thigh, rides to meet his bride (verse 3). The shouts of the people echo the psalm's exhortation (verses 4-5).
In your majesty ride forth victoriously On behalf of truth, humility and righteousness; Let your right hand display awesome deeds. Let your sharp arrows pierce the heart of the king's enemies.
This psalm abounds in Sagittarian images. The principal one, of courst•, is tlw horse, but the arrow is mentioned, and even the thigh, on which the brid�.•groum wears his sword, is ruled by Sagittarius, as Manilius tells us (see Append ix 2). Mark's original readers would undoubtedly have been aware of these assol'ia tions, and they would also have made the connection between Jesus' rid1.• into Jerusalem and the passage in the prophet Zechariah, which runs:
* Curiously. a n early Chinese na mt• for S.1gittarius is S..·ih Muh, ·nw Cll'H Tn•t•, nr l\r.u11 ho·' Cui for l'in·wood ( A I It•n, pagt• 1�6).

TI1e Gospel and tile Zodiac
Rejoice greatly 0 Daughter of Zion! Shout, Daughter of Jerusalem! See, your king comes to you, righteous and having salvation, gentle and riding on a don key, on a colt, the foal of a donkey. (Zechariah 9:9)
It is interesting to note that Mark's version of Jesus' journey into Jerusalem does not refer specifically to any Old Testament passage. Instead, he lets our imagination and our memory work on the image. Matthew, however, sees this incident as a fulfilment of Zechariah's prophecy (Matthew 21:1-11), and even has Jesus ride, absurdly, on two animals ('an ass and a colt') to make sure Zechariah's words are fulfilled to the letter. It is from Matthew's fidelity to Zechariah that we get the image of Jesus riding on a donkey or ass (onos). Mark uses the word pcilos , which is much more generic, and which is always translated 'colt': it could as well be the horse of Sagittarius as the donkey of Zechariah . * We generally interpret this scene through the eyes of popular piety which has robbed it of its powerful spiritual message. We are taught that riding on a donkey shows Jesus at his most humble, but we forget that the animal Jesus rode - whether donkey or horse does not really matter - was 'one on which no one has ever sat' i.e. an unbroken animal. Jesus was riding sedately on a 'bucking bronco' ! Members of the horse family are not born as our nat ural allies. They are born wild and turbulent; they instinctively rebel against human dominance, and in order for them to be any use to us at all they have to be brought into subjection. Their natural, uncontrollable energies have to be harnessed to a will that is stronger than their own. They have to be 'broken' and when raw power is brought under the control of intelligence, a formidable alliance is formed. In such a context was born the mythological image of the centaur - half man, half horse - which married the twin qualities of intelligence and strength. And it is not too difficult to see how the centaur came to symbol ize the human being - part god, part animal; part creative intelligence, part destructive passion. The great artist Picasso was asked, toward the end of his long l ife, how he felt now that age had robbed him of his not inconsiderable physical passions. 'It's like being unchained from a wild animal,' he replied.

Clark Ltd, Edinburgh. Arndt and Gingrich, following Bauer, consider that l'ti/os simply means 'horse': 'W. Bauer has made more extensive researches ... (in which) he shows that pti/o� in Greek litl'rature from Homer down means young animal when another animal is named in its context ... but simply ' horse' (not 'colt') when no other animal is so found.

Sagittarius (Mark 1 1 :1-1 1 :26)
' Chained to a wild animal' is not a bad description of any human being in the full flush of youthful vigour; some of the animals to which we an• chained are wilder than others, but all of us must admit that there arc parts of our nature which are difficult to integrate, that we are complex, compos ite, ambiguous creatures. The eighteenth-century English poet AlexandL·r Pope describes this dual nature of the human being in his Essay on Ma11:
Plac'd on this isthmus of a middle state, A being darkly wise and rudely great;
He hangs between; in doubt to act, or rest, In doubt to deem himself a God, or Beast; In doubt his Mind or Body to prefer, Born but to die, and reas'ning but to err.
Chaos of thought and passion, all confus'd; Still by himself abus'd, or disabus'd; Created half to rise and half to fall; Great lord of all things, yet a prey to all; Sole judge of Truth, in endless Error hurl'd; The glory, jest, and riddle of the world. (from Essay on Man, by Alexander Pope, born 21 May 1 688)
No one has described the ambiguous, centaur nature of the human being better. We are all centaurs. For the most part, the centaurs were portrayed in mythology as wild and savage creatures, all the more dangerous becau!"ll' their dominant bestial power was mixed with human ingenuity; but onl' of their number, Chiron, was a friend to humans, and so great was his wisdom that many young people were entrusted to his care. Indeed, Chiron taught what he himself had accomplished: the marriage of passion with intel li gence, which produces the outstanding, heroic, undaunted, creative human being. Significantly, the apostles found the horse at a place 'where two roads meet' (verse 4). It is images such as this which will enable us to understand the spiritual meaning of Jesus' entry into jerusalem. In calmly riding an unbroken horse into the holy city, Jesus is shown to be capable of dominating the forn's of the Fire element, the animal passions. His action symbolizes tlw mastery of the bestial by the spiritual, the mastery of what we might today call t lw l'AO (or, in Freudian terms, the l d ) with its selfish cravings, by tlw powL•rf u l

forces of self-knowledge and self�ontrol . Jerusalem is the city of peace salem is the same word as 'shalom' in Hebrew and 'salaam' in Arabic - and in order for us to enter symbolically into the holy city of peace, individually and collectively, we must attain the same level of mastery over those trouble some aspects of our animal nature that Jesus is shown exercising in this
little story. And it is the objective of all spiritual practice, in whatever tradi tion it comes down to us, to attain this level of control over the wilder aspects of our na ture. The greater jihad (holy war), said Muhammad, 'is the struggle against the lower self'. In short, we should strive to become creatures of will, not of whim. As Blake realized:
To be in a Passion you Good may do, But no good if a Passion is in you.
(Auguries ofInnocence)
The Cursing of the Fig Tree and the Cleansing of the Temple
After visiting the Temple, Jesus leaves the city and spends the night in Bethany. He returns in the morning and, being hungry, looks for some fruit on a leafy fig tree. Finding none, he curses the tree with the words: 'Let no one eat fruit from you ever again!' (Mark 1 1 :13). This seems almost a spite ful, pointless act, particularly so when we consider that figs were not in sea son (verse 13). Later in the text, however, we learn the real significance of Jesus' action.* The next day they find the fig tree 'wi thered from the roots' (verse 20), and Jesus uses the whole incident to give a lesson in faith. Whoever has faith in God, believing with his whole heart, can even move a mountain into the sea (verse 23) . Hyperbole, of course, but a saying of great importance because it illustrates the power of the human mind to achieve even seemingly impossible goals. When we pray we must believe that we already have what we are praying for and it will be ours. This is much more than 'positive thinking'; it is what Dane Rudhyar (page 77) calls 'creative visualization', and it is one aim of the Sagittarian phase of the spiritual life. Its object is not to attract material success to our life: its application is princi pally to the spiritual life, operating as a kind of spiritual alchemy, by which the
vague outlines of our aspirations are transformed by prayer, meditation and spiritual exercise into solid reality. However, the lessons of the fig tree arc not exclusively concerned with the

spiritual life. The text implies that human beings can effect changes in t lw physical world; that persistent prayer involving mind, will and faith can achieve, in Tennyson's words, 'more than this world dreams of' . Such thi n k ing is anathema t o the materialistic philosophies of the contemporary world, which consider mind to be an epiphenomenon, a by-product, of matter. For Gnostics, however, consciousness is primary, and the material univcrSl' is ,, 'crystallization' of mind, the last in a long line of increasingly dense emana tions from the Divine. In such a system of thought, matter can be mad�.c• to respond to the dictates of mind. This is the basis of the magical world v it•w, which can accommodate the gardener's green fingers, the shaman's rai n
dance a n d the healing prayer with relative ease. I n cursing the fig trel' jt>sus masters those things symbolized by the Earth, and so has now dcmonstrah•d control over all four Elements.
Ara - The Altar and the Curse
The relationship between the fig tree incident and the Sagittarian d1xan, 1\ r.t, is quite striking. To the Romans the word A ra meant 'altar' and, accord i ng
to Caesius, the constellation Ara represented one of the altars raised /1_11 Most'S,
or the permanent goldtm altar i11 the Temple at Jerusalem. Some thought i t n·p··
resented the Altar erected by Noah after the Flood. Allen reckons that this association with this 'first' Altar helps to account for the prom inenn• �iVl'n to this visua11y unimportant constellation, and explains why Manili us c.t lls it Mundi Templum, 'The Temple of the World' (Allen, page 63) . B u t in ( ;n•t•k the word ara means 'curse'. Seiss writes of this constellation:
The Greeks used the word ara sometimes in the sense of prayl'r, b u t more frequently i n the sense of an imprecation, a curse, o r the �{fi·ct o(a cu rse - bane, ruin, destruction ... In Aeschylus it is the name of the at'/ual curse of Oedipus personified. (Seiss, pages 56-7; emphasis ad ded )
Seiss informs us that the constellation Ara also has association with tlw a l t<u· of sacrifice, and this links the whole incident of the fig tree with the story of the Cleansing of the Temple (Mark 11 :15-19). The Jerusalem Templl' was t l w centre of Jewish sacrificial worship, the excesses of which are a t tarkl·d hy Jesus in heroic Sagittarian fashion. He casts ou t the merchants, overtu rns tlw tables of the money-changers and the seats* of the dove-sel lers. Ht• pn•vt• n t s

people using the Temple precincts as a thoroughfare, and he declares the place a den of thieves. The Temple no longer serves any valid religious func tion. Like the fig tree whose leaves deceive by promising fruit when no fruit exists, the Temple's beauty and ostensible commitment to spiritual values are mere hypocritical sham. It is not 'a house of prayer for all nations' (note the Sagittarian expansiveness, echoing Manilius's Mundi Templum), but a commercial enterprise based on the notion that God is to be approached through the killing of animals. This incident has long proved troublesome to the conventional commen tator, for a number of reasons. The first concerns its sequence in the narrative. Matthew and Luke, following Mark, place it at the end of Jesus' ministry, just before his Passion and Death. John, on the other hand, puts it right at the beginning, just after the miracle in Cana Uohn 2:13-17). Did Jesus do it twice? Is John's placement of the incident 'purely symbolic'? For the historically minded these are not easy questions to answer, but the problem is compounded even further when we consider that Jesus would not have been able to accomplish this feat very easily: the Temple precincts were very heavily guarded, and a trouble-maker would have been whisked away at the first hint of a disturbance. The incident's most problematic aspect, however, concerns the unfamiliar side of Jesus' character that it seems to show. Did he really, as John says, take a whip to these people (John 2:15)? What happened to turning the other cheek? Could Jesus get angry? Mark makes no specific mention of anger, but Jesus' actions here are not those of a restrained and passive person. He is indeed angry, justifiably so, righteously so, as he defends the cause of real religion against the charlatans, incurring the wrath of the authorities in the process (Mark 1 1 :18), and demonstrating that the Sagittarian phase of the spiritual life demands tireless warfare against all religious cant and spiritual quackery. It is a task that Sagittarians, who seem to have almost a monopoly on satirical writing, have taken upon themselves with relish. Voltaire in
Candide, Jonathan Swift in Gulliver's Travels, Samuel Butler in Hudibras and
Tire Way of all Flesh, and the comedian Bill Hicks in numerous stand-up routines, mercilessly take the Sagittarian 'scourge' to all manifestations of irrational, divisive, cruel, myopic religion - as does Mark Twain, whose bit ing words are a fitting end to this Sagittarian chapter:*
Man is the Religious Animal. He is the only Religious Animal. He is the only animal that has the True Religion - several of them. He is the only

'So, Ananda, you must be your own lamps, be your own refuges ... Holdfinn to the truth as a lamp and a refuge and do not look for refuge to anything besides yourselves. ' (fhe Buddha)
Capricorn and Saturn
Capricorn is the sign of the winter solstice, the point of the sun's maximum southerly declination, when nights are at their longest in the northern hemi sphere. l11e sun, symbolic of individual consciousness, is now at its weakest and the forces of darkness, symbolizing the collective, predominate. This is when ' institutions freeze into systems' (Rudhyar, page 29), when the demands of society and its laws take precedence over individual initiative, and the major organizations of collective endeavour begin their task of regulation and
control. Capricorn symbolizes organizational man, the company, the state, the
team, any a rea of life in which the individual is a participating member or,

worse, a computer-generated number. Some hint of this polarity betwt•t•n the individual and the community is preserved in the ancient symbol ol Capricorn, the Goat-Fish. which is half one creature, half another, just as llw human person lives partly as an individual, partly as a member of a group. Tlw sign's glyph (\IS) supposedly resembles the horns of a goat with a curling fish tail. Dane Rudhyar (page 29) tells us that this is the phase of life in which tht• state assumes control over the individual, and in which an individual rult•r can become totally subservient to his office. Capricorn is a sign of power .md authority, but it is not the innate authority of the individual that Wl' find in Leo, but the conferred authority of the figurehead, the authority that sprin�s from the office and not from the soul. The mountain-goat, slowly but sun• footedly climbing up the steep slope is an appropriate symbol for this sign's association with the relentless pursuit of office by painstaking nsn•nl through the ranks. Capricorn's commitment to society also finds expression in tt•rms ol t lw tokens of success which, collectively, we prize. This is the stagt• of acc u m u lation, n o t as a protection against possible reversal o f fortu nt•, a s in Cann•r, but as a mark of achievement. Capricorn is the sign of the sta t u s-symho l : the private parking space, the second home. I t i s the sign o f rigid socia l divisions, o f knowing one's place. England, with its lud icrous social st r.t l ifications and its tradition o f deferential forelock-tugging, is a lw.w i l v Capricornian country, a s i s caste-ridden India. Like Cancer, i ts polar oppo site, Capricorn recognizes its debt to the past and finds solact• in tradition, order, and continuity. It is the sign of the Father, our first authority sy m hol, who connects us with the past, who embodies all the accu mula t(•d wisdom of the race, and who teaches us the great Capricornian virtues of soci.tl responsibility and self-control. Vesta (sometimes Hestia), the Roman goddess of the hearth, was con sidered to be especial ly associated with Capricorn as its ' tu telary dei ty' . Every new-born child was carried round the hearth as an initiation into tlw family, and each meal began and ended with an invocation to tht• goddt>ss. Every Roman city would have a public hearth sacred to Vesta, tended by tlw vestal virgins who had to ensure, on pain of death, that the fire nt•vt•r wPnt out. Coals from the hearth of the parent city would be carried to kind It• ,, f i n• in the hearth of any newly founded city. The hearth, then, symbolizes the family and the nation, the link bt'lwt•t•n present and past, the role of the ind ividual in tht• grea ter comm uni ty , defined ei ther spatially or temporally. That this should lx' assodatt•d w i th Capricorn serves to underlim' this sign's connection w i th lineage, centrali Zt•d au thority, convention, propriety, and social conformity.

The Gospel and the Zodiac
It shoul d not be assumed from the foregoing that these are in any sense undesirable elements of human experience. Even designating them the sym bolic products of the Night Force is in no sense meant to imply disapproval. The collective dimension of life is not an option: we are called to live it whether we like it or not, and it is as well to remember that Capricorn char acteristics, when embodied in an individual, can contribute markedly to the collective good. As Gettings says:
Capricorn may often appear rather dominating to those who do not like being controlled, but someone has to shoulder life's responsibilities ... the Capricomian gives structure to the human world - he is the force which prevents us all from being lost in mere anarchy, the great stabilizer in the world of man. (Gettings, 1972, page 1 18)
Order and stability are essential to the proper management of any aspect of our life, and this is especially true of the spiritual life which is intrinsically turbulent, and which needs the support of tradition, and the consolations of company. However, it is our relationship to these structures that the Capricomian phase calls us to examine. We need to determine how far our commitment to spiritual authority, church doctrines, charismatic figures, holy books, group membership, and the like has affected our sense of self reliance. How far have we turned over our spiritual life to the regulation of some outside agency or other so that we may be spared the problems associated with thinking for ourselves? 'The tragedy of the . . . religious life is that it fosters dependence upon an intermediary,' says Dane Rudhyar (page 78), and the challenge of Capricorn is to develop a sense of spiritual self-determination so that, whether inside or outside of a recognized group, we may relinquish our need to place others between ourselves and the divine. The ruler of Capricorn is Saturn, the furthest away from the earth of all the planets visible to the naked eye. To the ancient world, Saturn marked the boundary of our planetary system, and so came to represent all boundaries and limits, principal among these being death. Ptolemy associates this planet with old age, when a man becomes 'worn down ... dispirited, weak, easily offended, and hard to please in all situations, in keeping with the sluggish ness of his movements' (page 447). Together with the sun, Saturn represents the father and, alone, it has rulership over the bones. The skeletal system defines and maintains the structure of the body, giving it form and durability, and persisting even after the body's demise as a universal symbol of mortality and decay. In Greek mythology Saturn is Cronos, Ti me, who decrees the
I HI I



Capricorn (Mark 1 1:2 7-12:44)
limits of all things, and who stands with his scythe to announce impending death. The glyph of Saturn (TJ) resembles the scythe of Cronos. When Saturn rules the soul, says Ptolemy,
he makes his subjects lovers of the body, strong-minded, deep thinkers, austere, of a single purpose, laborious, dictatorial, ready to punish, lovers of property, avaricious, violent, amassing treasure, and jealous. (page 241)
The above gives Ptolemy's view of the Saturnian influence when Sat urn's position in the horoscope is 'dignified'! His list of epithets for an unfavourable position i s even more colourful. However, Ptolemy' s favourable list shows us quite clearly how the planet Saturn was vit•wed .1s a malign and sinister influence in the ancient world. The 'Lord of Capricorn', who crystallizes all things into form, and holds them together by forn•, is himself the symbol of their inevitable collapse. It is important to realize that the sun's entry into Capricorn in Dt•n•rnlwr marks another reversal of direction. In Cancer, the northerly sun bt•wm to move south; in Capricorn it reaches its southerly limit and begins its moVt'nll'nt northward. This was always a time of rejoicing among the ancient pt•oplt•s of the northern hemisphere, and the Romans celebrated the Sat u rnalia, named in honour of Capricorn's ruling planet, between 17 and 23 Dt•n•rnlwr. It was a time when the customary roles were reversed - masters and st•rvants changing places, for example - and when the moral conventions wt•rt• relaxed a little. The tradition survives today in the office party! On a more exalted level, this reversal 'relates to the idea of a shift in value, a turning away from the values of the outer world to those within. In one sense i t is the reawakening of the personal' (Wright, page 160). Among the Jews, Capricorn was said to be the emblem of the tribe of Naphtali, but Jacob's description - ' Naphtali is a hind let loose' (Gem•sis 49:21) - is hardly unambiguous, and some have claimed Benjamin or Reuben for Capricorn. However, there seems little doubt that the Jewish people as il whole have affinity with this sign and with its ruler, Saturn.• Charles Cartt•r writes:
• The Jewish Sabbath is Saturday - Saturn's Day. We noted t•.ulit•r that )ud.1ism w.1� hom when the equinoctial point entered the constellation Aries, and there is no doubt th<�t Arit•n imagery of rams, goats, sheep, sacrifices and ci.rcumcision play a m.1jor role in tht• l it u r�i,-.11 practices of Judaism.

The Gospel and the Zodiac
The Jews are principally under Capricorn ... and the New Testament does contain condemnations of the leaders of Jewry that certainly sound like attacks upon the traditional Capricorn - the love of high places, hypocritical formalism in religion, the desecration of holy places in pursuit of gain. (Carter 1965, page 83)
These condemnations take up a good proportion of the Capricorn section of Mark's Gospel.
The Spiritual Lessons of Capricorn
Lawyers are all right, I guess ... I mean thet;'re all right ifthet; go around saving innocent guys' lives all the time, and like that, but you don 't ·do' that kind of stuff if you 're a lawyer. All you do is make a lot of dough and play golf and play bridge and buy cars and drink Martinis and look like a hot shot. And besides. Even ifyou did go around saving guys' lives and all, how would you know ifyou did it because you really wanted to save the guys' lives, or you did it because what you really wanted to be was a terrific /moyer ... How would you know you weren 't being a phoney? 17ze trouble is, you wouldn 't. (17ze Catclzer in the Rye by J.D. Salinger, born 1 January 1919)
It is the question of spiritual authority that Mark addresses first in the Capricorn section of his Gospel. A group of 'chief priests, scribes and elders' approach Jesus and ask him by what authority (exousia) he does the things he does (Mark 11:27-28). Jesus replies with a question of his own:
'I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. John's baptism - was it from heaven, or from men? Tell me!' They discussed it among themselves and said, 'If we say, "From heaven". he will ask, "Then why didn't you believe him?" But if we say, "From men" .. .' (They feared the people, for everyone held that John really was a prophet.) (Mark 11 :29-32)
They have fallen into Jesus' trap. Since any opinion they might voice would be based on social expediency and not on any objective assessment of the
purpose, Capricorn symbolizes its operation and enforcement; leKalism, concern for the letter of the law, is, therefore, Capricomian. Similarly, while Christianity is a l'iscean religion, it also relates clearly to the other M u table signs - V irgo, Gemini and Sagittarius. Its emphasis on vir ginity and celibacy arc V irgoan, its elaborate and divisivl' lht'ology is Gt•minian (as are the Letters which wnstitute a good proportion of the Christi<�n s.-ripturl's'). and its missionary zeal and sacerdotalism <lrt' Sagi ttarian.

evidence, they are unable to answer without incriminating themselves and so they admit that the question has defeated them. Jesus' response is won derfully audacious, and provides one of the few occasions on which tlw reader is forced to smile. 'If you can't answer my question,' he says, ' I won' t tell you where my authority comes from' (Mark 12:33). It is as well for us to remember that these men are the sources of authority in Israel. They are not simply market-place debaters. The chief priests, who would almost certainly have been from the powerful and influt•nlial Sadducean party, are accompanied by those Satumian figures 'tht•. l'ldt•rs' (lloi presbuteroi), the older men, the pillars of the community, the sa�e and venerable counsellors of the people. Also present are some scribes, le�.1l experts who were generally associated with the Pharisees, who could quoh• the Law of Moses verbatim, and who could cite precedent and precept on ,,JI matters pertaining to religious affairs. Jesus' handling of his interro�atinn .1t their hands shows his contempt for their supposed wisdom, and for lilt' whole system of spiritual authority on which their combined status as tt.•adwrs of the people is based. The next passage, the Parable of the Tenants (Mark 12:1-1 2), is a bl isll'ri ng attack upon all the leaders of Israel, past and present, who have consistt.•ntly maltreated or killed God's messengers. These are the wicked 'husbandnwn' (J{eorgoi) of Israel, the ones to whom God has entrusted his vim•yard, but who, by their treachery, have forfeited the right to exercise any aut hority in spiritual matters (Mark 12:9-11). Hard on the heels of this collective denunciation comes a series of encoun ters with the various separate groups of mentors within Judaism, tlw first of which involves the Pharisees and the Herodians. It is historically Vl'ry unlikely that these two parties would be united on any issue, but it is tlwir mutual animosity that Mark exploits as they frame a question for Jesus which, however he might answer it, would be sure to alienate one group or the other. 'Should we pay tribute to Caesar?' they ask (Mark 1 2: 1 5). Tlw I k•rodians, so named because they supported the puppet regime set up by tlw J{omans, would want to hear an affirmative answer. The Phariset.--s, fi£'n:dy conscious of Israel's unique status as God's people, and opposed to [{oman authority, would want to hear him say 'No'. Jesus' reply surprises tlwm both: 'Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and give to God what belongs to God' (Mark 12:17). ll1is simple little saying expresses concisely what the Christian attitude to authority should be: where it makes legitimate demands we should obt.•y, but we must not assume that our civic duties and our spiritual d u lit'S <ll'l' till' same thing. ll1ere is the dear implication, too, that our duty to God is mort.• i m portant than our du ty to systt.•ms, be thest.• Sl'cu lar or rt.•l igious.

It is worth noting that a denarius minted in Spain during the reign of Augustus actually displayed an image of Capricorn on the reverse side. MacNeice tells us:
The young Augustus, though a hard-headed and calculating person, was so impressed by the glorious future foretold for him (by an astrologer named Theagenes) that he published his horoscope and struck a silver coin stamped with Capricorn, the sign under which he was born.* (MacNeice, page 122)
Fig. 23 Roman Coin showing Augustus and Capricorn
Although Augustus was dead when Mark was writing it is possible that the text here alludes to an image of imperial power with which his earliest read ers would have been familiar. After all, coins do not go out of circulation upon the death of the monarch whose likeness they bear.t Some Sadducees bring the next question. These were the aristocratic, priestly party within J udaism, distinguished theologically from the Pharisees by their disbelief in resurrection. They held that the Pentateuch alone ('the Book of Moses', 12:26) was authoritatively from God, and any doctrine which could not be clearly found therein was not to be believed. Since there is no unambiguous reference to an afterlife in these five books, they rejected the notion of physical resurrection. Their question to Jesus con cerns seven brothers who were married successively to the same woman. Although unusual, this would have been hypothetically possible, since under the law of levirate marriage, a man was obliged to marry his sister-in

law in order to raise up children in his dead brother's name. In the resurnoc tion, the Sadducees ask, whose wife this woman would be? (Mark 12:2.1) . Jesus tells them that she won't be the wife of any of them because, in the n•s urrection, marriage does not exist and men and women will be ' lik(• tlw angels in heaven' (Mark 12:25). However, it is Jesus' reasoning, rather thiln his answer, which is interesting from our point of view. He argues:
'Now about the dead rising - have you not read in the book of Moses. In the account of the bush, how God said to him, "I am the God of Abraham. the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?" He is not the God of the dead, but of the liv ing. You are badly mistaken!' (Mark 1 2:26-7)
Here Jesus is shown arguing on the Sadducees' own terms, demonstraliny, how a text from the very books that they considered to be inspired could lw used to refute the position they were defending. This is an attack upon ,,IJ bibliolatry in whatever guise it may appear. Except perhaps for insurann· policies, there are no unambiguous documents. We bring our prejud ices .md our background to everything we read, and differences of opinion owr meaning are inevitable. The warring sects of Christendom are su fficit•nt proof that this is so. In pointing out the faulty exegesis of the Sadduccl� (hv means, we might add, of a very specious argument on his part), Jesus is not advocating that they go back and study the text more carefully, as is gent•r ally supposed: he is demonstrating to them the futility of all argumentation based on personal interpretations of sacred texts. Our religious lifl• must never be entirely focused on any book, no matter how exalted the claims made for its origin. Scriptures may inspire us, and they may educate us; they may point us in the direction we must follow but they must never be allowed to usurp our sense of self-determination, which relies on the intt'r nal light and not the external text. Jesus continues his parody of scripturalism a little later in this section when he refutes the notion that the Messiah was to be a 'son of David'. Quoting from Psalm 110, he asks:
How is it that the teachers of the law say that the Christ is the son of David? David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: 'The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.· David himself calls him 'Lord'. How then can he be his son? (Mark 1 2 :367)
Again, specious reasoning, designed, I am sure, to raise a chuckle. l lere the text of Mark is itself delightfully ambiguous: are we meant to infl•r that
the Messiah was nof to be a son of David; or are Wl' meant to ded un• that,

given enough time and a sharp enough wit, we can prove anything we like from scripture? I leave the reader to judge. The Sufis tell an illuminating and h umorous story which suggests a more liberal attitude to scripture than that of the literalists. A preacher, renowned for his wisdom, drew large crowds wherever he went. At the end of his ser mons he would often be asked the secret of his great wisdom. He always replied, 'I am wise because I know what is in the Koran.' One day, a ques tioner decided to probe further: 'Tell us, then. Just what is in the Koran?' 'In the Koran,' replied the preacher, 'there are two pressed flowers and a letter from my friend Abdullah.' Received texts can only be useful to us when they are examined in conjunction with our experience of living. Isolate a text from life, extol it as inerrant revelation, and it becomes a tyrant. Sandwiched between these two scripture lessons is an encounter with a scribe whose faith Jesus commends. This man, in a spirit of genuine enquiry, asks Jesus which commandment is the most important. In reply, Jesus quotes the Shema, the prayer derived from Deuteronomy 6 that is central to all Judaism, and which runs:
'The most important one," answered Jesus, 'is this: "Hear, 0 Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength." The second is this: "Love your neighbour as yourself." There is no commandment greater than these.' (Mark 1 2 :29-3 1 )
The scribe accepts what Jesus says, and his integrity i s rewarded with the words, 'You are not far from the kingdom of God' (Mark 12:34). This passage illustrates the fact that Jesus does not condemn all Jewish leaders. It clearly implies that there were some, of whom this man was a representative, who accepted and practised the essential core of Judaism and who were unaffected by factionalism and casuistic squabbling. This section of the Gospel ends with Jesus contrasting the spiritual vacu ousness of certain scribes who parade their pseudo-piety for all to see, with the humble actions of a poor widow who puts all she has into the Temple treasury. The status-conscious scribes, who scrabble for the best seats in the synagogue (Mark 12:39), reflect everything that is reprehensible about Capricorn. Real religion, we learn, is not about putting on a display, but about the simple acts of generosity which are motivated by love. Matthew's condemnation of the Pharisees is much longer than Mark's, comprising the whole of chapter 23. It is the most comprehensive and uncompromising attack upon hypocrisy anywhere in the Christian scrip tures, bu t we must be very careful not to assume that it is directed only at a particular set of people living at a particular time. Pharisa ism is cndL•mic to

the human condition. The 'whited sepulchres' of Jesus' time are just t l w ' phoneys' o f our own. In the passage from Matthew 23 which parallels the Markan section, }L•sus denounces the Pharisees' clamouring for exalted titles with the words:
But you are not to be called 'Rabbi', for you have only one Master and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth 'father', for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called 'teacher', for you have ono Teacher, the Christ. (Matthew 23:8- 1 0)
This seems l ike a strange saying to J ud aeo-Christian ears; after a l l, }l'Ws !'.Ill their ministers ' Rabbi', and Catholics call their priest 'Father', but it is pt•r fectly comprehensible to adherents of less authoritarian religious sysh·ms. The Zen Buddhist master Dae Kwang, for instance, said, 'If you nwl'l tht· Buddha on the road, kill him. If you meet the Patriarch, kill tlw Pa t ri.ud t . ' What he means by this i s that nothing - books, gurus, traditions - shou ld ht• allowed to usurp the individual's responsibility for his or her own l'll l i�h t enment. The Buddha, who described himself as merely a fingL'r poi n t i n� .11 the moon, says:
It is proper ... to doubt ... to be uncertain ... Do not go upon wl1.1 t h.1s been acquired by repeated hearing; nor upon tradition; nor u pon rumour; nor upon what is in scripture; nor upon the considt•r.1 t ion, 'The monk is our teacher' .

[Likewise) when you you rselws know : 'These things are good; [when] undertaken and observed, these t h i n�s lead to benefit and happiness', enter on and abide in them. ( Novak, page 62)

And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, 'Speak to us of Children.' And he said: 'Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself. They come through you but not from you, And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you. You may give them your love but not your thoughts. For they have their own thoughts. You may house their bodies but not their souls, For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams. You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you. For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday. You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth. The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far. Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness; For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.'

the rest of the stanza - 'Then peace will guide the planets, and love will steer the stars' - is more an expression of naive sixties optimism than a faithful account of esoteric tradition. If the writers had investigated this tradition they would have found that the 'dawning' of the Age of Aquarius would be anything but tranquil, harmonious and loving. As we shall see, one of the documents they could have consulted was Mark's Gospel. 'Capricorn and Aquarius,' says Ptolemy, ' ... are cold and wintry, ... and their diametrical aspect is not consistent with beneficence' (page 81 ). By 'dia metrical aspect' he means their opposition to the signs Cancer and Leo in which the power of the sun is at i ts strongest. Cancer, though ruled by the moon, is the sign of the summer solstice, when the sun reaches its highest point in the sky; Leo, ruled by the sun, symbolizes the glory of the individ ual, the consciousness of selfhood, and personal uniqueness. Capricorn and Aquarius, on the other hand, are both ruled by Saturn, the planet which 'occupies the orbit highest and farthest from the luminaries', and in w hose nature 'cold prevails'. 'Cold' and 'darkness' symbolize the collective; the light of self-hood is all but extinguished, and we are more conscious of our group orientation. Winter is the time of huddling together for warmth, of relying on our fellows to provide protection against predators, of sharing what we have to ensure the welfare of the community. Today, we have all but lost an awareness of these things and they survive, in somewhat mangled form, only in our celebration of Christmas at the time of the winter solstice. But, to our ancestors they would have been real indeed, and the symbolism of light and dark would have had much more meaning for them than it possibly can for us with our central heating and electric lights. In the story of Samson's first haircut Oudges 16:17-19), the Jewish scrip tures present us with a delightful poetic account of the sun's weakness when it is placed in the sign of Aquarius. The name Samson (see 'The Forgotten Language of the Stars'), comes from the Hebrew word shemesh, which means 'sun', and so his name is equivalent to our 'Sonny'. His nemesis is Delilah, whose name comes from the Hebrew word deliy, which means 'water-bucket'. Delilnh is Aqunrius, in which the sun loses its strength, n process symbolized by the clipping of Samson's locks (the sun's rays). For Ptolemy, Capricorn and Aquarius lacked 'beneficence', then, not because people born under these signs were without benevolence, but because the signs themselves represent the bleakness and blackness of winter, when life was hard and dangers were many. Such hardship, however, makes us conscious of our vulnerability, of our need for others, of our responsibil ities within the groups to which we belong: as our sense of individuality di minishes, our sense of communa l responsibil i ty i ncn•dst•s.

Aquarius (Mark 13:1 -14:16)
In Capricorn, this manifested as authority, as the power of the stiltl' to subjugate and regulate the rights of the individual. In Aquarius, howt•vt•r, group-consciousness is expressed as co-operation among free ind ividtiitlr; who have sublimated the demands of the ego in order to facilitate the hi�h est good of the greatest number. Aquarius is the Fixed Air sign, and although fixity reflects something of its Satumian inflexibility, Air is llw medium of ideas, of debate, of intellectual exploration. Conseqm•ntly, Aquarius has come to be associated with the democratic spirit, with free pnr ticipation by equals in the governing process. The au tocracy and palri.urhy expressed by Capricorn has yielded to the egalitarianism of Aqu.1 ri u�. reflected no doubt in the curious fact that many of the twentieth n·nturv's most prominent feminist thinkers have been born under Aquarius.• At its best, Aquarius symbolizes the ideal society, in whkh tlw propt•r balance between the rights of the individual and the rights of tlw �roup i!i established and maintained. People in whom the Aquarian vision st•t•ms most evident are socially committed, concerned for the welfare of tlw w i dt·r community. Manilius claims that Aquarius, when rising in tht• ""�' ,, , tlw time of birth, signifies a model citizen:
The Good, the Pious, and the just are born When first Aquarius pours out his Urn. (page 137)
Such sentiments are echoed in more modern delineations of tht• Aqu. ui.m type. Charles Carter, writing in 1925, has this to say:
. . . there is nearly always much kindness, sympathy, and refincnwnt, together with an intense love for the feeling of kinship with w ild nature. There is generally artistic ability. The love of friends is vt•ry marked, and the native is attracted to societies, clubs, associ<�t ions. groups of people, and ' movements' of all sorts, easily merging his own personality in 'causes' . (Carter, 1925, page 8)
This easy merging with the group reflects the lack of commitment to a pos st•ssive individualism which also gives rise to that other Aquarian qu,l l i ty, ,k•tachment. This has led to an association of this sign with scienn•, with t lw mol objectivity of the observer who is prepared to go w herever the l'vidl'tll't'

leads. Manilius credits Aquarius with inventiveness, particularly with regard to aquatic machines; he also tells us that:
To his Births the World oblig'd shall owe Spheres, Cycles, Oms, and turn new Skies below. (page 128)
This is a picture of the astronomer complete with the accoutrements of his vocation, observing and mapping the cycles of the heavens and interpreting their meaning for us who live beneath the skies. Here is the true ' Water Bearer', then, who patiently gleans wisdom from heaven and earth and who pours it out for all humanity to share in and to benefit from. He is the one who lives a life dedicated to bringing refreshment to all, the selfless one who contributes unstintingly to the public good, and who embodies and fosters the ideals of brotherhood and equality. These are noble ideals and, as we mentioned above, many people think that they will characterize the Age of Aquarius, on the threshold of which we now stand. But there is nothing automatic about these things. We may be experiencing a new awareness of our inter-relatedness, but the experience has to be appropriated, individually and collectively, if it is to become any thing more than just sentimental longing for justice and equity. In order to become vehicles for the transformation of society, we have first to transform ourselves: we cannot pour out what we don't possess. Such transformation is the goal of the spiritual life in toto, but it has particular application in the Aquarius phase where we are called to assess our contribution to the collec tive and, more importantly, our willingness to offer it. So drastic is the change implied here that it cannot be achieved without turmoil. As Liz Greene tells us, before we can experience brotherhood we must:
first go through the long and bloody process of discovering why we have never been able to experience brotherhood. No individual becomes conscious of himself instantaneously and without suffering, and no collective does either. If something must die, then it's going to raise a hell of a fuss in the process, and if something is being born, it's going to cause pain to the thing giving it birth ... It may be that Aquarius will bring us the awareness that we are indeed part of a vast interconnected life entity, both biologically and psychologically. But the awareness is going to force up everything in us which obstructs us from living our vision. (Greene, pages 1 72-3)

Aquarius (Mark 13:1-14:1 6)
The trauma produced by radically changing the focus of our life is l'vidt•n whenever there is a change of human consciousness, as symbolized by th, concept of astrological ages (see 'The Forgotten Language of thl• Still's' ) Whenever the equinoctial point moves from one constellation to anot lwr w' are collectively obliged to come to terms with the principles embodied in l h• new constellation. This inevitably means radically breaking with lht• past. . process which can never occur painlessly. This applies to the ending of .11 1 1 cycle o f human life, including the tiny cycles o f an individual t•xish'lll'l': t lu new can only be accepted if the old is allowed to die. But Aquarius, th• penultimate sign, does not symbolize the end of a cycle. I t reall y si�nil it·� openness to the end, preparedness for it, willingness to accept l hl• pc1 in t h,, the end will involve. These ideas are reflected in the Saturnian rulership of Aquarius. In t lu last chapter we noted how Saturn ('F:J) symbolized structure and ordl'r ,. . ,d how this was in keeping with its rulership of Capricorn. But Sat u rn iN a l s• the planet of decay and death, and there is a certain appropria tt••wss in i h ruling two signs together. Like Janus, i t seems t o face both w.ly N : i n Capricorn it represents the building u p o f structures; i n Aquarius, i t rt>p· resents their dissolution. In modem astrology, this aspect of Aq uari w; ha� been appropriated by Uranus ( W ), the planet of violent di sru ption 111 I radical change, whose existence was unknown to the ancient world, but whose principle seems to have been associated with Aquarius from tlw earliest times.* Together, Saturn and Uranus are said to rule Aquari us, tlw tlllt' signifying gradual erosion, the other sudden and unexpected dt$lrudion. In the Greek myths Saturn is the child of Uranus, but he cwntua lly l'al s his own children an d castrates his father. A s Cronos, o r Time, Sat u rn dm•s indeed 'eat' his children, and as the symbol of structure and ordt•r lw fnas trates the chaos and creativity symbolized by Uranus. The tension between structure and anarchy which Aquarius sym bo l i ws l'an be detected in the work of Aquarian writers, who often seem to be bn•.lk ing the stylistic conventions.

The Spiritual Lessons of Aquarius
0 wonder, How many goodly creatures are there ltere! How beauteous mankind is. 0 brave new world That l1as such people in 't!
(Miranda in Shakespeare's The Tempt•st, Act 5, Scene 1 )
Chapter 1 3 of Mark presents more difficulties to the commentator than .my other passage in the Gospel. To begin with, the whole chapter takt•s tlw form of a single discourse, familiar enough to the reader of John's Cos�wl. but completely different from anything previously encounten•d in M .u k . In addition there seems, at first sight, t o b e a change of emphasis. No longer is the kingdom of God seen simply as an interior state, grow i ng within the individual like the mustard seed (Mark 4:30-32); instead, a msmk d imension is introduced and the son of man, hitherto si m ply ' man', becomes a celestial, apocalyptic figure who, at the appointed t i nw, will make his presence felt upon the earth. There are many statements w h ich appear to be prophecies of some future time, and these have fueiiL•d m i l lenarian expectation throughou t the centuries. In fact this chaptl•r in MMk, along with the corresponding chapters in Matthew (chapter 24) and l .u kt• (chapter 21), the Book of Revelation and the Book of Daniel, all notoriously difficult to interpret, seem to be the basic textbooks of contemporary sed.� ri anism. Many people w ithin mainstream Christianity, too, consider t h,\ t t hese particular parts of the Bible provide us with a timetabiL' of t•vt•nts lt�ad ing up to the battle of Armageddon and the end of the worl d . Wlwn President Reagan announced, way before Perestroika, that Russia was t ht• ' t•vil empire' and that the biblical signs of the end seemed to bL• e v i d t• n t , ht• sl'nt a chil l down every liberal spine in the western world. Evt•n St Augustine believed in a literal, visible 'second coming' of Chri st , and lw used his belief to counter the arguments of those who held tha t t lw t•art h was round: it couldn't be, he said, because a returning Jesus would not lw v isible to those ' u nderneath' .

happen' and we can see why it is futile to interpret these verses as literal prophecies. Literalism, in fact, inhibits any meaningful analysis of this chapter. Taking each verse and declaring it a 'scripture', one piece of God's great revelatory jigsaw puzzle, misses the point of the whole. We can only get some idea of the author's purpose if we allow his poetic images to work on us, and if we try to understand the sources of that imagery and the part that it plays in the complete sweep of the Gospel's narrative. However, since the Jerusalem Temple was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE it is possible that at least the first part of chapter 13 (1-23) reflects the situation immediately preceding this event, and that the warnings in these verses and the mention of the 'abomination which causes desolation' (thought by scholars to be the Roman standards in the Temple precincts) refer to actual historical incidents, in addition to any other reference they may have. Whatever the truth of this, there is no doubt that Mark has put it in the right place because, while the imagery is apocalyptic, and therefore conventionally Jewish, it is woven together with zodiacal references which are entirely Aquarian. The Jewish ideas spring from the concept of the 'Day of the Lord', a time in the future when God would intervene dramatically in world history and act as champion of Israel. Whenever this is referred to in the Old Testament the imagery is invariably cosmic, catastrophic, and bloody. Joel's description (quoted in 'The Forgotten Language of the Stars') is a classic example of this kind of writing. For the Jewish people, history was divided into two periods: a time of anguish and strife, followed by a time of peace when Isaiah's vision would become a reality:
They will beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war any more. (Isaiah 2:4)
The point of division between these two periods would be the 'Day of the Lord', the approach of which would be signalled by a variety of disasters, and by the coming of the Messiah. Mark's Gospel reflects this notion faithfully. Before the 'end' occurs we are told that:
... in those days, following that distress, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky and the heavenly bodies will be shaken. (Mark 1 3:24-5)

Mixed with this conventional Jewish imagery, however, are astrological concepts which involve not one time of cosmic upheaval, but a series. At� t•xplained in 'The Forgotten Language of the Stars', the ancient world believed that when the equinoctial point moved from one constellation of the zodiac to another, a new age was born.

of thinking was not foreign to the Jews. Mark was living at a time when the equinox was about to move from Aries to Pisces, from the Ram to the Fish, with all the attendant calamities that such a dramatic change in human con sciousness was expected to bring. So Mark is w riting about the end of the age (of Aries), and the approaching end of the individual's spiritual cycle, in terms drawn from Jewish apocalyptic writing which was the conventional way of describing catastrophic upheavals. But there are astrological images too, and, for some reason we find, yet again, that the zodiacal motifs are less clear in Mark than in Matthew. In verse 26 Mark writes:
At that time men will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.
Clouds, of course, are ' water-bearers' (!) but the parallel passage in Matthew is even more explicitly Aquarian:
At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will moum . They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory. (Matthew 24:30)
A little earlier Ma tthew reports that the question which prompts this whole discourse is, 'Tell us, when will these things be, what will be the sign of your coming (parousia, literally 'presence'), and the completion of the age?' The A uthorized Version transla tes this last phrase ' the end of the world', but the Greek word is the genitive form of aion which means ' a space o f time . . . a lifetime, generation, period o f history, a n indefinitely long period, an age' (Abbot-Smith, page 15). There is more than a hint here of the end of one astrological age and the beginning of another. That the new age referred to is Aquarius is confirmed a little further on in the text, where we read:
For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west. so will be the coming of the Son of Man. (Matthew 24:27)
This little simile captures the very glyph of Aquarius (m), the twin flashes of
to an unknown country . His experience is representative of all new beginnings, when we are called to proceed ' in fa ith' to an unknown future with no certainties and few landmarks. It is the ram of Aries that Abraham finds in l lll' thkkel .1s he prepa res to sacrifict• Isaac (Gt•nesis 22:bH . ) .

lightning.* The reference to the 'sign of the Son of Man in heaven' (versl' 111) confinns the Aquarian signature on this whole section. Aquarius is tlw only 'sign of the man' in the zodiac, and whenever we have encountert�d ' tlw man' in this kind of symbolic context it has invariably been associated w i t h the three other Fixed signs o f the zodiac: Taurus, Leo , and Scorpio. This qua· ternity appears in the Book of Ezekiel (1:10) as the 'four living crea tures' i n the prophet's vision, and i n the Book o f Revelation a s the four beasts around the throne of God (Revelation 4:7). They are the lion, the calf, the man .md the eagle: Leo, Taurus, Aquarius and Scorpio. This part of Matthew's Gospel seems to point towards our own day, t lw ' dawning' of the Age of Aquarius, when the old structures would bt• torn down and a new order would arise from the smoking ashes. W.B. Yt•a ts, w ho was well versed in esoteric lore, describes the birth of the new agl' in h b poem Th e Second Coming. It i s a time when ' things fall apart' a n d ' tlw n•n tn• cannot hold'; when 'mere anarchy is loosed upon the world'. And the imil�t· from the spirih1s mundi which will accompany these events is that of a lwilst 'with lion body and the head of man', Aquarius and its polar opposih• si�n Leo, the two signs which will characterize the new epoch. Peter Lt•mesuru·r has written about these Matthaean symbols in the following, rathl•r colour ful, terms:
And as he (Uranus) brandished his new-found powers, flexed his cos mic muscles, she, the Earth-Mother, would suffer violent convulsions. The planet would be sent reeling by disturbances in deep span:•. Tht'l"l' would be planetary collisions - a comet, or worse. Earthquakes would follow. Volcanic dust would hood the moon and tum the sun to blood . Famine and pestilence would stalk the lands. Wars would rage. Tlw very survival of life on earth would be threatened. Such wou ld bt.• the birth-pangs of the new age, the advent of the long-awaited sky kingdom. And then, in the aftermath of the twilight of the gods, t lw promised new dawn. The coming of the Son of Man. The birth of Aquarius. (Lemesurier, page 40)

Tile Gospel and the Zodiac
But the turmoil and chaos of our own turbulent time of transition from Pisces to Aquarius - perfectly predictable on the basis of the ancient theory of Astrological Ages - echoes the time of transition from Aries to Pisces dur ing which the Gospels were written. The age of the Fish is beginning; the age of the Ram - symbolized by the Temple in Jerusalem - is ending, and the old order will resist so strongly that the universe itself will reflect the tension between new and old (Mark 13:7-8). When these things will occur, no one knows, but Jesus' followers are called upon to hold out to the end (Mark 13:13), to look for the signs (Mark 13:28-31). One thing is certain: 'this genera tion will not pass away until all these things have happened' (verse 30), i.e. the time of transition will take place within the lifetime of people then alive.
The Decans of Aquarius
Pegasus and Cygnus, two of the decans of Aquarius, seem to be reflected in this apocalyptic chapter of Mark, since both are concerned with the sky. Pegasus, the Winged Horse, whose name probably derives from the Greek pegai, the Springs of the Ocean, was the steed of Bellerophon, and eventually became the Thundering Horse of Jove that carried the divine lightning. Seiss sees a different derivation for the name, and once again the names of some of the stars in the constellation seem so astonishingly appropriate to this chap ter of Mark that, despite the fact that Allen would consider their etymology dubious, they are worth mentioning here:
The first part of his or his rider's name, Pega, Peka, or Pecha, in the Noetic dialects means 'the chief'; and the latter part, sus, means, not
only 'a horse', but swiftly coming or returning with the idea of joy bringing; hence the chief, comingforth again in great victory, and witlt good tidings and blessing to those to whom he comes. The ancient names of the
stars which make up this constellation are - Markab, the returning, Scheat, lie who goeth and returnetlt (Pages 76-7, emphasis added)
Of the third Aquarian decan, Cygnus, the Swan, Fleming writes:
Cygnus was called Tesark, meaning 17tis from Afar ... Its name in both Greek and Latin means Circling and Returning. The brightest star is Deneb 17te Lord Comes ... This star is also called Arided, which means He Slrall Come Down . . . The two stars in the tail, Azel and Fafage, have names meaning Who Returns Quickly and Slrining Forti!. (Fleming, page 84, emphasis added)

Aquarius (Mark 13:1-14:16)
(The first Aquarian decan is Piscis Australis, the Southern Fish, whose prin cipal star is Fonnalhau t, the Fish's Mouth, which we mentioned in connection with Matthew 1 7:24-27 in the Leo chapter.) If the author of the original Gospel was familiar with this kind of star lun•, and it seems to me very likely that he was, then we have some understand ing of why he chose to weave the Aquarian section of his Gospel around tlw imagery of a returning saviour. To consider the ' returning saviour' motif ilS a poetic image used to describe the shifting of the Ages is to speculate, of course, but it does seem truer to what we know of history and astronomy than St Augustine's expectation of a visible Jesus appearing in glory at tlw end of time.
Awakening
There is also the likelihood of a personal spiritual dimension to this stran).;t.' and complex chapter, i.e. that elements of it describe the 'awakening' of thP individual seeker as he nears the end of his zodiacal journey. This could wl'll be the reason for the enigmatic words in verse 14, ' let the reader undt.•r stand'. On this reading, the Temple's destruction symbolizes the colla pse ol order, convention and tradition which the spiritual seeker had encountt•n•d in the Capricorn phase of his journey. Saturn, the builder of structurt•s, haH given way to Saturn the Destroyer. In purely psychological tenns Saturn in destructive mode is the 'abomination that causes desolation'. Just as Saturn castrated his father Uranus, and devoured his own children, so ' Brotht.•r will ht'lray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel ag.1inst their parents, and have them put to death' (Mark 13:12). Now is the tirnt.• when the Christ-like individual, the one who has attained spiritual illu mina tion, who has received the kingdom of God, offers his gifts to the communit y . They will not be received gladly. H e can expect to encounter those who would try to deceive him with false claims about their own enlightt•nnwnt ( Mark 13:5-6), and he can expect to be treated with contempt by rl'liginus .md civil authorities, and even by his own family (Mark 1 3:9-13). But, as lw must constantly be aware, the spiritual life is God-ordained, and God's power will sustain him in the face of every adversity (Mark 13:11, 20). The cosmic i magery is appropriate to a section on individual illumination because, as all t i ll' spiritual traditions remind us, the awakening of any person is a cosmk t•wnt. And when it comes, it turns our interior universe upside down; it shatters our world view; the sun, moon and stars of our interior span• comt.• t u mbling from their orbits; our certainties arc destroyed, our petty aims and l'x pectations are totally tmnsformcd. The world can nt.•ver he the samt.• 11gain.

What is called the kingdom of God in the Christian tradition, the Tibetan Buddhists call Rigpa. Of the moment when Rigpa is revealed, Dudjom Rinpoche says:
That moment is like taking a hood off your head . . . everything opens, expands, becomes crisp, clear, brimming with life, vivid with wonder and freshness. It is as if the roof of your mind were flying off . . . All lim itations dissolve and fall away . . . as if a seal were broken open. (Dudjom Rinpoche, pages 157-8)
When the Buddha attained enlightenment (we read in the Buddhist scrip tures) ' the earth itself shuddered as if drunk with bliss and no one anywhere was angry, ill or sad; no one did evil, none was proud, the world became quite quiet as though it had received full perfection' (Rinpoche, page 56). It is the consistent testimony of the world's religions that one person's trans formation transforms the universe. The realization of the kingdom of God does not just affect the one who realizes it; its influences spread like the ripples on a pool. What is the nature of this interior transformation? How will I know when it has arrived ? It may come suddenly, like the blinding flash that struck Paul from his horse on the Damascus road, bu t more often it steals upon us gradually. However it occurs, it leaves the individual with a quali tatively different view of the universe from the one he or she previously entertained. The Hindu sage, Patanjali expresses it thus:
. . . all your thoughts break their bonds; Your mind transcends limitations, Your consciousness expands in every direction, And you find yourself in a new, great And wonderful world. Dormant forces, faculties and talents Become alive, and you discover yourself To be a greater person by far Than you ever dreamed Yourself to be. (Dyer, page 1 7)
The Aquarian themes continue into chapter 1 4 with two incidents concerning
jars. The first is of the woman who pours out the precious oin tment on to
Jesus' head (Mark 1 4: 1 -9). Th is is an imagl' of the Christ- l i ke ind i v idual who

Aquarius (Mark 13:1 -14:16)
offers to another the healing balm of her own transformation in an act of sympathy and love which is considered even more important than helpin� the poor materially. In John's version of this story Gohn 12:1-8) the woman, named as Mary, Lazarus's sister, anoints Jesus' feet with the ointment. Till' feet are ruled by Pisces and it could well be that, originally, this narratiVl' contained a deliberate fusing of Aquarian and Piscean elements, to link tlw two final sections of the Gospel story. The second is of the Water-Bearer himself (Mark 14:12-16), the enlightenl'd, generous and androgynous* one, the 'individual who, aware of himself and his relations to his fellows, participates consciously in the corporate lifl' of the race', and who pours out ' the Water of Life in the form of knowledge and revelation of truth' (Reid, page 92). He is the one whom we must all follow into the final act of the drama.

Pisces (Mark 14:17-16:8) The End and the Beginning
As long as you do not knaw How to die and come to life again, You are but a sorry traveller On this dark earth.
(Goethe)
Pisces and Jupiter
With Pisces we come to the end of our zodiacal walk. The sun, which began its journey through the heavens at the vernal equinox, now enters its final thirty-day phase before it re-enters Aries and the whole cycle begins once more. Pisces is at the end of the cycle, and so has come to symbolize all end ings; but it does not symbolize finality. As one cycle ends, another begins: the death of one is the birth of the other. Pisces and Aries are complementary aspects of the universally observed phenomenon of darkness, decay and death leading to light, growth and life. 'lf Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?' sang Shelley, expressing perfectly the rhythm, both of nature and of the human spirit.



Pisces (Mark 1 4:1 7-1 6:8)
In referring to this sign, along with Gemini, Virgo and Sagittarius, as ' hi corporeal', Ptolemy was, in part, describing its 'linking' character. Thcst• signs, called 'Mutable' signs in modem astrology, come at the end of each uf the four energy pulses of the solar cycle, the equinoxes and solstices, and Ho join one cycle with the next As the energy from one pulse diminishes, anuthl'r one begins to build up. The signs themselves reflect this duality in tlll'ir symbols: Gemini, the Twins; Virgo, the Maiden with the Sheaf of Wheat; Sagittarius, the Centaur; and Pisces, the Two Fish. Such duality inevitably produces a tension which all four of these signs symbolize, in one way nr another. This is least in evidence in Virgo and Sagittarius, since the Earth nl one and the Fire of the other give consistency and resolve, qualities whnlly lacking in Airy Gemini and Watery Pisces. These latter two have much in common, as their glyphs show. Gemini (li) has two parallel poles, St.•pamh· but joined at top and bottom: Pisces (*) has two fish, swimming i n oppnsih· directions, joined at the centre by a thin band. In psychological terms, duality can become duplicity, and this, for Manitius, characterized the Piscean type. As we might expect, he tells us tiMt the Piscean makes a good fisherman, whose skill enables him:
To sweep smooth Seas with Nets, to drag the Sand And draw the leaping Captives to the land. (page 128)
B u t he immediately adds that he can also:
Lay cheating Wires, or with unfaithful bait The Hook conceal, and get by the deceit.
So suspicious of Pisces is he that, he says, nobody should want it prominently placed in his horoscope:
But could I rule, could I the Fates design, The rising Fishes ne'er should govern mine; They give a hateful, prattling, railing Tongue, Still full of Venom, always in the wrong; That blows up Jealousies, and heightens Fears, By muttering poys' nous Whispers in Men's Ears. Faithless the Births, and full of wild Desire, Their Faith is Treachery, and their Land is Fire. (page 1 37)

I11e Gospel and tile Zodiac
Manilius detects a weakness in Pisces which we might call spinelessness, unwillingness to confront anyone directly, deviousness, covert and cowardly acts. Allen tells us that the sign was 'considered ... a malignant influence in human affairs, - a dull, treacherous, and phlegmatic sign' . He goes on:
The Egyptians, the instructors of the Hebrews in astrology, are said to have abstained from eating sea fish out of dread and abhorrence; and when they would express anything odious, represented a fish in their hieroglyphics. (page 340)
However, this is not the whole story. For the Hebrews, at least, Pisces had some redeeming features. It is probable that this sign represented Jacob's son Joseph,* the dreamer and visionary, who saved his people from famine, and whose cruel fate at the hands of his brothers was interpreted as a manifesta tion of God's special providence (Genesis 50:20). This attribution of joseph, an exalted though flawed character, to Pisces seems apt because there is a gentleness to the sign and an ability to empathize. Water symbolizes emo tion, and the Mutable Water sign is the sign of 'flowing' emotion, of reach ing out to others in their distress, of concern for the suffering world. For modem writers, in fact, the faults of Pisces which so horrified Manilius are really just expressions of the sign's extreme sensitivity. Such faults
spring from his being a victim of the world, in a sense - in being a sensitive soul lost in a world which has little respect for sensitivity ... The various gambits, by which Pisceans try to hide their sensitivity and their inability to deal with the world, at times include deceit, hypocrisy, and lying - three faults which emerge from a lack of real self confidence. (Gettings, 1972, pages 135-6)
The diffidence which the Piscean so often displays is our key to understand ing the spiritual lessons of this sign. Lack of confidence in the self, or in the future, is characteristic of most of us, particularly so when one cycle of life is coming to an end. Part of us wants to stay in the security of the past, prefer
* Most authorities give Joseph as the Piscean son of Jacob. As a 'dreamer of dreams' he seems to fit the characteristics of the sign better than the rest. Dobin thinks that the fact that no tribe of Israel was named after Joseph (his sons Ephraim and Manasseh gave their names to tribes in his stead) indicates the 'hidden' qualities of Pisces. In addition, the confusion over Jacob's bless ing of Joseph's sons (Gen. 48) - he crosses his hands and so places his right hand on tlw head of Ephraim, the young••r of the two - reOecls the confusion often found in ,1 strongly l'isct'<lll char ,,cter (St't' Dobin, pagt•s 47-ll).

ring the devil we know to any merely promised angel. This is one of tlw Piscean fishes, swimming backwards into the safe waters. But it is a t this point that we have to steel our resolve, to face the uncertainties of the futu rl' with confidence, to swim with the other fish into the open waters which beckon us to a newer and fuller life. Pisces, however, is not Aries. It does not symbolize the new beginning, but it does anticipate i t and prepare for it. In Aquarius we witnessed tlw breaking-down of the old structures in readiness to begin rebu ilding. Tht• past has already been cracked open: we now have to prepare to mow through it. The Church, which was not always ignorant of these things, has long recognized the importance of this period of the solar year by design.lt ing it a time of preparation and anticipation. Lent is for reflecting on the past, and for opening up to the future: the Ash Wednesday anointing dt>t:lan•s that our present suffering is cathartic, purgatorial perhaps, bu t not pl'rm.l nent: it is just the anguish of anticipated transformation. Symbolic of the optimism and hope that should be evident at such a t i nw is the Jupiterean rulership of Pisces. We have already explored the symbolism of this planet in relation to Sagittarius where the generosity, magnanimity, and dignity of Jupiter find their most convenient expression . The J u p i ll'r (l&.) of Pisces, however, is not so extroverted, but it is no less honourahh•, compassionate, or kind. Jupiterean expansiveness echoes the gl• n u i m• hu manitarian quality of Pisces which seeks the greatest good of thl· gn•a tt•st nu mber, and which is sometimes prepared to sacrifice itsel f in the pron•ss. Since the discovery of Neptune M in the last century, howewr, it has been customary among astrologers to assign this planet co-rulersh i p ul Pisces. According to Allen, Pisces was, in antiquity, 'under the care of tlw Sl'a-god Neptune, and was called Neptu ni Sidus by Manitius' (page 340), .md the principles which modern astrologers have ascribed to this planet mysticism, intuition, mediumship - seem, in one sense, more appropriatl' to the gentle, misunderstood Pisces than the more ' fiery' attribu tes of Jupill'r. But this sign is ' hi-corporeal' after all, and it is fitting that i t should haw two rulers: Neptune, which seems to be associated with transcending barrier!'!, .md Ju piter which wants to jump over them.

This final section of Mark is so lengthy and so densely packed with symbolic and mythological elements that a whole book would be necessary to deal with it adequately. Fortunately, it is no part of my present purpose to provide such a comprehensive commentary. Instead, I will deal only with the specif ically astrological themes of the text, pointing out where appropriate their relevance to our main contention, that Mark's Gospel, whatever else it might be, is a guide to the spiritual life. There is also a possibility that, in addition to symbolic and mythological elements, the story contains some historical material. It is certainly possible that a holy man called Jesus was executed by the Romans with the con nivance of the Jewish authorities. It is also possible that this man was the source of many of the sayings which are attributed to him in the gospel record, and that he founded a movement dedicated to the promulgation of divine wisdom. However, I do not think that Mark's Gospel has such things as its principal concern, even though it may indirectly reflect them. The pres ence in the text of genuine place-names, real historical characters, and veri fiable customs and traditions does not guarantee history. Mark's narrative is so contrived, so replete with Old Testament and zodiacal echoes, that it can not be mere chronicle. We should be alerted to the text's heavily symbolic character by the stated dating of events. Mark leaves us in no doubt that the series of incidents with which his Gospel concludes took place at the time of the Jewish Passover celebrations. It is not unlikely that a wandering preacher would be present in Jerusalem at Passover time. Nor is it hard for us to envisage him antagoniz ing the authorities so greatly that they would wish him killed. However, that such an execution should take place on the very day of the Passover, as Mark declares, is well-nigh impossible. The city would be full of people who had come from all over the world for the solemn festivities, and for the normally prudent Roman authorities to risk antagonizing the crowds by executing anyone, prophet or pretender, defies reason. In addition, that the Jews themselves would plot an execution on one of the holiest days of the year is unthinkable. Even if they were prepared to risk defiling the holy day itself, where on earth would they have found the time for such chicanery? For the high priests and their minions, this was the bu siest time of the year.
20H



Pisces (Mark 14:1 7-16:8)
It is significant that John's Gospel, which at this point seems to reflect '' slightly different tradition from Mark, dates the crucifixion differently. Mark tells us that Jesus ate a Passover meal with his disciples on the night befort• his death (Mark 14:12, 17). For John, however, this final meal took plan• on the day before Passover, 'the Day of Preparation' Gohn 13:1; 19:14). Timing differs, too. According to Mark, Jesus was on the cross from the third hour (9a.m.) to the ninth hour (3p.m.) (Mark 15:25, 34). (Since the Jewish day began at sunset, Jesus' death would therefore occur on the same day a:-� Passover.) In John, however, it is at noon on the day before Passover that they lead Jesus away to his death Gohn 19:14), the precise time that tlw priests would be busy in the Temple killing the thousands upon thousand:-� of Passover lambs. It is impossible that both John and Mark can be right on this. Tlw two .tccounts cannot be reconciled, and all attempts to reconcile them fai l larnen t
.1bly. But the discrepancy is really irrelevant. Both authors have the crucifixion occur during the Passover season, despite the historical unlikelihood of thiN, because it is symbolically appropriate that it should be so. John is concenwd to show Jesus as the sacrificial lamb whose death was prefigured in tht• n•nturies-old practice of animal offerings, and so he makes the time of hi:-� I'Xt..'Cution correspond with the time of the ritual killing. Although we cannot n•adily discern such a theological motive in Mark, we can legitimatel y ,,:-�sume from the imagery in the narrative that he associates Jesus' death with tlw Passover for two reasons: the first is related to the fact that the Passovt�r is a springtime festival; the second concerns the approach of the new age of l
'isces, when the equinoctial point would move out of the constellation of tlw l{,ml and into the constellation of the Fish. Mark's symbolism in these thrt't' rh.tpters is based on two cycles. The first is the ordinary yearly cycle which c'IHis with the sun moving from Pisces to Aries at the equinox. The second is t l u• cycle of the Great Year (see 'The Forgotten Language of the Stars' ), in w hich the equinoctial point i tself moves backwards through the constella t ions of the zodiac. We will examine them in tum.

Christians. Throughout the ancient world, people would celebrate the returning sun with ceremonies which closely resemble Christian ones. Sir James Frazer has catalogued these and noted their common themes. They all have to do with a dying and rising god, or a dying and rising king. They are dramatic presentations of the cycle of nature itself, in which we observe the emergence of new life from death and decay. The myths of Tammuz, Adonis, Osiris, Dionysus, Demeter and Persephone are all of this type, and bear a striking resemblance to the Jesus story. Each involves going down into death and coming back to life again: the end of one cycle and the begin ning of another; winter to spring; Pisces to Aries. These stories are not to be dismissed as 'mere' myths fit only for the enter tainment of children. The fact that they are so widespread points to them being expressions of the deepest hopes and aspirations of all humankind. To say that they are originally metaphors drawn from the observations of farmers is not to belittle their spiritual significance in any way. What Frazer says about the myth of Demeter and Persephone might be taken as applicable to all such stories:
In the mind of the ordinary Greek the two goddesses were essentially personifications of the com, and that in this germ the whole efflores cence of their religion finds implicitly its explanation. But to maintain this is not to deny that in the long course of religious evolution high moral and spiritual conceptions were grafted on this simple original stock and blossomed out into fairer flowers than the bloom of the bar ley and the wheat. Above all, the thought of the seed buried in the earth in order to spring up to new and higher life readily suggested a com parison with human destiny, and strengthened the hope that for man too the grave may be but the beginning of a better and happier exis tence in some brighter world unknown. (Frazer, page 433)
Mark's Gospel is one of these 'fairer flowers' . He has given the ancient pagan mythology a Jewish dress, but the garment is transparent and through it we can detect the limbs of Piscean death-rebirth themes which had their origin in agriculture but which have ever expressed the universal human hope that death is not the end, and that the ending of one cycle is the beginning of another. John's Gospel has the actual image of the seed's death and rebirth in Jesus' saying:
"I tell you the truth, unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed . But if it dies, it produces many seeds' (John 1 2 :24).
210



Pisces (Mark 14:1 7-1 6:8)
In addition, both Matthew and Luke write of the 'sign of Jonah', clearly expressing the same Piscean death-rebirth themes:
Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, 'Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you.' He answered, 'A wicked and adulter ous generation asks for a miraculous sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.' (Matthew 1 2:38-40)
The absence of these sayings from Mark is rather puzzling, but tlw fact tl1.1 t they are found in the other Gospels gives us some kind of clue to the nwan· ing of all resurrection stories. The 'great fish' (ki?tos) is Pisces into which Jonah, the son of man, and Everyman has to sink before emerging ' rebom' into the next cycle. The sun's emergence from Pisces to Aries at the spring l'l.flli nox symbolizes the eternal longing of humanity for resurrection to new lifl'. The connection of these themes with the sun comes ou t clearly in M,1 rk's narrative. The 'darkness' of its Piscean sojourn is imaged in thl' darkrwss which covered the land 'from the sixth hour to the ninth hour' as Jesus hung on the cross (Mark 15:33). The cockerel which marks Peter's denial of jl•sus is associated with the sun, in that its crow announces the sunrise, and its cox mmb actually looks like a shining solar disc. And it is just possibll' tha t lt'sus' troublesome cry of dereliction from the cross, Eloi Eloi Lama Salmdrlt/111, given in Mark 15:34 in Aramaic and translated, 'My God, my God, why haVI' vnu forsaken me?' was originally a cross-language pun which dt'pl•nds on tlw fact that the vocative of he/ios, the Greek word for sun, is /rdic.

The Gospel and the Zodiac
The 'pagan' references do not end here, however. Frazer's work has shown that in the ancient world, the king had magical significance and his life and fortunes were intimately bound up with the life and fortunes of the people. In some cultures it was customary to put the king to death before his physical and mental decline would be known in society at large. This is a Piscean notion, since from the king's death comes new life and vigour to the people, and Mark preserves the potent symbol in his account of Jesus' cruci fixion. Jesus is crucified as a king:*
They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him. And they began to call out to him, 'Hail, king of the Jewsl' Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spat on him. Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him. (Mark 1 5 : 1 7- 1 9)
Pilate asks Jesus if he is King of the Jews (Mark 15:2), and above his cross was written 'The King of the Jews' (Mark 15:26). These motifs reflect the second decan of Pisces, Cepheus, about which Seiss has this to say:
Here is the figure of a glorious king, wearing his royal robe, bearing aloft a branch or sceptre, and having on his head a crown of stars. (Seiss, page 85)
The king is both victim and redeemer, a notion which, says Liz Greene, 'is very close to the heart of Pisces' . She goes on:
Whether the individual Piscean identifies more with the victim and becomes the one whom life has dismembered, or with the redeemer who is the saviour of suffering, there is not much to choose between them, for they are two facets of the same thing. So too is the voracious fish, the goddess, from whom the victim must be rescued; or to whom the redeemer must be sacrificed to absolve others of sin and damnation - they are part and parcel of the same mythic motif. It has speciously been said that Pisces people incarnate either to suffer or to save. As a generalisation, it is truer than most, and it is usually both, for only the
• There's a hint of the 'dismembered king' motif in the strange incident of the cutting off of the high priest's servant's ear, which occurs as jesus is being arrested (Mark 14:47). Mark tells us very little, but john gives us a very telling detail: 'Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.)' Uohn 18:10). Luke alone tells us that jesus healed the man (Luke 22:51). 'Malchus' comes from the Hebrew word mdec/r, which mt•ans 'king'. So the king. like Osiris in the Egyptian myth, is (partially) dismernbt.•n•<t. but is rn01dl• whole ag.1in by tht• power of the Christ.

injured has compassion. No sign is so inclined to present itself as life's victim, nor is any sign so inclined to genuine empathy for suffering. (Greene, 1985, page 260)
l"he idea of the 'suffering redeemer' is present also in the first decan of Pisces, Andromeda. The name means 'man ruler' ('King'? 'Queen'?), to which the Latins frequently added Mulier Catenata, the Woman Chained. J"he myth of Andromeda bears so many parallels with the story of the cruci fixion and resurrection of Jesus that it is worth quoting the first part of Manilius's version at length:
There follows the constellation of Andromeda, whose golden light appears in the rightward sky when the Fishes have risen to twelve degrees. Once on a time the sin of cruel parents caused her to be given up for sacrifice, when a hostile sea in all its strength burst upon every shore, the land was shipwrecked in the flood, and what had been a king's domain was now an ocean. From those ills but one prict• of rl·demption was proposed, surrender of And romeda to the raging main

for a monster to devour her tender limbs. This was her bridal; relieving the people's hurt by submitting to her own, she is amid her tears adorned as victim for the beast and dons attire prepared for no such troth as this; and the corpseless funeral of the living maiden is hurried on its way. Then as soon as the procession reaches the shore of the tumultuous sea, her soft arms are stretched out on the hard rocks; they
bound her feet to crags and cast chains upon her; and there to die on her virgin cross the maiden hung (et cruce virginea moritura puella pepmdit). Even in the hour of sacrifice she yet preserves a modest mien: her very sufferings become her, for, gently inclining her snow-white neck, she seemed in full possession of her liberty. The folds of her robe slipped from her shoulders and fell from her arms and her strea ming locks covered her body. (Manilius, G.P. Goold, pages 345-7)
But Perseus, returning from his destruction of Medusa, notices the chained Andromeda, falls in love with her, saves her from the dreadful sea monster, and eventually marries her. These images of dying that others might live, of a virgin cross, of the innocent victim, of defeating the monster, even the parental sin ('original sin'?) are all part of the Jesus story and have had a pro found influence on later Christian theology. All of them are prefigured in mythology of the constellation Andromeda. At the beginning of the twentieth century j . M . Robertson proposed the theory that the gospel account of the Crucifixion, Death and Resurrection of Jesus was originally scripted as a kind of play which would have been pre sented to initiates of the Christian mysteries at a springtime festival. The very structure of the piece and its dramatic quality - so different, really, from everything which precedes i t - lends support to this point of view. We know that the various pagan mysteries were celebrated in this way, and Apuleius (second century CE) has given us a very graphic account of a springtime pageant in honour of the goddess Isis in 17w Golden Ass, which was originally called Metamorphoses, or Transformations. The hero, Lucius, who was changed into an ass instead of an owl by the appl ication of the wrong magical potion, is eventually transformed back into a human being a year later by munching on roses. When he is subsequently initiated into the priesthood of Isis, in which ceremony he 'approached the very gates of death and set one foot on Proserpine's threshold, yet was permitted to return, rapt through all the elements', he emerges from the sanctuary a t dawn, ' wearing twelve different stoles' (Graves, page 286). Robert Graves comments on this passage:
2 1·1



Pisces (Mark 14: 1 7-16:8)
Fig. 27 Andromeda 'on her virgin cross the maiden hung'
The seasonal transformations of the variously-named god of the mystery cults, the Spirit of the Year, were epitomized in the Athenian Lenaea festival and corresponding performances throughout the ancient world, including north-western Europe. The initiate identified himself with the god, and seems to have undergone twelve emblematic trans formations - represented by Lucius's ' twelve stoles' - as he passed through the successive Houses of the Zodiac before undergoing his ritual death and rebirth. 'Transformations' therefore conveys the Sl'C ondary sense of 'spiritual autobiography', and Lucius has spt•nt twelve months in his ass's skin, from one rose-season to the next, con stantly changing his House, until his death as an ass and rebirth as a devotee of Isis. (Gr<lVl'S, pa�e 1 5)
215



17te Gospel and the Zodiac
In Apuleius, after twelve 'emblematic transformations' culminating in a symbolic 'death', an ass becomes a man. In the gospel story, which is, of course, by no means an exact parallel, the same series of transformations cul minates in a 'symbolic death' on the cross, leading to a resurrected life, and to the initiates who would be watching the performance would appear as a dramatic representation of the ultimate spiritual transformation. As the old sun goes to its death in Pisces only to be reborn at the spring equinox; as the Israelites cross the Red Sea before entering the Promised Land; as Jonah spends three days in the belly of the fish only to be vomited out, trans formed, on to dry land once more; so the old, carnal self is crucified and the new, redeemed person is reborn. This is the 'secret' message of the Gospel narrative, a message which it shares with the dramas of the mystery cults of old, that a new kind of life 'eternal life', 'resurrected life' - is available to those who are brave enough to embrace the Way of the Cross, the painful destruction of the ego and its appetites, so that the Christ-spirit may come to birth. This 'resurrected life' is not a post-mortem state; it is offered to us while we are still in the flesh. As Balzac says in his novel Louis Lambert, 'The resurrection is brought about by the winds of heaven which sweep the worlds. The angel born upon the blast saith not: "Ye dead, arise", he says, "Arise, ye living!'" The resurrection of Jesus, the resurrection of Jairus' daughter, are both 'awakenings' from the sleep of the unlived life which it is the aim of all spiritual systems to effect. Neither incident concerns a reanimated corpse.* In addition to its 'pagan' themes, the final section of Mark has Piscean ele ments drawn from Jewish mythology. In the main, these concern Joseph, the Piscean son of Jacob. Luke's genealogy informs us that Jesus was the 'son of Joseph, son of Heli' (Luke 3:23), and Heli could easily be a corruption of the Greek word helios, which means sun. This information is not found in Mark, but what we do find are a number of incidents which echo the Joseph story as we find it in Genesis. Just as Joseph was sold into slavery by his brother, Judah (Genesis 37:28), so Jesus is betrayed to the authorities by Judas (Mark 14:10-11). Joseph is handed over to the Midianites for twenty pieces of silver (Genesis 37:28), Jesus earns his betrayer thirty pieces of silver (Matthew 26:15). When Joseph refuses the advances of Potiphar's wife he runs away naked as she pulls the garment from his body (Genesis 39:12): at the crud
• The sense of resurrection as 'freedom' might well be contained in the incident with Barabbas (Mark 15:6-15). 'Barabbas' in Hebrew/ Aramaic means 'Son of the Father'; so there is the implication that the one who is released from all shackles is a true son of God. TI1e dramatic context is not to be takt•n litl'rally, and lht•re W<lS certainly no t:ustom of releasing a prisoner at Passover t i rne.

fixion of Jesus, a young man runs naked from the crowd, leaving his linen garment behind (Mark 14:51-2).* Even Pilate's wife's dream (Matthew 27:19) t'Choes the dreams of Joseph. By introducing Joseph into the narrative in this way, Mark is able to point us to the great lesson of Joseph's life: his misfor tunes were part of God's plan; his slavery meant his people's liberation (Genesis 50:20). Out of darkness comes light. Jesus' death 'between two thieves' (Mark 15:27) echoes the death of Samson Oudges 16: 23-31) between the two pillars of the temple of Dagon. Samson, as we have seen ('The Forgotten Language of the Stars' and ' Leo: Who Am 1?'), is a personification of the sun. He is at the height of his powers when he kills the l ion (Leo); his strength is reduced by Delilah (Aquarius); bu t he finally dies in the temple of Dagon, the Philistine fish god (Pisct's). Crucified at Golgotha, The Place of the Skull, Jesus is Everyman and Everywoman, poised between the past and the future, the twin 'thieves' of the divine life, symbolized by the two fish of Pisces swimming in opposiiL' d i rections. Other characters in the drama play out the Piscean themes. J udas' t reachery (Mark 14:10-11), and Peter's denial (Mark 14:27-31, 66-72) both illustrate the cowardice we all exhibit when faced with the prospect of any kind of suffering. The sleep of the apostles in Gethsemane (Mark 1 4:40), which can hardly be historical in view of the danger they were about to t•ncounter, is itself Piscean, and contrasts with the wakeful agony of ]t'SUH who is prepared to undergo his destined transformation regardless of per sonal cost (Mark 14:32-42). 'The spirit is willing, but the flesh is wt•a k' (Mark 14:38), Jesus' words to his sleepy companions, epitomize the tensions t nherent in this sign. The Gethsemane episode is, in fact, a dramatization of the Piscean lesson for the spiritual seeker: the pain which inevi tably .1ccompanies the end of any cycle has to be encountered . Evasion, denial or 'sleep' cannot lift us to the next phase of our existence. With Hamlet wt• have to say 'The readiness is all', and go forward to a future which 'couiJ lw different from the past because (it is) more evolved, more fulfilling' ( l�udhyar, page 81). But our post-resurrection journey, like that of Jesus to Galilee (Mark I h:7), is back to where we started from. The cycle has ended only to begin ,,g<1in as we continue to spiral, onwards and upwards, towards our eventual li bt•ra tion.

Tlte Gospel and the Zodiac
The Equinoctial Cycle - Aries to Pisces
Piscean themes are not restricted to the final chapters of this Gospel. The whole Gospel can, with some justification, be called a Piscean document. Early on we read of the apostles becoming 'fishers of men' (Mark 1 :17); the multitudes are fed on bread and fish (Mark 6:38ff.; 8:7); and the Piscean virtue of self-sacrifice is constantly extolled. Other 'fishy' stories can be found elsewhere in the Gospels: Matthew has the curious story of the Coin in the Fish's Mouth (Matthew 17:24-7), and John tells of the Miraculous Catch of Fish Gohn 21:1-14). Such stories point to the imminent 'new age', the age of Pisces, which was potentially a time of collective spiritual transformation. As the equinoctial point, moving backwards through the zodiac (see 'The Forgotten Language of the Stars'), 'passed over' from Aries to Pisces, the spiritual symbols of the people would be changed. Two thousand years earlier the Ram, or Lamb, of Aries had entered human consciousness as the symbol of the age of Aries. This great shift in spiritual awareness had been celebrated by the Jews in the Passover, in which the Lamb was ritually consumed. In Mark's time a new Passover was imminent, and this would necessitate a new ritual. This time there would be no lamb, since the age of Aries was over (the 'Lamb' has been slain), but certain elements of the old ritual, their meaning transformed, would remain. In every new age there is the idea of breaking with the past, symbolized in the original ceremony by the un leavened bread.* This would remain as part of the new celebration, but it would take on an added significance, representing Virgo, the Maiden with the Sheaf of Wheat, whose qualities complement those of its polar opposite sign, Pisces. Thus, the bread of Virgo's harvest is linked with the Christ, 'the Vine' (see John 15). Wine, symbolic of all celebration, which gladdens our heart but takes away our will, is, like all drugs, Piscean. Mythologically it belongs to Dionysus (Bacchus in Roman mythology), god of the vine who died and was resurrected. It is this 'new wine', the wine of the new age, which Jesus will drink in the kingdom of God (Mark 14:25). In John's Gospel, the Last Supper Gohn 13ff.) contains Piscean themes even though it is not said to be a Passover celebration. Jesus rises from the table, takes cloth and water, and begins to wash the feet of his disciples. The feet, as Manilius tells us, are ruled by Pisces, but the most important Piscean

•·h•nwnt of the story is in the self-abasement, humility and service that jl'SWI ••hows. These are the virtues that were to inform the Piscean age. Our colk'l· l l \'1' fa ilure to embrace them should leave us a little sceptical about the broth ''' ' " 'lld promised by Aquarius.

John the Baptist turned up in the wilderness, offering people an opport u nity to change their ways and be released from their sins by means of a rit u.ll immersion in water. Crowds of people from Jerusalem and from all over l udca were coming out to him, and as they confessed their sins he would plunge them in the water of the river Jordan. John's clothing was made from ' ,,mel hair, and he had a leather belt round his waist; he ate locusts and wild honey. He was proclaiming. 'There's someone coming after me who'� ••l mnger than I; I'm not fit to lace his shoes. I drenched you in water, but he will drench you in holy spirit.'"' At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was immersed in I he• Jordan by John.

spent forty days among the wild beasts being tempted by Satan. But the angels looked after him. After John was arrested, Jesus went to Galilee preaching the good news about God. He was saying that the appointed time had come; the kingdom of God was close by. 'Otange your mind and your ways and believe the good news.' Going along by the Sea of Galilee he saw some fishermen, Simon and his brother Andrew, who were casting their nets into the sea. Jesus said to them, 'Come and follow me; I'll make you into fishers of men!' They left their nets without hesitation and followed him. A little further on he saw Zebedee's sons, James and John, mending nets in the boat. He called out to them and they followed him at once, leaving their father Zebedee and the hired men in the boat. They went to Capemaum and, wasting no time, he entered the synagogue on the Sabbath day and began to teach. The people were amazed at his teaching because he taught them like someone with authority, not like the experts in religious law. Suddenly in their synagogue there was a man with an evil spirit, who cried out, 'What business do you have with us, Jesus the Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are - God's holy one!' Jesus rebuked him. 'Shut up and come out from him!' he said, and come out it did, but not before letting out a terrific scream and throwing the man into a fit of convulsions. Everybody was astonished, so much so that they were asking one another, 'What's all this about? A new teaching? And he has authority to make the evil spirits obey him!' The report about him soon spread everywhere around the region of Galilee. On leaving the synagogue they went to Simon and Andrew's house, along with James and John. Simon's mother-in-law was lying down, sick with a fever, and as soon as they told Jesus about her, he went in to her, and taking hold of her hand, he raised her up. The fever left her and she began to wait upon them. In the evening, when the sun was setting, they were bringing him all those who were sick or who were possessed by demons. The whole town was gathered together by the door, and he healed many who were sick of vari ous diseases. He also cast out many demons, but he wouldn' t let the demons speak because they knew who he was. Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he got up and went off to a deserted place to pray. However, Simon and his companions found out where he was and told him that everyone was looking for him. He said to them, ' Let's go somewhere else, to the villages roundabout, so that I can preach there. That's why I've come.' And off he went, preaching in syn agogues and casting out demons th roughout the wholl' of Ga l ilee.

A leper approached him, and falling down on his knees begged him, ' I f you want to, you can make me clean!' Moved with pity, he stretched o u t hi� hand, touched him, and said, 'I do want to. Be healed !' The leprosy dis.l p peared immediately and the man was clean. Jesus sent him on his way, telling him in no uncertain terms that he wasn't to say anything to anybody, but to show himself to the priest and to make the appropriate offerin� for his cleansing, just as Moses had commanded. But the man went out and starh•d to blab about everything and to spread the word everywhere, so that jlosus was no longer able to go openly into the city, and had to stay in tht• wild,•r· ness regions. Even so, people kept coming to him from all directions.

Now the disciples of John and the Pharisees used to fast, and some people came and asked Jesus, 'Why do the disciples of John and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don't fast?' To which Jesus replied, 'The friends of the bridegroom can't fast while the bridegroom is with them. While they have the bridegroom with them they can't fast. But the days are coming when the bridegroom will be taken away from them and that's when they'll fast. Nobody patches an old garment with new cloth because the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear even worse. And no one puts new wine into old wineskins, because the wine splits the wineskins and both wine and wineskins are ruined. No: new wine goes into new wineskins.' One Sabbath day he happened to be walking through the grain fields, and his disciples began plucking the heads of grain as they were making their way along. The Pharisees said to him, 'Hey! Why are they doing what they are not supposed to be doing on the Sabbath day?' So Jesus said to them, 'Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hun gry and in need of food? How he went into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest and took the loaves of holy bread which only the priests were allowed to eat, and gave it to those who were with him?' He went on: 'The Sabbath came into existence for the sake of human beings; human beings didn't come into existence for the sake of the Sabbath. So, the son of man is Lord of the Sabbath.'
Chapter 3
He went into the synagogue again, where he found a man whose hand was shrivelled up. They were watching him closely to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day and so give them something to accuse him of. Jesus asked the man with the shrivelled hand to come up into the middle, and then he asked, 'Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath or to do harm, to save a life or to kill?' They were silent, so looking round at them with anger, and deeply grieved at their stubborn insensitivity, he said to the man, 'Stretch out your hand.' He stretched it out and his hand was healed, but straight away the Pharisees went out with the Herodians, plotting how they might kill him. Jesus and his disciples went back towards the sea, followed by great crowds of people from Galilee, Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, from the other side of the Jordan, and the area around Tyre and Sidon. People who'd heard what he was doing came to him. And he told his disciples to have a little boat ready because the crowds were pressing in upon him. He'd healed many, and the sick people were crowd ing round him, just so that they could touch

him. Whenever the evil spirits saw him they would fall down in front of him and say, 'You are the son of God!' And often he would order them to keep quiet about him. He went up the mountain and called those he wanted, and they camc tn him. He selected twelve to be with him, whom he called 'apostles' (l•mis saries) because these were the ones he would send out to preach. Tht•y would have authority to cast out demons. These are the twelve he chosl': Simon, whom he called Peter; James, the son of Zebedee, and his brullwr John (he called these Boanerges - 'Sons of Thunder'); Andrew, Phi lip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus; Thaddat'UN, Simon the Cananaean; and Judas Iscariot who was to betray him. He went into a house but the crowds were so tightly packed once again that they couldn't even eat a meal. When his relatives heard about it tht•y went out to grab hold of him, because they said he was out of his mind. A nd the legal experts who'd come down from Jerusalem were saying that hc wnH in league with Beelzebub, and that he was casting out demons by the pllWl'r of the chief demon. So Jesus called them to him and, using a few appnsitt• metaphors, he said, 'How can Satan cast out Satan? A divided kingdom can' t survive. Nor can a divided family. And if Satan rises up against himSt.•lf and is divided, he can't survive but his end approaches. But no one is ablt• to l'nter the house of a strong man and steal his property unless the strong rn•m has been bound first; only then can he rob him. I'm telling you the tru t h : human beings will be forgiven for everything, n o matter what sins they co m mit o r what blasphemies they utter. But whoever blasphemes against tht• holy spirit won't ever be forgiven, because he's guilty of an eternal sin.' Ht• said this because they were saying, 'He has an unclean spirit.' His mother and brothers came and were standing outside, and they sent !';omeone in to summon him. A crowd was sitting around him and they said to him, 'Your mother, your brothers and your sisters are outside; they are looking for you.' Jesus responded by saying, 'Who is my mother and my brothers?' And looking at those sitting in a circle round him, he said, ' Look! l lere are my mother and my brothers. Whoever does the will of God is my brother, my sister, and my mother.'

Chapter 4
He began to teach again beside the sea, and so great a crowd gathered about him that he had to get into a boat and sit in it on the water, while the crowd looked on from the shore. He taught them many things in parables, and in his teaching he said to them, 'Listen! Look! The sower went out to sow, and while he was sowing some seed fell by the roadside and the birds came along and ate it. Some fell on the rocks where there wasn't much soil; it sprang up very quickly because there was no real depth of soil, but when the sun rose it was scorched and it withered because it didn't have any root. Some fell among the thorns, but the thorns came up and choked it and so it yielded no crop. But some fell on good soil where it grew and thrived, yield ing an abundant crop - increasing thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.' He said, 'Use your ears! Take notice of what I'm saying!' When they were alone, those close to him, along with the twelve, began to question him about the parables, so he said to them, 'The mystery of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to those on the outside every thing is expressed in parables, so that although they may look they won't see, and although they may hear they won't understand in case they would need to turn around and forgiveness be given to them.' He said to them, 'If you don't understand this parable, how are you going to understand all the other parables? The sower is sowing the word. The seed that falls on the roadside represents those who hear the word, but no sooner do they hear it than Satan comes along and takes it away from them. The seed that falls on the rocks are those people who hear the word and receive it with joy but they don't have any staying power, so they continue for a while but as soon as they encounter trouble or persecution on account of the word they let things slide. Then there are those represented by the seed among the thorns. They are the ones who hear the word but the cares of the time, the enticements of wealth and desires for all kinds of other things overwhelm them and choke the word so that they cease to be fruitful. But the seed that is sown on the good ground represents those who hear the
word, recei ve i t and prod uce fru i t - thi rtyfold, sixtyfold, a nd a h u ndredfold.'

He told them, 'You don't bring in a lamp and then put it under a measur ing basket, or under the bed. No, you put it on a lamp-stand, don't you? Su, there's nothing hidden that will not be revealed; and what's been carefully concealed will be brought into the open. Use your ears and take notin� ol what I'm saying.'* He went on, 'Take notice of what you are hearing; what you ren•iVl' by way of increase wil l be in proportion to what you give out; and to him who has it will be given, and to him who has not, what he has will be taken from him. 'The kingdom of God is like a man who scatters some seed on the ground and he sleeps by night and gets up by day and the seed sprouts and grows, but how it happens he doesn't know. Things grow by their own power; first the shoot, then the ear of grain, then the full head of com, and when il i� ready, he puts in the scythe because it's time for the harvest. 'With what can we compare the kingdom of God? What image can Wt' usL' to describe it? It's like a grain of mustard seed which, at the time that it's sown in the ground, is smaller than all the seeds of the earth, but after it's sown it grows and becomes bigger than aU other plants and produn•s branches so massive that the birds of heaven can nest in its shade.' Using many parables like these, he told them just as much as they WL'rt' able to grasp. Indeed he didn't speak to them except by means of a parabJ,., but he explained everything privately to his disciples.

On the evening of the same day, he said to them, 'Let us cross over to the other side.' So, leaving the crowds they took him as he was in the boat, and other boats were with him. A great windstorm (Greek: laelaps) blew up and the waves were beating against the boat, so that it was already filling up. Jesus was sleeping in the stem with his head on a cushion, so they woke him up and said to him, 'Teacher, don't you care that we're going down?' He got up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, 'Quiet! Be silent!' And the wind subsided and a great calm descended. He said to them, 'Why are you so timid? Are you still without faith?' And they were very scared and said to one another, 'Who is this man? Both the wind and the waves obey him!'
Chapter 5
They came to the other side of the lake into the land of the Gerasenes, and no sooner was he out of the boat than a man with an unclean spirit approached him.* This man was living among the tombs in the graveyard and he was so out of control that no one could subdue him or even chain him. In the past he'd been bound hand and foot, but he'd pulled the chains apart and smashed the shackles. Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was crying out and bruising himself with stones. When he saw Jesus in the distance he ran and fell on his knees, paying him homage and shouting at the top of his voice, ' What's your business with me, Jesus, son of God Most High? I beg you in God's name don't torment me!' He said this because Jesus was ordering the unclean spirit to come out of him. Jesus asked, 'What is your name?' He replied, 'My name is Legion; there's a whole gang of us.' He kept begging Jesus not to send them all out of that region. There was a great herd of pigs feeding on the hillside, and the demons shouted out, 'Send us into the pigs! We want to go into them!' Jesus gave them permission, and the unclean spirits came out and entered the pigs, and the herd of about two thousand dashed headlong down the steep slope into the sea, where they drowned. The herdsmen ran off and told the story so that people came &om town and country to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and they looked at the man who'd been possessed by the legion of demons, and when they saw that he was now dressed and sane they were terrified. Those who had witnessed it related what had happened to the possessed man and to the pigs, and they began to implore Jesus to leave their neighbourhood. When he got into the boat, the man who'd been possessed begged that he might go along with him, but Jesus wouldn't allow

it, and said to him, 'Go home to your family and tell them what the Lord has done for you, and how he's taken pity on you.' But the man went away and began to announce in the Decapolis what Jesus had done for him, and every one was amazed. When Jesus had crossed over again to the other side, a large crowd thronged around him as he stood on the shore. When one of the rulers of the synagogue, a man called Jairus, saw Jesus, he threw himself at his feet. 'My little daughter is dying. Come and lay your hands on her so that she can be healed and live,' he begged. So Jesus went with him. A great crowd pressed upon him. There was a woman who'd had a flow of blood for twelve years, and who'd undergone a lot of suffering at the hands of many doctors, but despite spending all her money on medical treat ment, none of the doctors had been able to help her and her condition hadn't improved at all; in fact, it had deteriorated. She'd heard about Jesus and, coming up behind him in the crowd, she touched his clothing, because she'd told herself, 'If I can only touch his coat I'll be healed!' Straightaway the flow of blood dried up, and she felt in her body that she'd been cured of her con dition. But Jesus, sensing that power had gone out of him, turned round to the crowd and said, 'Who touched my clothes?' His disciples said to him, ' You see the crowd milling around you, and you say, "Who touched me" !' But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it. The woman, con scious of what had happened to her, and trembling with fear, fell down before him and told him the whole truth. He said to her, 'Daughter, your faith has saved you. Go in peace and be free of your sufferings.' While he was speaking to her, some people came from the ruler of the synagogue's house and said, 'Your daughter has died; why bother the teacher any more?' Jesus overheard, and he said to the ruler of the syn agogue, 'Don't be afraid. Just have faith.' He allowed no one to accompany him except Peter, James, and James' brother John. They went into the house of the synagogue ruler, and he saw a great commotion, people crying and wailing. Going inside he said to them, 'Why are you weeping and making such a racket? The little girl is not dead; she's asleep.' They laughed at him but he threw them all out, and taking the child's mother and father along with his companions he went in to the child's room. Holding her hand, he said to her, ' Talitha koum,' which means ' Little girl, I'm telling you to wake up!' The girl got up immediately and started walking around. She was t welve years old. They were overcome with astonishment, but Jesus ordered them all to keep quiet about it, and he told them to give the child something to eat.

Chapter 6
Jesus, with his disciples in train, went from there to his home town, and on the Sabbath day he began to teach in the synagogue. Many of those who were listening to him were astonished, and were saying, ' Where did he get these things from? What wisdom has been given to him? He does the most amazing things! Isn't he the carpenter, the son of Mary and the brother of James, Joses, Judas and Simon? And aren't his sisters among us?' They were offended by him, and Jesus said to them, 'The only place a prophet isn't hon oured is in his home town and among his relatives and in his own house!' Apart from laying his hands upon a few sick people and curing them, he wasn't able to perform any works of power there. He was amazed at their lack of faith. He was teaching in the villages roundabout, and he called the twelve to him and, having given them authority over the unclean spirits, he began to send them out two by two. He ordered them to take nothing on the road except a staff; no bread, no bag, no money in their belts. They were to wear sandals, but they weren' t to wear two coats. He said to them, 'Where you go into a house, stay there until you leave the area. When you leave a com munity that hasn't welcomed you or listened to you, shake the dust from your feet as a testimony against them. I'm telling you the truth: on judge ment day it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town!' So they went out, preaching repentance, and they cast out many demons, and cured many sick people by anointing them with oil. Jesus' reputation was growing and a report of his activities reached King Herod, who thought that these amazing things were happening because John the Baptist had been raised from the dead. Others thought that it was Elijah, or a prophet like one of the prophets of old. When Herod heard of it he said, 'John, the one I beheaded, has been raised from the dead.' This self same Herod had sent for John, seized him, bound him and imprisoned him, on account of Herodias, the wife of Herod's brother Philip, whom Herod himself had married. John had told Herod that it wasn't lawful for him to take his brother's wife, and so Herodias held a grudge against him and wanted to kill him, but she wasn't able to. Herod was in awe of John because he knew him to be an upright and holy man, and he kept him safe. He would listen to him gladly, although he was puzzled by what he said. Hcrodias's opportu nity came when Herod threw a party on his birthday for his court, his h igh-ranking m i l i tary men, and tlw l ea d i ng citizens of

Galilee. When the daughter of Herodias carne in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests so much that the king said to the girl, ' Ask me for any thing you want and I'll give it to you!' He gave a solemn promise: 'Even if you ask for half my kingdom I'll give it to you!' She went out and said to her mother, 'What shall I ask for?' Her mother replied, 'The head of John the Baptist!' She rushed straight back to the king and said, 'I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter!' The king was very sad, but because of his oaths and his guests there was no way he could refuse her. Ht• dispatched an executioner with orders to bring John's head immediately. Hl• went off and beheaded him in the prison and brought the head on a platter and gave it to the girl, who gave it to her mother.

them, 'Go and see how many loaves you have.' When they'd found out they said, 'Five, and two fish.' He told the people to sit in groups on the green grass, so they sat down in groups of fifty or a hundred, looking like so many garden plots. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the bread and gave it to his disciples to distribute. He also divided up the two fish. They all ate their fill and, after five thou sand men had eaten, there was enough bread and fish left over to fill twelve baskets. Straight afterwards; Jesus urged his disciples to get into the boat and go on ahead to Bethsaida while he was releasing the crowd. Taking his leave of them, he went into the mountain to pray. It was evening and the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he was alone on the land. At about three o'clock in the morning, seeing that they were struggling to make headway because of a contrary wind, he went towards them walking upon the sea, as if he meant to go past them. Those who saw him walking on the water took him for a ghost and screamed out, because they all saw him and were very fright ened. But he began to speak to them straightaway. He said, 'Take heart! It's me! (Greek: ego eimi, literally "I am"). Don't be frightened!' He went up to them in the boat and the wind abated and they were all utterly astonished, because they hadn't understood about the loaves and their hearts were hard. Crossing over, they came to the land of Gennesaret where they dropped anchor, and as they were getting out of the boat the people recognized him and they carne running from the whole of that area carrying their sick about on stretchers to whatever spot they thought he might be. Wherever he was - in villages, in towns or in the countryside - they'd lay their sick in the mar ket places, and beg Jesus to allow them to touch just the hem of his robe. Those who did touch him were cured.
Chapter 7
The Pharisees and some teachers of the Law from Jerusalem carne to Jesus. They'd seen that some of his disciples were eating with defiled hands hands that had not been washed in the prescribed ritual way. The Pharisees and all the Jews don't eat unless they wash one hand with the clenched fist of the other, in the manner laid down by their ancestral traditions. Whenever they come from the market place they don't eat unless they bathe them selves, and they have many other traditions concerning the washing of cups and jugs and cooking pots. The Pharisees and the legal experts asked him, 'Why, in defiance of the ancestral traditions, do your disciples eat with unpurified hands?' Jesus

Appendix 1 : The Gospel ofMark
replied, 'Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites. He says, "These people honour me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. They worship me in vain, teaching man-made rules as doctrines." You ignore the commandment of God while faithfully observing human tradi tion.' He went on, 'You have a really smart way of setting aside God's com mandment so that you can keep your own tradition. Didn't Moses say, "Honour your father and your mother" ? And " Whoever speaks badly of father or mother deserves to die"? You, on the other hand, say that if a man tells his mother or father that any gift they might have expected from him is Corban - already offered to God - then he no longer needs to fulfil his obli gation to them! And so the customs you are observing and handing on nul lify God's word. And you are doing lots of things like this.' And calling the crowd to him again, he said to them, ' Listen all of you, and understand. There's nothing outside a man which can go inside him and make him ritually unclean; it's what comes out of a man that makes him unclean.' When he'd gone away from the crowd and entered the house, his dis ciples asked him what he meant. He said to them, 'Can't you understand either? Don't you realize that there's nothing which goes into a man which can make him unclean, because it doesn't penetrate the core of his being; it just goes into his stomach and then into the lavatory?' (So, Jesus was saying that all foods were 'clean' .) He went on, ' It's what comes out of a man that defiles him; from a person's very nature come bad thoughts, unchastity, theft, murder, adultery, greed, treachery, debauchery, envy, blasphemy, arrogance, senseless behaviour. All these evils come from inside a man and defile him.' From there Jesus went to the region of Tyre, and went into a house where he hoped to escape notice. But it wasn't possible for him to remain hidden for long, and a woman whose daughter was possessed by an evil spirit heard about him, and she came and fell down at his feet. She was a Greek - a Syro Phoenician - and she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter. He !'laid to her, 'Let the children be fed first; it's not right to take the children's l ood and throw it to the dogs.' She replied, 'Yes, Lord, but the dogs under t lw table eat the children's scraps!' And he said to her, ' Because of what you've just said, go on your way. The demon has left your daughter.' When !ihe went home she found the child lying on her bed, and the evil spirit had �one. Leaving the region of Tyre he went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, up t h rough the middle of the Oecapolis.

Taking him privately, away from the crowd, he placed his fingers in his ears, and touched his tongue with spittle. Looking up to heaven he sighed aloud as he said, 'Ephphatha!' (which means, ' Be opened !'). The man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosed, and he began to speak correctly. Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone, but the more he told them to keep quiet, the more they proclaimed it. They were completely amazed, saying, ' He's done everything well; he makes the deaf hear and the dumb speak!'
Chapter 8
In those days, when once again there was a big crowd of people with noth ing to eat, he called his disciples and said to them, ' I' m concerned about the crowd because they've been with me three days, and they've not eaten. If I send them off home hungry they'll faint on the way, and some of them come from far away. His disciples replied, 'Where can anyone get enough bread to satisfy these people in this lonely place?' Jesus asked them, ' How many loaves have you got?' 'Seven,' they said. He gave orders to the crowd to sit down on the ground, and taking the seven loaves he gave thanks, broke them and gave them to the disciples, who distributed them to the crowd. They also had a few little fish, and when he'd blessed them he told them to distribute these too. They ate their fill, and they collected up seven baskets full of leftovers. There were about four thousand men. Finally he let them all go. Immediately afterwards he got into the boat with his disciples and he came to the district of Dalmanutha. The Pharisees came to him and started asking him questions. They were looking for a sign from heaven, trying to test him. He sighed deeply and said, 'Why is this generation looking for a sign? I'm telling you the truth, no sign will be given to this generation.' Then he left them, got into the boat, and went off to the other side. They'd forgotten to bring bread; they only had one loaf with them in the boat. ' Be alert. Look out for the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod,' instructed Jesus. But they were discussing with one another the fact that they had no bread, and Jesus, realizing this, said to them, 'Why are you discussing the lack of bread? Don't you see and understand yet? Are you completely impervious to it all? Can't you see with your eyes, and hear with your ears? Don't you remember how many baskets of leftovers you collected after I shared the five loaves among the five thousand?' 'Twelve,' they said to him. ' And how many baskets did you fil l with leftovers when I shared the seven among the four thousand?' 'Seven,' they said to him. ' And you still don't u nderstan d ?' he sai d .

He said to them, 'I'm telling you the truth: there are some people standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God come in its power.' After six days Jesus took Peter, James and John by themselves up into a high mountain, where he was transfigured before them. His clothing shone with intense whiteness, a whiteness which no bleaching agent on earth could possibly match. Elijah and Moses appeared to them, and were talking with Jesus. Peter, dreadfully frightened like the others and not knowing what to say, responded with: 'Rabbi, it is wonderful for us to be here. Let us make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.' Then a voice issued from an overshadowing cloud: 'This is my son, the beloved. Listen to him!' Suddenly, looking round, they saw no one with them, only Jesus. As they were coming down the mountain Jesus sternly charged them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the son of man should rise from the dead. They kept his words to themselves, but they discussed among them selves what this 'rising from the dead' could mean. They began to question him. 'Why do the legal experts say that Elijah must come first?' they asked. Jesus said to them, 'Elijah does come first and is putting everything straight. But why do the scriptures say that the son of man must suffer many things and be treated with contempt? I'm telling you, Elijah has indeed come, and they've done to him all that they wanted, just as it has been written of him.' When they reached the other disciples they noticed that they were argu ing with some legal experts, surrounded by a huge crowd. As soon as the crowd caught sight of Jesus they were amazed, and they ran towards him and began to greet him. He said to them, 'What are you arguing with them about?' One of the crowd answered, 'Teacher, I brought my son to you because he has a spirit of dumbness, and whenever it seizes him it throws him down and he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth, and he's wasting away.* I asked your disciples to cast it out, but they weren' t powerful enough.' He answered them, '0 faithless generation! How long must I put up with you? Bring him here!' They brought him, and when the spirit saw him it immediately threw the lad into convulsions. He fell to the ground and was rolling about, foaming at the mouth. Jesus asked his father, 'How long has this been going on?' He replied, 'Since he was a little child. Many times it has thrown him into the fire and into the water in order to destroy him. If you can do anything, have pity on us and help us.' Jesus said to him, ' If you

can! Everything is possible to someone who has faith!' Straightaway, the boy's father cried out, 'I do have faith! Help my lack of faith!' When Jesus noticed that a crowd was bearing down upon them, he rebukt.>ti the unclean spirit, saying, 'Deaf and dumb spirit, I order you to come out of him, and never enter him again!' With a shriek, the spirit sent the lad into ter rible convulsions, and came out. The young man looked as if he was dead, but Jesus, taking him by the hand, raised him, and he stood up. When they went into a house, the disciples asked him privately, 'Why weren't we able to cast it out?' He said to them, 'Nobody can cast out this kind except by prayer.' From there they went on their way through Galilee, and Jesus didn't want anyone to know about it. He was teaching his disciples, 'The son of man is being delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him, but three days afterwards he will rise up.' They didn't understand what he meant, and were afraid to ask him.
VIRGO
Virgo is Mutable Earth, and is the sign ofthe harvest. Its symbol is the Maiden witl1 tl1e Wheatsheaf In Egypt the sign was associated with the goddess Isis, who is t�{krr depicted carrying the infant Horus, and the sign has strong connections witl1 cl1ild· lwod. Its keywords are service, humility, simplicity, purity, characteristics of till" Virgin Mary, whose birthday is celebrated on 8 September, when the sun is in tilt' centre of Virgo. The decans of Virgo are Coma (the Infant), Centaurus (flu· Centaur), and Bootes (tlte Shepherd).
·n,ey came to Capemaum, and when he was inside the house he asked them, 'What were you arguing about on the road?' But they were silent, becaust• on the road they had been arguing about who was the greatest. When he'd sat down, he called the twelve and said to them, 'If anyone wants to be first, he will be the last of all, and the servant of all.' He took a little child, and stood him in their midst. Taking him in his arms, he said to them, 'Whoever receives a child such as this in my name, receives me; and whoever receives me, is not only receiving me, he is also receiving the one who sent me.'*
• A few verses after Luke's account of this incident with the children, he has )<.>sus say, 'Ttw
h..rvcst is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field' (Luke10:2, NJV). Matthew's version of the parable of the Lost <;h,�p occurs just after Jesus has spoken about children. 'What do you think?

John said to him, 'We saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we stopped him because he wasn't of our company.' Jesus said, 'Don't stop him. Nobody who does a powerful work in my name will then be able to slander me. Whoever is not opposed to us is on our side. I'm teUing you the truth: whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name of Christ won't go unrewarded. But it would be better for him who puts obstacles in the way of one of these little ones who believe in me to be thrown into the sea with a huge millstone tied around his neck! If your hand causes you to fall, cut it off! It's better to enter into life maimed than with both hands to go into Gehenna, into the inextinguishable fire. And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off! It's better for you to enter into life lame than to be thrown with both feet into Gehenna. And if your eye causes you to fall, pluck it out! It's better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than to be thrown with both eyes into Gehenna, where the worm doesn't die, and the fire is never put out! Everyone will be salted with fire; salt is good, but if ever it loses its saltiness, what will you use to make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and live in peace with one another.'
LIBRA
Libra, the Balance, is the sign ofthe autumn equinox, when day and night are equal. It is associated witlt relationships and marriage, and has been called 'tlte sign ofcos mic reciprocity'. Its mler is Venus, the goddess oflove. The Greeks called it Zugos, 'the Yoke', and in Egypt it was represented by the goddess Ma'at, who judged the dead, weighing their souls in the balance: those who passed Iter test were said to be 'light hearted'; those who Jailed were 'heavy hearted'. Its decans are the Cross, the Victim, and the Crmun.
Chapter 10
From there he went into the region of Judea, and across the Jordan. Once again a crowd gathered round him, and once again he taught them. And Pharisees were asking him if it was lawful for a man to divorce his wife; they were testing him. He replied, 'What command did Moses give you?' They said, 'Moses allowed divorce by the writing of a divorce certificate.' Jesus said to them, ' It was because of your spiritual immaturity that he wrote you this commandment. From the beginning of creation God made them male and female. Because of this, a man will leave his father and his mother and cleave to his wife, and the two will become om.• flesh, so that they are no

Ht• said to them, 'Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her. And if a woman divorces her husband and marrit•s another man, she commits adultery.' They brought children to him so that he might touch them, but his disciples warned them off. But noticing this Jesus was annoyed, and he said to tht•m, 'Let the children come to me, and don't prevent them, because the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. I'm telling you the truth, whoever does not accept the kingdom of God like a little child won't enter it.' And taking t lwm in his arms, he blessed them. When he'd gone back on to the road, a man came running towards him. He fell on his knees before him and said, 'Good teacher, what should I do in order to inherit eternal life?' Jesus said to him, 'Why do you call me good ? No one is good except God alone. You know the commandments: don't murder, don't commit adultery, don't steal, don't tell lies, don't ddmud, honour your father and your mother.' He replied, 'Teacher, I've kt•pt .1 1 1 these from m y youth.' Jesus, gazing a t him, warmed towards him, and said, 'l11ere's only one thing you need. Sell what you have and give it to thl· poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. And come, follow me!' But the young man was upset by what Jesus said, and he went away sor rowfully because he was a man of great wealth. Looking round, Jesus said to his disciples, 'How difficult it is for a very wealthy person to entl•r tlw kingdom of God!' His disciples were astonished at his words, but Jesus told them again, 'Children, how difficult it is to go into the kingdom of God! I t's t•asier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to l'nter into the kingdom of God.' They were extremely shocked, and said to one another, 'Who can be saved then?' Looking intently at them, Jesus said, " With men it's i mpossible, but not with God. Everything is possible with Cod.' Peter began to say to him, 'Look. We left everything and haw fol lowed you.' Jesus said, Tm telling you the truth, there's no one who has ldt ,, house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my .,,,kc and the sake of the good news who won't now receive a hundred tinws rnore houses, brothers, sisters, mothers and children and fields (with �wrse nr tion), and in the coming age, eternal life!

' Look,' he said, 'We are going to Jerusalem, and the son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and the legal experts, and they will condemn him to death and hand him over to the Gentiles and they will make fun of him, and spit on him, and scourge him and kill him, and after three days he will rise up.'
SCORPIO
The sign ofhidden power, death, regeneration, expiation, purgation, sexuality, and spiritual initiation into the deep mysteries oflife. It concerns the hidden connections between living and dead. Hallowe'en is celebrated on 31 October, when tile sun is in Scorpio. Its decans are Serpens (the Serpent), Ophiuchus (the Serpent Holder), and Hercules. A passage from what appears to have been a longer version of Mark is appropriately placed here, as is part of what is called 'the longer ending'. A t this point in tile narrative jesus and the apostles are approaching jericho, the lowest point on the earth's surface; this is appropriatefor the 'descent into the depths' which Scorpio symbolizes.
*James and John, the sons of Zebedee, approached him saying, 'Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask.' Jesus said to them, 'What do you want me to do for you?' They said to him, 'Allow one of us to sit on your right hand and one on your left hand in your glory.' Jesus said to them, 'You don't know what you are asking! Are you able to drink the cup which I shall drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I shall be baptized?' They said to him, 'We are able!' Jesus said to them, 'The cup I shall drink you shall drink, and the baptism I shall undergo, you shall undergo, but to sit on my right or on my left is not in my gift; it's for those for whom it has been prepared.' When they heard this, the other ten began to be annoyed at James and John and, calling them together, Jesus said to them, 'You know that those who consider themselves leaders among the Gentiles lord it over them, and the greatest among them exercise dominance. Well, that's not the way it is among you. No. Whoever wants to become great among you will be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you will be a slave of all.
* The passage from the 'secret' Gospel of Mark occurs at this point: And IIIey come into Betlrany. And a certain woman whose brother lracl died was there. And, coming, she prostrated herself before Jesus and [says/ to /rim, 'Son of David, /rave mercy orr me. ' B u t the disciples rebrtked lrer.

Hearing that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and say, 'Son of David, have mercy on me!' Many people told him to keep qu it•t, but he cried out all the more, 'Son of David, have mercy on me!' Jesu� stopped and said, 'Call him.' They called the blind man, saying, 'Cheer up and get up. He's calling you.' Throwing off his coat, he jumped up and WL•nt to Jesus. Jesus said in response, 'What do you want me to do for you?' Tlw blind man said to him, 'Rabbi, let me see again!' And Jesus said to him, 'Co. Your faith has saved you.' And at once he could see, and he followed Jesus on the road.
SAGITTARIUS
Sagittarius is the Archer or the Centaur, and is the third ofthe Fire sigr�s. It i:; a:;sll ciated with zeal, foreigners, travel, horses and religion. Notice how Mark says tlwt Jesus rides into Jerusalem on a young unbroken horse, before zealously vmtin� lri!i spleen on the hypocritical religious activity of the Temple. Two of its deca"s - Lym (tire Eagle or Lyre) and Draco (the Dragon) - do not appear to be significant, /rut tlrere is a clear allusion to the third, Ara (the Altar, in Latin; tl1e Curse, in Grt!c!k).
Chapter ll
When they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany towards tlw Mount of Olives, he sent out two of his disciples. He said to them, 'Go i nto the village opposite, and as soon as you enter it you will find a tethered colt on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it. If anyone asks you what you are up to, tell them that your master needs it, and he will send it straight back.' They went off and found the young horse tied up by the door outside, w here two roads meet, and they untied it. Some of those standing there said to them, 'Why are you untying the horse?' They replied as Jesus had i n structed them and they were allowed to go. They took the colt to Jesus .1nd placed their coats on it. Jesus mounted it. And many people spread

Blessed is the one who is coming in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the com ing kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest!' He went into Jerusalem, to the Temple, and when he'd looked round at everything he went off to Bethany with the twelve because it was already late. The next day, as they were leaving Bethany, he was hungry, and seeing a distant fig tree in leaf he went to see if he could find anything on it. But he found nothing but leaves, because it wasn't the fig season. He said to it, 'May no one eat fruit from you ever again!' and his disciples heard him. They came to Jerusalem and, going into the Temple area, he began to throw out those who were buying and selling in the Temple, and he over turned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. And he wouldn't allow anyone to carry their goods through the Temple. He taught them: ' Isn't it written, " My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations?" You have turned it into a den of thieves!' The chief priests and the lawyers heard of it, and they looked for a way to kill him; but they were scared because the crowd were amazed by his teaching. And when evening came, they went out of the city. Early the next day, as they were passing along, they saw the fig tree withered to its roots. Peter remembered, and said to him: 'Rabbi, look. The fig tree which you cursed has withered!' In reply, Jesus said to them, 'Have faith in God. I'm telling you the truth. Whoever says to this mountain " Be lifted up and thrown into the sea!" and who has no doubt in his mind but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him! Because of this I say to you whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that it is yours and it will be! And whenever you are praying, if you are holding a grudge against somebody, forgive him, so that your father in heaven may forgive you your failings.'
CAPRICORN
The sign of the win ter solstice, wizen tire sun changes direction once more. It is tire Cardinal Earth sign, ruled by the planet Sah1rn and connected with political and social structures, conven tion, propriety, au thority, and tlze father. It was the moon sign of tlze Emperor A ugustus, and the image of Capricorn appeared on a denarius du ring his reign. In this section of Mark, Jesus is shown in disp u te witlr all the au thority figu res in lsracl, and in the corresponding passage in Matt!IL"w he says, 'Call 110 man 011 eartlr your_{tlfher.

They came to Jerusalem again and as he walked around in the Temple.• precincts some of the chief priests, l awyers and elders came up to him. Tlwy were asking him, 'Where do you get your a uthority to do what you do? W ho gave it to you?' Jesus replied, Til ask you a question. Answer me and I ' l l tl•ll you in what kind of a uthority I do a l l these things. Was John's baptism from heaven or from men? Answer me!' They discussed the matter with onl' another. 'If we say that it was from heaven, he'l l ask us why we didn' t believe him. But we can't really say that it was from men either . ..' (Tiwy were frightened of the crowd because everybody considered John to he.• a prophet.) So they said in reply, 'We don't know.' Jesus said to them, ' Nor am I going to tell you by what authority I do what I do.'

He began to speak to them in parables. ' A man planted a vineyard and lw fenced it, and dug a wine trough and built a tower. He let it out to v i nl' dressers and went on his travels. At the appropriate time he sent a slaVl' to collect some of the fruits of his vineyard from his tenants. But thl'Y look h i m and beat him a n d sent him off empty-handed.

The tenants said to one another, "This is the heir. Come on, IL•t's k i l l h i m and the inheritance w i l l b e ours!" They took him and killed h im and threw him out of the vineyard. So, what will the owner of the vi neyard do? He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to ntht>rs. Didn't you ever read this scripture: "The stone which the builders rejt•ctl•d has become the cornerstone. This comes from the Lord and is marvel lous i n our eyes"?' They were seeking t o seize him, but they were afraid of tlw crow d because they knew that he'd spoken this parable against them. So I hey left him and went on their way. But they sent some Pharisees and supporters of Herod to him, so that they muld entrap him in his speech. They came and said to him, 'Teacher, Wt' know t hat you are sincere and that you don't bother what other pt.>ople think of you. You don't judge on appearances, but you teach the way of God truthfully. Is it l.twful to pay the poll tax to Caesar? Should we pay it or not?'

Some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him and asked him, 'Teacher, Moses gave us the rule that if anyone's brother dies and leaves a childless wife, the man should take the woman as his own wife and raise up offspring on behalf of his brother. There were seven brothers and the first took a wife and then died without producing any children. So the second took her and then he died childless, and so did the third. All seven in fact died childless. Finally the woman herself died. In the resurrection, whose wife will she be? All seven were married to her.' Jesus said to them, 'Isn't this where you make a mistake? You know neither the scriptures nor the power of God! When they rise from the dead they won't be married; they will be like angels in heaven. About the dead being raised: haven't you read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God said to him, " I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." He is not the God of the dead but of the living. You are greatly mistaken.' One of the Jewish legal experts, who had heard the disputes and who thought that Jesus had given sound answers, asked him, ' Which command ment is the most important?' Jesus answered, 'The most important one is " Hear, 0 Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul and all your mind and all your strength." The second is this: "You shall love your neighbour as you love yourself." There's no greater commandment.' The lawyer said, 'Teacher, you spoke the truth. He is one and there is no other. And to love him with all the heart and with all your mind and with all your strength, and to love your neighbour as yourself - this is greater than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.' Jesus saw that he answered sensibly and said to him, 'You aren't far from the kingdom of God.' Nobody dared to question him any more. As Jesus was teaching in the Temple precincts, he said: 'Why do the legal experts say that the Christ is the son of David? David himself, inspired by the holy spirit, said, "The Lord said to my lord, Sit on my right hand till I put your enemies under your feet." David himself calls him " Lord", so how is he his son?' A large crowd heard him with pleasure. And in his teaching he said, 'Look out for the legal experts, who want to walk around in long robes, and who want greetings in the market places and the most important seats in the synagogues, and places of honour at meals They gobble up the houses of widows but offer long prayers to hide their iniquity. They will receive the greater condemnation.'*
• At this point Matthew adds, But you are not to be called 'Rabbi'. for you have only one Master, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth 'father' for you have onl' Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called 'teacher', for you have om• TPacher, thl• Christ (Matthew 2.1:8-10, NIV).

And sitting down opposite the Temple treasury, he saw how the crowd threw coppers into the offertory box. Many rich people were throwing in large sums, but a poor widow came and threw two small copper coins, which together make about a penny. Calling his disciples to him, he said to them, 'I'm telling you the truth. This poor widow has put more than all thl• others into the offertory box. They all gave from their surplus; but slu�. despite her need, gave all she had to live on.'

Sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the Temple, Peter, James, John and Andrew asked him privately, 'Tell us, when will these things happen? What will be the sign that all these things are abou t to take place?' And Jesus began to tell them. 'Be careful that no one misleads you. Many will come i n my name saying 'Tm the one", and many will g o astray. Whenever you hear of wars and reports of wars, don't be alarmed. These things must take plan•, but the end is not yet.

because of my name, but whoever holds out to the end will be saved. When you see the abomination of desolation standing where it ought not to be (let the reader understand), then let those in Judea flee to the mountains. Let the man on the housetop not come down; neither let him go into the house to take anything out. And let the man in the field not turn back to fetch his coat. Pity those who are pregnant or who are suckling babies in those days! Pray that it doesn' t happen in winter, because in those days there will be dis tress the like of which has not occurred from the time of the creation right up until now. Nor will it happen again. And if the Lord hadn't shortened the days no human being would be saved, but because of those whom he has chosen he has shortened the days. If at that time someone says to you, " Look, the Christ is here" or "There he is", don't believe it, because false Christs and false prophets will rise up and give such convincing demonstra tions of their power that, if it were possible, even the elect would be fooled! Keep watch, then! I've warned you about everything. But after the distress of those days, the sun will be darkened and the moon will not shine. The stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken, and then they will see the son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory.* And then he will send out the angels and gather together his chosen ones from the four comers of the earth, from the farthest bounds of earth to the farthest bounds of heaven. Learn a lesson from the fig tree: when its branch becomes tender and the leaves appear, you know that summer is near. So when you see these things taking place you will know that the end is near, at the door al most. I'm telling you the truth: this generation will not disappear until all these things have occurred; heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. But as far as timing is concerned, no one knows, neither the angels in heaven nor the son; only the Father knows. Watch! Be alert! For you don't know when the time is. It's like a man travelling abroad; he leaves his house in the care of his servants, giving each of them a particular task; he tells the doorkeeper to keep watch. So, you keep watch, because you don't know when the lord of the household is coming whether late in the evening, at midnight, or at cock-crow, or in the morning! You don't want him to come suddenly and find you sleeping! What I am saying to you I am saying to everyone: "Watch!"'

While Jesus was in Bethany, eating a meal at the house of Simon the lcpt.•r, a woman came in carrying an alabaster jar full of very expensive perfU Jnt'd oil, pure nard. Breaking open the jar, she poured the oil on his head, to tht• great annoyance of some of those present. 'Why this waste of the perfu ml•d oil? It's worth a year's wages. I t could have been sold and the money given to the poor.' They were very indignant. But Jesus said, ' Leave her alone. Why are you bothering her? She's dnnt• a lovely thing for me. The poor are always with you, and you can always do good to them whenever you want to, but you won't always have me around. She has done what she could. She has anointed my body in antici pation of my burial. I'm telling you the truth, wherever the good news is preacht•d throughout the world, what this woman has done will be spoken of. She will be remembered for it.' Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests in ordt•. r to betray Jesus to them. They were delighted, and promised to pay him, so he began looking for a suitable time to hand him over. On the first day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb was cus tomarily slaughtered, his disciples said to him, 'Where do you want us to go to prepare the Passover meal for you to eat?' He sent off two of his disciples, saying, 'Go into the city, where a man carrying a jar of water will meet you . Follow him, and say to the master of whichever house he enters, " Where is my guest room, where I might eat the Passover with my disciples?" He' ll show you a large upper room, equipped and ready. Prepare for us there.' The disciples left for the city and found everything just as Jesus had said; .md they prepared the Passover.
PISCES
l111• Two Fish. Pisces is Mutable Water and is the sign in which tl1e s11n 'dies' before /tcing 'born anew' at the spring equinox when it enters A ries once again. R11led by Jupiter, it is a sign ofextreme sensitivity and llem.?volence, but it was also associated "' tlu• ancient world with secret enemies, betrayal, cowardice, diffidmce, sleep, .lrtmns, all of which appear it1 this final, lengthy section of the Gospel. The three dt·nms are The Band, Cepheus (tlw King), and Andromeda (flu• Cltai11ed Woman). IIPIII Cepheus a11d Aruiromeda are clearly referred to in flit' story of the crucifixicm.

will betray me.' They were greatly saddened by this, and said to him, one after another, 'It's not me, is it?' Jesus said to them, 'It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping into the same dish with me. The son of man is going away, just as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the son of man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he hadn't been born!' As they were eating, he took a loaf, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to them. He said, 'Take this. It is my body.' And he took the cup, offered thanks, and gave it to them. They all drank from it. He said to them, 'This is my blood of the covenant which is shed for many. I'm telling you the truth: I shall not drink the fruit of the vine again until I drink it new in the king dom of God.' When they had sung a hymn they went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said to them, 'You will all desert me, because it is written, "I shall strike the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered." But when I have been raised up I shall go ahead of you into Galilee.' Peter said to him, 'Even if all the others desert you, I won't!' Jesus said to him, 'I'm telling you this: today, this very night, before a cock crows twice, you will disown me three times.' But Peter protested vehemently, 'Even if I have to die with you, I won't deny you!' And the rest said the same. They went to a place called Gethsemane and he said to his disciples, 'Sit down here while I pray.' He took Peter, James and John with him, and he began to be distressed and troubled. He said to them, 'My soul is over whelmed with deadly grief. Stay here, and stay awake.' He walked on a little before falling to the ground, praying that, if possible, the hour might pass from him. He said, 'Abba, father! All things are possible to you. Take this cup from me; but not what I want, what you want.' He came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, 'Simon, are you asleep? Didn't you have the strength to stay awake for one hour? Stay awake and pray that you won't be tempted. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.' He went off again and prayed as before, and when he returned once more he found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They didn't know what to say to him. He came back a third time and said to them, 'You are asleep, and taking your rest. But that's enough. It's time. Look, the son of man is being handed over to sinners. Get up and let's be going. See, my betrayer has approached.' While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came straight up to him. He was accompanied by a crowd from the chief priests, scribes and elders, and they were carrying swords and clubs. His betrayer had given them an agreed signal: 'The one I kiss is the one (you want). Grab him and take him off under guard.' Coming up to him he said, ' Rabbi!' and he kissed

him. So they grabbed hold of him. However, one of those standing by drew his sword and struck the high priest's slave, cutting off his ear. Jesus said to them, 'Have you come to arrest me with swords and clubs as you would arrest a robber? Day after day I was with you in the Temple and you didn't arrest me. But let it be, so that the scriptures may be fulfilled.' And they all abandoned him and fled, but a young man wearing just a linen sheet over his naked body followed him. They grabbed at him, but he left his linen sheet behind and ran off naked. They led Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, legal experts and elders were assembled. Peter followed him at a distance as far as the court yard of the high priest, where he was sitting with the servants warming himself by the fire. The chief priests and the whole council were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could execute him, but they couldn' t find any. Many people were telling lies about him, but their evidence was conflicting. Some stood up and lied that they had heard him say, 'I shall destroy this temple made with hands and after three days build one not made with hands.' But their testimonies did not agree even about this. The high priest stood up the middle of them all and questioned Jesus. ' Have you nothing to say in reply? What is it that these people are saying against you?' Jesus was silent; he didn't reply at all. So the high priest asked him, 'Are you the Christ, the son of the Blessed One?' Jesus said, ' I am, and you will see the son of man sitting at the right hand of power, coming with the clouds of heaven.' The high priest tore his own garments and said, ' We don't need any more witnesses. You heard the blasphemy! What's your ver dict?' They all judged him deserving of death. Some started to spit at him, to rover up his face, and to strike him, all the while saying, 'Prophesy!' Slapping his face, the attendants took him away. One of the high priest's servant girls saw Peter as he was warming him Hl'lf. She looked closely at him and said, 'You were with the Nazarene, with It-sus!' But Peter denied it. 'I don't know what you're talking about,' he said . l ie went outside into the porch and the cock crowed. The servant girl spot h•d h i m and began to say to those standing around, 'This is one of them!' l 'l·ter denied it again. A little later the bystanders said to Peter, 'Yes, you arc llllC of them. You're from Galilee!' Peter started to curse and swear. 'I don't know the man you're talking about!' he said. Immediately the cock crowed ol SlX"Ond time, and Peter remembered that Jesus had told him, ' Before the nJck crows twice, you will deny me three times.' And throwing his cloak olround his head he brokl' down and wept.

17te Gospel and tl1e Zodiac
Chapter 15
Very early in the morning, the chief priests, the elders and the legal experts - the whole Sanhedrin, in fact - held a meeting. They bound Jesus and took him off and handed him over to Pilate, who asked him, 'Are you the king of the Jews?' Jesus replied, 'Those are your words.' But the chief priests were accusing him of many things, so Pilate questioned him again. ' Have you nothing to say for yourself? See how many things they are accusing you of.' But Jesus said nothing, and Pilate was amazed. It was the custom for Pilate to release to the people a prisoner of their own choosing. There was a man called Barabbas, imprisoned with his fellow revolutionaries, who had committed murder in the rebellion. The crowd came up and began to petition Pilate to carry out the customary procedure, and he replied by saying, 'Do you want me to release the king of the Jews to you?' He realized that the chief priests had handed him over out of spite. But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to ask for Barabbas instead. Once again, Pilate answered them, 'So, what shall I do with the one you call the king of the Jews?' Again they cried out, 'Crucify him!' Pilate said to them, ' Why? What has he done wrong?' They shouted out all the more, ' Crucify him!' Pilate, wishing to please the crowd, released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus whipped, and then handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers took him into the courtyard inside the palace, the Praetorium, and they called the entire detachment of soldiers together. They dressed him in purple, plaited some thorns into a crown, and placed it on his head. They started to salute him: 'Greetings, king of the Jews!' they said, and they were cuffing him round his head with a reed and spitting on him. Kneeling before him, they paid him homage. When they'd finished making fun of him, they stripped the purple robe from him and dressed him in his own clothes. Then they led him out to crucify him. They forced a passer-by to carry his cross. It was Simon of Cyrene (the father of Alexander and Rufus), who was coming in from the field. They took him to Golgotha, which means 'The Place of the Skull', and they offered him wine drugged with myrrh, but he wouldn't take it. They crucified him, and they shared out his clothing, casting lots to see who would take what. It was nine o'clock in the morning when they crucified him. The inscribed charge against him read, 'The king of the Jews.' And they crucified two thieves with him, one on his right, and one on his left. Thost•
who passed by hurled abuse at him, shaking their heads and saying, · Aha! You were goi ng to tl'ar down tlw Temple and build i t up again i n th ree day�.

were you? Well, save yourself by getting down off the cross!' Similarly, tlw chief priests and the lawyers were joining in the fun, saying, 'He saved otht'rs, but he can't save himself! Let's see the Christ, the king of Israel come down from the cross now! We'd believe him then!' Even those who were bein� crucified with him were jeering at him. At about noon, darkness fell on the whole earth and lasted until thn•t• o'clock in the afternoon, at which time Jesus cried aloud, 'Eioi, eloi, lama sabakhthani', which means, 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken nw?' Some of those standing by heard it and said, 'Look! He's calling Elijah!' Someone put a sponge with sour wine on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, 'Let's see if Elijah will come to take him down.' But, with a loud cry. Jesus died, and the Temple curtain split in two, top to bottom. A centurion standing opposite him as he died said, 'This man was certainly a son ol God!' Some women were looking on from a distance. Among them was Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the mother of the younger James, Joses and Salonw. These had been with him, and had taken care of him, when he was in Galilee; and there were many others who had come up to Jerusalem w ith him. It was already evening, and since it was the day of preparation, that is tlw day before the Sabbath, Joseph of Arimathea, a respected council membt•r, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, plucked up the coura�e to go to Pilate and ask for the body of Jesus. Pilate was amazed that Jesus could be dead so soon, so he called the centurion and asked him whetlwr jesus was, in fact, dead. Assured that this was the case, he granted the body to Joseph, who took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth which ht� had bought. He placed him in a tomb which had been hewn out of rock, and lw rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. Mary Magdalene and Mary tlw mother of Joses saw where he had been put.
Chapter 16
When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene and Mary the motht•r tlf J,unes and Salome bought spices with which to anoint him. Very early in thl· morning on the first day of the week they came to the tomb. The sun had l'ist•n. They were saying to each other, 'Who will roll away the stone from tht• door of the tomb for us?' But when they looked up they saw that the stone h.1d aln•ady lx•en rol ll'd away, t•vcn though i t was very large.

looking for Jesus the Nazarene, the one who was crucified; but he has been raised up. He's not here. See the place where they laid him. Go and tell his disciples and Peter that he is going on ahead to Galilee. You will see him there, just as he told you.' When they came out they ran away from the tomb because they were trembling with astonishment. And they said nothing to anyone because they were afraid.
(The Gospel ends at this point. Alternative endings appear in most Bibles but these are much later additions. It is possible, however, that at least one verse from these belonged to the original text. See the Scorpio section above.)

The Gospel and the Zodiac
c. The Signs of the Zodiac and Parts of the Body
Manilius's attributions are the traditional ones:
For as in Man, the Work of Hands Divine, Each member lies allotted to a Sign; And as the Body is the common Care Of all the Signs, each Limb enjoys a Share: The Ram defends the Head, the Neck the Bull, The Arms bright Twins are subject to your Rule; I' th' Shoulders Leo, and the Crab's obey'd I'th Breast, and in the Guts the modest Maid; l'th Buttocks, Libra, Scorpio warms Desires I'th secret Parts, and spreads unruly Fires; The Thighs, the Centaur, and the Goat commands The Knees, and binds them up with double Bands. The parted Legs, in cold Aquarius meet, And Pisces gives protection to the Feet. (Manilius, T11e Five Books, page 141)
d . The Constellations of the Sky and their Decans
These are taken directly from Seiss's work The Gospel in tile Stars (pages 1720). The decans are the constellations which are around the zodiacal constel lations and rise with them. Seiss bases his attribution of decans to zodiacal constellation on the work of the Arab astronomer, Albumazer, who lived about a thousand years ago. Manitius attributes them differently (I11e Five Books, pages 157-176). I have generally followed Seiss.
Aries, the Ram: by some nations called the Lamb: the figure of a strong sheep with powerful, curved horns, lying down in easy composure, and looking out in conscious strength over the field around it. The Decans of Aries I . Cassiopeia, the woman enthroned; 2. Cetus, the Sea Monster, closely and strongly bound by the Lamb; 3.
