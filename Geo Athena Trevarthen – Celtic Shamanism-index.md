ABSTRACT
Early Irish literature, other Celtic literatures and later folklore are rich with
descriptions of personal contact with the sacred. The Otherworld, or spiritual aspect of
reality, is a constant and vivid presence in the legends. This reality does not seem
distant, but rather, always ready to break through into physical reality, transforming
those who encounter it. In earlier times, druids, and sometimes heroes and saints, seem
to function fully as shamans as described by Mircea Eliade in his definitive work on
shamanism, undertaking spirit journeys into the Otherworld. and returning with gifts
for their people.
In later times, when overtly primal shamanic practice was increasingly repressed,
personal contact with the sacred became in many cases less defined and more
individual. However, we continue to see contact with the Otherworld in folklore.
hagiography and the mystical experiences fostered by later spiritual movements.
While scholars such as Carey, Nagy and Melia have recognised and explored
some of the shamanic themes present in Early Irish literature, the full complex of these
themes, along with their implications for our understanding of Early Irish and Celtic
culture, have not yet been h l l y examined.
A holistic approach to these difficult issues indicates that one must not just
dissect the texts themselves for meaning, but take into account the research of
archaeologists, anthropologists, psychologists and neuroscientists as well as Celticists.
By doing so, I hope to show not only the evidence for Celtic shamanism itself, but
suggest possible fbnctions of shamanic experience in Early Irish, and more broadly,
Celtic culture, Because shamanic traditions typically have a clear cosmology and ideas
about spiritual growth, I have also considered if the early Irish and, more broadly, the
Celts may have had such a cosmology and ideas of harmonising with the sacred they
came into such intense contact with.

INTRODUCTION
THEWELL OF THE PAST
Very deep is the well of the past. Should we not call it bottomless? The deeper we sound, thefurther down into the lower world o f t h e past we probe ...the more do we find that the earliest.foundations qf humanity, its history and culture, reveal themselves unfathomable.
Thomas Mann‘
The well with theJive streamsflowingfrom it that you saw is the source o f knowledge, and the streams are the-fivesenses through which knowledge is grasped. No one will have co-creative power that does not drinkfrom the source or its streams. Those who can create in many ways have drunkfrom all ofthem.
h!ananniin‘sdescription of the Fell of R‘isdom in “EchtraeCormaic ”’
Seeing Celtic shamanism requires us to fathom the well of the past and
drink kom all its streams. It requires looking at, and with, many modes of
perception. It requires the tools of anthropology, psychobiology, religious history,
mythology and psychology as well as those of Celtic ~cholarship.~
It also requires the humility to heed Mann’s warning and admit at the outset
that the well is to some extent unfathomable. To enter the hearts and minds of
ancient people is to invoke a paradigm shift we can never really be sure we’ve
made.
We can compare the myths, symbols and folk tradition of Celtic culture
with others at apparently similar stages of development and cautiously investigate
potential meanings. We can scrutinise the archaeological record and classical
authors’ descriptions for clues. We can also, as Campbell and others have
suggested, look to the human psychosomatic system for “structures or dynamic
tendencies to which the origin of myth and ritual might be referred” in the earliest
times4

In shamanism we examine one of the earliest strata of human ritual and
spiritual behaviour, one that may be a source for much of the mythic literature in
Celtic and other tradition^.^
Although some scholars have deemed shamanism “primitive,” it can lead to
sublime experiences of spiritual revelation-the kind of transcendent, life-changing
experiences that appear in Celtic literature.
These experiences can be referred to as shamanistic or shamanic, depending
on the person involved. I have used the term “shamanistic” for activities which may
be carried out by somebody other than a shaman, and “shamanic” for activities
carried out by a shaman. I will generally use the term “shamanistic” below.
However, when the evidence strongly indicates that a figure is acting in the role of
shaman for his community, I will refer to his or her activities as “shamanic.”
SHAMANISM AND ANIMISM
Shamanistic cultures have an animistic world-view. Animism essentially
means that there is no such thing as an inanimate object, that everything is imbued
with Spirit. Tylor developed this concept in Primitive Culture, and since then there
have been various approaches taken to it! One of the most important changes is
that some anthropologists no longer believe, as Tylor theorised, that animists see
the world “erroneously and childishly,” and that only science yields “true”
knowledge of the world.’
Everything is seen as having some degree of consciousness in an animistic
culture. Animism attributes “life or divinity to such natural phenomena as trees,
thunder, or celestial bodies.”’ We definitely see this approach reflected in what we
know of ancient Celtic religion as well.
It is generally accepted that the basic perception underpinning the religion of
the pagan Celts was that the gods were everywhere: the landscape was full of spirits.
Thus, every tree, spring, lake, river and mountain was numinous. All over Celtic
Europe, there is evidence of the very close association between the Celts and their
5 See Glosecki, 1989. Eliade, 1964, p. 7 6 Tylor. 1958. (first printed 1871). For a review of current thinking on animism. see Bird-David, 1999 7 Bird-David, 1999. p. S68 8 Hunter and Whitten. 1976. p. 12

natural worldwhich was,to them, full of supernatural energy, energy which could do
humankind good or evil, and therefore needed to be controlled or neutralised.’
The shaman is the specialist who “controls or neutralises” these energies in
animistic cultures. The word “shaman” comes to us through Tungus Siberian,
though scholars have argued that it originates anywhere fiom a Turkic-Mongolian
language to Pali or Sanskrit. In Tungus saman means one who is “excited, moved,
raised,” but the word shaman may also be related to a word meaning, “to know.’”1o
Analogues have been found in Tokharian. In this Indo-European language, sdmme
means a “Buddhist monk.” The term “shamanism” has been applied to a wide
range o fphenomena.l 1
I define shamanism as a body o f techniques that bring the individual into a
personal and interactive contact with the spiritual aspect o f reality.12 Shamanistic
experiences may also arise spontaneously, without being sought through specific
techniques.
I hope to prove that in pre-Christian times there were people in Cehic
culture hctioning hlly as shamans in the classical sense, as described by Mircea
Eliade, in his defmitivework, Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy.
ELUDE’SMODEL
I have generally followed Elide’s model with some adaptations based on
more recent research and the special demands o f Celtic materials. In Elide’s book,
some subjects, such as the spirit journey, tend to be covered throughout,
overlapping with other topics.
After discussing the general features o f shamanism in chapter one of his
book, Eliade describes the shaman’s initiatory illness in chapter two. I deal with
this facet o f shammic experience in my chapter one.
In chapter three, he speaks o f the ways the shaman attains magical powers.
One way is through acquiring a spirit mate and other spiritual allies such as totem
animals as I discuss in relation to Celtic tradition in chapters one and four.

In chapter four, Eliade discusses methods of shamanic initiation,
corresponding to my chapter two. Eliade next discusses the symbolism of the
shaman’s costume and drum in chapter five, which I relate to Celtic materials in
my chapter four.
Eliade has spread his comments on shamanic trance throughout his book. In
my study it is in chapter two, which also includes a discussion of the spirit journey,
which Eliade considers the defining feature of shamanism.
The shaman performs a wide range of hnctions in shamanic cultures,
including prophesying, healing and conducting shamanic warfare with enemies.
Eliade discusses some of these functions in chapter seven, and more generally
throughout his book. It would be impossible in a study of this length to document
all shamanic fimctions in detail, so I have selected three representative ones:
killing, healing and revealing for chapter three.
I range further afield fiom Eliade’s model in chapter five on trance
possession. While Eliade did not originally consider trance possession a shamanic
phenomenon in the strict sense, he later admitted that he had not attributed
sufficient importance to it.
In chapter six, on the shaman as guarantor of cosmic order I draw upon the
work of Eliade, in both Shamanism and Rites and Symbols of Initiation, and that of
Walens and others to delve deeper into the cosmological significance of the themes
in the preceding chapters.
Chapter seven contains the shamanic biographies of a few key figures in
Celtic literature, such as Cu Chulainn. It will be seen that they correspond to the
overall picture of the shaman drawn in Eliade’s work.

Obviously. for an individual to function as a shaman in the way that Eliade
describes includes their having a community who turned to them for guidance,
help, and healing.13 In the later folklore, there are fewer people one can argue
functioned fully as shamans on all levels. However, one can argue that various
people are described as having personal and interactive contact with the spiritual
aspect of reality into later times.
Having defined the term “shamanism” for the purpose of this study, it is
important to also define how I am using the term “Celt” before attempting to put
them together.l 4
DEFININGTHE TERM“CELTIC”
Sims-Williams has noted that “the terms ‘Celt’ and ‘Celtic’ have become a
battlegr~und.“’T~wo articles he wrote in 1998 sum up the arguments, and my
discussion below is primarily based upon the points he raised and data he
gathered? It is impossible to go into great detail in the space I have here so I refer
the reader to his articles for greater depth.
The earliest textual evidence we have for the people the Greeks called the
kelroi places them around south-west Iberia, central Europe and around the
Danube’s source around the 6* to 4* centuries B.C.17 The first material cultures
that archaeologists identify as “Celtic,” are termed by the name of “type-sites?”that
is sites that are used to define a culture. Halstatt was a ma-jor site, active fiom
around the 71hto the 5‘hcenturies BC, and La Tene active from around the 5‘hto the
1’‘ centuries BC. Both gave their names to phases of Celtic material culture.”
Celtic languages are considered to have diverged fiom Italic between 1300
800 B.C.19 The Celtic language ultimately diverged into what has been termed the
P or Brythonic and Q or Goedelic branches. In ancient times the P-Celtic branch
13 Eliade. 1964. pp. 123. 136-137 14 In this and the later section on using the literature as a source of information on Celtic shamanism, as well as in other revisions throughout this stud). I am gratehl to Prof. Tom Clancy for suggesting potential difficulties with my approach and areas in need of further clarification. 15 Sims-Williams. 1998b. p. 1 16 See Sims-Williams. 1998a and 1998b 17 CunlifTe. 1997. pp. 2-3 18 Cunliffe. 1997. pp. 28-35 19 Cunliffe. 1997. p. 2 1

comprised Gaulish, Lepontic. Pictish and and Brythonic. and in modem times
Welsh Cornish and Breton. The Q-Celtic comprised Goedelic and Celtiberian in
ancient times, and Irish, Manx and Scottish Gaelic in modem times.20
As the Brythonic and Goidelic branches of the Celtic languages diverged
from “Common Celtic,” it would seem likely that the cultures would have diverged
in other ways as well, so we certainly cannot speak of one monolithic culture, but
rather, groups of related tribes whose cultures would have shared some common
features. As I have said, this is one theory.
While popular literature produces ever more books with the words “Celt”
and “Celtic” in the title, ever fewer scholars seem clear on what, if any, meaning
these terms have. Some go so far as to argue that “It is not currently possible to
prove that any of the Iron Age peoples who lived in central or western Europe
definitely spoke a Celtic language or defined themselves as Celts.”2’
While this may be so, it is also possible that some peoples we may now
consider Celtic felt a kinsnip with other such groups although they didn’t use the
same ethnic terms of themselves that the classical authors used of them.
Some of these ‘Celts’ may not have accepted the Celtic label at first, just as
the term Gerrnani was at first foreign to most ‘Germanic‘ tribes. On the other
hand, some Celtic speaking peoples may have regarded themselves as ethnically
akin to the Keltoi, Galatai, or Galli even though they rarely or never used those
ethnonyms of themselves. Here we can compare the Welsh and Bretons who were
certainly aware of their kinship as Britons even though the Welsh increasingly
referred to themselves as C y m ra~ther than Brython.22
Despite the fact that inhabitants of Britain and Ireland were never called
‘Celts’ by classical authors, some scholars believe that there are still reasons to see
a kinship between Insular and European Celts. Tribal names such as Parisii and
Atrebates appear in both Europe and the British Isles.23Cultural links give further
evidence.

...observers like Caesar and Tacitus refer to linguistic, cultural and political
links between Britain and the Continent, including the Druids of Gaul going to
Britain for further study, and to similarities ‘in the character and customs of the
people’ (ingenia cultusque hominum) between Britain and Ireland. These are
telling facts for an ‘objectivist’ ethnologist, and undermine Collis‘s ‘subjectivist’
deduction that ‘there is no logic in calling the indigenous inhabitants of the
British Isles
Classical authors use the term “Celtic” in both linguistic and ethnic senses.
There is also direct evidence of Celtic peoples in the form of Celtic language
inscriptions, place names, and personal narnes in Italy, Switzerland, France and
Spain from 600 B.C.
Linguistic evidence gives strong indication of a Celtic presence because it is
difficult to imagine the Celtic languages taking root in Britain and Ireland any other
way. The ancient Britons and Irish adopting Celtic languages in the absence of at
least some degree of Celtic migration would be like the current British population
suddenly beginning to speak French for no apparent reason.
The issue of ethnicity as applied to the Celtic question is very contentious,
shadowed as it is by issues of racism and how data might be used ideologically.
Genetic research of European populations is in early stages and the population
samples the data is based upon are quite small.
For example, “Celtic” genetic features were determined by sampling 135
Irishman with Irish surnames and 88 Welshmen from Anglesea with Welsh
surnames. The European genetic surveys have only sampled about 3,000 people,
hardly enough to be truly confident in the results.26Perhaps unsuprisingly, some of
the data appears to be contradictory.
The fact that Finns, Sami, and other non-Indo-European language speaking
peoples are “outliers when nuclear gene frequencies are analysed” supports the idea
that genes and language evolve t~gether.~S’okal’s work appears to back this up,
24 Sims-Williams. 1998b. p. 26 25 Sims-Williams, 1998a p. 508 26 Richards. 2003. referring to Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza 1984. Also see Bodmer, 1993. for *Celtic“

noting that “speakers of different language families in Europe differ genetically and
that this difference remains even after geographic differentiation is allowed for.”
However, he goes on to say that “since language differences themselves are likely
to be barriers to fiee gene flow, they will enhance genetic differentiation.”28
In some respects, it appears that the only fum conclusions we can draw are
that the past is not simple. and that much more work is needed before we have clear
genetic and linguistic maps of Europe, Britain and Ireland during the relevent
periods in their respective pasts.
We cannot and should not make grand assumptions about Celtic
continuities over time and unity between diverse population groups over extended
geographical areas. However, there are linguistic connections over time and space
between groups that have been considered Celtic. Therefore we arrive at one basic
definition: that a Celt was a person speaking a language of the Celtic group.
Celtic language and Celtic ethnicity often go together.29 Celtic art and
archaeology cannot be as clearly tied to Celtic peoples because they may be the
result of a non-Celtic person seeing an object or image, liking it for aesthetic or
other reasons, and copying or importing it. A modem example might be the fact
that many objects in Britain were made in Taiwan and other East Asian countries,
and Eastern art and ideas such as feng shui currently influence British design.
However, though there are some immigrants fiom Taiwan and other East Asian
countries, the mass immigration is more one of objects and ideas than of people.
I agree with Sims-Williams that the uses of the term Celtic in relation to
language, art, ethnicity and archaeology “have some historical validity and are too
useh1 to abandon.”30In what follows I have tried to heed his warnings about
excessive cultural generalisations, while sticking to a broad definition of the Celts
as a grouping of tribes in Europe, Britain, Ireland and Asia Minor, speaking related
languages of the Celtic group, and having a number of common cultural features.
These features demonstrate some degree of continuity over time. For
example, aspects of the heroic ethos described by classical authors does not seem at

10
too far remove from the world described in early Irish literature. For example,
Athenaeus describes how the bravest hero traditionally got the best piece of meat at
a feast, and if another contested his right to it, a battle would ensue between them.31
In Fled Bricrend we see this described in great detail when Cu Chulainn contests
for the hero’s portion with other Ulster warriors.32Variants of deity names that
appear in inscriptions in the pagan Celtic world later appear in early Irish and
Welsh literatures, given to characters that at least in some respects appear to relate
to the earlier pagan gods.33
Celtic society was made up of numerous tribes and alliances of tribes who
would have had personal totems and deities, perhaps associated with local
environmental features like rivers and wells.34A practice in one area, or something
that may have occurred on one occasion, would not necessarily reflect widespread
Celtic belief or practice. That having been said, there seem to be some widely
worshipped deities and widely performed practices in the ~ources.~’
Therefore, one hypothesis I am beginning with is that there were linguistic
and cultural links between the peoples we now call Celtic, and that we can
meaningfully speak of a Celtic culture, by no means homogenous, but sharing some
common traits in artistic, social and spiritual realms. This grouping of possible
common features is what I mean when I speak of Celtic tradition or Celtic culture.
THEFOCUS OF THIS STUDY
I am seeking knowledge first about the more remote pagan Celtic past, and
the extent to which shamanism in the strictest sense may have played a role in
Celtic religion from the first recognisably Celtic peoples around 500 B.C., to
around 500 A.D. when the Christian conversion process was well underway.
However, because it is clear that some elements of what we may term Celtic
culture survived beyond this period, I have not limited myself to sources dating
from this period. The Celtic languages still survive, so in the the linguistic sense,

34 ROSS.1993. pp.84-85

Celtic culture can still be said to exist. Some other features, like aspects of tribalism
and the heroic ethos, could even be said to have existed until the Highland clan
system was d i ~ m a n t l e d .A~s~ Sims-Williams notes, even modem peoples who
declare themselves Celtic may have a claim no more “tangential than the modem
Greek claim to descend from the ancient Greeks, which everybody now accepts, at
least in the spirit of discour~e.’?~’
Therefore, I am also interested in the extent to which a shamanistic world
view, which I will argue was present in earlier stages of Celtic culture, may have
persisted into the Christian period. along with shamanistic techniques of vision
seeking. This may be indicated in the animistic features of some of the prayers and
invocations in Carmina Gadelica, as well as other sources I will refer to in future
chapters.
This brings me to another point. One reason I feel I am justified in ranging
so far across time is that people are often conservative in strands of their religious
practices. Even when people change religion, aspects of their former world-view
tend to hang on and mingle with the new one.
SYNTHESIS, CONTINUTIY AND CONSERVATISM
While shamanistic cultures are often receptive to new ideas because they
believe in fresh revelation, they are often conservative in that they want to continue
shamanistic practice. The personal experience of the sacred is not something people
readily relinquish.
We find a modern example of the process in Haitian Vodou. Modern
devotees continue the African animistic and shamanistic practices and beliefs of
their tribal ancestors. These elements have intermingled over the years with
Catholicism, a sprinkling of European ritual magic (which, itself, incorporated
strands of European paganism) and a host of modern cultural elements3*Rather
than give up their gods, they integrated them into their Catholic cosmology as
saints. Rather than give up their old shamanistic techniques of trance dancing and
36 Mac Can& 1982. p. 149 37 Sims-Williams. 1998b. p. 27 38 See Cosentino, 1995. pp. xx-xxii, and 25-38.



12
possession, they employed them in the service of their new hybrid religion.
I hope to show that Irish sources yield evidence of a similar combination of
conservatism and synthesis, such as the way in which the goddess Brigit became
St. B ~ i g i t .H~er~example and others show that some Irish clergy went to unusual
lengths to respect older beliefs and and incorporate them into their type of
Christianity. Carey reflected on the stories of Columba’s conversation with a youth
at Carn Eolairg and T b mac Cai~-ell.~’
These two tales reflect the ability of the early Irish church to find a place
for much-in some cases startlingly much-of the older beliefs of the people. It
is important not to oversimplifi: the spirit of rapprochement which I am
endeavouring to describe represents only one strand in a complex culture, full of
controversy and contradictions. But is a notably interesting strand, reflecting a
mentality for which I know of no close parallel in medieval Christendom. A11
across Europe, to be sure, pagan beliefs and practices survived among the
common folk...But in Ireland scholars and bishops were also busy with the old
traditions, seeking to create a hybrid, composite culture which would be both
wholly Irish and wholly Christian. One can perhaps compare these efforts with
the adventurous syntheses of Mirandola and Ficino; but I can think of nothing
nearer, or earlier, to which to liken them.4’
This shows a clear qualitative difference between Irish Christianity and
Christianity elsewhere at this time. In this way at least, one strand of Celtic
Christianity is shown to be different in a substantive way, despite some scholars’
opinions to the c0ntra1-y.~T~hroughout this article, Carey demonstrates the unusual
lengths to which some Irish clerics and philosophers went to integrate the Aes Side
into Christian cosmology as “neutral angels,” or as a branch of Adam’s children
who never “fell.”43
Why this difference? Why didn’t clerics in Norse countries, with an equally
vibrant pagan tradition, incorporate their older gods into the Christian cosmology in
39 See 0 CathAin. 1995 40 Meyer, 1899. Carey, I984b 41 Carey. I999b. pp. 10-1 1 42 For an overvieu see Davis. 1992 43 Carey. 1999c. pp. 36-38

a similar way?
It is far beyond the scope of this study to go into this important question in
detail, but one might speculate that Christianity came to Ireland before it had
aquired the more monolithic authority of later centuries. Doctrines were in a more
fluid state. The Norse, by contrast, converted later, to a church with centuries more
established authority and set doctrines.
One might also speculate that certain elements of Irish paganism must have
been very deeply rooted for the Irish scholars and priests to go to such pains to
integrate these elements into the church’s world-view. It is possible that the Irish,
including those very priests and scholars, would simply not accept a faith in which
all their gods and ancestors were either demonic or damned. It might also be that
they would not accept a faith which did not foster personal, visionary experience,
given the centrality of this experience in many folklore and literary accounts.
O’Loughlin, of course, makes a good point when he says that the idea of a
Celtic theological “fringe” has turned the study of the early Irish Church into “a
search for the peculiar, the unique, and the bizarre: what is common between that
culture and the rest of Christendom becomes invisible, and what seems jarring
becomes the
This point is certainly essential to bear in mind while looking at the sources.
However, when seeking the evidence for Celtic shamanism, one cannot ignore the
fact that some of it is peculiar and bizarre, at least by comparison with the
experiences and behaviours found in some branches of modern Christianity. For
example, Adomnan’s initiatory and visionary experiences are unusual to say the
least-but fit very well into overall schema of shamanistic activity.45It should not
surprise us to find shamanism and Christianity, or any religion for that matter, co
existing to one degree or another.
Shamanistic techniques themselves are neutral. Shamanistic and Christian
elements may co-exist as easily as shamanistic and pagan elements.46 An Irish
example, discussed hrther later, is the fact that St. Patrick himself allowed the

visionary technique of imbas .forosnai to continue, because it involved no sacrifice
to pagan gods. Therefore the technique itself was seen as neutral, despite having
come out of paganism and despite it having a shamanistic purpose.47
Of course, the first native written accounts date fiom the Christian period.
The question is, do they have bearing on the question of Celtic shamanism?
THE USE OF LITERATUARS AE SOURCE
My starting point and primary focus has been early Irish literature fiom the
areas of classification commonly referred to as the Mythological, Ulster, Fenian
and Historical Cycles.4x
I chose this focus because Early Irish literature seems to have preserved
some of the oldest and least “polished” mythological elements. This is for a variety
of reasons. including the above-mentioned sympathy of some Irish clerics and
scholars for pagan traditions and the fact that the manuscript material we have fiom
Ireland is earlier than that fi-om Wales.49 Dillon, Mac Cana and others have
convincingly argued for the archaism of aspects of Irish tradition?’
By contrast, some scholars such as Carney argue that Irish literature is
primarily Christian and European in its influences, and literary in its aims, with
genuine archaic pagan and mythological elements few and far between. However,
even Carney has admitted that archaic, possibly pre-Christian, elements are present
in some early Irish poems, such as those relating to kingship.” He also admitted
that the Tain consisted “in part of traditional material, in part of imaginative
reconstruction of the remote Irish past in form and terms that belong to the mixed
culture of early Christian Ireland.”52
Above, I noted the similarity between Athenaeus‘s description of Celts
contesting for the best portion of meat at feasts and the competition for the
“champion’s portion” in the early Irish tale Fled B r i ~ r e n d .Th~e~use of the war

chariot is prominent in early Irish literature, such as the Tain, in classical accounts,
and in Celtic archaeological remains. such as those of the La Tene culture.
Elements of Celtic social structures, descriptions of head-hunting, the roles
described for the druids and poets-in short, many elements-also appear with
some degree of consistency in cultures identified as Celtic over a wide period of
time in archaeological. classical and native vernacular l i t e r a t ~ e s ? ~
There may even be more specific relationships between the tales and
historical events. Specifically, Ross noted the connections between archaeological
finds at Emhain Macha and the events and settings of the Red Branch Cycle.”
I base my research on the hypothesis that the vernacular literature reflects
aspects of pagan Celtic religious life as well other elements of ancient Celtic
culture such as feasting and warfare. The various examples above, and others I
shall give throughout this thesis, indicate that this is a reasonable hypothesis. And,
as Jackson suggested so many years ago, with regard to the idea that pre-historic
aspects in all areas of Irish life are reflected in the literature, “There is nothing in
such a hypothesis which need alarm us.”56
Celtic tales mention figures with names which can be related to deities we
know fi-om pagan Celtic inscriptions, such as Lug, or the Welsh Lleu, probably
from Lugos and other variants in the earlier inscriptions. In the tales, some of the
deity’s attributes may also appear. This indicates that at least some features of
pagan Celtic religion remain in the texts.57
There are also many correlations between elements present in generally
recognised shamanistic cultures and elements present in Celtic literatures. In part in
this study I am comparing narratives that we can be sure are shamanistic fiom the
oral and literary traditions of known shamanistic cultures with Celtic narratives. If
the tales of, or inspired by, shamanistic experience have similar or identical
elements and themes to Celtic tales, then we have another reason to suspect that
Celtic culture, particularly before the 7* century AD or so, was also shamanistic.
I believe it to be highly unlikely that the Irish Ziterati wrote stories that have

16
such a wealth of correlations to shamanistic traditions in other cultures by pure
chance and literary inventiveness.
The diagrams at the end of each of my chapters clearly illustrate the sheer
number of correlations between Celtic and shamanistic cultures. The diagrams in
chapter seven show that these correlations extend to the biographies of shamanic
figures in Celtic culture. These could have easily been multiplied but for lack of
space. Ultimately, I think it highly unlikely that this number of correlations would
be present if strong shamanistic elements never existed in Celtic culture.
The fact that we can find multiple examples of all shamanistic behaviours,
multiple examples of shamanic biographies, and an overall pattern that corresponds
entirely to that of known shamanistic cultures seems to me to present
overwhelming evidence of Irish shamanism, and by extension, Celtic shamanism.
Perhaps the strongest evidence in my opinion is that there are elements in
folk tradition and literature that are explicable by looking at activities as
shamanistic and people acting in a shamanic role. Many of these elements make
little sense when looked at in any other way.
For example, as I shall discuss in the next chapter, why would an Irish king
order that a feathered cannibal woman who had depopulated his barony be restored
to sanity rather than killed? The Christianity of the day had nothing against
executing murderers. I can literally think of no other explanation that would make
sense other than the one I have offered in the next chapter-that Mis is a potential
shaman who is therefore crucially important to the community. Even if we see the
tale from a purely literary angle, viewing it through a shamanistic lens seems to be
the only way to create a clear and focussed picture.
I think the most persuasive aspect of my argument is that seeing Celtic, and
particularly early Irish literature Erom the Mythological, Ulster and Fenian cycles,
as well as the cycles of the kings, through a shamanistic lens makes the most sense
of a great deal that happens in these tales as a whole.
In the upcoming chapters, I do not simply pick one or two stories with
shamanistic elements. I range quite broadly through Irish literature and include
elements fiom Scottish, Irish and Welsh folklore and traditions as well.



17
Despite the fact that shamanistic elements in general are widely and well
attested, I cannot provide several examples for each individual element. I therefore
need to address a firther difficulty in my investigation, that of the quantity of
materials available to us.
WHATREMAINS
When I began my PhD, Professor Gillies told me that surveying the
materials available to us for the study of Celtic paganism is like surveying a bomb
crater. Little bits remain around the edges of a huge hole in the middle?
Consequently. while some shamanistic phenomena, such as the spirit
journey, are quite well attested in the literature, others occur in only one or two
places. Given the fact that Christian monks wrote and edited what we have, it is
only surprising that they preserved as much “pagan” Celtic lore as they did, as
Carey noted in the quote above.
As we are lucky to have what evidence we do, I do not feel that we can
afford to ignore any of it. It is simply impossible to provide numerous examples of
all shamanistic phenomena in Celtic literature. However, I believe the case for
shamanistic features that only occur in one or two places can be supported by
looking at broader patterns of ritual, behaviour and symbolism.
Returning to Mis’s tale again, as I will describe, Dubh Ruis dug a hole in
the earth and bathed her in deer broth heated with stones. He scrubbed her feathers
from her and she emerged transformed. This incident correlates strongly with the
bath given to the Kwakiutl Hamatsa as part of his initiation, and relates to broader
ritual patterns of cooking as “initiating” or “civilising,” examined at great length by
Levi-~trauss5.9
What Celtic correlates can we find? There’s nothing precisely like it, but
there are other relevent accounts, where a person enters a bath and emerges
transformed. Many of them also make it clear that supernatural power is involved.
King Cormac washes in a bath dug into the earth and heated with stones
that float in and out of the water of their own accord during his encounter with
58 Prof. William Gillies. personal comment. University of Edinburgh, 1996 59 Uvi-Strauss. 1970



18
Manannan in Echtrae Comaic.60This may be seen as shamanically initiatory, since
he encounters a God and receives magical objects and spiritual instruction.
Giraldus Cambrensis gives us an account of a king’s inauguration in Ulster. It
includes being bathed in the broth of a mare? Cu Chulainn is calmed and “cooled”
fiom his riustrad by being placed in a bath!* His riustrad has supernatural qualities
and Eliade has associated it with the shamanic ability to generate mystical heat.
In the Cath Maige Tuired, warriors of the Tuatha De are restored to life by
being dipped in a cauldron.63 A figure being dipped in a cauldron or possibly
drowned is on the Gundestrup ~auldron.‘T~his is of course Thracian, but contains
elements of Celtic iconography.
All the above examples feature a person or persons, immersed in a bath or
cauldron of fluid, sometimes broth or an herbal mixture, fiom which they emerge
changed. Taken together, this seems to me to be evidence that the theme of an
initiatory or transformtive bath was present in ancient Celtic culture.
In the above case, this is the evidence I use to support the idea that Mis’s
bath was not a purely cosmetic procedure. In other, similar cases, this is my
reasoning for using this kind of corroborative evidence.
FACTS,FICTIONASND TRUTH
Overall, literature may, of course, have greater or lesser “factual” elements.
Sometimes the difference between a novel and a biography is simply that the
names have been changed. Even when literature does not depict factual specifics, it
often depicts real situations and ideas that existed in the culture.
For example, “Star Wars,” though obviously a fantasy, would still be a
valid film to analyse if one was writing about American gun culture. While it is a
work of fiction, and lasers rather than guns are fired, it reflects attitudes towards
firearms that are also prevalent in American culture. The heroes engage in battles,
come out largely unscathed, and the whole process is largely depicted as an

adventurous good time.
In a different vein, Amos Tutuola’s works, including My Lifi? in the Bush uf
Ghosts, depict a fantastic reality, yet one that reflects the animistic, shamanistic
world-view the author grew up with, and the kinds of visionary experiences people
in his culture have!‘
Celtic literature and later folklore abound with curious elements that don’t
make strict narrative sense, or even lend themselves to making a better story. Many
tales that have come down to us are unsatisfLing as narratives. It seems likely that
there are other reasons they were preserved. Composer Judith Weir who has based
some of her work on Scottish folktales, said that folklore contains a lot of “the
mental history of the world.”66 Perhaps one might add that it contains some of the
mythic history of the world as well.
THEGRITI N THE OYSTER
If the great Irish hero Cu Chulainn was based on an historical figure, all
sorts of legends and stones fiom various sources might have become attached to
him over time. These could have been stories about other heroes or shamanistic
figures, stories about divinities, or anecdotes attributed to him to craft a better tale.
As a result, his biography may be that of a type of person in Irish culture more than
a heroic biography of a particular person
However, I think it likely that myths tend to grow around something or
someone-a real type of figure in the culture, or a real person. The type, or the
person, give the initial impetus to the myth-making process, rather like a piece of
grit in an oyster creating a pearl. If we could go back in time, the historical person
might, of course, be no more recognisable as the source of the mythic pearl that has
grown around him or her than a piece of sand is seen first as a pearl in potentia.
However, if the motivating myth-making force was a person, there must have been
something special about them to motivate the creation of those first stones. 0
Cathasaigh addresses these issues in detail in his Heroic Biography ofCormac Mac
Airt with reference to the 1963 English translation of Jan de Vries 1959 work,
65 Tutuola, 1954 66 Weir. 2002



20
Heroic Song and Heroic Legend.
The second problem concerns the relation of the individual realizations of
the heroic biography on the one hand with the facts of history on the other: this is
a question with immediate relevance to personages like Cormac mac Airt. De
Vries’ discussion of this problem is valuable and his general position seems to me
to be unexceptionable. He shows that, in some cases at least, the heroic life
demonstrably bears some relation to historical facts, but he argues that in these
cases the facts of history are transmuted in the heroic biography. Using the
concept of Ganzheiten (‘entities’), he claims that ‘the historical event and the
heroic legend can he said to oppose one another-as entities...the heroic life is a
life sui generis, which does not belong to history and which cannot be rived by
ordinary rnortals’ (p. 209). He goes on to say that the heroic legend is a myth ’not
of a god, but of a man who raised himself to the level of the gods’ (p. 24 1).
It seems unnecessary to speak of the hero’s ‘raising himself to the level
of the gods.’ What is important is that by means of the heroic biography the
human person (real or imaginary) is transmuted into something quite other, that
is, into a sacred personage. The hero is a mortal personage whose life is
characterised by certain definable features which mark him off as sacred. The
treatment of a personage in this fashion does not prove that his name and acts
bear no relation to the facts of hist01-y.~~
We can all think of examples of figures who historians believe existed but
who also had mythological elements grow around them in the tales told of them.
For example, the Buddha is believed to be an historical figure. However, aspects of
his story, such as being sheltered by a multi-headed serpent while he meditated, are
likely mythological-perhaps mythically true in a spiritual sense but not
historicallyfactual. Maybe the Buddha saw the serpent in a vision and later told his
students. When they, (or their students) passed the story on, it might have become a
physical fact in the re-telling.
Christ is also believed to be an historical figure, yet we know that the date
of his birth, and certain mythological aspects of it, were borrowed from the
67 0 Cathasaigh. 1977. p. 5



21
Zoroastrian legend of Mithras. The Bible gives evidence that certain aspects of his
life may have been visionary experiences he had, later transmuted into physical
fact. For example, Luke gives the following account of Christ’s baptism. “Now
when all the people were baptised, it came to pass, that Jesus was also being
baptised, and praying, and the heaven was opened, And the Holy Ghost descended
in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said,
Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.68Here, the entire crowd sees
the Holy Spirit descend bodily as a dove.
John gives the following version, which takes place after John has said that
Jesus is the one who would come after him to baptise with the Holy Spirit. “And
John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending fiom heaven like a dove, and
it abode upon him. And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptise with water,
the same said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and
remaining on him, the same is he which baptiseth with the Holy Ghost. And I saw,
and bare record that this is the Son of God.69Here, John sees, and bears witness to
the others.
In Matthew and Mark, however, only Christ experiences this vision.
Matthew has: “And Jesus, when he was baptised, went up straightway out of the
water: and, 10, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God
descending like a dove and lighting upon him: And 10 a voice fiom heaven, saying,
“This is my beloved Son in Whom I am well plea~ed.”~M’ ark gives a similar
account.71
None of these versions are more mythically or spiritually true than the
others, but taken together they make the point that what may have been Christ’s (or
John’s) personal, spiritually real, experience could then have been transmuted into
a group, physically real, experience in the context of the story’s development by
others. John’s version says specifically that he bore witness, telling others what he
saw. In the versions where only Christ sees the dove, he must have told his
disciples at some point for the story to be preserved.

22
Examples of mythic elements in history and historical elements found in
myth or oral history can be multiplied from other sources. For example, the
“mythic” city of Troy, was believed to have existed only in literature until
Schleimann dug it up.72 Additionally, the archaeological finds at Emhain Macha
support aspects of the tales of the place in the Ulster cycle, as noted above.73
THISSTUDY’S APPROACH
I mentioned above that archaeology and other sources have shown that at
least some elements of pre-Christian Celtic culture are reflected in the literature.
Therefore, I believe that it is both useful and valid to approach the tales on their
own terms, in the way that Ewa Sadowska did in an article based on her PhD thesis
on martial aspects of the Tain.
She said that she used the Tain “as it stands, as a literary exposition of a
raid addressed to the twelfth century audience, on the assumption that it is textually
unified. Its two recensions are final versions of a long creative process of literary
composition, and tell a story which deserves examination in its own right.”74She
treats phenomena such as theferg or “battle h y ” of the Ulster warriors as a real
phenomenon, at least in the context of the story, and discusses its effects on
warriors in the tale.75Shespeaks simply of Conchobar, Cu Chulainn and the others
as people, and quotes them directly. My approach is similar.
I base my investigation on the hypothesis that the literature reflects, to some
extent, real spiritual beliefs and practices in Celtic culture, and that the figures who
fblfill shamanistic roles, such as Cu Chulainn, may be based on real people. If they
are not based on a single real person, they may be based on a real type of person
who existed in Celtic culture.
Therefore, when I discuss Cu Chulainn, I will speak of him as I would
speak of a real person. This does not mean that I consider every facet of his tale and
character to be factual, just that it is the most workable way to approach my
subject. I am also not failing to acknowledge that there is a writer behind the story
72 See Schliemann, 1875
74 Sadowska. 1997, p. 8 75 Sadowrska. 1997, pp. 35-38
73 ROSS.1982. pp. 209-210



23
by doing this. As in a biography. one can acknowledge the reality of the subject
and the artistic input of the writer at the same time.
As an example of how I will treat these figures, I say in chapter one that
Mis, behaves “unusually, both violently and sexually for a woman of her time,”
referring to the time the writer placed her in, that is, when the story is set. I say this
as I might also note that a cannibalistic character in a Jane Austen novel was
behaving unusually for a woman of her time. I could say this while acknowledging
the fact that Austen’s novel, like the tale of Mis, is a written work.
When I refer to a figure such as Taliesin’s “later career,” I mean his later
career as described in the literature. When I say, “Taliesin says,” I mean what I
would mean if I said “Madame Bovary says...” In the latter case I would be
referring to the words Flaubert wrote and placed in her mouth. In the former, I refer
to the words the writers place in Taliesin’s mouth. To say “as Taliesin is made to
say by writer or writers unknown” would be cumbersome. The words spoken may
or may not relate in some way directly to a historical personage. However, they
were seen by writers as consistent with the figure of Taliesin, and therefore, with
this type of inspired poet.
Another point must be made in relation to what these characters say. One
example is the dialogue between St. Columba and Oran, discussed in chapter two.
In a nutshell, Oran and St. Columba debate on the nature of heaven and hell, Oran
then seeks the answers by a three-day burial which I will argue was a spirit journey.
Oran’s answers don’t follow church teachings, and this disturbs Columba, who
orders that Oran be reburied for
It might be argued that because this is a story, we are not dealing with
“real” opinions but with manufactured, “fictional” ones. However, real opinions
can be put in the mouths of fictional characters. In fact, an idea, or opinion can
never be more or less real than any other idea or opinion. Ideas, of their nature, are
thoughts formed in the human mind and expressed in various forms, sharing the
same degree of reality (or unreality).
These particular ideas are opinions that the author or authors of the tale saw
76 Carmichael. 1900-1971. v. 2, pp. 338-340



24
fit to put in the mouths of St. Columba and Oran. As such, they must have seemed
reasonable opinions, and the discussion must have seemed plausible, even if only in
a narrative sense.
I am not saying that this exact incident necessarily ocurred between St.
Columba and a monk called Oran, or even that it occurred at all. However, one of
the most telling things about this story to me is that it depicts the conflict between
orthodoxy and personal experience in a way that does not flatter St. Columba. Why
would a story be preserved that did not hlfill any sort of “propoganda” needs, for
lack of a better term? Why would a story be preserved that depicts St. Columba
executing a man over a theological disagreement? This seems to me to indicate that
the opinions expressed must have been very real indeed, at least to those who
preserved and transmitted the tale, even if the incident itself was not. I am not
suggesting that those who preserved the tale necessarily “sided” with Oran, just
that the points of view must have seemed sufficiently significant to record.
LAYERS OF MEANING
Obviously, there are many ways to look at Celtic literature and folklore. My
approach does not under any circumstances seek to negate any other aspects of
these tales, or other layers of meaning that they may contain. Shamanistic meaning
does not preclude other levels of meaning. Conversely, the fact that there are other
possible explanations for an action, name, tradition or event in the tales does not
mean that there is no shamanistic level of meaning to be found.
There is almost never one stand-alone reason for anything a culture does.
Why do people get married, tell stories or have knerals? There is no one set reason
or explanation for any of the above. Shamanistic cultures are even more resistant to
crystal clear either / or analyses.
An objection might be raised, for example, that the Camerons were at one
time called Clann ‘ic Gill Onfhaidh, or the Clan of the Lad of the Storm, because a
progenitor was born on a stormy night. However, even if this is one reason for the
name, one must also look at the root impulse to name a person after an elemental
force. Is there also a totemic reason behind it? People don’t seem to regularly name



25
their children after environmental phenomena now, so something must have
changed. I would suggest that it might be a sense of the hterconnectedness of
things, a sense that someone born during a storm may partake of that power.
When we look at a tale such as Mael Duin’s, it may be argued that it is
clearly a fictional, fabulous tale. Point taken, however it also deals with r e d human
issues such as bereavement, forgiveness, desire for vengeance, Joy and sorrow.”
What people write generally relates in some way to what they see around
them, kom accounts that attempt to have a documentary focus, to fantasies that
may be reactions against a person’s daily life experience.
Even if a tale is totally fanciful, it cannot help but reflect something of the
person who wrote it, something of their ideas, preoccupations and interests. If
Celtic literature revealed nothing real, factually or mentally, of the lives of those
who wrote it, it would be the only literature in the world that did not reflect the
culture fi-om which it sprang in one way or another.
VIEWING CELTIC MATERIALS THROUGH A SHAMANISTIC LENS
Seeing the evidence for shamanistic practice in many Early Irish and other
Celtic sources involves viewing Celtic materials through a shamanistic lens, a lens
that I believe pulls many obscure aspects of Celtic literature and spirituality into
clearer focus.
The value of examining this literature and other evidence through such a
lens is manifold. If we can place Celtic culture in the broader category of shamanic
cultures, it will give us a wealth of additional material to explore shamanic
practices and the possible meanings behind them. It will also give us additional
insights into the history and development of religion and the psychology of
spiritual experience into the present day.
For example, the shaman’s initiatory crisis appears in shamanic cultures
world-wide. Modem people may experience analogues to it in psychological crisis,
therapy and near death experiences, as documented by Stanislav Grof He notes
that the experience can “result in dramatic alleviation of a variety of emotional,
psychosomatic, and interpersonal problems that have previously resisted all
77 Stokes, 1888. Van Hamel, 1941, pp. 26-77. Oskamp, 1970



26
psychotherapeutic work.”78
Shamanistic experience lies at the heart of most religions, and continues to
manifest in many refined spiritual disciplines. For example, the classic shaman’s
dismemberment vision manifests in Tibetan Buddhist and Tantric rites as chod,
where the practitioner offers his flesh to be eaten by demons to remove his self
absorption.79
The shamanistic basis of most religions gives us one of the most important
reasons to apply a shamanistic lens to pagan Celtic religion. If we find that pagan
Celtic religion is likely to have been shamanistically based, it can give us another
window on the constellation of meanings typically found in the early stages of
these religions. It can also offer an intriguing insight into the transition between
pagan and Christian in the conversion process.
From the other side, anthropology and psychology can provide insights into
aspects of Celtic literature and culture that have puzzled many scholars. For
example, the nature of the fairies and the meaning of the illnesses suffered by
figures such as CU Chulainn and Oengus. Overall, as I hope to prove, the
shamanistic worldview seems to make the most coherent sense of pagan Celtic
spirituality as a whole, and also casts light on shamanistic experience in later
Christian contexts. I reiterate here that shamanistic techniques are neutral. They
can, and have, been applied to many religious systems.80
There is increasing scholarly support for interdisciplinary approaches. Ann
Ross believes that “investigation into the Celtic world, pagan and Christian, ancient
and modem, can only be conducted by combining several disciplines.”8’ Mac Cana
says that numerous topics in Celtic myth and literature “invite close scrutiny in the
light of the immense extension of our knowledge of human experience brought
about within our lifetime by the (more or less) modem sciences of anthropology,
mythology and comparative religion allied to comparative linguistics.”82
Obviously, I can only scratch the surface in a study of this length. My hope
78 Grof. 1988. p. 234 79 Elide. 1964. p. 436 80 Kalweit. 1988. p. vii 81 Ross, 1982. p. 204 82 Mac Cana. 1982. p. 153



27
is to prove that the full complex of shamanistic practices exist in Early Irish
literature, and to some extent. in other Celtic literatures, the archaeological record,
and the other sources I list below. This may encourage more scholars in Celtic and
other disciplines to look at individual texts through a shamanistic lens, perhaps
doing new translations from this perspective,
As I hope I shall show, particular words and phrases, such as the use of the
word commairge in the Serglige Con Culainn, discussed in chapter six, may be of
key significance in revealing the shamanistic nature of certain figures and
activities. The significance of these terms is sometimes obscured in translation.
My goal is to enter and advance the dialog in this area already begun by
scholars such as Chadwick, Nagy, Carey, Melia, Lonigan and Mac Cana. Although
these scholars have advanced the understanding of shamanistic and related areas of
Celtic spirituality, I was told by many that I was going where angels fear to tread
when I began this study. My hope is to make this area of scholarship safer for
mortals to explore by providing a map and guideposts on the way.
PAGAN CELTIC RELIGION
There are many theories about the nature of pagan Celtic religion. In this
study, I explore the idea that it may have been shamanistically based, but that
should not be confused with the idea that it was somehow primitive.
The use of shamanistic techniques of entering alternate states of
consciousness such as sensory deprivation, chant and other kinds of music exist in
highly developed religious systems with elaborate ritual and hierarchical structures,
like those of Tibetan Buddhism, Catholicism and V o d o ~ . ~ ~
Therefore, the existence of an organised priesthood does not preclude the
additional presence of a strong shamanistic element. As I will discuss below,
religions can be seen to exist on a kind of continuum. The earliest manifestations of
the religious impulse probably descend kom the Paleolithic hunter gatherers, and
have to do with the magic of the hunt, the animal powers and the elemental forces.
83 This is not to say that all music in litrugy is trance inducing, but these three in particular use, or have used, music in a deliberate way to cultivate a sense of contact with the Sacred.



28
The modern !Kung are an example.84Yet as even this example shows, religions at
this “stage” of development, if it can be called that, are far from primitive or
disorganised.
It is true that as religions develop a greater hierarchical structure they may
grow increasingly concerned with consolidating power in a more political sense,
limiting access to alternate states of consciousness to an ever more specialised
priesthood to enhance their prestige and pri~iledge.~I’propose that pagan Celtic
religion falls somewhere along this continuum. As I will discuss firther below, the
Druids are better described as shaman-priests than shamans, in that they appear to
hlfill both cultural roles. They are also the figures of Celtic tradition who most
frequently present us with the most classically shamanic examples of behaviour.
SHAMANS AND DRUIDS
The idea that the Druids may have had a shamanic role is not a new one
Pokorny made the comparison in 1908, and Piggott in 1962? They are are
described by Roman authors as sacrificial priests, diviners, lawgivers and
magicians. This does not mean that they could not have also had a shamanistic
role-indeed, a good deal of divination is based upon shamanic techniques.”
Shamans in other cultures have multiple roles as well. The main roles of the
Sami shaman were “physician, diviner, psychopomp, hunting magician, and
sacrificial priest.
It is extremely important to remember that the Romans and Greeks, so often
accepted as factual sources of information on the ancient Celts, also had strong
biases. The easiest bias to perceive is the one all people share-they don’t see what
they don’t know.
Roman and Greek religions were for the most part far fiom the shamanic
roots all religions share. They were highly organised, with highly codified rituals
and pantheons. Some of their rituals, at least, were carried out by rote, their original
84 See Campbell. Joseph. 1984. pp. 90-101 85 Campbell, Joseph. 1991c. pp. 231-238 86 Pokorny, 1908-9, p. 16; Piggot, 1962, p. 1 18 87 Elide. 1964. p. 184 88 Pentikgnen, 1984, p. 127

meanings forgotten. This does not usually happen in shamanistic cultures because
meanings. like the rituals themselves, are continually “refieshed” fiom the
Otherworld. They were generally fairly practically minded and intellectual in their
religious observances. Their religious practitioners, with the exception of the
Delphic Oracle and Roman Sybils, don‘t appear to have relied heavily on alternate
states of consciousness to do their jobs.89
By contrast, we know fiom the comments of the Greeks and Romans, Celtic
religon was less codified. There was a tendency to worship outdoors, rather than in
temples. Classical authors may well have found the Celtic attitude to worship
excessively casual. They don’t seem to fully understand it. Worshipping out of
doors, in a less codified manner, is consistent with an animistic, shamanistic
culture. There is also a telling statement made by Tacitus in his Germunia.
While the following statement is ostensibly about a Germanic tribe, we
know that Roman authors fiequently confused Celtic and Germanic tribes. For
example, Tacitus identifies Ambiorix of the Eburones as a German, as well as the
Celtic-named prophetess Veleda. Dio Cassius calls her successor, Ganna, Celtic.”
Additionally, there is no question that Celtic and Germanic tribes
influenced each others religious beliefs. with some scholars arguing that Odin was
borrowed fiom the Lugh of the Celtic pantheon, or that they both descend from a
similar deity.” Therefore, it is reasonable to look to one to glean possible ideas
about the other. Tacitus says as follows.
They do not, however, deem it consistent with the divine majesty to
imprison their gods within walls, or to represent them with anything like human
features. Their holy places are the woods and groves, and they call by the name of
god that hidden presence which is onZy seen by the eye of re~erence.~~(Italics
mine.)
By defmition, directly perceiving Gods in a reverent, contemplative sense is
a shamanistic practice. Of course, as I have noted several times, all religions may

30
be seen to have a shamanistic basis in that they are founded by people who have a
direct experience of the Sacred. Most religions also continue, in one way or
another, to foster that experience for at least some of their adherants, even if it may
be limited to a few "saints" of exceptional shamanistic abilities.
However, in the quote above, Tacitus affirms that Celtic religion was based
so strongly upon this kind of experience and technique that idols of most Gods
were deemed both unecessary to the experience of the worshipper and insulting to
the God. It would be hard to come up with a stronger statement in favour of the
idea that pagan Celtic religion was shamanistically based.
The lack of interest, or actual distaste for representations of the gods
evidently changed dramatically, however, in the Romano-Celtic period. Four
hundred or so deity names occur in the iconography of this period, which points to
an animistic culture, with local tribal or territorial deities.93 It also points to a
shamanistic culture because animistic cultures who seek to contact and propitiate
the spirits of particular places need a medium for discovering and communicating
with them. That medium is the shaman.
Because the Romans and Greeks did not have prominent shamanic figures
in their own priesthoods, it is not surprising that they would not generally recognise
a shamanic figure in another land. (Obviously they would not have used the term
shamanistic either. What I mean is they do not generally note shamanistic features
in the Druid priesthood.)
When they do recognise a figure with "prophetic" or supernatural abilities
that I might term shamanic, such as Veleda, those figures tend to have analogues in
their own culture. Veleda would have borne some resemblance to the Sybils or
Delphic oracles.
Classical authors seem to have difficulty categorising the druids, meaning
that there must have been something about their role that made it hard for Classical
authors to pigeon-hole them. Could it have been their shamanic role?94
The fact that, when we turn to native Celtic sources, primarily early Irish
literature, the Druids take on a much more strongly shamanic cast would tend to

94 Rankin cites this as a possibility in his Celts and the Classical World. pp. 277-278



31
support this argument. For example, Mogh Roith. with his bird-feathered head
dress and ability to make aerial spirit journeys, discussed below.
Priests in different cultures may invoke and even see divine beings, but the
shaman engages in discourse with them, intercedes with them on behalf of their
people and makes spirit journeys into their realm. He may also act as an oracle for
the deities?
The shaman traditionally has a central role in the community. He may act as
advisor, priest, physician and custodian of the cultural myths. He adds to these
myths through his adventures and experiences in the other world. He is above all,
”the great specialist in the human soul; he alone ‘sees‘ it, for he knows its ‘form‘
and its destiny.96He is a liminal creature who exists between the worlds and is h l l y
functional in both.
The Druids obviously had various other hnctions-observing the rituals of
the society, determining auspices or acting as judges and lawgivers. The view of
them as a learned caste of people in Celtic society, similar to the Brahminic caste of
India, makes a lot of sense.97Just as all Brahmins are not priests, so all of the
“Druid caste” would not have been priests or have had the same specialities.
Therefore, some druids may have had a shamanistic role and some not.
Various religious specialists co-exist in many shamanistic cultures. A tribe may
have both a shaman and a sacrificing priest.98I am not arguing that shamanism is
per se the religion of the ancient Celts. or that the entire magico-religious life of the
Celts crystallised around shamanism. One could not say that of even generally
recognised shamanic cultures, like the T u n g ~ s . ~ ~
Obviously, from what Classical authors tell us of the organisation, hierarchy
and twenty years of material to be learned by Druids, pagan Celtic religion was not
a primitive or wholly primal religion. It was a developed religion with what I will
argue are strands of primal and shamanistic elements running through it. I will also
argue that shamanistic figures within Celtic culture had a role in developing that

32
religion. Eliade has noted that “Generally shamanism coexists with other forms of
7 3 100
magic and religion.
The religions of Central and North Asia extend beyond shamanism in every
direction, just as any religion extends beyond the mystical experience of its
priviledged adherants. Shamans are of the ‘elect,’ and as such they have access to a
region of the sacred inaccessible to other members of the community. Their ecstatic
experiences have exercised, and still exercise, a powerful influence on the
stratification of religious ideology, on mythology, on ritualism.’’’
Shamanism appears to be a universal feature in early religions.’”2 Alternate
states of consciousness play a central role in people’s lives in these early,
shamanistic cultures. All people’s access to alternate states of consciousness and
therefore, the Otherworld, tempers the shaman’s leadership. In effect, it is a
spiritual system of checks and balances.
It must be noted that there can also be a kind of continuum between
shamans and priests. As alluded to earlier, it appears that, at earlier stages of
culture, typically that of the nomadic hunter-gatherer, shamans are the dominant
103
leadership figures in society.
However, later, as cultures grow more codified and stratified, specialisation
and the consolidation of political power leads to visionary practice being limited to
an elite composed of shaman-priests. Still later, this elite become wholly priests,
that is, social functionaries who act as intercessors with the Otherworld, but may
have no ability to communicate with it via alternate states of consciousness.Io4
I suggest that we may think of the Druids, or at least some of their number,
the shamanic “specialists in the Sacred,” as shaman-priests falling somewhere
along this continuum. They were not purely shamans, because they also fulfilled
various social roles as custodians of tribal knowledge, lawgivers, celebrants of
seasonal rites and so on. However, they were not just priests, because the evidence
suggests that their practices included a strong visionary element. Their name also

suggests a shamanic role.
The etymology of the word “Druid” has two components. Pliny connects
the “dru” part to the Greek drus, meaning oak. This goes back to the Indo
European root word for “oak.” The word may also derive fiom an Indo-European
root meaning “strong,” the same root that gives the English “true.” The second
component, %id-. connects to the same Indo-European root we get “witness”
from. It relates to knowledge of things seen.’05You will recall, as noted above, that
the Tungus word saman may also be related to a word meaning “to know.,,I06
Therefore. one meaning could be one who has ”strong wisdom.” That is,
wisdom personally known or seen. This has strong shamanic connotations, in that
shamans see spiritual reality for themselves. They do not believe there are spirits,
they know there are.
If the etymology relates to drus, “oak,” as Pliny suggests, this could also
connect to shamanism. “Wisdom of the oak“ may not relate to a tree cult as much
as it relates to the use of the tree in linking the worlds. In many cultures shamans
climb to the upper world on a tree or fly off its upper branches, or follow its roots
down into the lower world in the spirit journey.”” So the word may relate to the
“oak wisdom” or wisdom gained by using the oak to travel to different realms.
Some have argued that the root is actually the same, since the oak is the
“strong tree. If this hypothesis is true, the combination of the ideas of strong
wisdom, the oak as “world tree,” and the fact that the wisdom is based on personal
experience (the %id- root), powerfully suggest shamanism.
,7108
If, on the other hand, the words “oak” and “strong” come fi.om different
roots, the word “druid” would have come fi-om one or the other. Even if this is so, it
is also possible that the ancient Celts may have noticed the similarities between the
two words themselves. Certainly the later Irish Ziterati delighted in finding multi
layered etymologies and double meanings in words. This would have an effect on
the term’s perceived meaning similar to the words coming fi-omthe same root.
As I shall seek to prove below, it seems clear to me that all the general

34
features of shamanism are present in the accounts of Druids we find in the Early
Irish literature. I’ll go into further detail of each facet in the chapters to follow. As
one example, we find spirit flight in Forbuis Droma Damhgaire, as well as mastery
of frre, and the use of classically shamanic accoutrements, such as the encennach,
the bird-winged headdress.”’ Medb and Ailill’s Druid, Mac Roth, has many
shamanic characteristics, not the least of which is his ability to go “could go all
around Ireland in a day.,,I 10
The name of the-filid, is of course also from the same Indo-European %id
root relating to sight, the same root that gives us the Welsh pvelet. The Dictionary
o f the Irish Lunguuge says that it originally meant ‘’seer or diviner...and in earlier
documents generally implies occult power or knowledge.’” There seem to be
reasons to connect these later seers with the earlier Druids, and to connect both
with shamanic practice.”’ TheJiZid also wore a tuigen, or bird feather cape and bird
features are the most common theme in shamanic costuming.’I3
Of course, shamans do not exist in a vacuum. To hnction as shamans, they
must be recognised as such by their culture. Druids are often recognised as
specialists in the Sacred in the way shamans are in other cultures, as examples in
hture chapters will show.
CELTICSHAMANISM:A BRIEFOVERVIEW
A survey of 488 cultures found that ninety percent utilised alternate states
of consciousness to facilitate people’s personal experience of the Sacred. The
scholar who did the study, Bourguignon, feels that the capacity to enter alternate
states of consciousness is part of our psychobiological inheritance as a species. We
are “hard wired” for it. l 4
Eliade noted that since the ecstasy or trance “seems to form an integral part
of the human condition, just like anxiety, dream, imagination, etc., we did not deem

35
it necessary to look for its 'origin' in a particular culture or historical moment." He
goes on to say:
As an experience, ecstasy is a non-historical phenomenon...a primordial
phenomenon in the sense that it is coextensive with human nature. Only the
religious interpretation given to ecstasy and the techniques designed to prepare
it or facilitate it are historical data. That is to say, they are dependent on various
cultural contexts, and they change in the course of history."5
Given all this. it would be surprising not to find these methods in the Celtic
context. I believe that shamanistic patterns exist in Celtic culture because humans
have innate abilities to enter alternate states of consciousness, and many individuals
and cultures appear to have innate desires to do so, as Bourguignon's study shows.
Evidence is plentiful. Contact with the Otherworld, or spiritual aspect of
reality, is ubiquitous in Celtic literature. Initially we hear of this contact in the
myths and epics. Sometimes it occurs through the love of a woman of the Sid, as in
the Serglige Con C'ulainn, or through following an animal in to an enchanted wood,
as in the tale of PwyZZ, Prince (!f'Dyfed.l'6 Sometimes this contact is traumatic, but
in one way or another, it is usually transformative.
The person may return with special spiritual giRs that he can give his
people. For example Pwyll, in his exchange with Arawn, becomes a better ruler.'17
Alternately, the Otherworld contact may prove fatal, as King Muirchetach meets
his doom when he meets the fairy woman Sin.118
When pagan aspects of Celtic practices became increasingly repressed in
later Celtic society, these experiences became less defined and more individual.
The person experiencing contact with the sacred is not necessarily doing it to return
with gifts for the people. In Eact, in some cases having the da shealladh, the two
sights of Scottish tradition, may be regarded as curse rather than a blessing. l9
All of these manifestations have something in common: a direct personal
experience of the sacred. Behind all the tales, there is a person, mythic or actual,

36
who sees, at least for a moment, not through a glass darkly but face to face. A
person, in short, who sees shamanistically.120
SHAMANICCULTURES
An important feature of cultures with practising shamans is that while not
everyone feels the call to become a shaman as a vocation, generally everyone uses
shamanic techniques. For example, amongst Native American tribes, most people
seek spiritual power and a connection with guardian spirits, obtained by the same
shamanic techniques the shaman uses. 12’
Just as one doesn’t have to be a monk to pray. so one doesn‘t have to be a
shaman to experience the spirit journey or personal contact and interaction with the
Otherworld or spirit beings.
This is an essential distinction, especially when I move to later sources. I
am not trying to argue that people in later Celtic tradition were shamans in the strict
sense of the word.’22I will seek to show that they utilised shamanistic techniques to
enter trance and have the personal interaction with the other world to which I have
been referring.
For example. in the 1690‘s. Martin Martin describes a ceremony to receive
a vision not unlike the tarbfeis, a ceremony where the seer is wrapped in a bull‘s
hide described in Irish literature. The seer in this account is not a shamanic
“specialist” but a member of the vision-seeking group chosen by lot.123This shows
that any of them were believed to be able to induce visions in the right
circumstances.124
SHAMANIC DESCRIPTIONOFSREALITY
The fact that shamanic cultures typically draw no distinction between this
world and the Otherworld in conversation and ritual is crucial for our
understanding of the way shamanic themes may be described in Celtic literature.
120 Hamer. 1980, xi 121 Elide. 1964. pp. 156-158 122 Elide. 1964. p.8 123 Martin. 1934, p. 172 124 Machnes. 1989. p.15



37
The idea that experiences of spiritual reality may become mythologised
over time as experiences of physical reality, discussed above, is worth bearing in
mind as I examine the early Irish tales. Some of the things that occur in the tales
would have been physically impossible. However, if they reflect a spiritual reality,
they become readily explicable.
Shamans are aware when they are in one reality or the other. However, they
do not typically distinguish between the realities in speech because it would be
unbearably cumbersome.
I’ll use a Shuar shamanic song to illustrate my point. The italics in square
brackets are mine, saying which reality the shaman is singing about in each part.
I am like T~uni,’ I~’am like Tsuni, [spirir reality] When I drink natema,
all my body becomes cold, [physical reality] and I easily suck out the tsentsak.‘26
[spirit reality] I am always above the clouds, and thus I have power. [spirit
reality] I drank natema. [physical reality] I drank enough to have power ... [spirit
reality] there is a very large body of water. [physical reality] Thus, I am like a
great body of water...[spirit reality] Now I am going to become dizzy, [physical
reality] I will see [spirit reality] when I have become int~xicated.’’[~phvsical
reality]
One can see how awkward it would be for the shaman to draw distinctions
between the realities in his song. He would also not find it necessary to say which
reality he is talking about, largely because shamanic cultures tend to view things
more holistically. They do not draw such hard lines between flesh and spirit, daily
life and religious activity, this world and the other. Where modem Western culture
favours an either / or approach to life, shamanic cultures approach life as more of
an eitherall proposition.
I have heard anthropologist Roy Willis suggest that “alternate states of
consciousness” is actually a better term for visionary states than “altered states.”
Kalweit uses the term alternative states of consciousness.’28Where alternate or
125 The mythical First Shaman of the Shuar. 126 A spiritual parasite. viewed as the cause of illness. 127 Hamer. 1980, p. 161 128 Kalweit, 1992. pp. 81-83



38
alternative both imply one of various equally acceptable states, altered implies that
these states deviate fi-omone “normal” state of consciousness.129 Alternate states is
certainly a term more in accord with the way shamanistic cultures see their
activities.
The use of the term da shealladh, “the two sights,” in Scottish Gaelic may
reflect a similar shamanic view that the two worlds are of equal importance. In the
Gaelic both sights hold equal weight, unlike the English translation of the term as
“second sight.”
Kearney suggests that Irish intellectual tradition also has a holistic approach
to reality, cultivating “an intellectual ability to hold the traditional oppositions of
classical reason together in creative confluence.9 , 130
Mac Cam specifically speaks of the sense of overlap or continuum between
spiritual and physical reality in Celtic culture. He says that modern anthropologists
“have commented on the deep and continual concern of the people in Irish rural
communities of, say, thirty of forty years ago with the inter-relationship between
the two worlds, and there can be no doubt that this is one of the underlying
continuities fiom primitive to modem Irish society.-7131
As I will argue in chapter ten, the way spiritual and physical realities
overlap in the tales also has deep significance when we consider the nature of
certain mythic figures such as the fairy folk. In later times, people with shamanic
abilities were sometimes viewed as being incarnate fairies.’32
Of course, descriptions that suggest sharnanic modes of perception in
narratives are only one kind of evidence. As I’ve shown above, there are many
other kinds of evidence for the presence of shamanistic themes in Celtic literature
and culture.
METHODOLOGY
Disparate kinds of data and the diversity between branches of Celtic
tradition make it difficult to find general truths about Celtic spirituality. Some
129 See Zinberg, 1977, p. 1 130 Keamey. 1985, p. 9

39
would say that even seeking such truths is pointless. prejudiced. or both.'33
I obviously tend instead to agree with scholars such as Mac Cana and
Kearney, cited above, who do not consider the quest for common Celtic ground to
be pointless or prejudiced. I think the earlier arguments I noted in relation to
Celticity in general can also be used to argue for the usefulness of looking at Celtic
spirituality as some sort of whole while simultaneously acknowledging changes
over time and diversity between different branches of Celtic culture.
I have utilised all the traditional sources of Celtic scholarship in my
research: the archaeological record, classical authors, the cycles of Irish literature,
later folklore, some later religious practices, linguistic analysis of particular terms,
and cultural comparison, particularly with other Indo-European cultures. However,
an interdisciplinary study such as this has also required the use of other materials
such as articles and books from the fields of anthropology, neuroscience,
psychology and other sources mentioned above.
I have obviously not been able to include every possible source of evidence
in this study. I used the specific examples of apparent shamanic phenomena and
techniques I found within early Irish literature as a taking-off point to look at the
other sources below. There were also occasions when my prior knowledge of
shamanism, for example, in the area of initiatory illness, led to my actively
searching the literature for phenomena of that nature. While I have made an effort
to take in as much as I could, I have not made an exhaustive study of possible
shamanic materials in hagiography, later folklore or Welsh materials.
SOURCES AND THEIR USE
ARCHAEOLOGY
Archaeological evidence is by its nature objective because it consists of
material remains, but how those remains are interpreted is as subjective as the
interpretation of all other sources.
One limitation with archaeological evidence is that we can only recover
133 See for example, Davis, 1992, Sims-Williams. 1986



40
what the environment preserves. Different materials are preserved best in different
conditions. For example, waterlogged, anaerobic environments such as peat bogs
will preserve some kinds of organic remains such as leather, skin and fabric, but
will dissolve bone. Metal and stone by contrast often survive best when buried.
It also goes without saying that what is found on a dig is never all that was
there, so our picture is never complete. Suppose we make a wild (and perhaps
optimistic) guess and say that 15 percent of what was at a site might be preserved
in the archaeological record. That’s not a lot to go on.
For comparison, think about a room in your house. If you randomly selected
15 percent of the objects it contained, would a person be able to reconstruct your
life story from them? And-how many other stories could they make up that
weren’t your life?
That being said, the chief advantage of archaeology is that, where history
ulwuys comes embedded in the tellers’ viewpoints, archaeological remains were
not designed to deliver a message-at least not to a fbture observer. Therefore we
can make our own interpretations and observations based upon the objects
themselves, not the ideas others have had about them.
THECLASSICAALUTHORS
The pagan Celts generally transmitted spiritual knowledge orally, or via
inscriptions and images that can prove cryptic to the modern observer. Therefore,
the earliest clear written sources we have are those of the classical authors. While
some useful information can be gained from these sources, they must also be taken
with a grain of salt. It was in the Romans’ interest to depict all the races they
conquered as barbarous, or at best as “noble savages” who benefited fiom being
“civilised.‘‘
When I am trying to separate the wheat from the chaff in these sources, I
look frst at the tone of the commentator. For example, the tone Caesar uses when
describing the “wicker man.”
Some tribes have colossal images made of wickerwork, the limbs of which
they fill with living men; they are then set on fire, and the victims burnt to death.



41
They think that the gods prefer the execution of men taken in the act of theft and
brigandage, or guilty of some offence; but when they run short of criminals, they
do not hesitate to make up with innocent men.134
His tone seems inflammatory here, though it is of course difficult to judge
tone in a written source. His description may be intended to outrage those hearing
it, as Romans did not condone human sacrifice at that time, despite the deaths in
the arena for more fkivolous amusement. There is clear archaeological evidence for
sacrifice, but most seem to be individuals. Ann Ross has suggested that at least one
might have been the self-sacrifice of a Druid.’35I do not discount Caesar’s
statement entirely, but would look for corroboration from other sources before
taking it fully on board.
LATERRELICIOLPJRSACTICE
Various scholars have asserted that once organised Druidic teaching on
cosmogony and eschatology was emasculated, pagan and Christian spiritual
systems were able to co-exist to some extent. The two systems “became
complementary rather than competing, and there is some evidence that they
remained so for as long as the Gaelic order endured.7,136
We find a very shamanistic worldview in early Irish Christian poems,
stories and hymns, reflected in their reverence for nature, and belief in the
interconnectedness of all things.137 Of course, most cultures appreciate nature as
well-this is nothing uniquely Celtic. It must also be noted that scholars such as 0
CorrAin have pointed out that some of these works, such as the “hermit poetry,”
may have been purely conscious art, written by the learned, rather than an
autobiographical experience of the sacred in nature written by hermits.138
However, prayers and invocations fiom Curmina Gadelicu provide a
different kind of evidence. These prayers were used for personal devotion, and
reflect the same experience of the immanence of the sacred in natural phenomena

that we see in the earlier Irish works. Carmichael gives one prayer called Jesu Who
Ought to be Praised, (Eosai Bu Choir A Mholadh) composed by a woman in
Harris. According to the story, she had healed herself of leprosy by bathing in a
kind of broth she made of sea plants and shell-fish.
There is no plant in the ground,
But is full of his virtue,
There is no form in the strand
But is full of his blessing.
Jesu! Jesu! Jesu!

There is no life in the sea,

But proclaims His goodness.

necessarily being shamanistic, healers and others seem to appropriate these sacred
powers to effect change in a possibly shamanistic way. We find one example in an
“exorcism” of the evil eye. Here the practitioner says that they trample upon it “as
tramples the host of the elements” (mar a shaltraisfeachd nan ~ u Z ) . ’ ~ ’
Power of wind I have over it,
Power of wrath I have over it,
Power of fire I have over it,
Power of thunder I have over it,
Power of lightning I have over it...

Working ith elemental powers can be a shamani tic technique. To iork
with them the practitioner must be able to at least invoke them. This in and of itself
is not shamanistic. However, ideally, to work most effectively, the practitioner
should be able to interact with or at least see them to know if the invocation has
been successful. This is shamanistic.
As I noted when I quoted fiom Carey, above. the early Irish church seems
to have gone to unusual lengths to preserve some traditions and techniques that
could be seen as shamanistic. I therefore feel that some of the early materials and
teachings of the Irish Church may offer clues about Celtic shamanic practice.
FOLKLORE
Folklore, the study of traditional beliefs and customs, is generally gathered
fiom oral traditions. Some of the most notable collectors of Celtic traditional lore
such as Carmichael and Campbell worked at the close of the 19’ Century. At this
time, some of the overt hostility towards older, possibly pagan traditions had died
140 Carmichael, 1900, vol. 2. pp. 44-45 141 Carmichael. 1900, vol. 2. pp. 44-45



44
down, at least to the extent that “witch buring” had ceased. At this time.
Carmichael and others were well aware that time was running out. People were not
only less interested in persecuting people with traditional beliefs, but were less
interested in these beliefs in general.
Recent years have seen a revival of interest in folk traditions, particularly
those of a shamanic or pagan nature. The fact that so much traditional lore has been
published presents the folklorist with the difficulty of determining how much of
their informant’s data is truly folk-tradition as opposed to popular revival.
Fortunately. I have less difficulty using these materials than someone
primarily concerned with archaic continuities. This work is more about continuity
of shamanistic experience than continuity of religious orientatian.
Due to revival or continuity, Celtic folklore gathered during the 19thand
subsequent centuries offers vivid testimony to continued experiences of contact
with the Otherworld, or at least stories that dealt with this sort of experience. These
stories have clear paralells in shamanistic cultures.
Evans-Wentz gathered a great deal of information about what he termed the
“Fairy Faith. Some accounts that he gathered clearly describe a shamanistic
experience of the sacred. He gathered the following account kom a Protestant
Scottish minister, a native of Ross-Shire living in the Western Hebrides at the time
of the interview. Evans-Wentz says that because “he speaks fi-om personal
knowledge of the Fairy Faith as it was in his boyhood and is now, and chiefly
because he has the rare priviledge of conscious contact with the fairy world. his
testimony is of the highest value.
9,142
,7143
When I was a boy I was a firm believer in fairies, and now as a Christian
minister Ibelieve in the possibility and the reality of these spiritual orders. but I wish
to know only those orders which belong to the realm of grace. It is very certain that
they exist. I have been in a state of ecstasy, and have seen the spiritual beings which
form these orders. [Italics mine.]

describing both folk tradition and his personal e~perience?~Kirk described the
state in which he had his own visionary Otherworld contact as a “rapture, transport,
and sort of death” that the seer experiences as if “divested of his body and all its
senses, when he is first made participant of this curious piece of knowledge.
Among the Araucanian Indians. a person often first receives the vocation to
become a shaman when they fall in trance “as if dead.” Numerous other examples
of this kind of behaviour can be cited.14’
7,146
The great advantage of folklore as a source is that it reflects, to some extent,
the beliefs and experiences of the informant. There is less possibility that it is
wholly fictional-barring the well known phenomenon of an informant having a
joke at the researcher’s expense. Because shamanism is all about a personal
experience of the Sacred, this kind of information is invaluable.
CULTURACLOMPARISON
Cultural comparison, particularly within other Indo-European groups is a
relevant source of information on Celtic shamanism, particularly when there was
continued contact. There are certainly many comparisons between the Norse myths
and the Celtic.14’ Additonally, comparisons between Indian myths and teachings
and those of the Celts are too numerous to list in their entirety.149One
archaeological example is the resemblance between Siva Pashupati, the lord of the
animals, as depicted on an Indus Valley seal, and the much later representation of a
figure who may be Cernunnos on the Gundestrup cauldron.15oThe horns, posture,
and accompanying animals depicted are strikingly similar.
The cauldron itself, of course, is the product of diverse influences.
Manufactured in Thrace and deposited in Denmark, it also features elephants.
Therefore, it might well be argued that if it depicts elephants it might also depict
Pashupati. The cauldron, like Celtic tradition itself, incorporates many influences,
so we cannot positively say where particular elements came from. Nonetheless, it is

an interesting comparison.
Besides looking to other Indo-European cultures, commonalities in
shamanistic practice world-wide can be used to illuminate possible Celtic practices.
LANGUAGANED TRANSLATION
One of the problems with the mass of popular literature on Celtic
spirituality is that it misses real items of spiritual interest, and puts false
assumptions in their place.
For example, the way Scottish Gaelic speaks of the self as separate from
emotions, physical states and belongings says more to me about a Celtic sense of
the self than ninety percent of what appears in popular literature.
To say, “Thu an t-eugd orm,” or “The fear is upon me,” is very different
than saying the English equivalent: “I am afraid.“ Though the root grammatical
structure underlying the English does not identifv the fear with the self. the
construction as it is used does. “I am afraid” is like saying, “I am Joe,” it identifies
emotional affect with the self. It implies that the emotion is not a state. but is what
one is. The Gaelic by contrast implies that the self is a separate essence fiom its
emotional states.
Points such as this may easily be missed in translation. Even when a
translation is mostly accurate, one often finds that translators leave out certain
passages because they are obscene, offensive or strange. This is particularly true of
the earlier translators, and particularly problematic for the subject I am researching.
which may have elements of all three.
When the translator is interested in “reconstructing” what they see as a
pagan Irish tale, they may leave out passages that betray clear Christian influence.
They may also leave out interesting passages because they do not relate to the
primary story. For example, Gantz doesn’t translate the segment relating to
kingship in the Serglige Con C ~ Z a i n n . ‘W~h~ile it is unrelated to the central tale, it
has usefd references to the tarbfeis. It also seems significant that someone saw fit
to insert it in this story dealing with initiatory illness and the spirit mate.
151 Dillon. 1975, pp. 8-1 1. par. 21-27



47
Gantz also doesn’t include the final scribal “disclaimer,” as follows:
So that is the destructive vision shown to Cu Chulainn by the people of the
Sid. Demonic power was great before the faith, and it was so great that devils
would fight bodily against the people, and they showed pleasure and hidden things
to them as if they were existing permanently. It is thus that one believed in them.
So it is on account of those visions that the ignorant talk of the Sid and the folk of
the Sid.Is2
This is obviously not pagan, probably the reason it was cut, but it is
revealing. It illustrates that people in prior times, according to this scribe, did have
a personal and interactive experience with Othenvorld beings. They even fought
bodily with them, possibly implying a human oracle. It also says that the “ignorant”
still talk of the Sid “on account of those visions” at the time of writing.
All that having been said. there are good translations of many tales, and as it
would have been impossible to translate all tales with points of shamanic interest
myself, I have utilised these translations where they exist. Of course, where my
interpretation has hinged on a particular reading of a word, I have examined the
text in the original. I have also translated some texts of particular importance to my
case in full, like the Aislinge Oenguso and Serglige Con Culainn.
Needless to say, my translations owe much to those who have previously
translated the stories or segments I have later translated myself. Jackson and Dillon
in the above cases.153I additionally owe many thanks to Prof. R.M. Scowcroft and
Prof. William Gillies for those translations done under their supervision.
O L D IRISHAND MIDDL ‘EWELSH LITERATURE
The tales of Old Irish and Middle Welsh literatures were written down,
edited and “re-visioned” in many ways by the Irish and Welsh Ziterati.
Consequently, we can never be positive what came fiom where, and what is
missing fkom the picture of pre-Christian Ireland they convey. However, Mac Cana
believes that the Irish monastic literati preserved a surprising amount.

...a remarkable wealth of pagan story, usage and belief, much of it extremely
archaic and a good deal that might seem amoral or scabrous to modern eyes, but.
as I have argued elsewhere, they were for all that selective in what they
preserved...there are certain areas of pre-Christian belief and practice which are
almost wholly undocumented and yet which we know must have existed because
the general contextual pattern suggests so and because the suppression of
evidence has not been perfect.9, I54
There are passages dealing with explicit sex and assorted bodily fimctions
that certainly offended the earlier 19 I h and 20th Century editors and translators
enough that some of them left the passages out, such as the Dagda’s intercourse
with the Fomoire girl in the Cath Maige Tuired. There are also themes that seem to
be pagan Celtic. The scribes sometimes added a disclaimer. as at the end of the
Serglige Con Culainn.“’
Some sources even appear to hint at a continuity of worship. For example.
the lothcentury poet, Eochaid ua Flainn, finds it necessary to put this aside into a
poem: “Though he (the author) enumerates them, he does not worship them.” (Cia
dosruirmem nis adram.)lS6(That is, the Tuatha De Danann.) His statement implies
that there were those who did, or were at least believed to, at the time of writing.
Another source says that the Aes Side are “dei terreni or Side worshipped by the
foik.-- 57
The question of continuity, is, of course, only one difficulty that confronts
us as we attempt to view the texts through a shamanic lens. I believe that one of the
best ways of sorting out possible pagan continuities and evidence of archaic forms
of shamanism is by use of materials not generally used in Celtic scholarship.
A holistic approach to the problem of Celtic shamanism, the only approach
likely to yield significant results, requires the tools of anthropology, comparative
religion, psychology, neuroscience and the new physics as well as those of the
Celtic scholarship.

A HOLISTICAPPROACTHO THE QUESTIOONF CELTIC SHAMANISM
Many linguists and Celticists have missed evidence of shamanic themes in
early Irish literature because of their lack of experience in shamanism. There are
various notable exceptions, of course. Without their precedents my own work
would have been made much more difficult if not impossible.
Most recently, after I completed my MSc on initiatory illness. I was excited
to find that Carey had drawn the Same conclusions about Cu Chulainn's wasting
sickness in a paper published in the proceedings of the Tenth International
Congress of Celtic Studies.15*Melia's article on Adamnan's shamanic initiation as
the source of power and legitimacy that enabled him to promote the Cuin
Adomnuin is also very usehl.'j9 Nagy's work on Finn mac Cumaill and other areas
of shamanic interest in the literature has been invaluable. I also owe much of my
own work on the goddess figures of early Irish literature to Mac Cana's prior
work?" Although he does not explicitly refer to shamanism his idea of the queen
as a symbolic goddess is only a step short of mine that the goddess manifested in
the person of her shaman-oracle.
From the other side, anthropologists have not been able to utilise Celtic
materials because they don't have the necessary linguistic skills. Another reason is
the fact that they have an easier time working with living, well-documented
cultures. The problems of transmission and continuity that I have listed above are
sufficient obstacles to discourage all but the keenest from investigating Celtic
shamanism.
One of the few anthropologists to have studied Celtic materials to any
extent for shamanic phenomena is Eliade himself. In particular, he speaks of the
episode where Cu Chulainn's battle heat must be cooled in vats of water, not unlike
the frenzy of the Kwakiutl hamatsa after his trance possession. 162 He also devotes a
section of Shamanism to possible shamanic phenomena amongst the Indo
Europeans.'63

A very important source of information is recent research on how the brain
functions, learns, and may experience transcendent states. The brain's structure has
not changed in the couple of thousand years between the ancient Celts and
ourselves Researchers from diverse fields have come to new understandings that
may be used to shed light on mystic experience in general and that of the Celts in
particular.
For example, Arnold Mandell describes how severe stress may induce
transcendent experience in his article Towards a Psychobiology o f Trunscendence:
God in the Brain. Much earlier, Pavlov discovered that a curious thing occurred
when his dogs nearly drowned in a flood. Some of them seemed in a beatific state.
Put under severe stress, nearly up to their noses in water when rescued, the
hippocampus in the brain shut down all external stimuli and amplified the internal.
This may have created the sort of grand unified experience described by mystics,
sometimes after severe penance, fasting, and other austerities.'64
This is relevant to the exploration of trance induction via ascetic practices.
Methods such as fasting, praying in freezing rivers, and the initiatory ordeals of
figures such as Adamnan are well attested in Celtic literature.
Adding the perspectives afforded by these branches of research, is,
however, only one part of the equation. The other is to attempt, however
cautiously, to see shamanism itself in some respect as those who practice it. and
apply those insights in turn to Celtic tradition.
W H E N THE ANTHROPOLOGISATRSRIVTEHE GODSLEAVETHE ISLAND
There are two ways to approach cultural research. One is as the academic,
standing back and viewing the subject. The other is trying to get inside the minds of
the people you're researching-to view the myths, the practices, and the universe
closer to the way the subjects might have viewed it.
In this and many other areas, scientists and academics are moving towards
more holistic and interdisciplinary approaches. They are coming to recognise that

discussing its aspects, the method shouldn’t be codused with reality itself as a
wh01e.’~’ A number of anthropologists in recent times have highlighted the
importance of actually experiencing shamanism to their research. ’66
There is a Haitian proverb: “When the anthropologists arrive, the Gods
Holger Kalweit, an ethnopsychologist with degrees in
leave the island.
psychology and anthropology, likens using only Euclidean concepts and rational
thought to understand shamanism to using a tape recorder to record a painting. All
you get is the hum of the machine itself.’68In the same way, the researcher records
more of his own perceptions than those of his subjects.
7,167
Reductionist and materialist viewpoints alone cannot make sense of Celtic
spirituality. I think to understand the Celts one must understand a more holistic
view of reality itself, reflected in the Celtic sense of connection to nature, and in
the experiences of oneness with creation that we fmd in the myths.
In acknowledging these other views of reality, we do not remove
empiricism, but expand it and become more objective. As my father, Dr. George
Mueller, modern re-founder of the science of organic geochemistry and a NASA
scientist, used to say, to view the scientific method as the only method of
perception is, in and of itself, unscientific.
Without throwing the intellect out the window, one has to acknowledge the
validity of a world view that does not draw hard lines between body, mind, and
spirit, religion and daily life, this world and the Otherworld. Therefore. to hope to
come to an understanding of an ancient culture, we cannot solely use methods and
a mindset that might well have been totally alien to the people in question.
Shamanic cultures that we know of, such as the Kwakiutl, tend not to view
man as the prime mover in the universe. Therefore, if their behaviour is discussed
purely in terms of kinship, warfare, and prestige issues, we miss the true motivation
behind it.’69The outward social form is based upon myth and visionary experience.
This is appears to be equally true of Celtic culture. As John Carey has said

in a recent article, “Again and again in early Irish writing, history is rooted in
eternity: society, and the kingship in which society is crystallised. derive their
legitimacy, and indeed their existence from the supernatural realm.79170
The Tain provides us with a prominant example of supernatural
considerations superceding practical ones. The passage begins with a gathering
before the raid.
So, then the four provinces of Ireland were gathered together in
Criiachain Ai. Their prophets and druids did not permit them to go thence, but
kept them for a fortnight awaiting an auspicious omen...On the Monday after the
autumn festival of Samain they set out
Doecmultu dum iurum ceithre coiced Hkrend CO mbatur hi Cruachnuib
Aii. Ocus n k teilcset a fathi ocus a ndruid ass sein CO cend ctjicthigis oc irnaidi
seoin...I n luan iar samain is and documlaiset. 171
In practical terms, Samain is an awful time to go on a raid. Cath Ruis nu Rig
recommends late spring and summer for raids because the roads are dry and
smooth. the rivers shallow, the woods sheltering with their foliage and the warriors
in good spirits.172 Sadowska attributes the decision entirely to religious concerns.
Contrary to all practical considerations, the winter timing of the
campaign could be considered auspicious precisely because its start was linked
with the great religious festival...by assembling at Cruachain Ai the hosts were
perfectly positioned for the samain night celebrations. being close to the famous
Sidh ar Crziachain, known as the “Hell Gate of Ireland,” believed to provide
entrance to the Otherworld...It was believed that the festival temporarily removed
barriers between the natural and the supernatural, bringing the universe back into
primordial chaos. However, it was fiom this disorder that the New year emerged
as a commencement of a new cycle...It could be suggested therefore that it was
these magic and symbolic ideas of the “dissolution of established order” and the
marking of a ‘‘new beginning” that prompted Medb and her druids to a campaign
170 Carep, 1996. p. 201 171 0‘ Rahilly. C.. 1976. p. 114. lines 21-23 172 Fitzgerald, 1979, p. 151



53
at the onset of the otherwise inauspicious winter season...The regeneration
of...nature was thus symbolically linked with the attempt on the part of the
Connacht leaders to establish a new order in the political arena. It can be
postulated that the Ulster raid ws staged not so much for the purpose of a single
loot for cattle from Cuailnge, but in order to crush for good the enemy's military
and political strength...the ideological associations generated by the festival
would offset the practical inconveniences and disadvantages of staging the raid in
winter.'73
Of course. we cannot attempt to examine the nature of the interchange
between this world and the Otherworld in early Irish literature without addressing
one of the most knotty problems of Irish Studies. That is, the conflict between the
so-called nativist and anti-nativist approaches to Irish literature and myth.
For something to be considered a myth. rather than just a tale. presupposes
that it has some validity to its culture. This is one reason why Claude Levi-Strauss'
view that all variants on a myth are equally valid has not been embraced in Celtic
studies.'74 Alterations made to Aboriginal myths are made by Australian
Aborigines who still believe in. and experience. to some extent. their ancestor's
cosmology. By contrast, pagan Celtic tales came through the hands of Christian
Ziterati promoting a different cosmology. The question remains: can we see a
continuity of any sort and what is its significance?
RETURN OF THE NATIVIST
Scholars of Old and Middle Irish have viewed early Irish texts in various
ways. For example, the tale 0 Cuiv called The Romance ofMis and Dubh Ruis was
seen by Mac Cana as a manifestation of the theme of king and goddess, emanating
from pagan Celtic tradition.175One might wonder whether she is a female Suibhne.
and a largely literary endeavour.
The Aislinge Oenguso, or Vision of Oengus, is a sophisticated literary work.
However, it also contains themes that may go back to the Indo-Europeans. For

54
example, Dillon thought that the sercc ecmaise, “love in absence” or “love of a
spectral love” in Irish literature bore a resemblance to the Indian literary
convention, udrskzkiima, defined as “love of an unseen one.,7176
Camey dubbed some Irish scholars “nativists” because he felt they paid too
little attention to the literary contributions and Latin influences of the
rn0na~teries.lIn~~general, scholars such as he and McCone tend to view Irish tales
as literary products, not reflecting ancient traditions to any great extent.’78 By
contrast, scholars such as 0 Cathasaigh, Dillon and Mac Cana see them as possibly
retaining very archaic pagan elements.179
The anti-nativist position may be seen as a pendulum swing reaction away
fkom the work of earlier scholars. Some of these scholars, like O’Rahilly. tended to
over-emphasise themes such as solar worship, pagan mythology and nature-based
religion to the exclusion of other possibilities. Early research into Celtic spirituality
reflects romantic ideas of the “nature-worshipping“ noble savage prevalent in the
1gthand early 20thcenturies.
In a very important article, Sims-Williams states his belief that the idea of
the visionary, occult Celt is largely derived fiom an 1854 essay by Renan, although
Ireland was regarded as a land of saints for a long time before.”’ He is. of course,
quite correct that classical authors Celtic ethnology may be as suspect as modem,
coloured as it is by ideas of “noble savages” and mysterious Celts with a “special,
profound spiritual discipline.39 182
However, there is also no reason to say there was no spiritual discipline
simply because others have exaggerated it. Similarly, simply because some may
have exaggerated Celtic contributions to medieval Otherworld literatures, as Sims
Williams suggests, does not mean that Celtic literature does not have a strong
visionary component. Folklore about the dir shealladh in Scottish tradition. and
visionary experience in other Celtic traditions also suggest that the visionary

55
component is supported by actual practice.lS3
Sims-Williams also notes that the Celts themselves have apparently
cultivated the perception of themselves as visionary and “other” from ancient
times.*84They must have had their reasons. To cultivate a pose means that, at the
least, you see some power or good in it.
One example of the kind of exchange that occurs between “nativist” and
“anti-nativist” schools of thought is Mac Cana’s response to Carney’s assertion that
the Otherworld is described in a Christian fashion as a place of chastity. He says
that one thing “is clear beyond all doubt: the Irish Otherworld of Immram Brain
and comparably early texts is not ‘characterised by an extreme of chastity.99- 185
Mac Cana feels that Carney misreads the evidence because he presumes
that Immram Brain “is a thoroughly Christian composition: given this premise, it is
easy to assume that, where sexual relations are concerned, sinlessness is
synonymous with chastity. If. on the other hand, one adopts a less absolute
approach to the text, if in particular one allows the native and traditional element to
fmd its own level in the course of the enquiry rather than reduce it or preclude it in
advance, one will arrive at a very different interpretation.77186
If one allows the native element in, it opens at least the possibility that no
sin does not necessarily equal no sex. There is also the option of sinless sex.
Given the nature of my research focus, it should come as no surprise that I
tend to put myself more on the nativist side of the fence-with certain caveats. As
Mac Cana says, I believe we must approach the texts with an open mind, and allow
“the native and traditional element to find its own level in the course of the
enquiry.”
I also freely acknowledge that I am concerned with literature here, albeit a
literature with elements arguably drawn fiom pagan mythology and oral
tradition.187 Mac Cana Believes that the Irish Ziterati were clearly conscious that
they were doing something new and creative with their cultural inheritance.18’

Whether it was synchronising Irish mytho-poetic history with the Bible.
consciously archaising their own compositions, or ingeniously synthesising foreign
influences like Isidore of Seville with their own materials, imagined or oral, they
were certainly writers, not just scribes.
Even if we were able to directly observe the pagan Celtic religion of two
thousand years ago, Eliade noted that “nowhere in the world or in history will a
perfectly ‘pure’ and ‘primordial’ religious phenomenon be found.*, 189
pagan Celtic religion must have incorporated many influences even before
the Christian. Thus, we cannot seek a “pure” Celtic manifestation of the universal
phenomenon of shamanism. Nor can we ever wholly resolve questions of origin
and influence, since no religion is ever wholly “new.” Celtic literature in part
reflects what visibly remains of pagan Celtic religion.
I once heard Dr. Scowcroft say that Celtic texts may be viewed as
mushroom-like in that the hngus itself is actually under the ground and not visible.
The mushrooms are the flowering bodies above ground.”’
The myths and sagas aren’t identical with pagan Celtic religion and
philosophy, which remains largely hidden, but in some ways, the myths may be
seen to manifest what they grew from. Moreover, as 0 Cathasaigh has said, the
myth making process did not stop in Christian times.”’ Tales of Cormac Mac Airt
still served as myths, inspiring and guiding those who believed they descended
from him, long after Ireland had been Christianised.192
The implications of the conflict between nativist and anti-nativist views to
my study are various. Shamanic phenomena manifest in most cultures and
religions, at least for certain people. You could look to St. Theresa of Avila, or St.
Gertrude the Great of Helfta. as well as to Balinese shamans and the heroes of
Celtic myth for accounts of divine marriage. A Covenanter going through a ”dark
night of the soul” experience, an Eskimo shaman going through his initiatory crisis,
and a modem day person experiencing “spiritual emergency,” may also describe a
strikingly similar state. By my definition, all of these experiences could be called

shamanistic.
On this level, whether the experience stems from pagan, Christian, or a
combination of both traditions is ancillary to its reality and essential nature as a
shamanistic experience.
Therefore, this study has two strands. The first is identifLing shamanistic
experience in Celtic culture wherever it occurs. The second is drawing attention to
facets of experience or practice that may represent continuities of pagan Celtic
religion and shed light on its nature.
One example of how I shall try to untangle these strands is the way I deal
with initiatory crisis in chapters one and six. Those who experienced an initiatory
crisis in later times did not do so in a purely or perhaps even partially pagan
context. However, what I hope to prove is that these experiences occurred, and did
so in a way which is so classically shamanic that the survival of some pagan
elements seem likely. In turn. as I shall detail in chapter six, I believe that the use
of the word commairge or “guarantor” in the Serglige Con Culainn, may reflect
something of the shamanic figure’s role in pagan Celtic religion.
One might question if some of the elements of initiatory crisis that I take to
be possible pagan continuities might not rather be drawn fiom Biblical accounts,
albeit ones that may themselves have shamanistic features.
For example, the Biblical tale of Nebuchadnezzar’s madness, where a
spiritual crisis makes him grow talons and feathers, and flee into the wilderness,
could be a source for the tale of Mis.’” One remarkably close shamanic analogue
to her story is that of the Pacific Northwest Coast Kwakiutl hamatsa or cannibal
dancer. Some features appear in the cases of Mis and the hamatsa which do not
appear in the account of Nebuchadnezzar. These include cannibalism, a bath in
water heated by hot stones to return them to sanity and the sense that the illness
itself is of crucial importance to the community. The theme of immersion in fluids
to restore to sanity also occurs in stories of Cu Chulainn, leading Eliade to draw
parallels between them.’94To me, this makes it seem likely that these tales preserve
vestiges of pre-Christian Celtic shamanism.

58
Of course, the similarities between Mis. Cu Chulainn and the hamatsa also
lead to the question of where Celtic shamanism may have come from.
FROMWHENCE CELTIC SHAMANISM?
The similarities between Kwakiutl. Siberian and Celtic shamanism that I
will reveal in upcoming chapters raise the question of origins. As mentioned
earlier, brain functions transcend culture. Place someone in a situation of sensory
deprivation over three days, whether in a modem purpose-built tank, a cave, buried
under loose sods, or in a tomb, and something will happen.
There may also be strong similarities from one person to the next in the
content of their experience. The symbols that may arise are frequently those of the
“collective unconscious,” as Jung put it. These are the mythic themes that pop up
everywhere, fiom death and resurrection to spirit marriage. Campbell has related
them to the “innate releasing mechanisms” observed by students of animal
behaviour. These are inherited structures in the nervous system enabling animals to
respond to stimuli never before experienced, as the new-born turtle knows to race
to the sea or the chick knows to flee the silhouette of a hawk passing overhead.195
There are also theories of direct diffbsion, starting with those of Frobenius,
which explain Siberian / Native American and other connections.196Thomas
Burrow, in The Sanskrit Language, notes that the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo
Europeans must have lived in long and close contact with a race speaking proto
Finno-Ugric, ancestor of later Siberian languages. This race gave them various loan
words.197 Eliade felt that Hindu meditative practices directly influenced Siberian
and Asian shamanism, which would bring us full circle. If Indo-Europeans
influenced Siberians and Asians, their practices in turn, might have fed back into
Celtic shamanism via later contact.’”
There is also the matter of foreign influences. As Celtic art incorporated
foreign influences kom the earliest times, it is hard to imagine the Celts were not
influenced by other cultures in deeper ways. Perhaps the best way of looking at this

59
influence is the way in we look at the integration of foreign elements in Celtic
artwork. We see the influence. but the Celtic craRsman made the motifs his own.199
Shamanic cultures are characteristically receptive to new teachings,
adapting them to what they already know. People in shamanic cultures can always
ask the spirits themselves if a particular practice or idea is right for them.
By contrast, some branches of Christianity believe that God’s message for
humanity, once and for all, is in the Bible. While they may believe that the devotee
can commune with Christ, any teachings received through that communion would
need to be in line with existing scripture to be acknowledged as divine, rather than
diabolical, revelation. “Revealed” teachings that contradict church teachings on,
say, sex outside of marriage, are not accepted in this kind of Christianity, though it
goes without saying that this is not true of Christianity as a whole.
St. Patrick’s Purgatory in Lough Derg in Ireland was supposedly built for
this purpose, although it evidently had a lively pre-Christian history as well.”’ The
Irish refked to believe in a hell or heaven unless they saw it for themselves. Hence
the three days in a dark cave, akin to the burial under sods we hear that St.
Columba’s disciple, Oran, A primitive sensory deprivation chamber.
where shutting out the sight of this world opens sight of the other. The end of the
tale, where Oran is buried yet again, lest he cause dissension, reveals the limits
within which visionary practice could be allowed in later times.
It must also be stated that the Christianity which replaced the pagan Celtic
religion brought with it strata that relate to Mithraic and other forms of ancient
religion. Just because it is not Christian does not mean it is pagan Celtic.
Conversely, I might add that just because it is Christian does not mean it is
not also pagan Celtic, since the Celts would probably not have accepted a religion
that bore no relation to what went before. For example. by the archaeological
record and Classical accounts, the symbolism of sacrifice was obviously important
to pagan Celts.202It is also central to Christian theology.203It is not a far stretch to

60
imagine that some kind of meeting of the minds might have occurred between
Christians and pagans around this symbolism. Attempting to unravel all these
strands will be a key and difficult part of the equation.
CONCLUSIONTS:HEDIFFICULTOYF DEEPERREADING
The outline above shows enough comparisons with Eliade‘s classical model
of shamanism to warrant this study. My goal is to give the scholar a place to go to
begin their quest. It is an entry in a conversation already begun by Eliade, Carey,
Melia and others, one that I hope will both stimulate hrther discussion and provide
a useful matrix to kame it.
As far as the evidence that follows goes, I’d suggest that the reader bear in
mind Occam’s razor. The simplest explanation that encompasses all the phenomena
we will discuss in the upcoming chapters is likely the best.
Generally speaking. if it goes into trance like a shaman. wears feathers like
a shaman, journeys like a shaman, heals and hexes like a shaman-in short,
shamanises like a shaman-it probably is a shaman.
However, the basic documentation of shamanic phenomena in Celtic culture
is, I believe, a place to start but not finish. The bigger question is what may it
mean? Cosmology and underlying philosophy are special challenges in Celtic
materials because pagan spiritual exegesis, among other things, is precisely what
monastic redactors removed.
As Mac Cana has said of Noinden Ulad, the tale of Macha’s Twins. bb...one
suspects-and not entirely without evidence-that in the Druidic schools of the
pre-Christian period such narratives would have been accompanied by a body of
exegetical commentary, but that this was suppressed by monastic redactors by the
simple expedient of not recording it.7,204
Mac Cana finds a parallel to the tale of Mongh mac Fiachna‘s precocious
wisdom found in a cosmogonic tale of Vishnu as a McCone argues that the
story of the boy Jesus in the temple is a more convincing source, and that “vague
similarities with a highly evolved Indian theological exposition“ do not necessarily

61
point back to a common Indo-European prototype.206Again, one problem with this
assertion is that theological exposition is precisdy the sort of thing the literati
would have edited out.
What I have looked for, in part, is the “gutted” narrative, those stories that
have incongruous elements that plainly suggest that there’s something missing. The
perspective afforded by comparison with shamanic cultures and reference to Norse.
Indian and other Indo-European literatures has sometimes suggested possible
deeper layers of meaning in these tales.
I fully recognise. as Carey has noted. that anyone engaged in “deep
reading” risks imposing his or her own interpretations on the material and seeing
the symmetries their own theories suggest, and, as he concludes, “the deeper the
reading, the greater the risk.,7207
However, as the samurai used to say, the greatest victory lies an inch f?om
your opponent’s blade. I have played it close to the blade-but, I hope. not too
close.

INITIATORY ILLNESS AND SPIRIT MARRIAGE
...the best things we have comefiom madness, when it is given as a grft o f a god. The prophetess o f Delphi and the priestesses at Dodona are out oftheir minds when they perform thatfine work of theirsfor all of Greece...but they accomplish little or nothing when they are in control of themselves.
Plato‘
Shamanic initiatory illness is an experience of psycho-spiritual darkness
and dissolution that tears down the individual’s old ego structure.2 Many shamans
begin their career with this dramatic episode of altered consciousness.
Traditional Western psychiatry has tended to class initiatory illness and
other forms of what some have termed “spiritual crisis,” as manifestations of
mental illnesses like schizophrenia or psych~sis.R~ecently, however, psychiatry
has demonstrated greater openness to more holistic views. For example, the
recognised standard psychiatric diagnostic manual, the DSM IV, recently added
“religious or spiritual problem” as a possible d i a g n ~ s i s . ~
Lukoff s work draws valuable distinctions between psychotic disorders and
shamanistic initiatory crisis and other kinds of spiritual crisis.’ For one thing.
MEPF, Mystical Experience with Psychotic Features, the diagnosis he proposes for
what I term spiritual crisis, generally has an internal coherence. There is a clear
story, and that story has archetypal components. Wilber suggests that anyone
“familiar with the philosophia perennis can almost instantly spot whether any of
the elements of the particular psychotic-like episode have any universal-spiritual
components, and thus easily differentiate the “spiritual channel” psychoses
neuroses fiom the more mundane (and oAen more easily treatable) pathologies that
originate solely on the psychotic or borderline levels.”‘
I cannot detail all the ways of differentiating between mystic experience

with psychotic features and straight psychosis or schizophrenia here, however, one
widely agreed upon point is that the shaman is invariahZy healed and thereby gains
the power to heal other^.^ A person cannot become a shaman unless they have
moved through their crisis to a place where they are h l l y in control of their states
of consciousness.
When anthropologist Michael Harner was studying with the South
American Jivaro tribe, he noticed a man who was always in the jungle talking with
spirits. He asked one of his Jivaro informants if the man was a shaman. ‘No,” came
the response, “he’s crazy.“’
The Jivaro considered him crazy because he had no control of his state of
consciousness. Shamans move between the worlds. This man was always in the
Otherworld. Additionally, his communications with spirits were apparently not
applicable to his community, or to what that community saw as a productive life.
By contrast, the passionate and personal relationship with the sacred that
shamans attain does not psychologically disassociate them from physical reality. It
leads them to greater effectiveness in all facets of life.
THEUNION THAT FOLLOWSLOSS
Many cultures see acquiring a spirit-mate as part of the shaman’s initiatory
process. That is why I include it in this chapter.
The spirit-mate forges an intimate and deeply felt bond between the shaman
and the Otherworld.’ The spirit-mate instructs the shaman and enables him to
perform feats. Both the shaman and his mate become intermediaries between their
respective worlds and the other.
Many mystical traditions, not just the overtly shamanic, have seized on the
imagery of human love and marriage as a natural way of seeing and experiencing
the union of the soul and the sacred.” For example, in several Catholic orders, nuns
traditionally received a wedding ring, and ceremonially responded, “I love Christ,
whose bed I share.” Metaphysical eroticism features in East Indian mysticism,

65
since "someone embraced by the primordial self can be neither within nor
without." '
Needless to say, in these traditions God is not just a spirit-mate, but God's
union with the soul may be depicted as a symbolic marriage. It should also be noted
that conversely, in animistic cultures that see all parts of creation as facets of Deity,
the spirit-mate is potentially not just a spirit-mate either. The spirit-mate, like the
totem animal, is potentially a conduit for vast power. They can become, in effect,
the personal manifestation of the God or Goddess for the shaman.
THESTAGES OF INITIATORY CRISIS
The stories I've chosen to explore here for evidence of the themes of
initiatory illness and spirit marriage are Aislinge Oenguso, Serglige Con Culainn,
and The Courtshb ofMis and Dubh Ruis. These tales show classically shamanic
features and yield some evidence of a shamanic culture surrounding the afflicted
person's experience.
Because initiatory illness has several distinct phases, I've synopsised each
story first below, then gone on to examine each stage as it manifests in all three.
Later chapters dealing with other themes will not follow this more complex
structure because there is no "storyline" involved as there is in the stages of
initiatory illness.
The stages are onset and ordeal, recovery, and the transmission of gifts. In
the first, the protagonist experiences psycho-spiritual crisis. In the second, he is
healed, in part by uniting with a supernatural or supernaturally gifted being.
Finally, he transmits the spiritual gifts he has received to his community.
THE TALES
THECOURTSHIP OF MISAND DUBHRUIS
This fascinating story illustrates many aspects of shamanic initiatory illness.
Mis, daughter of Daire Doidgheal goes mad after her father dies in battle and she

drinks his blood. She races fkom the field in madness, and goes into the wilderness.
Her hair grows long and she grows a coat of fur or feathers. She becomes a
menace, killing animals and humans. The area where she lives becomes a
wasteland. Despite this, the King of Munster offers a great reward for her capture
alive.
Dubh Ruis, harper to the king, takes up the quest. He attracts her with his
music, and succeeds in reawakening memories of her father and past life. They
make love, and gradually Dubh Ruis begins to reintroduce her to civilised ways of
eating, sleeping, and bathing. In two months. he helps her return to sanity. The coat
falls from her and he takes her home and marries her. She bears him four children,
and becomes one of the most beautihl and accomplished women in Munster.
Sadly, Dubh Ruis is later killed while collecting rents and Mis composes a song
over his body. ’
I have generally referred to Brian 0 Cuiv‘s synopsis for the “broad strokes”
of the text, and his edition of the text has been used for translation purposes where
there was a need to go into greater narrative detail
AISLINGEOENGUSO
Oengus, son of the Dagda and the Boann, sees a young girl in a vision each
night, playing upon a stringed instrument by his bed. He tries to draw her to him
but she vanishes. He becomes ill, and his mother decides they must find this girl.
They encounter many obstacles along the way and get help from many quarters
before they finally succeed. The girl, Caer, takes the form of a swan on alternate
years. To win her, Oengus must call to her when she is in swan form on the lake at
Samhain. He does so, and they unite. They return to the lake, then take flight,
returning to Oengus‘ home. They sing so beautifully together that they put
everyone there in trance for three days and they stay together thereafter.

differ fkom his reading. For my own, I used Fr. Francis Shaw’s 1934 e d i t i ~ n . ’ ~

SERGLIGE CON CULAINN
This story also begins with a supernatural visitation. Cu Chulainn and the
Ulaid are at Mag Muirthemne for the Samhain festival. A flock of glorious birds
arrives and all the women want them. Cu Chulainn succeeds in getting birds for the
other women but misses out Emer, his wife. She is displeased, so when two birds
that are more beautihl arrive, he sets out to catch them, despite the fact that Emer
and Loeg, his charioteer, fear they are supernatural birds.
He misses his cast at them, something that had never happened before, and
sits against a particular standing stone in an ill temper. He falls asleep, and two
fairy women beat him with horsewhips until he is almost dead. He remains in a
catatonic state for a year, until a fairy man comes to him,saying that everything
happened because Fand, a fairy woman and wife of Manannan, desires his love.
First Loeg, then Cu Chulainn go into the Otherworld.
Fand and Cu Chulainn become lovers, much to the consternation, and “only
jealousy” of Emer, who gets the “long knives” out for Fand. In the end, Fand
returns to Manannan, and Cu Chulainn to Emer. Druids give Cu Chulainn and
Emer a brew of forgetfulness. They forget the whole incident, and Manannan
shakes his cape between Cu Chulainn and Fand so they will not meet again.

MIS
Mis’s illness begins in trauma, when she goes to seek her father’s body on
the battlefield. “After finding the body covered with a multitude of bloody wounds,
she proceeded to suck the blood fiom the wounds.” (..iar bhfaghiiil an [51] chuirp

68
MacilleDhuibh has gathered various examples, fiom which I draw the references
below?’ Deirdre drinks Naoise’s blood at his death.” Emer drinks Cu Chulainn‘s
fkom his mouth at his death.” Caoineadh Airt Ui’Laoghaire says, “Your blood
flowed in streams; / and I did not wait to clean it / But drank it with my palms.”’’
Edmund Spenser, in A View of the Present State of Ireland. written between
1580 and 1599, says that the Gads and ancient Irish used to drink their enemies‘
blood. He goes on to say that he had personally seen the Irish do this only with
fiiends. He describes Murrogh 0’Brien’s foster-mother drinking all the blood fiom
his mouth while his executioners quartered him, saying that ‘The earth was not
worthy to drink it” while tearing her hair and shrieking.20
A thorough investigation into this theme is beyond my scope here, but it is
certainly of interest for fbture work.21On the surface, it seems to be an immediate
emotional response to a loved one‘s violent death. It’s hard to say whether the
practice has its origins in ritual, or began with an emotional reaction that was in the
process of becoming ritualised when the stories were composed or written down.
Perhaps it represents participation in the death. The loved one has blood in
their mouth due to their violent death. The blood drinker also has blood in his or
her mouth, putting him or herself in a symbolically similar position.
One scene in Scda Mucce Meic Dathb may relate to this idea. When Cet
contests for the champion’s portion with Conall, he admits that Conall is the better
man. However, he says, if Anluan his brother was there, Anluan would be a match
for Conall. Conall responds that Anluan is there, produces his severed head, and
throws it on Cet’s chest, “so that a gush of blood broke over his lips.”22
The original Irish, like the translation, is ambiguous. It could mean that
blood from the head splashed across Cet’s mouth, or that blood came to Cet’s
mouth spontaneously in some way in response to the trauma, or most simply, that
Conall simply bashed him very hard with the head.

69
Whatever the case, blood comes into contact with his mouth, and Cet
immediately admits defeat. He symbolically shares both his brother‘s death and his
defeat at Conall’s hands. This seems to point towards blood-drinking as
participation in the loved one’s suffering.
If blood drinking is a ritual death for the drinker, the act ties in with the
omnipresent theme of initiation: that of a ritual death and rebirth.23I will have
occasion to return to this theme repeatedly in the upcoming chapters, because
shamans are often seen as people who are “already dead,” who live in a perpetual
initiatory state due to their ongoing contact with the Otherworld. As we shall see in
Mis’s case in particular, there is a clear sense of her dying to her old state of being,
and entering a realm of primordial chaos.
BLOOD-DRINKIANNGD TAKIN IGN POWER
In the stories and folklore, blood is often drunk ftom the loved one‘s mouth.
Various texts and folklore speak of’the soul departing the body through the mouth,
sometimes as a moth or butterfly.24Perhaps drinking the blood from the mouth may
be taking in a part of the soul, keeping the person alive in some sense within the
drinker. The Jivaro believe that there is a vital soul that resides in the blood, and the
Scythians drank their enemies’ blood ritually to possess their enemies valour.2’
In other cultures, blood drinking can be associated with assuming ancestral
power. The ancestors are also often instrumental in calling a person to become a
shaman.26In other cultures, people honour their the ancestors, and keep their power
“within the family,’’ by eating them after death. For example, the Yanomamo mix
the ashes of dead relatives with water and drink them.27
Blood drinking may also be associated with trance possession, a point to
which I will return in chapter five. However, there is one account f?om the Isle of
Man that is relevant here because it identifies symptoms similar to Mis’s with
possession, albeit of an unwilling variety.

70
Evans-Wentz gathered this account fiom James Caugherty, a farmer and
fisherman on the Isle of Man concerning a boy who he had played with as a child.
According to Caugherty, fairies chased this boy and when he returned home he
could not speak, his hands and feet had turned awry, and his nails had grown.
Finally, when he “came to himself‘ he described being “taken away” by his
pursuers but could not remember where. His parents considered him a “changeling”
or possessed by afairy spirit.28
Carney acknowledges the possibility of possession in cases of geZtacht. He
notes that the person “developed great bodily agility-a result of possession by a
spirit7’”’
FLIGHATND FEATHERS
After she falls ill, Mis runs off into the mountains, and her hair and nails
grow. She can run like the wind and levitate. She grows a clzimh; a coat of what
may be feathers or fur.” However, the word is derived fiom the Latinpluma, so its
primary meaning is feathers, and The Dictionary of the Irish Language has more
examples of this word used as feathers than fur.31Feathers are more shamanically
significant because the shaman’s power of spirit flight make avian imagery a
dominant feature in shamanic costu~ning.~’
Suibhne has a similar sort
feathers and acquiring powers of
written story of Mis borrowed this
of experience, fleeing a battlefield, sprouting
levitation. I t may of course be that the later
component fiom S~ibhne.~S’ome sources also
say that gelta wore “feather dress.”34
Another possible influence is the Biblical tale of Nebuchadnezzar’s
madness. In it, Daniel explains a dream that has troubled Nebuchadnezzar with the
still more troubling prophecy that he will be driven into the wilderness in madness.
A year later, Nebuchadnezzar hears a voice fiom heaven. telling him that his
28 Evans-Wentz, 1990. pp. 132-133. (hdics mine.) 29 Came). 1955. pp. 146-147 30 0 Cuiv. 1952-1954,p. 328. line 19 3 1 Royal Irish Academy. 1990. p. 124. headword clum 32 Elide, 1964, pp. 156-158

71
kingdom is “departed fiom” him and he is to live as a beast of the field. “The same
hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: that he was driven from men,
and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his
hairs were grown like eagle’s feathers, and his nails like bird’s claw^."^^ He
remained in madness until he recognised Daniel’s God as the God, who gives
human kingdoms as He chooses.
We cannot discount the influences of Nebuchadnezzar and Suibhne’s tales,
but there are initiatory elements in Mis’s story not present in the above accounts.
These include a possibly ritual bath and sexual union as elements of the
protagonist‘s return to civilisation, as discussed below.
One must also remember, as I noted in my introduction, that many parallel
behaviours and experiences arise quite naturally between unconnected shamanic
cultures due to near universals in human experience and brain fimction. People
“flying” to the Otherworld may be said to “grow feathers,” and may costume
themselves in feathers. We find parallels to Mis’s tale in shamanic cultures that
obviously could not have influenced the story.
One is in the initiation of Wurajeri Australian shamans. Baiami, the creator,
appears in the physical form of a shaman. Kuli, holy water, flows from his mouth
over the students. The water flows into their bodies, penetrating their skin, without
a drop being lost, and this causes them to “soon sprout feathers from their arms,
which later grow into wings.“36Like Mis, the Wurajeri shamans take in a special
fluid from a person of power. Mis drinks her father’s blood, the Wurajeri absorb
kali, which they see as liquid quartz crystals, fkom the Creator himself, embodied
as a shaman. In both cases, feathers sprout afterwards.
In Mis’s case. she could run like the wind, overtaking anyone or anything.
and would then consume all she wanted of the flesh and blood of her kills. Mis
caused the Barony of Clan Maurice to become like a desert. 37

72
Cu CHULAINN
Cu Chulainn also suffers a trauma. In his case, it relates to his self-image.
He misses his cast at the enchanted birds in the tale-something that has never
happened to him before. This puts him in a bad fkame of mind, and he goes to sit
with his back to a particular standing stone.38This sequence of events may imply
that he is deliberately seeking Othenvorld contact, though the text does not say that
he is.
AAer sitting by the stone for a time, two fairy women appear with
horsewhips, and beat him until he is nearly dead. Some of the Ulstermen want to
try to wake him, but Fergus tells them not to, for he is seeing a vision.3YWhen he
awakes, he asks his friends to carry him to a sick-bed in Tete Brecc. There he
remains, in what psychologists might describe as a catatonic schizophrenic or

calls to my mind an image of a young Bushman being called back fkom a spirit
journey.42Deep in trance, ntum masters, masters of supernatural power, surrounded
him, blowing on him, holding his head and calling to him.
One Bushman described the experience this way: “They take hold of your
head and blow about the sides of your face. This is how you manage to be alive
again. Friends, if they don’t do that to you, you die.”43
After Cu Chulainn had been in the catatonic state for some time, one of the
Aes Sidee, Oengus, comes to speak with him. Cu Chulainn’s companions ask him
why he is not afkaid to come into the midst of all these great warriors. He responds
that Cu Chulainn is more the guarantor of Ulster in his current state than he has
ever been, and he fears nothing because he has come to speak with Cu C h ~ l a i n n . ~ ~
This is physically inexplicable, because Cu Chulainn is incapacitated. However, it

is spiritually explicable. as I shall explain in chapter six. The point here is that his
illness is in the process of increasing his power.
Li Ban, a fairy woman who comes to seek his aid in battle against her
husband’s enemies, says something that a f f m s this. He complains he is not in a fit
state to contend with men that day. Li Ban responds that his debility will last but a
little while and promises. ”thou shalt be whole, and all that thou h a t lost of thy
strength shall be increased to thee?
In one version of the Serglige, Cu Chulainn sends word to Emer that “the
women of the Sid have come to me, and injured me; and tell her that I am getting
better and better.‘46 In initiatory illness, the person is not just healed, but brought to
a higher spiritual and psychological state than ever before.
This is also true of what psychologists have termed “temporary psychotic
disorders.” Menninger notes that some patients “have a mental illness and they get
well and then they get weller! I mean they get better than they ever were...This is
an extraordinary and little-realised t r ~ t h . ” ~
OENGUS
Cu Chulainn’s catatonic state is similar to Oengus’ suffering in the Aislinge.
Oengus sees Caer one night in his room, but when he tries to draw her to him she
vanishes. The nature of this “seeing” is not made explicit. The tale doesn’t mention
him dreaming, it just says that he saw Caer. Aiding may be a vision or a dream, but
the only time the world occurs is in the title.
Having seen Caer, he starts to pine for her. He does not eat, or speak to
anyone about what is troubling him. Finally, Conchobar’s physician Fergne
discovers the problem-sercc e‘cmaise, literally, the “love of an absent one.
says it has been destined for Oengus to love her.

se‘gdae dunn nu cumcem do socht.) 49
Socht has been described by Watkins as a particular sort of stupor, a
pathological state imposed from outside the e@?s (Italics mine) Shamanistic
cultures see initiatory illness as a form of illness imposed fiom outside the self by
the spirits.
However, the word is not only used to describe what may be a spiritually
induced crisis. It also occurs in Scda Mucc Meic Dathd when Ailill, Medb, and
Conchobar all want Mac Datho’s dog. His dilemma puts him into socht.” Where
Oengus may be described as catatonic, Mac Datho tosses and turns and cannot
sleep. The distinguishing feature of socht therfore seems not to be symptoms but
source, that is, it is a state of distress with differing symptoms brought about by an
outside force.
The distress thus imposed brings about a sense of extreme powerlessness.
Mac Datho cannot give the dog to both Conchobar and Ailill and Medb, but the
consequences of insulting any of these parties would be terrible. Oengus does not
know where the girl is or how to find her. At this stage no solution presents itself.
OVERVIEW OF THE ORDEAL STAGE OF INITIATORY ILLNESS
As noted above, shamanic cultures do not recognise everyone who has
unusual experiences as a shaman-the person may simply be crazy. Early Irish
tradition describes various kinds of mental incapacity. A person could be an idiot,
(me‘r),a fool, (druth). a lunatic, (ddsachtach),or an unreasoning person, (iconn).j2
These illnesses do not seem to have a clear spiritual component, or convey spiritual
gifts to the sufferer.
By contrast, the terms used in the above cases seem to refer to a different
kind of state or states. Cu Chulainn’s serglige may mean either a “wasting
sickness’’ or a “love sickness.” Oengus has a serc e‘cmaise, love of an absent one.
The usage here implies a state of longing. This may relate to the longing for union
with the sacred that mystics describe. Oengus also has socht, a catatonic state

imposed by pressure from outside. Mis, has another kind of state that seems to arise
fiom outside pressures: she is geilt.
In her case, as in Suibhne’s more famous one, the state arises when she
suffers trauma relating to a battle. In both cases, becoming geilt leads to acquiring
supernatural powers and creative gifts. putting it more in the class of initiatory
illness than insanity.
Mis story says, “Moreover, the flightiness of her madness gave her such an
impetus that she would run like the wind, so that she would overtake anything she
wanted to in the world.” (Do chuir $0, <foluamhaina gealtachais an seoladh
siubhail sinfiithe go ritheach mar an ngaoith ionas go saruigheadh a rith, nidh ar
bith budh mhian lC...)j3
One incident in Suibhne’s tale seems to indicate that Mis and Suibhne are
not alone in their experiences of geilt. indeed, it seems almost an institution.
Suibhne arrives at the “ever delightful” Glen Bolcain. “It is there the madmen
(gealta) of Ireland used to go when their year in madness was complete, that glen
being ever a place of great delight for madmen.”54
Giraldus Cambrensis speaks of a place in his Topographia Hibernia? that
Stewart feels must be Glen Bolcain, later known as Gleam na nGealt. It is a
magical rehge for hunted beasts and birds as well as madmen? The term geilt
sometimes denoted m h a l s ? Indeed, one point of geilt is that animal and human
distinctions are blurred in this liminal state?’
A sense of powerlessness and sometimes fear is prominent in Mis and
Suibhne’s tales. In general, in the stories above, Mis, Oengus and Cu Chulainn are
all in situations in which they feel powerless. Oengus desperately wants to find
Caer, but initially does not have the power to attain her; a point emphasised
throughout the text. As one example, on the first night he sees her, “He had no idea
where she had vanished from him.” (NiconJitir cia arluid huadJ5’

deal with her father’s death. Thus, all of them are in a state of powerlessness.
Spiritual growth and appeals to the supernatural often occur when a person faces a
situation they cannot deal with. There are no atheists on a sinking ship.
It also makes sense fiom a psychological perspective as some scholars have
viewed the shamanic vocation as compensatory mechanism for a felt state of
powerlessness or lack of social prestige. The shaman may also use their vocation as
an excuse to hlfil socially unacceptable desires, including, for lack of a better term,
“Dionysian” ones.59As we can see in Mis’s case, she behaves well outside the
norm, both violently and sexually, especially for a woman of the time in which her
story is set.
CULTURALSLUYPPORTEDSCHIZOPHRENIA?
The origin and significance of the shaman’s crisis has been a source of
ongoing controversy am0ngst anthropologists and psychologists, Psychologist
Julian Silverman essentially views the shaman as a culturally supported
schizophrenic.“ He quotes Sullivan, speaking of the shaman’s “schizophrenic
process.” He says, “What we discover in the self system of a person undergoing
schizophrenic change or schizophrenic processes is...an attempt to cope with what
is essentially a failure at being human-a failure at being anything one could
respect as worth being.”6’
In this assessment, the pre-shaman, or pre-schizophrenic, is engaged in a
desperate coping mechanism while in the first throes of initiatory illness. They are
attempting to replace a bad self-image with a divine, archetypal one. They are
trying to replace a desperate sense of unworthiness, felt as a consequence of their
“failure at being human,” with a sense of extreme worthiness, religious mission,
divine election, etc.
Some psychologists say that it is due to this mental shift, from inadequacy
to ego inflation, that the person concerned experiences an eruption of archaic and
uncanny imagery.62 In my three examples, an experience of the supernatural

77
follows a sense of powerlessness. Of course. Oengus initial vision occurs before the
sense of powerlessness sets in.
Comparative experiences can be found in later Lowland Scottish society
within the religious revival movement known as the covenanter^.^^ At the initial
stage of conversion. the Covenanter felt an intense and painful awareness of
sinfblness and separation fkom God.h4Visions of attack by demons and deep
despair were common themes.
Covenanting families at the beginning of the 18thcentury considered all this
quite ordinary and proper. So much so that when a servant, mourning and weeping.
awaked Mr. Wodrow, the minister, and his wife, they thought it was just a normal
part of the trauma that attends spiritual rebirth. The poor woman was actually
pregnant because ~ f r a p e . ~ ’
Bessie Clarkson, another Covenanter, had three years of crisis during which
she says she would have been burnt alive to assure her salvation.h6A perceptual
shift followed this stage of crisis, where the minister led the sufferer to perceive
himself or herself as one of the saved, and have experiences of blissful union with
GO^.^'
So, in one of my examples, Cu Chulainn might have replaced a sense of
inadequacy borne of his poor marksmanship with the realisation that he is good
enough to be desired by the wife of a god.
THEUNION THAT FOLLOWS THE CRISIS
Another feature common to this stage of shamanic initiatory illness is a call
of some sort issued by a spirit-mate. Both Oengus and Cu Chulainn have a
precipitating encounter with Othenvorld women. Each of them fall into a state of
illness during the time it takes them to achieve union with the spirit woman.
The nat kadaws or ‘hat wives” give us a Burmese example of spirit
63 Here I am not arguing that the Covenanters were -’Celtic.“ or were continuing ancient shamanic practices, I am simply using them to provide another comparision. in the same way that as I used Aborigine examples earlier.

78
marriage. In Burma, the shaman is chosen by a spirit desiring them as mate.
Refusal to marry the nat, as these spirits are called, can result in misfortune, illness,
madness and even death.
Daw Pya, a female shaman, delayed her nat marriage, and took a human
husband. At thirty-seven, her spirit-mate insisted she divorce her husband. During
this time, she lost all her property and became ill. Her symptoms included seizures,
palpitations, vomiting, and, as with Oengus, an apparent inability or unwillingness
to digest solid foods. The inability to eat certain, or any, foods is a feature of
initiatory illness in various cultures, among them the Zulu and the Korean!* Daw
Pya married her nut and returned to full health, regaining her pr~perty.~'
If the divine marriage resolves psychological and spiritual polarities, one
can see how resisting the archetypal figures that have arisen in the psyche could be
met aggressively by the s u b c o n s ~ i o u s .T~im~e is also required to assimilate these
figures.
Cu Chulainn's beating reminds me of the way in which wrathful Tibetan
deities can be experienced as bliss if there is no ego resistance to their will.7' When
Cu Chulainn returns later to the stone where the women first whipped him, Li Ban,
the fairy woman, emphasises that the women did not seek to do him injury. but.
rather, sought his f i i e n d ~ h i p .H~e~then experiences a blissful union with Fand.
Experiences of dismemberment, or physical assault, such as the beating Cu
Chulainn received, are also common to shamanic initiation.73 The wife of one
Siberian shaman said that while her husband was ill he had dreams: "He was beaten
up several times, sometimes he was taken to strange places."74
Many traditions also describe the catatonic state. The body may become
cold and rigid, frozen in the position it was in when this state first occurred.7s
There are a number of comparisons to Mis's situation. Pripuzov describes
how the potential Yakut shaman becomes fienzied, then suddenly loses

79
consciousness, withdraws to the forest, and feeds on tree bark.76
The closest comparison I have found to Mis, however. is that of the
Kwakiutl hamatsa, or cannibal dancer. Both Mis and the hamatsa become crazed
and voracious, living out in the woods. Both will consume human and animal flesh.
Both are said to gain supernatural powers by this experience. All the f o r m of onset
and ordeal described in these Celtic tales occur in anthropological accounts of
shamanic initiatory illne~s.~’
Shamanic initiation’s purpose is to re-make the individual. Upon his
ceremonial return to society, the hamatsa acts as if he has lost his memory. His
tribe has to teach him to eat, dress. and walk again.” Mis loses her memory as well.
Remembering her past life, and civilised ways of eating, drinking, and bathing are
important features of her recovery.
Sometimes initiates even forget how to speak after initiations. This calls to
mind an example fiom Welsh tradition. Warriors restored to life by Bran’s magical
cauldron of regeneration cannot speak after this “rebirth.”79In this tale, however,
there is no suggestion that the death is initiatory rather than actual.
A last point to note is that Mis. Cu Chulainn and Oengus are all from noble
families. As I pointed out in the introduction, many cultures think that spiritual
gifts like the second sight can go in family lines, and these families may considered
to be of high status because of their spiritual powers. For example, amongst the
Kwakiutl the hamatsa must be a chief or the son of a chief?’ All chiefs are also
considered shamans in some respects.
RECOVERFRYOM INITIATORCYRISIS
Mis
In Mis’s case, sexual union with Dubh Ruis, as well as his harping, restores
her to sanity. The simplest Freudian reading of her recovery would say that she
76 Elide. 1964. p. 16 77 Elide. 1964, pp. 34-66 78 Walens, 1981. p. 161 79 Rhys, 1892, p. 256 80 Goldman. 1981, p. 112 81 Goldman, 1981. p. 4



80
calms down after her sexual desires are gratified. By this interpretation Dubh Ruis
also restores a sense of pleasure to her life. He helps her remember that the
civilised world that she has abandoned has some enjoyable aspects.
However, I think that the Freudian reading explains only part of the story. It
does not explain the community’s interest in Mis’s recovery, or some of the
possibly ritual aspects of the tale, particularly those that correspond to recognised
practice in other shamanistic cultures.
Additionally, Dubh Ruis is presented as a person of unusual abilities. She
does not attack him like everyone else because his music has the power to soothe
her and restore her to awareness of her prior life. His music literall-y has
consciousness-altering properties which suggests that its maker may have had
shamanic abilities. I believe that there is good reason to see Dubh Ruis as a
shamanic figure, making the whole process initiatory as well as cathartic in a
psychological sense.
As I have discussed earlier, and will explore much further in later chapters,
there are a several types of Irish figures that may be seen to have cultural roles that
can include shamanic features. These include warriors, kings, and musicians and
poets, especially the-filid. All of these roles required specialised training which in
many cases s e e m distinctly shamanistic. To be a sage or poet in particular required
spiritual training. Kings like Cormac Mac Airt seem to have strong connections to
spiritual practice as divine king. married to the goddess of the land. Musicians and
music, particularly that of the harp, often have magical associations.82
The possibly older poetic component of the tale describes Dubh Ruis as a
warrior, sage, p e t , and prince and Mac Cana has suggested that he may have been
the son of a king in earlier tales.s’ This collection of associations, first, the
associations of Dubh Ruis with a set of roles, second those roles’ association with
shamanic practice, provides evidence, albeit somewhat circumstantial, that Dubh
Ruis may be a shamanic figure.
If Dubh Ruis is such a spiritually powerful figure, his ability to restore Mis
to sanity might be that of an initiated shaman training a newly called shaman. He

81
would have shown her how to handle her new level of spiritual power.
Some traditions, like Tantra, associate spiritual power, specifically the
“mystical heat” of shamanism, with sexual energy.84 Thus, Dubh Ruis having
intercourse with her might represent a use of this energy. Mis seems to be
overloaded with power and out of control. Therefore, the sexual act might have
been a channel for all her excess energy. In the text, the banter between them is
also quite bawdy, and the humorous exchange serves to distract her from mourning
her father.
Initially Dubh Ruis’ harp music attracts her. It has a soothing effect. There
is, of course, a strong relationship between shamanic practice and the use of music
to alter consciousness.86
Interestingly, there is also a connection here again to the method of return
of the Wurajeri medicine men I spoke of earlier. Having sprouted feathers and
learnt to fly, he subsequently “sang off his wings” and returned to this world.”
RITUALSOF RETURN
After Mis and Dubh Ruis sleep together, Dubh Ruis is hungry, so she
catches a deer. Dubh Ruis kills, skins, and cooks the deer, using a cooking pit dug
in the earth filled with water and hot stones. Dubh Ruis has also brought bread with
him. She says that she remembers bread, and associates it with memories of her
father? The Kwakiutl make the hamatsa eat food in a civilised manner as part of
his return.89
After the food, Dubh Ruis puts her into the pit with the broth of the deer
and bathes her.” This ritual bath seems particularly significant for several reasons.
First, an immersion in fluid in the form of a bath or baptism rite is significant in
many spiritual traditions. It represents a rebirth. For example, the Kwakiutl bathe
the harnatsa as part of his return to society. They inhse the water with special
84 Elide, 1964. p. 437 85 0 Cuiv, 1952-1954. p. 330. lines 64-70, and p. 327 86 Elide. 1964. pp. 175. 179-180 87 Harner, 1980. p. 59 88 0 Cuiv. 1952-1954.p. 330, lines 79-80. p. 333 89 Walens. 1981. p. 161 90 0 Cuiv. 1952-1954. p. 333



herbs and heat it with stones. The Brazilian Macumba priestess, Maria-Jose, says
that ritual bathing is “death by instalments,” washing away the initiate‘s personality
bit by bit until the initiate becomes a yao, a consort of the gods.”
Giraldus Cambrensis describes an Irish king inaugurated, in part, by a bath
in the broth of a sacrificed white mare, also after a sexual en~ounter.’T~here are
also references to people such as Ceithern being put in a tub of the marrow of cattle
to rejuvenate them.93
COOKING AND COOLING
One of Cu Chulainn’s boyhood deeds gives another example of a people
using a bath to return an individual to society. After killing his frst men, Cu
Chulainn arrives back at Emain Macha with their heads, as well as live swans and
stags, tied to his chariot. As he comes, Conchobar says, “if measures be not taken
to receive him prudently, the best of the Ulstermen must fall by his hand.’194
Here we have the idea that the spiritual power, and its physical
manifestation in Cu Chulainn’s battle prowess, must be moderated in some way.
Like, Mis, Cu Chulainn is overloaded with power, and a danger to fiiend and foe.
All of Emain Macha’s women go out with bared bosoms. Cu Chulainn turns
away in modesty. The Ulstermen then seize Cu Chulainn and dump him in a vat of
cold water. The frtst vat bursts the second boils over, and the third is still hot, but
by then, he has returned to his normal state.”
This bears a relationship with the hamatsa ceremony, which I have been
comparing to the story of Mis. When the hamatsa comes back from the wilderness
crazed with a desire for human flesh, a naked singing woman holding a corpse
lures him into the long house. 96 This woman must dance in a lascivious manner
and must be a relative of the hamatsa. Since Cu Chulainn is Conchobar’s nephew,
it is probable that some of the women of Ulster are relatives. So we have both the
sexual component, although the young Cu Chulainn is depicted as embarrassed

83
rather than aroused, and the bathing to cool down his potentially destructive power.
Both Eliade and Dumezil have noted the comparison between this event in
Cu Chulainn’s career and the hamatsa’s initiation. Eliade concluded that Cu
Chulainn’s ferg, or magical heat, means that he has gained possession of sacred
power. Though ferg simply means “anger, wrath or ferocity,“ its supernatural
nature is quite clear from the way it’s used in context.
97
I will discussferg in detail in chapter three, but one particular point to note
is that the Tain repeatedly depictsferg as a skill unique to the Ulster warriors as a
group. Warriors, as described in Irish literature, all seem to have the capacity to
become enraged so ferg must be something a bit different from normal rage.
Additonally, Fergus claims that the Ulster warriors are invincible because of their
This is clearly not normal rage or ferocity, which as we all know. does not
guarantee victory in anything.
Comparing Cu Chulainn to the hamatsa, Eliade says that like the heat of the
cannibal “the wrath of the young warrior, which manifests itself in extreme heat, is
a magico-religious experience; there is nothing profane or natural in it-it is the
syndrome of gaining possession of a ~ a c r a l i t y . “(I~ta~lics mine.)
I00
By contrast with Cu Chulainn, Mis and the hamatsa have warm baths.
This seems to be about making the power useh1 to the community, rather than
“cooling” it. Perhaps “cooking” rather than “cooling” the power. Levi-Strauss
writes in detail about cooking as a metaphor for civilising.’”’ For example, various
Californian tribes put pubescent girls into ovens, hollowed into the ground. ”After
being covered with mats and hot stones, they were conscientiously ‘cooked., 9 7 1 0 2
...the individuals who are ‘cooked‘ are those deeply involved in a
physiological process: the new-born child, the woman who has just given birth, or
the pubescent girl. The conjunction of a member of the social group with nature
must be mediated through the intervention of cooking fire, whose normal function
is to mediate the conjunction of the raw product and the human consumer. and
97 Eliade, 1958a pp. 84-87 98 O‘Rahilly. 1967, pp. 116-1 17. 120, 4224-7. 4362-5. trans. pp. 252. 256 99 Eliade, 1958a p. 85 100 Walens. 1981. p. 160 101 Levi-Strauss. 1970 102 Levi-Strauss. 1970. pp. 335-336



84
whose operation thus has the effect of making sure that a natural creature is at one
and the same time cooked and socialised...103
Besides this 4 4 ~ ~ ~ k iDnugb,h”Ruis also scrubs Mis with great vigour.
He took a piece of deer hide and rubbed (violently) the joints of her body
and bones all over, and he proceeded to scrape and scratch her, and to buff her
smooth with the tallow of the deer and with the broth until he cleaned her for the
most part, and until he brought rivulets of sweat out of her in that manner ... He
was in that way in her company for a span of two months on the mountain, and at
the end of that time the feathers fell from her completely, as a result of her
protracted scraping and cleaning as we have described and moreover (until) her
sense and memory returned...104

This violent scrubbing may be a way to bring Mis back to a sense of
physical reality, as the ntum masters blow and rub on Bushmen in trance to return
them to this world. In addition, shamanic initiatory crisis strips away the old self.
This may manifest quite graphically in dismemberment experiences.‘06 In Mis’s
case, she is not ripped limb fiom limb, but the text stresses her being scrubbed.
This occurs in an opening in the earth. often an entry point in the shamanic journey,
and in a broth made of a sacred animal. Dubh Ruis then builds a hut for them, and
they stay there for two months, until he has helped her fully restore her sense and
memory.lo7 In a sense, like many shamans, Mis is both dis-membered and re

In Mis‘s story, the community support often expressed for the shaman‘s
initiation is not present at this stage. Rather, the earlier fact that the king did not
want her killed, but rather, restored to reason and returned to them, reflects
community support for the process.
Cu CHULAINN
Cu Chulainn’s healing begins when Oengus (a different one fiom our
protagonist in the other tale) tells him Fand’s love is the cause of his illness, and
the cure is union with her in the Othenvorld.108
Both Conchobar and Loeg, Cu Chulainn’s charioteer, take on the role of
expert advisor, or “senior shaman.” Cu Chulainn asks Conchobar’s advice. He tells
Cu Chulainn to return to where the fairy women beat him. He does so and speaks to
the fairy woman, Li Ban, who seeks his aid in battle. First, he sends Loeg, his
charioteer, into the Othenvorld. When Loeg comes back with good tidings, Cu
Chulainn feels strengthened in mind by what he has heard.”’
It should be noted here that there are some textual problems with these plot
points. The heroine’s name changes at one point, for example, so we are obviously
dealing. as usual, with various versions or possibly different tales that are cobbled
together with imperfect attention to detail. For example, after Loeg returns, the text
takes off on an apparent tangent, where Cu Chulainn delivers instructions on
kingship to his foster-son, a point I will return to below. However, although the
seams are visible, I believe the garment holds together as a whole. Whoever
assembled the version we have obviously saw it as a whole story, rather than
fiagments, and I do not feel the meaning has been impaired by what I believe are
errors of detail.
Emer then chides Cu Chulainn for lying in bed over the love of a woman, at
which point he arises and goes to speak with Li Bin.’ l0 So here, he acts on his own
behalf for the first time since the precipitating incident occurred. After some more

discussion with Loeg, he goes into the Otherworld, and does battle for the fairy
man, Labraid.
We then have a recapitulation of his boyhood return f?om battle, where
people place Cu Chulainn in vats of water to cool his battle frenzy. Fand meets him
after that.’’’ They spend a month together. At the end of this time, he arranges to
meet her at a yew tree later. Shamans have often used sacred trees as entry points to
the Othenvorld.*’2In later folklore, Thomas the Rhymer also goes to meet his
spirit-mate, the Queen of the Fairies, at a particular tree.’ l 3
Cu Chulainn seems to be in full fettle again. In some respect, these
incidents seem to reflect a greater level of mastery of the forces he encountered
when he was younger and in his first battle fury. Cu Chulainn, who was then
embarrassed by the nakedness of the Ulsterwomen, now happily cohabits with
Fand. Of course, this is far fiom his first sexual experience.
The stages in the “return” process are less clear in Cu Chulainn’s case than
they are in that of Mis. It is possible that the druids’ magical brew of forgethlness
created a final stage of return or readjustment to human life.’l4
There is strong community support for Cu Chulainn‘s recovery, an essential
feature in most shamanic initiations.’I” Members of the community surround Cu
Chulainn in the bedside scene. Emer plays a pivotal role in stirring him to action,
and Loeg acts as his intermediary with the Otherworld.
Community support is also present in bengus‘ story.
OENGUS
During Oengus’ illness, supernatural or supernaturally gifted beings such as
Fergne, the Boann, the Dagda and Bodb gradually gather to help him. Similarly,
the shaman gathers the help of tutelary spirits in his quest for power.’l6
Fergne seems to take the role of “senior shaman.” His magical diagnostic
powers enable him to see what is wrong with Oengus and what should be done next

about it. He also sees that Oengus is destined to be with Caer.”’
Assorted forces are called in to help, the pattern being that another helper is
called as each one fails to find the girl. First Fingen diagnoses Oengus, then asks
that the Boann be summoned. Boann fails to have the girl found, and so summons
the Dagda. The Dagda suggests that they speak with Bodb, who finally locates
her.’” The same sort of thing occurs when Bodb, then Medb and Ailill, and then
even Ethal, the girl’s father, say they don’t have enough power to give the girl to
Oengus.
0 Cathasaigh has commented on the way the passive and impersonal
constructions that are such a striking feature of the text mirror the fact that
‘dengus’ love for Caer is visited upon him.”*19This is also emphasised by one
possible translation of Oengus’ name, the “One of Choice,” or the “Chosen One.”
This would be derived from gustus, ‘*choice,’*in turn derived fiom do-go-a. ‘TO
choose.7.120
A constant feature of shamanic initiatory illness is that it comes unsought.
Traditional cultures generally see shamans who actively sought the role, and were
not “called” to it by initiatory illness, as less p o w e r f d 2 ’Additionally, passivity is
a necessary stage in the mystic process, where the soul releases all resistance to
divine will.
The end of this stage occurs for Oengus when, hlly empowered, supported
by the community, and at the auspicious and potent time of Samhain, he goes to the
lake to meet Caer. When he goes to the lake, he takes the first ritual action on his
own behalf in the story. At this point, the tale does not refer to him as Oengus,
which means “Chosen One,” but rather, as in Macc de,or “the Young Son.77122
As I shall discuss in chapter five, the fact that Oengus is given a title may
mean he has gained the power to oracle the “Young Son” in a divine family headed
by Boann and the Dagda. Having consummated his love with Caer, he is then ready
to move onto the next stage.

OVERVIEOWF THE RECOVERSYTAGEOF INITIATORCYRISIS
In these stories, sexual union of some sort, with a spirit-mate or with
another shamanically powerful being, seems to be an essential feature of the return
to sanity. In many cultures, the experience of divine union, a merging with the
feared powers that bring about the crisis, is what resolves the crisis. Cu Chulainn's
case is perhaps the most explicit this way: assaulted by fairy women, taking one as
a lover heals him.
Later Celtic folklore has much to say about the Zeannan sith, or fairy
weet the art.'^^ The fairy mate often comes bringing gifts of poetic and musical
inspiration, even actual instruments. For example, tradition says that a fairy
sweetheart gave the black chanter of Clan Chattan to a famous Macpherson
piper. 124
Experiencing union with the sacred as marriage-whether that sacred is
perceived as a spirit or a deity or God Itself is to join with the sacred in one of the
most intimate and emotional ways possible. As I noted earlier, the experience of
spirit-marriage in pantheistic and monotheistic cultures may differ amongst
individuals, but may feel equally profound in either context.
A pagan shaman married to a spirit he believes to be his personal
manifestation of the goddess may have as awesome an experience as a Christian
nun who feels herself married to Christ. Later mystics, like St. Gertrude the Great,
of Helfta, speak of their marriage to Christ as being the most perfect and
transformative union; a union in which the person is fully united with the sacred to
which he or she aspires.125
Mystics often describe the unio mystica in marital or sexual terms.
Underhill says that it was natural that "the imagery of human love and marriage
should have seemed to the mystic the best of all images of his own 'hlfilment of
life'; his soul's surrender, first to the call, finally to the embrace of Perfect
~ o v e . T~he~re'fo~re~, the spirit-mate often features in both the initiation and
consummation of the mystic or shamanic call.

89
It is important to note that these stories have various other paralells in Irish
literature, where the theme of a person becoming wild and crazed occurs with some
tkequency. 0 Riain sees geZtacht as an intermediate stage in a kind of intitiatory
process.’” This process begins with a curse, sometimes tkom a priest or saint, a
battle trauma, the loss of a lover or consuming contaminated food. Geltacht is the
intermediate stage, where the afflicted person perches in trees. flies, hallucinates, is
hairy, feathered, naked or in rags. Finally, restoration occurs through the
intervention of a religious figure, consuming blessed food or drink, or having
sex. 128
Healing is a crucial stage-the healing we see in the three tales above is the
most important way to distinguish the shaman fiom the simple sufferer. An Inuit
does not become a shaman because he is epileptic, but because he can control his
epilepsy.129
THETRANSMISSIOOFNGIFTS
Each of the protagonists of these tales clearly went through a psycho
spiritual crisis bearing strong resemblance to shamanic initiatory illness. or
“spiritual emergency” as Grof has termed it in modern, non-shamanic contexts. In a
narrative sense. they each fit the pattern of shamanic initiatory illness very well as a
whole and perfectly in some respects, as the diagrams to follow will show.
One question to be addressed, however, is to what extent these characters
acted shamanically after their crisis? Do they fulfil1 a shamanistic role in these or
other narratives about them, acting as intermediaries between this world and the
other in some way in transmitting giRs to their community?
Mis “surpassed the lovely, many-talented women of Munster during her
time.” ( 7 go ruibh air mhnaibh aille ilbhe‘usacha na Mzimhan le U She
certainly fulfilled the criteria of recovery from “temporary psychotic disorders”
mentioned earlier, that is, she got well and then she got better than she ever w a d 3 ’
127 0Riain.1972,pp. 180,204-206 128 0 Riain.1972, pp. 182-184 129 Elide. 1964,p.29 130 0Cuiv, 1952-1954.p. 332,lines 143-144.author’s translation 131 Menninger cited in Silverman. 1967.p. 63



90
As discussed earlier, these kinds of disorders can be seen as analogues to
spiritual crisis in general and shamanic initiatory illness in particular. However,
there is a problem with identifying Mis as a shaman rather than a recovered
sufferer. While an eminent and gifted figure in the community would benefit it, we
have to look hard for evidence of shamanistic service to the community.
There are two points, both of which will be detailed in later chapters. First,
Mac Cana has suggested that she was a queen figure. If true, she would clearly
have been of service-particularly in a shamanistic sense. As I will argue in
chapter five, I believe that these Irish queen figures may well have been not just
symbolic of the goddess, as Mac Cana and others have asserted, but might actually
have been shamanic oracles for the goddess. An oracle serves in part by simply
existing as a bridge between the worlds, a living axis mundi.
Second, as I discuss in chapter six, the potential shaman’s illness itseZfis
seen as one of their most important services to their communities in some cultures
like the Kwakiutl. Symbolising creation’s emergence fiom chaos, the shaman‘s
illness and recovery acts as a guarantee that the process still works. The worse off
the candidate is, the greater the guarantee.
In this way, Mis’s illness would have been a service in and of itself. As
noted earlier, the fact that the king does not seek her death despite her behaviour
stresses that her community must see her as important. This implies that she
ultimately serves her community in either her being or her actions.
Cu Chulainn performs a very clear service in the story, though scholars
have generally felt it was an awkward interp01ation.l~D~ruids conduct a tarbfeis to
see who the next king should be. The ritual reveals that he is a young man with
“two red bands around him” by the sickbed of a man in Emain Macha. It is Lugaid
Reoderg, Cu Chulainn’s foster-son. Cu Chulainn instructs Lugaid on sovereignty in
the text that follows, the Briatharthecosc Con Culainn.
It has been suggested that Cu Chulainn is acting, in this case, in an oracular
role, possessed by his father, the God Lugh.’j3I shall return to this point in chapter
five. Whether or not this is the case, and whether or not the Briatharthecosc is an
132 Carey. 1999, p. 8. Carey. 1994, p. 133 Carey, 1999, p. I96



91
interpolation, it is interesting that the scribe felt that this was an appropriate place
to put Cu Chulainn's instructions to his fGster-son on sovereignty.
The idea that sovereignty must have supernatural support in one way or
another is well attested in Irish and Welsh literature. One example is Pwyll's
exchange of rule with Arawn, king of the Otherworld, in the Muhinogion. It is
therefore significant that Cu Chulainn gives instructions in sovereignty at the
height of his sickness, as opposed to, say, at a feast, or on any other occasion.'34
When we look at this incident through a shamanic lens, it becomes clear
that it is far fiom an awkward digression. It is highly appropriate that Cu Chulainn
give this kind of instruction when he is in the deep contact with the Otherworld that
initiatory illness brings.
Instructing Lugaid is only one of many examples of Cu Chulainn serving
his community in the tales about him. He uses supernatural power as a warrior
shaman would. Cu Chulainn's father, the God Lugh, fights for him on behalf of
Ulster while he rests.13' This shows that he has a supernatural ally, as shamans do,
and possibly acts as oracle to that supernatural ally.'36He defeats the Morrigan, and
only he can heal her, thus showing he has healing powers as well.'37In short, we
see Cu Chulainn transmitting spiritual gifts both within this story and throughout
his career.
Oengus transmits spiritual gifts in the most obvious and narratively tidy
way at the end of the story itself. Besides his change of title, he and his mate
become swans, an animal with strong supernatural associations.13*He and Caer
sing so that all around his home go into trance, thus transmitting their experience of
the Otherworld to the community.139

OENGUASND THE BURMESESHAMAN
I BURMESSEHAMAN
The person seeing the spirit in Burma may be of any social class, but strongly tend to be lower class. They also tend to be women. He or she sees an attractive spirit in dreams. The spirit may become the lover of the person they appear to, or may wait until a formal marriage ceremony is performed. j2 People loved by nats typically fall ill until thev marrv the nat. Some people have difficulty eating or drinking when they are in the illness stage of the relationshir, with the nat.‘j3 Catatonic states are not mentioned in relation to Burmese shamans, but are mentioned in relation to shamans in other cultures like the Siberian. In most instances, a shaman identifies which nat is in love with the person and performs a ceremony to formalise the person’s acceptance of the nat ’s proposal and minimise the amount they are “disturbed” bv the nat.
1 The ceremony to rnarry the nat is large and expensive, involving many. However, the community perception of spirit marriage and shamans in general is not high, due to the fact that shamans dance wildly in public, have intercourse with their nats, and are thought to be
1 promiscuous.
OENGUS
He is of an elevated social status.
He sees an attractive spirit woman in dreams. She will not have intercourse with him.
Oengus falls ill because of his love for the sr>irit. His illness includes being unable to eat.
His illness includes being in a catatonic state.
He is initially helped by a person with supernatural powers (Fergne) to take the first steps in resolving his crisis.
A number of people assist Oengus in attaining union with Caer.

There is a formal quality to Oengus‘ union with Caer, where he calls to her, and formally promises that she may return to the water, etc. Oengus and Caer together return to Oengus’ home and put all into trance with their song, thus transmitting the gift of their union to others.

Cu CHULAINANND THE SIBERIASNHAMAN
SIBERIAN SHAMAN
Amongst the Buryat, shamanism often has a hereditary component.”* There is no clear association of this sort of event to shamanic vocation in Siberia. Beatings and dismemberment by spirits is a common feature of Siberian shamanism. s9 Buryatshamans are in a catatonic state as spirits in the Otherworld are torturing them. 160 Otherworld wives form an important, but not essential role to Siberian initiation. Buryat shamans are selected by the spirits but must also be taught by senior shamans.16’ Samoyed shamans may have elaborate Otherworld adventures and battles on the way to becoming a fully initiated shaman!* These may or may not include acquiring a spirit wife, although this is common. The human spouse may be jealous of the spirit, as the shaman sometimes considers that his human wife “is not fit to pour water” on her hands.163 Nothing similar is typical in Siberia.
The shaman utilises his power for the community.
Cu CHULAINN He is of an elevated social status.
He has a blow to his sense of selfworth,
He is severely beaten by two spirit women.
The beating puts him in a catatonic state.
He is told that this experience is due to an Otherworld woman being in love with him. He is advised by Conchobar to return to the place he was beaten.
He goes through various adventures and does battle to win Fand.
Emer is jealous of Fand.
Fand departs, and after drinking a brew of forgetfulness, Cu Chulainn forgets all about her. Cu Chulainn teaches his foster-son principles of sovereignty in this text. He acts for his community in numerous ways in other stories.

CONCLUSIONS
I feel that there is a strong case for viewing the tales above as examples of
shamanic initiatory illness and spirit-marriage. This is, of course, in addition to any
other themes that may be present.
Additonally, Oengus hlfills a shamanic fimction to his community in the
Aislinge. Mis may or may not have a clear shamanistic role. depending on whether
or not she was a queen figure of the type Mac Cana suggests. Cu Chulainn. as I
shall detail in later chapters, is perhaps the perfect shamanic figure of Irish
literature, doing such things as chanting spells before going into combat,
possessing magical objects, and using spiritual power to heal. kill and possibly,
become possessed by a deity or spirit.
The relationship between the shaman and their community has puzzled
some anthropologists. As noted earlier, some anthropologists see the shaman as a
“cultural1y supported schizophrenic. The question is, why would a culture
support a schizophrenic in the elaborate ways that they support their shamans?
7- 164
SOMEPOSSIBLREEASONSCIJLTURSEUSPPOR“TSCHIZOPHRENIA”
We have seen, above, that some psychologists class shamans as
schizophrenics, however, shamans’ use to their communities clearly distinguish
them from those suffering psychosis or schizophrenia as these illnesses are
clinically defined and experienced in modern western culture. The story in modern
times is of course, far fkom straight forward-in ancient times it may have been
even less so.
A few researchers, like Jaynes, feel that humanity, as a whole was
schizophrenic until a few thousand years ago, in that humans regularly experienced
visual and auditory hallucinations, often interpreted as divine transmissions.16’
However, some studies speculate that the biochemical and genetic changes
that could have, in part, created schizophrenia, may also be responsible for making
humanity into what it is today. In fact, the qualities schizophrenics and their
families seem to possess may mean that they acted as forerunners, showing the way
I 6 4 Silverman. 1967, p. 29 165 See Jaynes. 1976



99
in art, religion, and creative thought.166
In Iceland, one study carried out by Karlsson focussed on families in which
schizophrenia occurred. Iceland is an especially good place for such a study
because the relatively isolated population has kept excellent records. He could trace
both the "insane" and creative over a span of centuries.
Horrobin notes that the thing which stands out most clearly in this study is
that the families "where one or more members were schizophrenic were also the
families in which almost all other psychiatric disorders were found. However, these
families were also the ones that contained many of the high achieving Icelanders.
Madness, badness, creativity and leadership all seemed to go together in the same
fami1y trees.,3167
Biochemical and genetic factors appear to play a strong role in both
creativity and "madness." This understanding may "help to provide a more positive
perspective to what most people now see in almost wholly negative terms as the
problem of schizophrenia. Scientists have increasingly noted the "mixed bag"
,3168
of potentially positive and negative qualities schizophrenia and bi-polar disorders
present. 1 6 9
An interesting point in relation to the Celtic sources is that, as the diagrams
above show, shamanic, leadership and artistic abilities are held to run in families
that have schizophrenic or shamanic figures in them. The tales also stress that these
individuals have profoundly useh1 gifts.
TKEPERENNIAWLISDOM
The content of shamans' visionary experience is generally relevant to the
human condition and often profound. For example, one shaman Rasmussen
interviewed, Najagneq, received a message fiom the spirit called Sila, the upholder
of the universe.
The inhabitant or soul of the universe is never seen, its voice alone is
heard. All we know is that it has a gentle voice, like a woman, a voice so fine and

gentle that even a child cannot be afraid. And this i s what it says, Sila
ersinarsinivdluge,‘Be not afraid of the universe.’’70
This statement does not seem to stem fi-om the “fear marked puzzlement”
Silverman refers to as the state of the schizophrenic, rather, its opposite, a wisdom
that corresponds to much of the perennial philosophy.”’ It also contains a sense of
peace that some mystics. such as Suso, St. Catherine of Sienna, and St. John of the
Cross, describe attaining after the dark night of the This peace is very
different from the schizophrenic or psychotic who remains trapped by his own
unmastered psychological energies.
As always, we must use the applicability of visionary experience to the life
of the visionary, and to his community, to judge whether disease, intoxication
alone, or spiritual inspiration is at work.
The Irish Zilerati themselves express the need to draw such distinctions. One
wrote that Suibhne Geilt was not important because of the tale of his madness. but
because of “the stories and poems he left in Ireland after him.. .” that is, the product
of his experience.173
GUIDANCE
Producing a usable product from shamanic experience is not a
straightforward affair, and depends in part on the social and cultural context in
which the potential shaman finds himself.
The Ulaid’s support for Cu Chulainn and his experience is in marked
contrast to the way mystic experience is devalued and often pathologised by
modern western culture.
Joseph Campbell describes the difference between a purely psychotic or
drug induced experience and mystical experience this way, “The plunges are all
into the same deep inward sea: of that there can be no doubt. The symbolic figures
encountered are in many instances identical...But there is an important difference.

can swim and one who cannot.** The mystic swims in the same waters the
schizophrenic drowns in.’74The mystic also has the power to return to the shore.
Of course, most mystics and shamans in traditional cultures receive expert
guidance on where the shore is and how to get back. Perhaps the most essential
difference between the shaman and the schizophrenic is training.

Shamanism demands control. However inflamed by Spirit a shaman is, he
must sing straight and true from the heart of that frre, channelling the power of the
experience to his community. Shamans typically demonstrate exquisite control of
their state of consciousness, movements in deep trance, drumming, singing and
ritual behaviours, one reason Eliade called them technicians of ecstasy.2
Control comes only with training. In the poem above, a metaphorical
genealogy to establish Nede’s authority as a poet, he invokes a variety of skills
both intellectual and spiritual. The poem calls wisdom ‘son‘ of the gods ofpoetry,
implying that it is ultimately sourced in the Sacred. However, the poem describes
many stages of skilled work between that original source and its manifestation in
poetry and in “poetry’s son,” Nede.
Skilled work is also required of the shaman, if he is to harness the power of
his initial violent contact with the Otherworld. After the shaman’s unsought
initiatory experience, he must learn to contact the spirits at will.
It has been said that a man with an uncontrolled mind is like a man on a

mad horse-and a shaman‘s horse is madder than most. I once heard a Lakota
shaman advising a novice who had hysterics when she felt power, saying, “Honey,
you gotta learn to ride that horse better.”
In most cultures, initiated shamans train the novice. Whether or not we are
positive that Fergne and Dubh Ruis are initiated shamans, they certainly acted as
guides to Oengus and Mis as initiated shamans would in a shamanic culture. Fergne
in particular demonstrates clear knowledge of things he apparently has no physical
way of knowing. For example, he knows the cause of Oengus’s distress without
being told and the story also tells us that he can tell what ails people in a house by
the chimney-smoke. Clearly. Fergne has some kind of supernatural power.
Dubh Ruis’s abilities are less overtly occult, but he does survive and benefit
from his encounter with Mis-something scores of her victims failed to do. This. as
noted in the last chapter. would imply some sort of power or skill. He also tamed
her in part through music, and magical or quasi-magical powers are often attributed
to music in Celtic t r a d i t i ~ n . ~
These expert advisors are almost indispensable to the novice shaman. I say
almost because. theoretically, the shaman can get all the information they need
directly from the spirits.
In the Celtic context, it is evident that some shamanic training comes from
the Otherworld as well. For example, the Druid Mog Roith is said to have trained
for seven centuries with the Druidess Ban Buannan in Sid Cairn Breactanan.‘
While much training can come fiom the Otherworld. there is no need for
each shaman to reinvent the wheel. Shamans approach spirit within their culture’s
cosmologica1 matrix.
Senior shamans pass on a huge body of traditional lore and techniques,
including information on cosmology, what spirits or deities to approach for
particular problems or questions and techniques of healing, spiritual combat and
spirit travel.
I will further explore the evidence for specific shamanic skills and a
shamanistic cosmology in chapters three and six. Here. I focus on methods of

invoking alternate states of consciousness, making the spirit Journey in those states,
and evidence for other kinds of training.
THE NATUREOF SHAlllANIC TRAINING
There is no pure "ur-shamanism," wholly based on an individual shaman's
revelation^.^ All shamanic traditions have cosmologies, codes of behaviour. and so
on. As I said in my introduction, there is a continuum between shamans, focussed
more on direct revelation and priests, focussed more on hlfilling social and
religious hnctions! The hrther we go along the continuum from shaman to priest,
the more codified training generally becomes.
Pagan Celtic tradition, as reflected in classical sources, archaeology and
possible survivals in the literature was apparently somewhere along this continuum,
but it is hard to say how far. We hear of plenty of direct shamanistic experience of
the Sacred, and we have information that Druidic training took twenty-one years.
Warrior training appears to include shamanic components, a point to which I will
return in the next chapter since it relates to the shamanic warrior hnction.
Unfortunately, we do not have a lot of information about Druidic training. For
more detail on shamanistic training in Celtic culture, we need to look to those who
inherited some of the Druids role, the-filid.
POETIC TRAININGAS SHAMANIC TRAINING
The relationship between shamanism and poetry, particularly epic poetry, is
well known and I will discuss it firther in the next chapter.' Bards and filid such as
Taliesin, Ferchertne, Nede, Finn and Amergin, continually stress their skill. To
emphasise mastery means that there is something to be mastered. Everyone could
not do what they did. They certainly claimed mastery of the poetic metres and art
as a part of their power.
For example, in the Immacallam in da Thuarad or Colloquy of the Two
Sages, Nede and Ferchertne claim what seem to be concrete poetic skills, such as

making “polished tales, the delight of kings.. .arranging words in ranks, celebrating
art.. .structure of mind, art of small poems, clear arrangement of words.. ..?
Ferchertne speaks of possessing, “fury of inspiration,” (barand immais).
The word hurunn is equated withferg, supernatural heat and power, as discussed
below.’ They say their tasks include going among the Fomoire, among streams of
knowledge and “into death’s hills, where I may find great honour.” They variously
say that they come from the elf-mound of Nechtan’s wife, the nine hazels of poetic
wisdom and the land “where there is no falsehood.” This last is the way Manannan
describes the Otherworld to Cormac.’ In short, their mastery is not wholly of this
world. Terms for poetic inspiration such as the Old Irish dun and imhas and the
Welsh awen, create the sense that poetry does not originate wholly in the brains of
poets but comes, at least in part, from a spiritual source.
Cormac‘s Glossary mentions three skills that poets had to learn in ancient
times. They are teinm laida, dichetal di chennuih and imhus.forosna. I will return
to these in the next chapter, because they relate to the shamanic function of
revealing. For now, I will simply state that these techniques combine skills of
extemporaneous recitation and poetic composition with shamanistic techniques of
vision. The namefili itself, as I have noted, derives fkom a root related to vision.
and could be interpreted as originally meaning “seer or diviner...and in earlier
documents generally implies occult power or knowledge.”l0 Obviously, if the $lid
say they go into the elf-mound of Nechtan’s wife, or to the hazels of wisdom that
which they see is the Otherworld.
Eliade calls the journey to the Otherworld the defining feature of
shamanism.” This journey is also where the shaman or shamanic practitioner
continues their training. Through the journey, the shaman learns directly from the
spirits. Celtic and other sources make it clear that this mode of learning is possible.
When one folklore collector asked Donald Sinclair where he got his
information from, this is how he described his response:
“Oh well,” says I, ”seeing that you ask about it 1-11tell you that. In ever!’

machaire,” says I, “there‘s knolls, but there is a machaire over there and there‘s a
big, big knoll, and they call it ‘The Fairies Knoll.’ Well, I happened to be six
months in that knoll along with the fairies. That’s where I got all my
information.’”2
Before the shaman can undertake this journey. however, he must master
alternate states of consciousness. As I noted in the introduction, I prefer the term
alternate to altered states of consciousness because I do not believe that any one
state can really be considered standard.
TRANCE
As I mentioned in the introduction, a survey of 488 cultures found that
ninety percent utilised alternate states of consciousness to facilitate people’s
personal experience of the Sacred.I3The ability to enter the alternate state of trance
is the prerequisite for any kind of shamanic work. Trance is required to journey in
the Otherworld, prophesy, oracle, heal or hex.
Mystical experiences arise fiom trance. The word mystical comes fiom the
Greek muestes, meaning someone initiated into mystic rites. It relates to words for
keeping silent, and goes back to the Indo-European root word, *mu-, which
imitates inarticulate sounds. Unsurprisingly. one quality of mystical experience is
the difficulty of expressing or studying it in concrete terms.I4 It “defies
expression,” and “no adequate report of its contents can be given in words.”15
Eliade distinguishes broadly between two kinds of alternate states of
consciousness, shamanic exstusis and Yogic or Buddhist enstusis.l6 Enstusis draws
awareness within the self, cutting off external stimuli, until the practitioner loses
awareness of self or other. Everything unites into a single, formless one. By
contrast, exstusis expands the boundaries of self to the point where all equally
appears to be one, but with many aspects. I will discuss some of this idea’s
implications in chapter six.

108
Exstasis means “out of state.” The shaman goes out of his day to day state
of consciousness. He connects with spirits and deities invisible to his physical
sight.
THEEXPERIENOCFETHE SELF IN TRANCE
In a way, trance is distinguished more by what it is not than what it is. Freed
fiom physicality, emotions or history the shaman can clearly receive spirits‘
messages. The experience of the self freed of psychological limitations is what
many mystics have considered the true self.
Trance is therefore a state that puts the practitioner in contact not only with
the Otherworld, but also with the most fiee and sacred parts of his essential nature.
In 1992 a scholar studying Yogis said that he was “convinced that yogis use
meditation...to psychologically escape problems in life, as well as emotional
distress and anxiety present in their primary personality...They thus escape from
the suffering of their ordinary live^."'^ Trance has this healing and pain relieving
effect in part because it draws the practitioner’s attention away from sensation,
psychology and history.
This is exactly how the state of s u m seems to function in the stories-as a
healing state of alternate consciousness that transcends emotional polarities.
TRANCES,LEEP AND DREAM
The story goes that long ago, the Goddess Boann, deity of the river Boyne.
gave birth to three sons. Boann’s name contains elements that relate to cows and to
whiteness, so possibly means something like “She of the White Cows.” She seems
to represent the Mother Goddess in a benevolent, nurturing form. Her sons were
named Gentraige. Goltraige and Stiantraige, the same names as the “three strains”
of music a skilled harper had to be able to play, giving one the sense that all three
strains were seen as emanating kom the divine.18
The word sum is most often translated as ”sleep.” While it can be used this
17 Castillo. 1991,p. 4. Price-Williams and Hughes, 1994, p. 5 18 Emily Lyle has explored some ofthe other cosmologiical implications of this. discussing the way that these three may symbolise all of time, each associated with one of the three ancient Indo-European divisions of the year into spring. summer and winter.

109
way, cotlud or con-tuili are more generally used for normal sleep, although there
are a couple of occasions, referred to below, where the sleep described by these
words may be of a more supernatural character.” By contrast I believe that szian’s
associations s i g n i t~hat its meaning is closer to “trance” than sleep in most cases.2o
The fxst and most crucially important point to note in relation to this
argument is that many cultures blur the linguistic and cognitive lines between
normal physical sleep, divinely inspired trance, and even death. Even in a modem
English context, a tombstone may say “she went to sleep in Jesus.”
In Hebrew the word rdm may be interpreted as a deep sleep, a sleep sent by
God that is not of a visionary character, a “revelatory sleep” in which dreams are
sent by God, or finally it may be a trance state in which visions can occur while the
individual is fully awake.2’
Because words for sleep and dream often overlap in meaning with words
for trance, one has to look at the context and content of the experience as well as its
effect to discover which state is probably meant. For example, does a person go
into a state of sum (or cotlud or con-tuili) in a context that is likely to induce-r
at least allow-sleep? Does the person emerge from the state simply refieshed, as
one would from sleep, or are there other effects? Crucially, does the person learn
something they have no physical means of knowing while in this state, indicating
that the information has a supernatural origin? What compounds are created with
these words? Are the connotations of the compounds supernatural or more about
rest? I will look at all these points below.
DREAMINCUBATION
In addition to the difficulty we may have in distinguishing sleep states from
trance states in the literature. dreams and “waking dreams’’ present another layer of
complexity. Again in English, we may say to someone, “you’re dreaming,’’
meaning that they are imagining something, usually overly optimistically, while
fully awake.

While some dreams are obviously nonsensical rehashes of the day‘s events
and anxieties, most people are aware that they sometimes have what Jung called a
“big dream,” one that offers some sort of deeper insight into their life situations2*
Many cultures practice dream incubation to cultivate this kind of dream,
which they interpret as receiving messages from the spirits. For example, the
Siberian Vasyugan seek dream visions, and foretell the hture based on dream.23I n
the Celtic context, the layout of a Romano-British temple site at Lydney,
Gloucestershire has suggested that it may have incorporated dream incubation
chambers like those found at the Asklepion at Epidaurus.” In later stories, like the
Welsh Dream ofRhonahwy. the hero has a revelatory dream experience, in that
case, of A r t h ~ r . ~ ~
While all dreams are not “big dreams” or shamanistic dreams, the quality
and content of many dreams in Celtic literature seem to have shamanistic features.
First, the dream may be experienced as “real” in some way. The dream may also
reveal information that the dreamer had know physical way of knowing. For
example, when Oengus sees Caer, either in a dream or waking vision, he does not
know that she actually exists. However, he and others act on the premise that the
girl in the vision is real-a shamanistic way of viewing a vision.
Trance is a state of spiritual awareness in which the shaman can reach
beyond human limitations, even to the point of transcending severe physical or
emotional pain. Many examples can be given. One is the Hindu Thaipusam festival
in Malaysia. There, devotees enter trance and conduct extreme ascetic practices.
Some wear huge steel ‘armatures’ fixed into their flesh, others hang objects from
their skin with hooks-all with little or no apparent pain or bleeding.2h Lab
experiments on yogis and other subjects have provided more controlled studies of
this trance a b i l i t ~ . ’P~eople’s ability to transcend pain in trance makes the trinity of
joy, sorrow and trance in the literature particularly interesting.
One example of sziantraige relieving pain every bit as extreme as that of the

devotees at Thaipusam occurs in the Accalam na Senorach. Bodb Derg, king of the
k e s Side of Munster, gives a talented musician to king Lugaid‘s three sons.
“A gift from me to them,” said Bodb Derg, “a good minstrel that I have.
Fer-tuinne mac Trogain is his name, and though saws were being plied where
there were women in the sharpest pains of childbirth, and brave men that were
wounded early in the day. nevertheless would such [people] sleep to the fitfiil
melody that he makes.’’28
From the criteria discussed above, we can clearly see that this “sleep“
cannot be the ordinary state we fall into each night. Women in ‘The sharpest pains
of childbirth” with saws being plied in their proximity would not be likely and
probably not even able, to fall into a normal sleep. This passage therefore must
refer to some sort of trance state.
In the trance state the shamanic practitioner can experience joy without
clinging and loss without despair. Life’s polarities find their fulcrum in trance. Its
balancing function diminishes trauma’s impact, physically, mentally and
spiritually. I n fact, trance or spiritual awareness can be seen as a state that holds all
polarities of experience. With practice, it becomes the ground and all experiences
become transitory figures upon it, giving spiritual and psychological stability.
One indication that suan is trance is that it often has this kind of healing,
psychologically stabilising function in the stories. Where the Acallam, above,
yielded a fairly extreme example of trance’s ability to relieve physical pain.
Echtrae Cormaic gives an example of trance relieving emotional pain.
In the story, Cormac had promised to give a stranger whatever he wanted in
exchange for a magical branch capable of playing sziantraige. When the stranger
took his son and daughter as part payment, the king used suantraige to induce suan
and heal h i s court of the despair caused by the losses of his children.29While a
good sleep can certainly help matters, the degree of the court’s improvement must
indicate that more was going on.

evidence that suun has a supernatural healing function that ordinary sleep does
not-certainly not to the same degree.3o
She takes a traditional ballad she terms the Bullad ofKing Orpheus as her
starting point. It appears in various versions fiom the 16* to the 19* centuries, and
has been published by Child, Stewart and Shuldham-Sha~.I~'recognise that as a
text written in English, it might be seen as outside the purview of Celtic studies.
However, despite this, elements within the ballad clearly hearken back to older
Celtic traditions of the three strains of music, therefore I believe it has bearing on
my investigation.
Inthe 1gthcentury version of the ballad, Orpheus plays his pipes to the fairy
people and as his reward, requests the return of h i s wife and queen, the Scottish
Eurydice. He can play the traditional three strains, here described in English.
First he played the notes of noy, [griefl
Then he played the notes of joy,
And then he played the gaber reel.
That might a made a sick heart heal.32
The 16thcentury version has him play this healing music later in the story to
comfort his host (the burgess).
He begouithe to weip with this
That was the worthiest, I wis.
Than Orphus took his hairp with this
For to comfort the burgess
And sa he did into that stound,
The hairp it gaif sick ane sound.33
In this version, the king plays a harp, the instrument with which the three
strains of music are most often associated. Lyle goes on to discuss the association

113
of healing music with sleep.
...the type of music which took its name from the power to send to sleep
was also a healing music which brought relief fiom suffering by means of sleep,
as in the description of the effect of the music emitted by the three gold apples on
the fairy branch in The Adventure of Cormac Mac Airt: 'at that melody the men
of the world would sleep, and neither sorrow nor affliction would oppress the
people who hearkened to that
She goes on to argue that the three strains may be associated the "three
functions" Dumezil proposed as a model of the social order in Indo-European
cultures. These functions are first, the sacred, domain of priests and priest kings,
second, physical force, the domain of warriors, and third, prosperity/fertility, the
domain of farmers and commoner^.^^
It is impossible to precis her fascinating and complex argument here, so for
greater detail I must refer the reader to Archaic Cosmos. However, she reached the
conclusion that goltraige was best associated with the function of the farmers and
commoners, gentraige was best associated with the exuberance and vigour of the
warriors, and finally suantraige, which she terms -'the music of healing" is best
associated with the priests and priest kings and the hnction of the sacred.36
The sacred function of szian, induced through music, seems quite clear in
the Aislinge. As you will recall, when Oengus attains his full power and transforms
into a swan with Caer, they put everyone in suan for three days and nights by the
beauty of their singing (...chechnatar cocetal ciuil CO corastar inna doini i suan tri
laa ocus treora n '~idche).~T'his comes as the culmination of Oengus's epic quest
and initiatory illness, as discussed in chapter one. The singers are no ordinary
singers; therefore, one may suppose that the "sleep" is no ordinary state.
Additonally, fiom a narrative point of view, the only interpretation that
makes sense is that everyone who hears their song enters an ecstatic alternate state
of consciousness, sharing their bliss. This enables Oengus to fulfil1 the classic
34 Lyle, 1990. pp. 27-28, quoting Echtra Cormaic Maic Airt at the end from Hull. 1949. p. 877 35 Lyle. 1990. pp. 7, 33. For detail on Dumezil's structure. see Dumezil. 1958 36 Lyle. 1990. p. 33 37 Jackson. 1971. p. 97. Shaw. 1934. p. 62



114
shamanic hnction of transmitting his experience and power to his community
immediately after his initiatory crisis is completed. After all, to conclude the story
by saying "at the end of Oengus's great adventure, he and Caer sang a lullaby and
everyone had a good sleep" would be anti-climactic to say the least.
Trance inducing music is also used to exert magical control in less friendly
circumstances. In the Chth Maige Tuired, Lug, the Dagda and Ogma enter the
Fomoire camp to reclaim the Dagda's harp and harper. When the Dagda calls his
harp fiom the wall, it kills nine men on its way to his hand.
He then plays the three strains, beginning with goltraige. moving to
gentraige and finally suantraige, so that they all slept. (Sephainn suantraigi ddib
contuilset ant sluugh.)38 The three then escape the Fomoire unharmed although the
Fomoire wanted to kill them. The Fomoire have just lost nine men, they have three
of the greatest of the Tuatha De in their midst, and. quite naturally. they want to kill
them. However the suantruige renders them helpless, again in a context where
normal sleep is unlikely if not impossible.
Forhuis Droma Damhgaire gives us another example of s u m used in
warfare. At this point in the story. Mog Roith. fighting on Munster's behalf against
king Cormac, has put a spell (hreachta) on Cormac's troops so that they are
incapacitated.
This last word is used in Forhuis Droma Damhgaire in the context of the
battle between Cormac's druids and the Munster druid Mog Roith when Cormac
brings his army to Munster to fight against king Fiachra. I will discuss the clear
shamanistic elements of this battle in chapter three. In this passage, Cormac is
displeased with his druids, as they are getting the worst of it, and asks them what
they are going to do about it. I give the excerpt in Irish. then in Sjoestedt's French
translation, and finally in English.

39 Sjoestedt. 1926. pp. 36-37
rather than sum. However I think the context still makes it clear that this is a trance state.

Cormac fut alors frappe de terreur, car il pensait que quelque obstacle
retenait son armee, et qu’elle ne lui reviendrait plus jamais. Et il se prit a accuser
les druides qui etaient a son service. distant : “A quoi me servez-vous, si I’on met
a mort mes gens sans que j’en sois informe ni prevenu sans que j*ensois informe
ni prevenu sans que vous veniez a leur secours’?” “11s ne sont pas morts du tout,”
dirent ils, “mais le druide les ensorceles depuis une semaine, et nous les
ramenerons chez eux.“ 11s se recuillirent alors et rassemblerent toute leur science
et tout leur art et envoyerent un charme vers les armees, qui revinrent vers eux au
bout de la ~emaine.~’
Cormac was then stricken down with fear, because he thought that some
obstacle was holding his army back, and that it would never return to him. And he
started to accuse the druids that were in his service, saying, “What are you to me,
if my people are being put to death without my being informed about it, or
warned without your going to their help?” “They are not dead at all,’’ they said
but the druid has bewitched them for a week, and we will bring them back home.”
They prepared themselves and brought together all their science and their art and
sent a charm towards the armies, who came back to them at the end of the
week.41
Here the word suainbrect is used in the context of what I will show in
chapter three is likely a shamanic battle. It is clearly not a normal sleep, and
Sjoestedt herself translated the term not even as “place a sleep spell upon.” but as
ensorcelks, “bewitched.”
In what I believe is one of the most persuasive examples, an excerpt fiom
the Passions and Homilies from the Leabhar Breac appears to use cotlud and suan

cut out of his side in the sleep of the cross.42
Atkinson translates two different words as sleep here. Cotlud is the “sleep“
of Adam when God makes Eve fiom his rib. This is a supernatural sleep in that it is
induced by God for a supernatural purpose, however. its effect is described as a
general anaesthetic so that God can create Eve. It is God who is engaged in the
supernatural activity-Adam, and then Eve, are the objects of that activity.
Sziun is the “sleep” of Christ upon the cross. In this case, Christ is engaged
in the supernatural activity of redeeming all of humanity through the process of His
sacrifice. His resurrection fi-om the dead is imminent. This is obviously not a
normal sleep. One would be hard pressed to think of a more supernaturally charged
event.
The scribe clearly distinguishes between Adam’s cotlud and Christ’s suan.
The former is an anaesthetic sleep-induced by God, yes, but where the sleeper is
not the active party in the supernatural creative process described. Adam is “done
to,” he is not the “doer.” The latter, I would argue, is the “sleep” of trance squared.
Where a human shaman, as ”wounded healer,” enters the ‘*death“of trance
and sacrifices for his people in order to creatively utilise supernatural power on
their behalf, Christ, as “dying and resurrected God” enters the trance / actual death
of the cross and sacrifices for all people in order to creatively use supernatural
power on behalf of the entire ~ o r l d . ~Th’e scribe knows the difference and uses the
most appropriate word in each case.
42 Atkinson. 1887. Irish p. 136. tmslation pp. 384-385. (Italics mine.) 43 As I shall discuss in detail in chapter six. shamanic cultures often see trance as a kind of death, and the shaman‘s sacrificial role is central to maintaining cosmic order.

As I shall discuss in detail in chapter six, shamanic cultures often see trance
as a kind of death, and the shaman’s sacrificial role is central to maintaining cosmic
order.
I have already shown the likely shamanic nature of Cu Chulainn’s illness in
the SergZige.44The word s u m appears a number of times in relation to his trance.
For example, in the phrase, “the warrior’s torpor is great, lying in the trance of
wasting sickness” (mbr espa do laech / laigi f r i s u m ~erglige).“T~he serglige is
clearly not a normal illness, but is of supernatural origin, so the way in which the
words are paired here seems to make it clear that s u m is not a normal sleep. The
word’s meaning is made still clearer in the phrase, “since fairy sleep had overtaken
him.” (0 ro gab suan ~ithbroga.)“~
Finally, Ralls-MacLeod states that suan is clearly supernatural in both
origin and effect.
Music is often said to cause the listener(s) to ‘fall asleep,’ that is to enter
an altered state of consciousness, often for a period of days. The literature of
early medieval Ireland includes numerous references to the power of music to put
the listener into a trance-like sleep state, which is portrayed as a supernatural
effect. There is a distinct impression that the listener cannot help himself, in spite
of his efforts to remain in a state of normal, waking C O ~ S C ~ O U S ~ ~ S S . ~ ~
One example she uses is the Aislinge. She makes the point that when Caer
first appears to Oengus, she plays to him on a timpan until “he falls asleep.”
Far fiom this being a simple lullaby or merely a relaxing tune...Oengus
later becomes obsessively ‘haunted’ by this dream. It keeps repeating itself, with
its powerful musical effects, again putting him in a trance-like sleep state.48
This music, along with Caer’s presence, is what begins Oengus’s intiatory
illness. Like the sound of the voice that presages the violent alternate state of
consciousness that is initiatory illness for Tuvan shamans, suantruige can emanate

from the Othenvorld, and be the medium through which communication with the
Otherworld can occur in the trance state of ~ z i a n . ~ ~
OTHERTERMS
While s u m seems to be the primary term for a general trance state, many of
the other trance terms relate to specific shamanistic hnctions, and so shall appear
in the next chapter. For example, in the last chapter, we encountered the termferg
to describe Cu Chulainn warrior’s ardour. Since this relates to the shamanistic
warrior fimction of killing, I will discuss it fiuther there, along with terms such as
riastrad.
In the last chapter, I discussed Oengus’ socht as a catatonic state, imposed
fkom outside the self, in Oengus’ case as part of a spiritual proce~s.~S’uibhne and
Mis are both geilt, a state bound up in the tales with spiritual and creative gifts such
as the ability to fly.”
A i is a state of inspiration.” Aislinge, seems to refer to the vision itself,
rather than the state in which it is at~ained.’P~erhaps these two words relate.
Though I do not want to go too far in the direction of the sometimes-fanciful
etymologies of people like Cormac. it is tempting to see aislinge as a compound.
Perhaps it could mean something like an inspired “leap” (lingid), with spirit
journey connotation^.^^
Both Oengus and Cu Chulainn suffer fkom serc-love, an alternate state of
consciousness most people experience. However the way the word is used, from
Oengus’ sercc e‘cmaise, literally, the “love of an absent one,” to Cu Chulainn’s
sergZige, love sickness or wasting sickness, seems to indicate this may not be
ordinary love, but spiritual longing? Longing is bound up with at least one
spiritual term in Old Irish. Dzithracht means both devotional practices and
longing? To make prayers is to enact one‘s longing for the sacred.

Awen is spiritual inspiration, and seems to be the dominant Welsh word
associated with trance practices. This is made clear in many sources, particularly in
Giraldus Cambrensis’ account of the twelfth century Awenyddion, discussed in
chapter six?’ Through their awen they speak in an ecstatic state, probably as
oracles for spirits. according to Cambrensis.
MODESOF ATTAININGALTERNATSETATES
Trance is to some extent a physical phenomenon. Increasing research
attention is being given to its physical causes and effects. For example. research on
brain wave activity in Yogis experiencing sarnudhi showed increased amplitude of
alpha waves.58 Similar results were observed in studies of Zen meditators, with
additional rhythmic beta waves. Transcendental meditators showed theta periods
and some beta waves in advanced subjects. From all this we can see that while
alternate states can produce physiological changes, they do not all produce the
same changes, and therefore will not all result in the exact same sort of state, as
mentioned above.
It is well known that vigorous physical activity promotes endorphin release,
creating an euphoric, anaesthetised state. Shamanic rites often feature vigorous
dance, drumming and the like, so there is no reason why they should not provoke
the same sort of release.59 Because of all the indications that trance produces
chemical changes in the brain, an obvious approach to entering trance is through
chemistry.
CONSCIOUSNEASSLTERINSGUBSTANCES
The most obvious and indisputable consciousness altering substance the
Celts made use of is alcohol. The lavish nature of feasting and drinking goods in
burials like that of the Vix princess from around 450 BC, show the importance
Celts placed on intoxicating beverages. The krater found in the Vix burial is the
fmest surviving example of classical Greek metalwork anywhere. including

Greece.
Arnold believes that the symbolic meaning of alcohol in Iron Age Europe
can be partly reconstructed. Many cultures view alcoholic drinks as a way of
communing with the Otherworld. Various shamanic cultures like the Siberian use
alcohol sharnanistically.hoIncluding alcoholic drinks in chieftain’s burials may
imply the leader’s right to rule in Otherworld.
She goes on to say that the “symbolic value of alcohol over food is
underlined by the fact that while alcohol was interred in the Hochdorf grave, no
traces of meat or other food were recovered.”“ Edible grave goods are not simply
symbols of abundance, or adequate nourishment. In Hochdorf, they are
consumables that alter consciousness. Burials such as Hochdorf demonstrate the
belief in an afterlife, where the person will live again. The substance that vivifies is
that which affords the person access to alternate states of consciousness and so, the
Otherworld. That which vivifies in life is thought to do so in death.
In later literature, the right to rule is bound up with the distribution of
alcoholic beverages, such as the well known dergjlaith, red ale or red sovereignty.
Baile in Scail and Baile Chuinn Che‘tchathach both feature this theme!’ Drinking
equipment forms part of the king‘s, chiefs, or, most prominently, queen’s authority
granting paraphernalia, implying that part of their authority derives fiom
consciousness altering a b i l i t i e ~ . ~ ~
Of course, distributing rich goods of any kind including food or adornment
or livestock to followers would support the ruler’s authority. Additionally, the
alternate state alcohol induces does not automatically. or even frequently, lead to an
“illuminating” effect. Other drugs are more persistently associated with consistent
experiences of a religious or spiritual nature.
ENTHEOGENS
Various plants such as mushrooms, peyote, vines, herbs and seeds, have a
long history of shamanic use. Terrence McKenna termed them “entheogens”

121
because they can be used to cultivate a personal experience of the Sacred.h4The
nature of the experience, however, is determined not just by the substance, but also
by the setting.
Eliade argued that the use of psychotropics implied degeneration in
shamanic practice!’ Michael Harner leans in this direction, theorising that the use
of psychotropic “flying ointments” among European witches originated in the time
of persecution, when drums would have attracted the authorities? Of course. the
fact that these ointments were applied to a person’s naked body, and their potent
effects might leave them lying about in a stupor for a couple of days, did nothing
for the reputation of witchcraft!’
I am well aware that many modern discussions of witchcraft place it as a
purely socio-political issue, largely based around the persecution of women and
without any basis in the beliefs of the women thus persecuted. A full discussuion of
the arguments on either side is outside the scope of this work, but, as I will discuss
in chapter five, I think there is good reason to believe that some witchcraft accounts
reflect genuine continuities of shamanic practice.68
The fact that the hallucinogenic mushroom, amanita muscaria, plays a
central role in Siberian shamanic practice, cosmology and mythology stands
against the view that use of entheogens marks a decay in shamanic practice. For
example, the Vasyugan, a Siberian tribe, class amanita along with the drum and
zither as the ‘great’ material means, “by which the Ugrian magician attempts to
communicate with the spirits.”6’ The word shaman originates with the Tungus, and
Siberian shamans are often used as the “type” of the shaman against which all
others are compared. Since they use entheogens, I do not think that the argument
that their use represents decay in shamanic practice can wholly be sustained.
Is there a possibility that the Celts used entheogens? We know that one
group of people they came into contact with, the Scythians, were aware of the
consciousness altering properties of cannabis. Herodotus says that the Scythians

used cannabis, throwing the seeds on hot stones, inhaling the smoke, and falling
about roaring with delight a f i e ~ w a r d s .T~he~re is, however, no reference to its use
by the Celts in the later stories.
Maelduin’s tale gives us another example of intoxication after drinking, but
what he is drinking is a bit mysterious. This mysterious substance gives us another
possible candidate for an entheogen used by the Celts.
AMANITMAUSCARIA
The possible evidence for amanita use amongst Celtic peoples can be
interpreted in may ways. It is purely circumstantial evidence, therefore any
conclusions based upon it can only be highly speculative. It is certainly intriguing,
however, so I include it in the interest of completeness, because I think amanita use
is certainly conceivable, if not probable, amongst Celtic peoples. This strand of
possible shamanistic activity would also be of interest for future research, so it
seemed appropriate to relate some of what has been discovered in the materials.
even if firm conclusions cannot be drawn at this stage of investigation.
Returning to the tale of Maelduin, he and his companions find “magical
berries” the size of apples, but with a thick rind, growing on a tree on one island.
Maelduin presses the juice fi-om them and drinks it. He then foams at the mouth
and lies in a deathly sleep for a full day. Upon awakening, he says that the h i t is
excellent, and that his companions should gather all that they can7*
Compare this description to the process of preparing amanita muscaria, the
red and white hallucinogenic mushroom and its subsequent effects. It is best
prepared by drying it and then mixing it with water and pounding it into a
beverage. Upon taking it nausea, salivating and sometimes foaming at the mouth
and vomiting can ensue. The pulse slows, and the person falls into a deep sleep,
“dead to the outside world.” During this sleep, the person may experience intense
dreams, and upon waking, they become stimulated, voluble and el~quent.’~
A Polish soldier described an amanita experience reminiscent of some
70 Rice. 1957. p. 90 7 1 Oskamp. 1970. pp. 158-16 1. Laurie and White. 1997. p. 56 72 Wasson, 1968, pp. 75.58,262



123
Celtic Otherworld tales. Like Maelduin, he fell into a twenty-four hour sleep. and
saw a beautiful realm, with women dressed in white who offered him great
hospitality.73
Another text yields a possible symptom of amanita in a visionary context.
Amergin describes being the god who forms a head or mind of fire in his often
quoted poem, where he proclaims his unity with all beings.74 One symptom of
amanita intoxication is a strong sense of heat in the head. The face “becomes red
and bloated, and h l l of blood, and the intoxicated person begins to do and say
many things in~oluntarily.”~~
There is a great deal more evidence in Celtic literature implying the use of
amanita. I do not have the space to cite all of it here.76I will begin with possible
earlier Indo-European use.
Wasson identifies amanita with the Vedic soma, and the haoma of the
Zoroastrian Avesta. He makes a persuasive argument, and if he is correct it has
been used by Indo-Iranian and Indo-European peoples for thousands of years.
The relationship between amanitahoma and poetic inspiration is well noted.
One Vedic poet calls soma the “tongue of the way,” and says it is the source of
eloquence. The ritual of imbmforosnai, which I will discuss in detail in the next
chapter, provides an interesting comparison with techniques involving amanita.
In this ritual, according to Cormac’s glossary, thefzli chews a piece of raw
flesh fiom a pig, dog or cat, then offers it to his spirits, placing it behind the door.
He invokes his spirits, and if they do not give him the answer immediately, he lies
down, places his palms over his cheeks, and others watch to be sure he is not
disturbed. He then receives the information he seeks.77
I think it is likely that placing his palms over his cheeks is simply covering
his eyes, since removing sight of the physical greatly helps visualisation. As I will
discuss below, darkness is often a feature of Celtic vision seeking. The way in
which chewing “red meat” is here combined with a period of lying in darkness and

124
revelatory experience. however, may suggest amanita.
Compare the way some Siberians believe amanita will reveal the hture ..if,
before eating the mushroom, the man recites over it certain definite formulas
stating his wish to see the future, the wish will come true in his dream.”” The
Voguls, Ostyaks and others often practised their magic after amanita in the total
dark of a yurt where the fire was put out at night.79
Various Siberian tribes. including the Ostyak, Samoyed and Koryak,
commonly use amanita, and there’s linguistic and folklore evidence to suggest that
it was used in proto-history by the Hungarians and some Indo-Europeans.
Other evidence implying its use in Celtic culture includes the continual
association of red and white with the Otherworld and the various red consciousness
altering h i t s and nuts. In Immram Curaig Ua Corra, the travellers reach an island
with enormous red flowers dripping honey.8oThe Vedic soma may be called mdda,
“inebriation” or mudhu, “honey.”” We also find birds. who are actually the souls
of the holy, singing there. I will fhther explore the shamanistic associations of
birds in chapters four and five.
Other examples of consciousness changing foods include the hazels of
wisdom, and Otherworld apples. Even the golden apples described in some tales
might relate to amanita, because some species turn a metallic tinged gold when
dried.82
The hazels of wisdom are particularly good candidates. Red or purple in
colour, a Middle Irish gloss in the Cauldron of Poesy calls them bolcc imba
fuilngne, possibly “bubbles that support imbas.” It says that thefili gains his poetic
abilities in one way by consuming the hazelnut^.'^
BoZg can mean bag or bubble, but it can also mean a berry. bud or pod.84
Specifically, it is used of mushrooms, in words such as bolg Zosgainn, literally,
“fkog’s pouch,” for a wild mushroom, or bolg se‘idete, “blown up bag,” meaning

p~ffball.’It~can be used of a shield boss, which resembles a mushroom. Finally, it
may mean lightning, associated with amanita in many cultures.86 One word in
Scottish Gaelic, caochag can mean either a nut without a kernel or a mushr~om.’~
We could pass all this off as coincidence, because nowhere does anyone
come out and say, “I am intoxicated on mushrooms.’’ However, it is important to
note that even in cultures where one can be reasonably sure or positive about
amanita use, it is often referred to obliquely and symbolically, not directly.
TABOO AND RESTRICTEUDSAGE
This is in part due to its sanctity. It may also be because it may be used
predominantly by an elite of priests or nobility who do not want to share it with the
general population. This occurs in other shamanic cultures. For example, among
the Siberian Ket and Selkup tribes, only shamans and shamans elect were held to
be able to eat fly-agaric, all others were told they would die if they ate it.88
In a highly speculative argument, Wasson says that amanita is associated
with an organised priesthood in the Indus valley.
This priesthood may have characterised Indo-European society in its
homeland, but are we safe in assuming so? May not a shamanistic religion have
acquired an hieratic structure under the pressures of a tough war of conquest
lasting centuries? In a world of enemies the shamans may have found it in their
own interest to...organise a tribal priesthood, as a weapon of political power.”
He further theorises that the Vedas as hymnbook may have developed
around this time. Since the supply of mushroom in Himalayas and Hindu Kush was
finite, and the Indo-Aryans spread out over all of India. it would have ultimately
been insufficient. First, it would get watered down, then fall into disuse. Wasson
feels it would then have been replaced by austerities and other methods to alter
consciousness.90My feeling is that these methods would have preceded mushroom

126
use, and would never have really gone away, thought they might have receded into
the background given the easy and spectacular effects of amanita.
The combination of taboo followed by more limited use, followed by disuse
and prohibition under Christianity may be the case in the Celtic context. The
‘toadstool’ is of course fly-agaric. Wasson goes on to theorise that the ’toadstool‘
in it’s shamanic role had aroused such awe, fear and adoration that it came under a
powerful taboo.” He supports his claim with the fact that truly lethal mushrooms
are generally ignored by peasantry without any particular horror or revulsion.
Amanita, however, has a greater reputation for fatality than the truly deadly ones.”
There must be some reason.
The idea that only a shamanic elite can partake of amanitu may be reflected
in a passage in the Pursuit of Diarmuid and Grainne. It refers to the idea, present in
various legends, that the Tuatha Dd consume magical red rowanberries which give
them gifts of immortality and healing. Diarmuid says that these berries have many
virtues. Each berry is as exhilarating as wine and as satisfjing as old mead, and
whoever eats three berries. though he was a hundred, would become thirty again.92
Interestingly, a dosage of about three mushrooms produces an inebriation
comparable to wine or beer.93
A giant guards the rowan tree, and allows no mortals near, possibly a relic
of a taboo against non-shamanic usage of amanita. From a practical standpoint,
rowan trees generally grow in association with birch, and birch is a favoured host
of amanita, so the red rowanberry makes a reasonable symbolic substitute in
speech for a m m ~ i t a . ~ ~
Amanita is also actually combined with berry juice in some places. The
Siberian Koryak make a tonic of blueberries and amanita that they drink for
longevity and health.95The Siberian Kamchadals also combine amanita with berry
juice, particularly that of the bilberry, because this makes it ~tronger.’B~ilberries.
blueberries and rowanberries are all packed with anti-oxidants, though I cannot say
91 Wasson. 1968. pp. 191-192 92 Laurie and White. 1997. p. 56 93 Laurie and White. 1997 p. 57 94 Laurie and White. 1997 p. 57 95 Salzman, 1996
96 Wasson, 1968. p. 248



127
what precise effect this would have in combination with amanita.
The rowanberries in the story are guarded against “mortal” use, that is, use
by one not of the Tuatha De. As I will discuss in chapter five, I believe a strong
argument can be made that the Tuatha De‘, later the Fair Folk or Fairies, are
actually shamans, in some cases acting as oracles for deities. In Vedic suma ritual.
the priests evidently took on the roles of deities, particularly Ir~dra.~’
I came across an interesting reference that may be of relevance in
Hungarian tradition. Hungarians, like Celts, frequently offered milk to fairies. The
tdtos, or shaman, is also often considered one of the fairies him or herself, so if a
taltos comes to the door, one must immediately give the taltus milk.” It so happens
that milk is a potent detoxifier for am an it^.^^ It is easy to picture shamadfairies
taking too much amanita of an evening and staggering out of the woods to get milk
fkom whatever farm was closest. How much easier to encourage everyone to place
it outside in a basin as a general offering to the spirits?
Cow and milk symbolism in general is linked to amanita.’OOIt is impossible
to detail all the instances here, but it does call to mind the white, red-eared cows of
Celtic tales, and more broadly, the way in which white and red are so frequently
associated with the Othenvorld.
A last point of interest in relation to potential Celtic amanita references, is
the frequency with which it is linked to one-legged, one-eyed beings like the Irish
Fomoire. The Vedas speak of soma as being one-eyed and one-legged. Among the
Siberians, Vladimir Germanovich Bogoraz, writing in 1909, said Chukchee would
imitate mushroom spirits who had no legs or necks, just “stout cylindrical bodies
which move about swiftly.. .Mushrooms appear to intoxicated men in strange forms
somewhat related to their real shapes. One, for example, will be a man with one
hand and one foot; another will have a shapeless body.q.101
Of course, as noted at the start, all of this is highly speculative. The Irish
might have fantasised about fictional intoxicating berries as just one more of the
97 Wasson, 1968. pp. 55-56 98 See Domotor. 1984 99 Wasson 1968. pp. 31.282 100 Wasson. 1968. pp. 31.36-44.45-46 101 Wasson. 1968. pp. 46-47.60-67.274-276.281



128
many imaginative leaps in Irish literature. We also cannot believe that the Irish
couldn’t tell a berry fiom a mushroom, or meat fiom a mushroom, only that they
might have substituted one for the other in narrative for reasons of taboo or
secrecy. By the time the stories came to be written down the original symbolism. if
there was any, might well have been forgotten. Clearly, much more study must be
done if we are to draw any firmer conclusions fiom the tantalising possible
evidence for amanita usage in the Celtic context.
OTHERPOSSIBLEENTHEOGENS
Moving on to other possible drugs, we come to a component of the ”flying
ointments” of European witchcraft, the plant henbane. Schrijver associates a Welsh
word for the psychotropic henbane, hele, with the Celtic god Belenos, deriving his
name fiom this plant rather than the more usual translation of it as ‘*bright or
shining.” Belenos is associated with Apollo. and therefore. with healing. Henbane‘s
properties as opiate and anti-inflammatory were well known.’02 Taking it further,
he notes, in relation to Beltane, that there is a German custom of burning henbane
at midsummer to protect cattle, in much the same way as is done in the Beltane
fires.
He shows various words relating to hallucinating and fantasising that seem
to derive from the word for henbane. Finally, a poem in praise of Aed Dubh, king
bishop of Kildare, mocks anyone who tries to emulate him. “What is the use of you
competing with Aed unless you have drunk henbane?” (Cia du duit cornbag-friAed
/ munip gaffand attihis). O3
Henbane could produce an ecstatic, excited state, along with hallucinations
of flying and transforming into animals. One theory states that it was used by the
Apollo’s oracle at Delphi. Schrijvergoes on to speculate that it could be behind the
berserkir frenzy, and some of the other activities of Celtic and Germanic
Mannerbunde, or warrior bands. He notes that a tree-like image on the Gundestrup
cauldron on the panel with the figure being immersed in a vat resembles
102 Schrijver. 1999. pp. 26.35 103 Schrijver. 1999, p. 36



129
henbane.lo4This panel has already been interpreted as an initiatory rite by others,
so the involvement of henbane would provide an interesting additional element.1°’
Celtic stories provide a wealth of examples of gaining power by ingesting
substances, fiom Finn and his salmon to Taliesin gaining his awen from the drops
from Cerridwen’s cauldron. Of course, this universal idea may be symbolic,
representing receiving the sacred, and may not involve psychotropics at all. The
wine and bread of the Eucharist is a case in point.
Symbolic and ritual action can alter consciousness on its own, without the
addition of any chemical elements. All the substances discussed above work in part
by effecting brain chemistry and activity. Another approach, and most likely the
oldest shamanic approach, to producing the necessary changes in the brain is to
induce the brain to produce these changes without drugs.
SOUND
Various kinds of sound, natural and man made have always been used to
alter consciousness for shamanic work.’“ Finn’s poem to Beltane speaks of natural
music that brings peace. “Woodland music plays / melody provides perfect peace, /
dust is blown fkom dwelling place. and haze from lake full of water.-9 107
Streams are often depicted as trance inducing. Streams like the waters of
Assaroe in southwest Ireland are depicted in sources such as AcaZZam na Senorach
as likely places to hear Otherworld music.’08 In this context, the phrase sreb ‘na
man, translated in the Dictionary of the Irish Language as “the slow moving

MUSIC
One of the most common ways to induce trance is through trance inducing
music. in Old Irish, I have argued above, sziantraige.
There are many references to the sweetness and transformative powers of
Otherworld music. In fact, as Ralls-MacLeod has shown in her definitive study,
music and spiritual experience are closely bound in Celtic tradition. as they are in
all shamanic cultures.1 1 1
Texts refer to various kinds of sound being used for visionary purposes by
the Celts. In later times, Protestant ministers placed special emphasis on the
destruction of all musical instruments. This is generally thought to be solely due to
music’s association with dancing, drunkenness, pleasure and luxury, and occurred
in Protestant countries throughout Europe, not just in Celtic lands. However,
because music also has strong supernatural associations in Celtic culture in
particular, I do not believe that one can rule out its consciousness altering
properties as another reason to destroy instruments.
In the legends, the spirits give musical instruments and ability. The
instruments include the Black Chanter of Clan Chattan. and the Silver Chanter of
the MacCrimmons.* l2 Harps, magical branches, and references to drumming and
percussive sound all feature. I shall return to some of these instruments when I
speak of shamanic equipment in chapter four.
SONGAND CHANT
Song and chant consistently appear as modes of altering consciousness in
the tales. The role of the poet and singer was similar and at one time probably
overlapped with that of the shaman. J.E.C. Williams, in The Court Poet in
Medieval Ireland says “Every primitive poet was to some extent a Shaman or
magician, in other words, he claimed the ability to exercise power over things.“
The poetry was designed for magical effect, as well as the visionary trance or
ecstasy. Steven Glosecki has referred to this in his Shamanism and Anglo-Saxon
Poetry as well, and I will have more to say on this in the next chapter.

There are indications that much Old Irish and Gaelic poetry was sung or
chanted rather than simply recited. According to one source, the later prayers and
invocations of Carmina Gadelicu were either “sung to the type of music Mrs.
Kennedy Fraser published, intoned, or recited in a curiously rhythmic

informants or made it up is open to debate, however, the “rhythmic monotone” can
be a feature of shamanistic chant.

Earlier, the AZtus Prosator, attributed to St. Columba, states clearly that it
was composed in rhythm. In the body of the poem, we find “By chanting of hymns

typically has a monotonous quality, to facilitate trance rather than distract fiom it.
7 3 1 14
Giraldus Cambrensis says that Irish holy men used to carry harps and play
them frequently, due to music’s ability to arouse the spirits and promote religious
fervour. There were also specialists in chant at some monasteries, who apparently
did nothing else, underscoring its importance. l5
There are also interesting references to chant and its effects in some
hagiography. In St. Fiacc’s hymn to St. Patrick, the clerics of Ireland gather to
watch over St. Patrick as he is dying. Then, ‘The sound of singing prostrated them,
each one of them fell asleep on the road.” (son in cetaiZfo-s-rolaich, contuil cuch
ziadib for sit.)’16While con-tuili does not have the clear associations with trance
that the word s u m does, the context may indicate a trance rather than sleep state.
Shamanistic music frequently imitates animals’ sounds, to call and honour
helping spirits.l17 Many Scottish Gaelic songs imitate animal sounds, and like
shamanic music in general, may also use vocables in no known language. These
hlfil two hnctions, the rhythm aids trance, and the language is held to be “sacred
language,” the language of the spirits. In another context, In Tengu Bithnuu, “The
Evemew Tongue” features “angelic language,” that is not any known

132
POSSIBLE REFERENCETSO OVERTONE CHANT
There are various references to singing styles called sordan, dordan,
dordfhiansa and similar words associated with buzzing, humming, lowing or
murmuring.’19 This kind of singing is often depicted as supernatural in origin or
effects. For example, the Donn of Cuailgne is described making a cranndord when
he came home in the evenings to his cows. This supernatural sound was sufficient
music and entertainment for the entire cantred of Cuailgne.12*
Finn and his Fianna performed a chant called the dordfhiansa,accompanied
by the clashing of their spears. Its droning sound was said to scatter the enemy as
effectively as a physical attack.I2’While this chant is associated with the Fianna, it
is not limited to them.
Donn BO rehsed to perform on the eve of the Battle of Allen. The next day,
Maelduin, Donn BO and many others fell to the Leinstermen. The sound of the
dordfhiansu emanated fkom Donn BO‘s head on the battlefield. The Leinstermen
brought it back, put it on a post and asked it to perform. Donn BO turned towards
the wall “SO that it should be dark for hn,” and moved the Leinstermen to tears
with the dordfiiansa.’2It2 is highly significant that Donn BO required darkness for
this, associating the dordfhiansa with other shamanistic practices, in Celtic sources
and elsewhere, that require darkness.
Other than these general ideas of humming or droning sound, can we have
any idea of what these kinds of possibly shamanistic musical forms sounded like?
There is one clue.
The Fianna are described singing the dordfhiansa with pursed lips. This
calls to mind Tibetan and Tuvan overtone chanting, which also produces an
unusual droning, buzzing, othenvorldly sound. One might imagine that if a group
of Fianna performed it, and their opponents did not know how they were making
the sound, it could be alarming.
In overtoning, as described of the dordfiiansa the lips are pursed to send

133
the sound back down the throat, reverberating the vocal chords again. It is possible
to sing two or even three notes simultaneously in this way.
Overtoning in Tibetan and Tuvan contexts is associated with meditative and
shamanistic practice.‘230vertoningis powerfully consciousness altering to hear, or
especially to perform, because of the vibration of the sound and the breathing
techniques required.
There is another intriguing possible reference to overtoning in the work of
the much-derided 1010 Morgannwg, who said he had copied it f?om an ancient
manuscript. Many scholars discount his work entirely because he was a drug addict
and certainly made up some of what he says he copied. I include this for its interest
in relation to the matter at hand with a big lump of salt.
His Barddas says that creation occurred when God spoke the Awen. This
sound radiated down in the form of three bars of light (the Trinity) and three
sounds, given in the Barddas as 0-I-V. It goes on to say that the letters stand for
God’s love, knowledge and truth, and that, in harmony with this primal creative
act, Welsh bards sang the three letters simultaneously, each note corresponding to a
bar of light.
How was this done? There is a strong clue in the fact that the bardic
writings say that while the notes can be sung, “they cannot be pronounced.9,124
What can be sung that cannot be pronounced? Overtone chants. A fbrther point is
that one of the easiest ways to get an overtone is to place the tip of the tongue on
the roof of the mouth and move it -from -front to back while going -froman 0 to an I
to a bilabial V sound. There is even an interesting synchronicity with the “bars of
light” in Tuvan tradition. One group is named Huun-Huur-Tu which means the
light rays that come down through clouds. They chose the name because the “light
rays on the steppe remind us of the separate lines of sound in throat singing, except
that in throat singing you’re working not with light rays but with sound rays.7, 125
There are some other Celtic references which may imply overtone chanting.
In ancient times, Celts are described “roaring” into their shields, creating a

134
deafening reverberation. Singing with your mouth close to a reflective surface
naturally begins to create overtones.
St. Columba is also described as singing psalms like thunder, or a
melodious lion. He is said to have terrified the Pictish King, Brude, by singing the
forty-fourth psalm in a voice that “rose in the air like a terrible thunderstorm.,9126
PERCUSSION
There is less reference to percussion and drums than to other kinds of music
in the literature. I will have more to say about specific instruments, including a
possible pseudonym for the drum in a shamanic context, in chapter four. Some
scholars thing the drum came late to Britain, but we must bear in mind that drums
are made of perishable materials, and so, don’t leave a lot of archaeological
evidence for their existence.
There is, however, not a total dearth of references to percussive sound. One
of the classical authors refers to their warriors beating on their leather shields, and I
mentioned above that the dordfiiansa was accompanied by the clashing of their
spears. Bells appear frequently. and there is mention of a cnarnfir, or “bone
player,” someone that plays a kind of bone
In later folklore on Hogmanay in Scotland, a dancer would go around the
village wearing a bull’s hide that would be beaten with sticks, creating a
tremendous booming, as a chant was sung.
There is also percussive use of a sieve noted in a divination rite. The
informant, James Johnson of Skeld, Shetland, tells of the “siftin 0’ the siller.” Girls
stand before a darkened window with three, six or nine bits of silver in a sieve,
shaking them and saying “My siller I sift / My siller sift I / If I be to get a man /
may he pass by.” Then she would see her future husband pass the window.’28The
Hungarian taltos also uses a sieve in similar fashion as an instrument of divination
and trance induction. This has frequently been considered a trace of shamanism by

scholars.129
The supernatural aura of the smith may also have something to do with the
fact that smiths, even after the burning of instruments, still had the opportunity to
make percussive sound.
Drums are simple instruments. Each baby invents the drum on its own,
banging something against something else. Therefore, it is hard to imagine the
Celts did not use them. We will now move on to other, less comfortable, methods
of entering alternate states of consciousness.
ORDEAL
In many cultures, paradoxically, experiencing union with the sacred
requires that the shaman cultivate a sense of loss and longing, declaring his vacuum
so it could be filled. The Oglala Sioux speak of “becoming pitiful” before the
spirits.
Whatever the spiritual principals behind ordeal, it is clear that it also works
for a variety of physiological reasons. In many of the saints’ lives we see fasting,
long hours of wakefulness and prayer, and more severe forms of mortification of
the flesh being used consciously to draw the devotee closer to God.’3oThe Celtic
religious are no exception.
In The Martyrology of Oengus, Oengus is described as chanting his psalms
“fifty in the river with a withe round his neck tied to a tree; fifty under the tree and
fifty in his cell. Praying in water comes up on a number of occasions, especially
with the accompanying shamanistic ability to generate heat. The “hture
Manchurian or Eskimo shaman, like the Himalayan or Tantric yogin, must prove
his shamanic power by resisting the most severe cold or drying wet sheets on his
bare body.” Other rituals show power by the ability to handle fire, or tolerate
intense heat. “Resistance to cold through ‘mystical heat’ denotes obtaining a
superhuman state in the same measure as insensibility to fire.

pray. The monk is perishing with cold, and St. Patrick tells him to stand in fiont of
him, downstream. The monk then grows too hot. Other austerities include the
triduan or three day fast and the crosjjgil, where the monk would stand and recite
the Lord’s prayer many times, arms extended. Being entombed or buried was
another practice.
Ordeals of‘ one kind and another are well known in shamanic cultures. One
practice, and the reason behind it, was discussed by Igjugarjuk, a Caribou Eskimo
shaman interviewed by b u d Rasmussen in the 1920s. He fasted for a thirty-day
period in freezing cold. Eventually. he received a female helping spirit and returned
home. He still fasted periodically, and told Rasmussen that “The only true wisdom
lives far from mankind, out in the great loneliness, and can only be reached through
suffering.9,133
This relates in an interesting way to some recent research about how the
brain may experience mystic states of consciousness. Amold Mandell, in his article
Towards a Psychobiology of Transcendence: God in the Brain discusses how
severe stress may induce transcendent experience.134 Mandell refers to the earlier
research of Pavlov. When his dogs nearly drowned in a flood, he discovered that a
curious thing occurred. Some of them seemed in a beatific state. Put under severe
stress, (they were nearly up to their noses in water when they were rescued) the
hippocampus in the brain had shut down all external stimuli and amplified the
internal. This may have created the sort of grand unified experience described by
mystics, sometimes aRer severe penance, fasting and so forth.
All the dogs did not react in this way to the stress, but the ones that did were
much more receptive to learning, i.e., they fimctioned better, and more tranquilly,
in their day to day reality. It had, however, wiped out all their past conditioning. an
important finding. To wipe out past conditioning is to be reborn, and some
accounts of ordeals in Celtic tradition, especially burial, seem to show the
protagonists changed by the experience.

137
BURIAALND SENSORYDEPRIVATION
Sensory deprivation is used in many cultures as a method to enter alternate
states of consciousness. I have already mentioned above some methods that involve
sensory deprivation, such as imbas forosnai. Later, Martin Martin shows the
Scottish bards continuing these kinds of practices. He says that “they shut their
doors and windows for a day‘s time, and lie upon their backs, with a stone upon
their belly, and plaids about their heads, and their eyes being covered, they pump
their brains for rhetorical encomium or panegyric; and indeed they h n i s h such a
style fiom this dark cell, as is understood by very The idea that this sort of
thing was a common bardic practice is supported by one old story, that features a
“call and response” that goes, “What shall we do with this man?’ To which the
reply is: “If bard, underground, underground, If harper, to the castle, to the castle.
(Mu’sbard,$0 ’nuir,.f o ’nuir, / Ma ’sclarsuir, do ’ndun, do ‘ndun.)‘36
One step further than simply shutting the door of your stone chamber is
entombment. Ritual burial is common to many shamanic traditions. It features in
Nicobar Island shamanic initiations.13’ Among the Yakut, as a rule, a future
shaman “dies” and lies in the dark yurt for three days with no food or water.138In
Australia, the Euahlayi carry a young man chosen to become a shaman to the
cemetery where he is bound and left for several nights.’39Absolute darkness is
essential to the process in all cases.140
Like the Yakut example, the Celtic ritual burial often seems to be three
days. This burial is the most extreme form of sensory deprivation we hear about in
the tales. Probably the most famous example is that of St. Oran.
The story goes that St. Columba and St. Oran contended about the issues of
heaven, hell and punishment. St. Oran volunteered to go for the space of three days
down to the grave. They dug a hole as deep as he was tall and buried him. After
three days and nights, they dug him up and he told them that heaven and hell were
not as they were imagined and the good were not eternally happy and the bad were

138
not eternally unhappy. At hearing this, St. Columba was appalled, and ordered him
reburied for
Oran acts in a specifically shamanic way in this tale for three reasons. First,
he deliberately practices a technique of sensory deprivation to alter consciousness.
Second he does so to learn about heaven and hell, presumably making an
Otherworld journey to do so. Third, he does it to return with information for others,
as all shamans return to their tribe with boons fi-omthe Otherworld.
The incident shows an interesting conflict within St. Columba. At times he
seemed sympathetic to older traditions. However, when shamanic perceptions came
up against basic Christian tenets, or rather, threatened to. since poor Oran did not
get much chance to speak, he nipped it in the bud. Where shamanic traditions can
accept fiesh revelation, established religions tend to hold to existing tradition.
Michael Harner theorises that strict adherence to tradition comes when a culture
loses its shamans. They hold to what the last one brought back Erom the Otherworld
because they know it works.
St. Columba’s ambivalence in these areas is illustrated by a second tale
involving apparent ritual burial. St. Columba and his companion Baithin are in
Armagh, where they awake. go to bless themselves at “the stones and cemeteries
and crosses of Patrick,” and see stark naked men with what was left of their
winding sheets about them after their awakening. Baithin expressed disapproval at
that, for he did not like it. He asked St. Columba what it was. St. Columba said, “If
you had anything of Patrick’s feeling for the clerics and psalm singing hermits in
regard to their assistance you would not behave thus...” and St. Columba says he
will fill a reliquary with the winding sheets and it will heal the men of Scotland and
Ireland of every sickness and labor.=, 142
Is it a death and resurrection rite, like the three day burial we know of? The
dead are clearly raised, yet this is a physical happening, not a vision, since St.
Columba takes the sheets.*43The reason for Baithin’s disapproval is unclear. Is this
some sort of Primal survival, and is St. Columba’s response one of tolerance? The

139
winding sheets bring us to another mode of altering consciousness-techniques
involving binding or wrapping the practitioner.
BINDING
Binding or wrapping in a hide to induce an alternate state of consciousness
is an often-recurring theme in Celtic sources. Binding can combine elements of
physical pain and ordeal with sensory deprivation where the seer is entirely
wrapped in a hide.
The symbolism of binding, and specifically, that of the sacrificial noose,
may also figure in the symbolism of the torc, a point to which I will return in
chapter six. Binding also has many symbolic layers of meaning. 144
There are many examples of “bound shaman” rituals in other cultures. I
have even encountered a Palaeolithic image fiom Sicily showing several people
bound with their limbs tied behind their backs with bird-masked figures standing
over them. It has been interpreted as a scene of sacrifice, yet the bird-masked
figures are not doing anything obviously lethal to the bound figures.145The method
of binding all limbs behind the back is used by Inuit shamans for trance possession
and prophecy.’46 The exact same method is used by the Lakota in the Yuwipi
ceremony for healing and manifesting spiritual power to the tribe. I am not
suggesting that all these examples are connected, they are just interesting parallels
given the psychobiology of trance, and the idea that similar practices may invoke
similar states of consciousness.
The binding method described in some sources, ceungul nun tri chaol, or
the “binding of the three smalls or narrows,” is intriguing. The origin of the term is
obscure, but it occurs in various Old Irish and Scottish Gaelic source^.'^' Stem
believes we should imagine the procedure “so that wrists, ankles and waist are tied
with a caol each.. .and the 3 bits (cinn)are tied together on the back.1.1148
I am not sure myself if the descriptions always make it clear that the waist

140
is the third caol. It is not very narrow. Rather the neck might be, obviously not
drawn tight enough to make the person lose consciousness. The shaman in the
Lakota Yuwipi ceremony is bound this way.
A modem account describes the procedure. First, the shaman, in this
account, Plenty Wolf, stands and places his hands behind him. “Horn Cloud took a
short thong and began to tie.. .Plenty Wolf s hands together. He then placed the
quilt over Plenty Wolf s head so that one corner completely hooded his face.. .Horn
Cloud took fiom his pocket a long leather thong, one end of which had already
been fastened into a slipknot. and placed it over Plenty Wolfs head. securing it
tightly over his quilt covered neck ...” The quilt was then secured around Plenty
Wolf, the thong was wrapped round him, tied behind his back, and finally its end
was tied around his ankles.i49Later in the ceremony, Plenty Wolf spoke to his
spirits in the darkness and invoked help for the boy the ceremony had been called
for. Finally, when the lights were eventually turned on again. Plenty Wolf was
found unbound.
This is seen as a particularly good omen, meaning that the spirits were
motivated enough by the ceremony to take the physical action of releasing the
shaman.”’ One idea behind the various kinds of “bound shaman” rituals is that the
shaman’s pathetic state motivates his spirits to act.
Ceangal nan tri chaol is described as being palnful and undignified. For
example. “The king of Lochlan, the lucky (?). was thrown to the ground on the
heath, in fiont of everybody and subjected to the tying up of the 3 thin sprouts (it
was not an honour for a king!)” (Leagaidh righ Lochlainn gun agh / AmJiadhnuis
chaich air an fraoch, / Dho-sa, ‘s cha b ’onair righ, i Chuirt ’ air ceangal nan tri
chaol.)‘
Perhaps the most famous and well-attested visionary practice involving
binding or wrapping is the tarbfeis. First, archaeology confirms that the bull was
revered, as evidenced by numerous carvings and sacrificial deposits, for example at
Gournay-sur-Aronde.’j2This reverence is also shown by the use of a bull‘s hide in
149 Powers. 1984. p. 56 150 Powers. 1984. pp. 56-66 151 Stem. 1908. p. 190 152 Ellis. 1994. pp. 22 1-222



141
other ritual and visionary practices. Medb and Ailill’s druid, MacRoth, in The Tain
Bo C~ailnge,wears a bull‘s hide on his journey to survey the enemy troops. In later
folklore on Hogmanay in Scotland, a dancer would go around the village wearing a
bull’s hide that was beaten with sticks, as noted above.
Rituals involving wrapping in a hide, particularly a bull‘s hide, occur in
many time-periods and locations. In the tarbfeis a bull was sacrificed and a person
was wrapped in the hide. As others chanted, he received the answer to his question.
The SergZige Con Culainn describes the practice in a section relating to the election
of kings. ‘j3In the Dream of Rhonabtly, mentioned above, the hero falls asleep on a
yellow cow’s hide and has a dream of Arthur.”‘ It is also described in later
folklore, for example, in Martin Martin’s Description of the Western Islands of
Scotland.
In Martin’s 1703 account, a party of men goes to a solitary place. They
single out one of their number, wrap him in a cow’s hide except for his head. They
left him in this posture “all night until his invisible fi-iendsrelieved him by giving a
proper answer to the question in hand, which he received.. .fi-om several persons
that he found about him all the time. This seems to infer these are not just any
spirits, but possibly totemic spirits of the particular person coming to relieve him of
his distress. The extremely unpleasant variant on this theme which involves putting
a cat on a spit, at which point a large cat comes to its rescue with the answer, seems
to confirm this totemic connection.
s 155
He says that one person who had this experience. John Erach, experienced
such visionary horrors that he could not relate them. At least in this one case, it did
have an effect, albeit not the desired one.
This practice may have very archaic roots. The custom of burials wbere
horns and hooves alone remain, such as found in Neoltihic long barrows in
Wessex, may indicate some kind of ceremonial use of the hide where the entire
members, “head and feet, had been cut off while held together by the tendons,
ligaments, hooves and probably skin. Piggot cites Siberian paralells, and notes

that Danish burials in ox hide have been found, as well as probable hide-wrapped
burials of Beaker and early Bronze age peoples from Scotland. He notes the
connections with Celtic and Old Irish tradition, and its similarity to the Siberian.
...the bull's hide was employed in ritual divination, much as the Yakut
shaman sat in ecstacy on his mare's skin invoking the 'mighty bull of the earth'
and the horse of the steppe.'. ..Nor were such rites confined to medieval Ireland,
for the 1 l* century Burchard of Worms enjoins the priest to enquire of the
potentially sinful member of his flock whether. at the Kalends of January, he had
sat on a bull's hide at a crossroad, thinking thereby to know the future. And in the
Hebrides in the 18th century the powers of darkness could be consulted by
wrapping a man in a cow hide so that only his head protrudes, and leaving him all
night till his 'invisible friends relieved him by giving a proper answer to the
question at hand.' Celtic seer and Siberian shaman had much in common.'57
Of course, there is no way of telling if there is any continuity beyond the
practical. A bull's hide would be big enough to cover the practitioner fully and
block out all light, making it easier to "see" spiritually. Totally unrelated groups
might easily decide to use a bull's hide independently.
I mentioned earlier that the sound of running water can be consciousness
altering. Thomas Pennant describes a 1772 taghairrn ritual in Trotternish in Skye
that combines both wrapping in hide and the sound of water. He describes the
family, (probably the MacQueens) who practised it, as people who "pretended to

held to go in families. In the ritual the practitioner was sewn into a hide and placed
in a crevice behind the waterfall, before being asked the question. Given that there
would have been many less stressful, (and less attested) ways to dupe the gullible, I
doubt that this was pure pretence. One cannot help but be struck by the similarity of
form over all the centuries.

distress reflects a common shamanic practice. as noted above?”
An essential principal in the Yuwipi ceremony. described above. is
becoming “pitiful before the spirits” so that they will help you. The shaman is
tightly bound in the Yuwipi or “tent shaking” ceremony, so named because it often
results in spectacular manifestations of the shaman’s power. If the ceremony is
successful, the shaman’s spirits untie him, prophesying through him during this
process. They may also perform healing on the people there, as well as creating
physical effects, such as shaking the tent, or throwing prayer ties around.16’
Now that I have discussed modes of altering consciousness, I will move on
to the point of these procedures.
l l m S p m JOURNEY
I use the term “spirit journey” in preference to shamanic journey because this
technique is used by non-shamans as well as shamans in traditional cultures. The
shaman’s experience differs in general by its unusual and consistent intensity. The
same Indo-European root that gives us the word ecstasy gives us one word for a
spirit journey in Old Irish: echtra-literally an “outgoing.7,162
Other branches of Indo-European cultures show obvious examples of the
spirit journey. They feature clearly in Old English works such as The Seafarer, and
classical works such as the Aeneid.’63I think we are safe in calling the Norse Odin
a shamanic deity. I will speak of Odin as a possible shamanic oracle in chapter five,
but he also exhibits many other shamanic characteristics. including the ability to
journey.164Snorri says his “body lay as though he were asleep or dead, and he then
became a bird or beast, a fish or dragon, and went in an instant to far off lands.77165
One is spoilt for choice when it comes to examples of the spirit journey in
Celtic materials. I have already mentioned Cu Chulainn’s spirit journeys in the last
chapter. There are whole classes of literature, such as the echtrae tales and the
immrama that clearly follow the structure of the shamanic journey as it is manifest

in other cultures. For example, a Hungarian tultos describes going “to the end of
the world and enjoying there a great hospitality and then going to the bottom of the
waters. The bruidean tales also demonstrate a wealth of shamanic features, as
shownby Nagy.’“’
9, 166
Each story does not have all features, but many follow the classic shamanic
pattern. The protagonists go forth into the Otherworld, they interact with
supernatural beings, they gain spirit helpers and teachers, they learn things. they
return with boons for their people. For example, King Cormac Mac Art learned
about of truth, falsehood, and honour and gained ritual implements that helped his
people in The Otherworld Adventure of Cormac, discussed fiu-ther in chapter four.
While Cormac’s experience was, in part, visited on him, he did ask for the
stranger’s magical branch, implying he wanted some kind of Otherworld contact.
There are also examples of people being carried off unwillingly. If the sluugh
comes by, they may carry the person miles away. Interestingly, the Chukchee
describe a similar experience when on amanita. The mushroom spirits pick up a
man under the arms and carry him off. “They delight in places where the dead live
and may show the man round the entire world. Many journeys are more clearly
intentional.

Medb and Ailill’s druid, was able to go “all around Ireland in a day,” and
does so in the Tain to survey the enemy’s troops.1700 Riain says that while
Thomas O’Rahilly thought Mac Roth was sun god, he thinks that would been in the
remote past if it is correct at all. Rather, he may be portrayed in the Tain with
deliberate ambiguity. “Circuits were an integral part of abbatical
practice...Furthermore, only one abbot, namely Patrick’s successor, could aspire to
a circuit of all Ireland.”
Other ambiguous elements of Mac Roth’s description include words such
“as berrad ‘hair,’which may also denote tonsure, and fethal ‘dress’ which more
commonly means insignia or sacred halidom. Mac Roth is a religious figure

who can traverse all Ireland with remarkable speed. Called a druid, Mac Roth
seems a clear candidate for the label of shaman.
The SergZige implies that Cu Chulainn may be deliberately seeking
Otherworld contact. First, he casts at Otherworld birds, despite Emer's warning.
Some shamanic cultures hunt animals to gain their power as totems.'72This can be
very dangerous, as in the Sami bear hunt, and the hunter's relatives may or may not
be keen on him doing it, but he gains great power if he succeeds.
In Cu Chulainn's case, he fails, and troubled in mind, goes to sit with his
back to a particdar standing stone.173 In another tale, he binds himself to this same
stone as he is dying. The stone becomes the site of his final entry into the
Otherworld.174
Later folklore gives evidence that the pre-Celtic Neolithic megalithic sites
continued to occupy a place in the Celtic populations' minds, hearts and ritual
practices. Indeed, they still do. A researcher recently observed someone's ashes
being poured out at Clava, a megalithic site in the north of Scotland, in a funerary
ritual complete with piper.i7sThe site had been used for cremations in the Early
Bronze Age, and was later the site of a Pictish burial, so had evidently been in at
least intermittent use since its creation.176
There are examples of people using Neolithic burial mounds as well as
natural hills as starting places for the spirit journey. For example, Pwyll is
definitely seeking spiritual experience when he meets Rhiannon. He goes to sit on
mound where he will either receive wounds and blows or see a ~ 0 n d e r . lTh~e~
twinned theme of wounding and seeing is interesting in light of shaman's initiatory
experiences. Cu Chulainn also goes to a Neolithic site where he receives wounds
and blows and later sees a wonder. Both experiences lead to the protagonist's union
with Otherworld women.
Burial mounds are entry points to the Otherworld in many cultures. For
example, one Sakha Siberian man gains his shamanic power when he camped the

night on a Tungus shaman’s grave.
In the later literature, one traditional Scottish story, Canain nan Eun, the
“Language of Birds,” depicts both the journey and the knowledge gained upon it.’79
Birds, as I will discuss further in chapter four, are profoundly associated with the
Othenvorld and shamanic practice in most cultures, and the Celtic is no exception.
The Island of Birds features in several voyage tales, including Maelduin‘s and
Brendan’s.
In the story, Alasdair’s father wants to give his son the best possible
education, so he sends him to the Isle of Birds to learn bird language. Each time the
boy returns, his father asks what he has learned. After the first year he says, “I can
see (a thing).” After year two he says, “I can see a thing and I can hear a thing.”
After year three he says, “I can see a thing and I can hear and I can understand a
thing.”i80
A chaffinch prophesies that the father will face humiliation at his son‘s
hands. Alasdair’s father orders the bird killed. Then there is a slightly strange
episode where Alasdair returns to bird island for three more years. When he arrives
the birds recognise him and flock around. He begins killing and eating them, “so
that if he wished for any further acquaintance with bird language he got it during
those three years. It may be something to do with gaining the power of an
,9181
animal through consuming it. For example, the Andaman Islanders kill and eat
turtle meat in their initiations, then dance the turtle to show they now have its
power.’82
In one Egyptian funerary text, the deceased is depicted as a huntsman who
devours the gods and the illuminated ones, gaining their power. After a gory
description of killing, dismemberment, evisceration and cooking of the deities in
cauldrons which would do any Siberian shaman proud, the deceased bbdevourtsheir
hearts and crowns and thereby gains their powers, so that their magic is in his body;
he swallows the understanding of every god...77183

In this tale, Alasdair goes through a Mis-like episode. where his hair and
nails grow out. Despite his grooming. he is adopted by a ship’s captain. He solves a
king’s long-standing problem with some ravens, and marries a princess, however,
his feral state retums.
He seeks help from a Prince of Spain to whom he had previously done a
favour. The Prince hears a voice in his sleep saying that if he kills his three children
his friend will be restored. He cuts their throats, washes Alasdair in their blood, and
he’s as beautiful as before. When he tells his Queen, she agrees that she would
have given anything to heal Alasdair, even the deaths of her children. They go to
mourn over the bodies but find the children are alive again. The story then notes
that “the children were wearing their necklaces,” though these necklaces are not
mentioned before or after.’84I think this may relate to symbolic, rather than actual,
sacrifice, a point to which I will return in chapter six.
Ultimately, Alasdair is a king in his own land. The chaffinch’s prophetic
words are hlfilled when Alasdair’s father sets his teeth to a knot in the king’s
shoelace and his mother stands with a basin. Alasdair’s father says it would be just
to slay him. He responds, “There is no knowing whether I should ever have been
king had not everything happened as it has, but never again shall you need alms.“
In this story, we can clearly see that Alasdair journeys into the Othenvorld,
where he learns to see, hear and understand-in short, he learns everything.
Various traditional cultures express “magic” and “bird song,” by similar or related
terms. For example, the Germanic word for magical incantations is galdr, from the
verb galan, to sing-a term especially applied to bird calls. Throughout the world
bird language “is equivalent to knowing the secrets of nature and hence to being
able to prophesy.7, 185
Like Mis and Suibhne, Alasdair goes through a feral phase. Like Mis, he is
deemed extremely valuable, so valuable that the Queen is willing to offer her
children’s lives for his restoration.
Maelduin provides us another example.18‘ He begins his journey seeking

148
revenge for his father. The islands he visits have an assortment of fascinating
figures and symbols that require a thesis of their own to explore fiom a shamanistic
perspective. Of particular interest is the theme of his three foster-brothers, lost on
his travels. I am confident that these are Maelduin's spiritual a1ter-eg0s.I~'
At the start of his journey. a druid tells Maelduin that he must only go with
a group of seventeen, and himself the eighteenth, for there to be a good result fiom
his journey. Maelduin's foster brothers want to go along so badly that they swim
out and nearly drown. Maelduin is very displeased and sulks.'" Psychologically,
it's like people treat unwanted aspects of the self-trying to get away from them
and then finding they've tagged along. The thing is that at several later points in the
tale, the text always refers to Maelduin and his seventeen men, not his twenty men.
The foster brothers are never counted in the equation.
Still more revealing is the way these brothers leave the expedition. The frrst
one takes a tow from an altar, and a cat leaps through him like a fiery arrow,
reducing him to dust.189Since the golden torc is a symbol of power, one might say
he was either guilty of greed or presumption, presuming to a spiritual or temporal
status he had not earned. The next brother is lost to the island of sorrow, later in the
story.'" As all the great mystics state, sorrow and the dark night of the soul are
great difficulties on the spiritual path.I9l Finally, the last is lost on the island of joy,
near his journey's end.'92Maelduin, however, returns. It is tempting to see this as
Maelduin's "Boddhisattva moment.'' Like the Boddhisattva, he chooses to depart
the total joy of the Otherworld and return to physical reality.
When he returns to his land and expresses forgiveness to his father's
murderers, it is clear, as with Alasdair, above, that his ordeals have changed him
for the better.'" Everything he has been through has been necessary to his
transformation-the classic shaman hero's journey.
187 It should be noted here that the motif of the three extra crewmen occurs in other Irish tales such as Adomnh's I i'tu Columbue. and the kvigatio Brendani. While these figures "work" as Maelduin's alter egos in this tale. the) don't necessarilj in the others. I intend to research this theme further in future. in the meanwhile. thanks to Tom Clanq for this point.

This is such an archetypal, universal journey that some scholars interpret
Celtic myths of this kind as literary borrowings fi-om other sources.’94Eldevick,
however, admits that the evidence for Virgilian influence is circumstantial.‘95 First,
there is a short quote fiom the Aeneid, which may or may not indicate that the Irish
writer had a thorough knowledge of Virgil. Next, Maelduin’s tale bears external
similarities to the Aeneid. Finally, there is an apparent similarity between the
spiritual development of Maelduin and Aeneas.
As I have stated above, however, both tales come from Indo-European roots
and both are based on the mythic pattern so well documented by Campbell, that of
the hero’s Journey.196Next, that theme in itself, with its Otherworld voyages,
battles with monsters, and eventual triumph in a higher level of spirituality and
adherence to a higher code than earthly heroism, vengeance or desire, is itself
based upon the shaman, society”sfirst transcendent hero. It is true that, as Eldevick
says, the irnmram can be viewed as a “portrayal of the growth and maturation of the
hero’s soul.” However, the Native Irish hardly needed to rely on Virgil as
“precedent and model” for a tale or myth of this type. It exists everywhere, as
Campbell has shown. Another universal is the shamanic cosmic structure.
THETHREEWORLDS
The cosmic structure the shaman journeys through is essentially simple,
with three worlds: an upper, middle and lower. Towards the end of the Thin.
Conchobar’s men make a vow. They say, “We shall hold the spot where we now
stand...unless the ground quakes beneath us or the heavens fall down on us, we
shall not flee fiom here.” (Ge‘bma-ne iarom i mbale i tam...acht mani maidi in
talamfound nd an ne‘m anuasforaind, nicon memsam-ne de sund.)“’
This formula is well attested throughout Celtic history and literature. While
it may simply be a statement that Conchobar’s men vow to stay unless the
194 Zimmer was the first to comment on the possible Vergilian influence on ICMD. (Re? Zirnrner. Heinrich. 1889. “Keltische Beitriige 11.“ in Zeitschrift&r deutsches ‘4ltertumvol. 33. the section dealing with Mael Duin being pp. 325-338.) This was rebutted by W.F. Thrall in: Thrall, W.F.. 191 7. “Vergil‘s Aeneid and the Irish Immrama: Zimmer’s Theory.“ in Modern Philology. vol. 15. pp. 449-474 195 Eldevick. 1984, p. 6 196 See Campbell.Joseph. 1963 197 Sayers. 1986. pp. 99-100. quoting O‘Rahilly. Cecile. 1976. line 4043



150
impossible happens, the way it is used indicates that it has cosmological
implications.198 It may be a relic of the shamanic three-fold cosmic structure.
A discussion of Celtic cosmic structure as a whole is far beyond the scope
of this work. The most basic facet of shamanic cosmologies that we can compare to
the Celtic is that they have lower, middle and upper worlds usually connected by a
world tree or pillar. The lower world is entered by going down into an opening in
the earth or descending the roots of the world tree. The middle is the spiritual
aspect of this world, and may include a spirit world entered by going over the sea.
The upper is entered by climbing the world tree or flying up into the heavens and
passing through a zone of transition, often clouds, and emerging into a landscape.
The worlds are each multi-layered like a cake.lY9
We see some evidence for all the above in Celtic tradition. First, journeys to
a lower world, in the Celtic case, into sid mounds or below the ocean or lakes. are
very well attested, and appear throughout this study. A middle world journey
features in the Tain where Mac Roth flies out to survey enemy troops. The
irnrnrumu can also be classed as middle world journeys.2oo
The upper world journey is a bit more difficult to show. It is implied by the
fact that some Celtic shamanic figures display powers of spirit flight, and many
wear bird costuming. Episodes where “mist descends” in stories such as Echtrue
C’urmuic may possibly represent an upper world journey, because the transition
zone to the heavenly realm is so often represented as clouds in shamanistic cultures
and the protagonists often encounter deities on these journeys.”’ However,
mistiness can also simply be a feature of mysterious or supernatural encounters in
literature as in film.
One problem is that native conceptions of an upper world would certainly
have been incorporated into ideas of the Christian heaven. Stevenson and Carey
have looked at some of the strands that have been woven into apocryphal literature
such as the Fis Adornnan, but their origins remain murky.202They do share features

151
with shamanic journeys of ascent. For example, there are several levels, the journey
may be arduous and even painful and supernatural figures help or hinder along the
way, sometimes functioning as spirit teachers.203
The usual number of heaven worlds in the apocrypha is seven. It is
interesting to note that the number of heavens. and corresponding branches of the
world tree, may number seven or nine in a variety of Siberian traditions. Nine is a
very important number in Celtic cosmology, appearing alternately with seven in
various contexts, as it does in Siberia.204 Siberian sources also show other
significant correspondences with the Celtic in the matter of cosmology.
THEDOWNWARDGROWINTGREE
One Irish manuscript describes a tree with “its upper part above the
firmament, its lower part in the Earth, and every harmony in its midst..& grew
downward fiom a single root...There were nine branches, every branch more
beautiful than that above. There were pure white birds on the forks of the branches,
singing many melodies throughout the ages. The inverted tree is Christ, and the
birds on the branches are the souls of the righteous. While this is a Christian text,
the idea of an inverted tree also appears in the Rig Veda, so we may have an archaic
Indo-European motif here, with shamanic parallels.206
,7205
From the ba soul we see hovering above mummies in ancient Egyptian
paintings to the white bird souls of the righteous perched in the downward growing
tree, the idea of the soul as bird is an almost universal phenomen~n.~”
Of course, in traditional shamanic cultures, the shaman is considered to be
the most “righteous” person there is. A Yakut myth on the origin of shamans that
echoes a number of Celtic shamanic themes says that shamans are born in the
North. A giant fir tree grows there with nests in its branches. Of course, North is
where the Tuatha De hail from and the direction of magic in Celtic tradition.208
As in the Celtic tree, the “noblest orders’’ of birds or souls are at the top.
203 Elide. 1964, pp. 193-197, Stevenson. Jane. 1983 204 Stevenson. Jane, 1983. Seymour. 1923. Elide. 1964, pp. 274-276. Rees. 1961. p. 195 205 Thurneysen. 1923, Herbert and McNamara 1989, p. 5 5 , Low, 1996,pp. 102-103 206 Rees. 1961. p. 193 207 Rowland 1978 208 Gray. 1983. p. 25



152
Great shamans are in the highest branches, lesser ones in the middle and garden
variety at the bottom. Bird-of-Prey-Mother, a mythical, eagle-headed, iron
feathered being, lays the eggs that the shaman souls emerge . f i . ~ m . ~W’h~en they
hatch they are given to a devil-shamaness of distinct Fomoirian aspect who has one
eye. one arm and one bone, to be trained.’”
Moving back to Celtic and Germanic sources, the seeress in the Voluspu
says “Nine worlds I remember, nine in the tree...” which may relate to the shaman’s
celestial ascent. Norse tradition has the world tree Yggdrasil, usually interpreted as
“the Horse of Odin,“ with the shamanic association that the world tree is the
“horse” the shaman rides into the heavens.2” A Welsh source refers to the oak as
dwsscrwr, “doorkeeper,”while one Old irish source calls a tree dor nime, possibly
meaning “door of heaven. In a shamanic parallel, the Buriat call the sacred
birch udcshi burkhan, the “guardian of the door,“ for “it opens the door to heaven
for the shaman. Watson claims that sacred trees were associated with poetry
and kingship and were sources of wisdom. 214
,7212
7 7 2 13
Another factor that enourages the idea of a Celtic world tree is the overall
religious significance of the tree in Celtic tradition. Sacred groves were central to
the Celtic spiritual practices. Tacitus states “The grove is the centre of their whole
religion.772 15
The oak was certainly an important tree, as evidenced by the connections to
the etymology of the word druid mentioned earlier. The fact that oaks are often
struck by lightning might have underscored their role in connecting the heavens
and earth. The ash is also important. Some sacred trees mentioned in an Irish
context are the Tree of Ross, The Tree of Mugna, The Ancient Tree of Dath-i, The
Branching Tree of Uisnech, and The Ancient Tree of Tortu, of which three are ash
and two are yew.”‘

I have only been able to give the slightest sampling above of the many
examples of trance inducing practices, shamanic training and the spirit journey
available to us in Celtic sources. In some ways, the journey. in particular. is one of
the easiest facets of Celtic shamanism to demonstrate. However, the shaman’s use
to his community does not end with the ability to change consciousness and
Journey.
In shamanic cultures. power is only power to the extent that it is of practical
use. Pwyll’s power to enter the Otherworld would be insignificant to his
community if he had not learned to be a better king through it.
The stories touched on above and in previous chapters give many examples
of the utility of Otherworld contact. Maelduin learns to forgive his enemies and
comes to internal peace. Cu Chulainn becomes a greater warrior. Oengus gets a
wife and their joined powers benefit others. Cormac gains greater wisdom and
magical implements that enhance his subjects‘ happiness. Mogh Roith does battle
with Munster’s enemies.
While there are various ways to determine that the shaman has had a
“proper” or “real” trance, the most dominant one is the utility of what he brings
back. Gaining power is only useful to the extent that the shaman uses it to perform
his function for his community.

The shaman has many cultural functions. They protect the community from
malefic spiritual forces. They are often healers. They may also be killers, whether they
use their powers in the hunt or against a human enemy. They look into the future and
discern hidden truths in the present in their function as revealer or diviner. They also
act as the spiritual guide for their community. teaching them how the universe works.'
These many functions are predicated on one hnction.
The core fimction of shamanism is to manifest Otherworld powers in this
world, acting as co-creator with spiritual forces. For the shaman thoughts and action
fuse. "For them, thinking is no mere symbolic expression that ekes out a pale
existence in the form of language. Shamans carry thinking to the highest level of
perfection, seeing in it a subtle quasi-material force that, like air, pervades the material
world."
The co-creative power of thought and the spiritual power it marshals is
neutral. The shaman decides how to apply it. We must return again to the bards and

shamanistic.
The Old Irish word creth, poetry and Welshprydydd, have cognates in other
languages which associate them with occult powers? The poetry was designed for
magical effect, as well as the visionary trance or ecstasy.
Ifor Williams called the poet a seer who. whether seeing a warrior. a
landscape, or society and customs, can “frame or shape his vision in fitting
words...and further, there is that element of frenzy, of the supernatural or the demonic,
which is akin to mania and madness, and may go with genius or charlatanism...It is
from this obscure source that we may derive all that mass of early poetry which is
grouped under the heading of durogan or ~aticination.“M~y only argument is that I
would prefer to call the poet’s inspiration duemonic rather than demonic.
Poetry and shamanic power go together in a wide range of cultures. Glosecki
has shown how shamanism and poetry intertwined in Anglo-Saxon ~ u l t u r eI.n~Tuvan
culture, the shaman accompanies every stage of his kandanie, or ritual activity. with
uZgysh verses. These are created spontaneously and the Tuvans believe that both the
sounds and imagery of the verses heal the patient!
While poetic inspiration comes fkom spirit, these poets do not simply go
along with what the spirits say, but creatively interact with them. The human, or the
shaman, acts on and is acted upon by many forces. Therefore, creation is always CO
creation.
Dh
I think that the word dan. used in Nede’s poem at the start of the last chapter,
and usually translated simply as “poetry,” or “art” may refer to such co-creative
power.’ Nede spoke of “wisdom, son of the three gods of art,” (emu mac nu tri ndea
duna), associating dan with pre-Christian deities, but it continues to be bound up with
the sacred in the Christian context.’”
The first meaning the Dictiionury of the Irish Language gives for akin is that

of “a gift,” for example, in the material sense of a gift of silver, (dhn airgid.)” The
most usual meaning of dhn is a poetic, artistic, scientific, or professional skill, or the
product of that skill, like a a poem or song. For example, when Lugh arrives at Tara
in the Cath Maige Tuired,the doorkeeper asks, “What art do you practice? For no one
without an art enters Tara.” (Cia dan.frisa ng[nJkie?A1 se‘i, “ayni te‘id nech cin akin i
Temruid.)’’
The next meaning given is a “spiritual gift,” for example, from God to man. A
“divine gift to man fiom God or the Holy Ghost. a Christian virtue looked upon as an
emanation-from the Holy Ghost.’‘‘ (Italics mine.)
For example, the Leabhar Breac says that there are seven gifts of the holy
spirit, (uair is secht ndana airegda airmither don spirut noem).” Another source says
that these seven gifts are “wisdom, intellect counsel, vigour, knowledge, piety and
fear of God,’‘ (ecna intliucht comorle nertjis gaire gur omon Fiudat-forhith eh&secht
ndana De‘ dun).l6
Clearly these kinds of spiritual gifts take us beyond the idea of dbn as a simple
skill or poetic art. Here dcin is more of a way of being derived fiom gifts received
fiom the divine. But dan does not simply refer to gifts that God gives man, but also to
gifts man gives to God.
The Leabhar Breac speaks of the “three gifts offered to Christ by the Church,
i.e., virginity, penance and lawful marriage.” (nu tri &nu e‘dbras ind eclais do Christ
.i. bige 7 aithrigi 7 lanamnus dligthech).”
The god Lugh possesses the epithet Samildanuch, the “All-Skilled One,”
because he told Tara’s doorkeeper that he possessed all skills, including supernatural
ones. In fact, the first thing he does when he has entered to demonstrate his power is
play the “three strains” of music, discussed in the last chapter. The first strain of these
that he plays on the first night was sziantraige. It may be significant that this is his first
demonstration of the powers that he claims. From the discussion in the last chapter, it

160
would seem to imply that the most important form of dan to demonstrate is
supernatural power.
So--dcin can mean a poetic, scientific, or professional skill, a poem or song, a
gift from God to man, or a gift fiom man to God. Lastly, it is sometimes used to mean
fate or destiny, as in the phrase i ndan 7 i tairngire, "was fated and foretold."'9 Taking
all these meanings into account, I think that, at its deepest level, dan can mean co
creative power.
For example, the ImacuZZum says that landholders will become inhospitable,
"CO mhut &ha U n-dunu.q'2' Stokes translates. "so that their poems will be dark,'' i.e..
their songs and eulogies. In short, they will get a bad reputation. If dhn can also mean
co-creation, it could then possibly also be translated as, "so that their creations will be
dark," i.e., what they manifest in the world.
Dun can change a person's essential nature-there is the saying that "the art of
wisdom makes a king of a pauper'' (dan ecnu dogni rig do bhocht)." Magical
practitioners of different kinds are also numbered among the kes Dana, including the
Zucht cumachtai or "people of power" include corrpinig, tuathaig or sorcerers,
ammaiti or wizards. Dun appears in the compound word for diabolic arts (diabul
ddnachta)." This associates dun with a kind of practice that involves working with a
kind of spirit (demonic) in a co-creative way.
Besides working with spirits, the kes D u m seem to be considered to be as
spirits themselves in certain accounts. Echtra Cormaic clearly associate the Aes Dunu,
with the Aes Sid, the fairy folk? As we shall see in chapter five, both these classes of
'folk' have strong shamanic associations. Finally, the wonderhlly strange text, the
Cauldron of Poesy, gives us still more reasons to associate dan with some sort of
supernatural co-creative power.'"
Other evidence that supports the idea of ddn as co-creation as well as poetry,
is the fact that poetry like Amergin's Rzin and some works attributed to Taliesin, give

161
the sense that creation occurs through language. This poetry is the very medium
through which co-creative power is exercised, making them one in at least these
cases. In Irish sources a n may be both a poem and its magical effect.
In Welsh, awen, usually translated as “divine inspiration,” is in some cases
both inspiration and effect. While the Biblical tale of creation via God’s utterance is
certainly one source of this idea in Irish literature, but shamanic cultures also see
words as potentially magically creative.
McKenna notes that fiom the shaman’s point of view, “the world appears to
be.. .in the nature of an utterance or a tale.“ He goes on to say that for the shaman.
“the cosmos is a tale that becomes true as it is told and as it tells itself. This
perspective implies that human imagination can seize the tiller of being in the world.
A reverence for and an immersion in the powers of language and communication are
the basis of the shamanic path.”’“
Taking all the evidence above into account, we can see that din can mean a
poetic, scientific, or professional skill, a poem or song, a gift fiom God to man, or a
gift fiom man to God. Lastly, it is sometimes used to mean fate or destiny. Taking all
these meanings into account, I think that, at its deepest level, dun means co-creative
power.
POWER IS NEUTRAL
Shamanic power can be used in many ways. I showed in the last chapter how
sziantraige can be used to heal, but the Tuatha De also have the capacity to use
music to bring sorrow or even kill. For example, Aillen mac Midhna destroyed
Tara every year by first putting everyone to sleep, then emitting a blast of fire?
Here suun may simply be “sleep,” albeit a magically invoked sleep. It could also be
the kind of deep trance that renders a person totally insensible to their surroundings
or anything that may be happening to them.
In ToguiZ Bruidne Du Dergu, “The Destruction of Da Derga’s Hostel,” we
have nine pipers who can kill with their music, but not be killed, because they are
25 McKenna 1992. p. 7 26 Ralls-MacLed 2000. pp. 89-90



162
of the Sid.27Of course, the ability to kill magically is not limited to shamans, and
may not necessarily be shamanic. This is the reason I have not included an
exhaustive description of the evil eye, curse tablets and the like, here. However,
shamans in many cultures do use their power to harm?
There are actually no rituals to heal or kill, only rituals to raise power. which
the shaman can then use as he desires.29The power is neutral. Like shamanic power,
the poets' din can be used in any way.
When the poet uses d i n to praise, he literally magnifies the object of his
praise. The word used in Old Irish is moluid-magnify. Dun used to praise makes the
person more than they are, bigger, better, braver and more noble.
For example, the following poem by an unknown author addressed to James
(Skmas) son of Angus. He was one of Clainn Domhnaill living in Islay and Kintyre
around 1600, according to various historical references and Bergin's estimated date
for the poem. The poet asks James to try to help fiee Ireland fkom English
persecution. He praises James in the highest terms.
...Fragrant blossom of Clann Domhnaill,
comely stag of Inis Fail.
fawn of the doe from the land of Mull,
sun of the school of Magh Mail...

Ultimately the chief or king is magnified out of the human realm altogether.
and into the mythic, cosmological one.

To accomplish each man‘s counsel.
...Deacair thra,gt? thn dad bhrosdach,
dod bhais leabhair lingios chrich,
a mhlir cliachda Chlair Logha,
hriathra caigh do chora a gcrich...31
Here, James is associated with the god Lugh. When one reads this kind of
poem, the kind that the$Zid and Welsh bards wrote for their lords, one would think
that these were either the greatest rulers in the world or that the bards w-ere the
greatest toadies. I think that neither is likely to be true.
Rather, I think that thefilid sought to magically amplify the qualities they
praised in their lords. Invoking an archetypal figure, such as a great sheltering tree that
links the worlds and supports the lives of all the forest creatures living in and around
it, they bound the ruler to its archetypal qualities.”
Of course this works on a purely practical level as well. If a bard has just
finished singing of his lord’s generosity, he would look very mean indeed if he failed
to give a generous gift-especially to the bard. To fail to be generous is to invite the
bard’s cuse.
SATIRISATION
To be satirised in an honour based culture robs one of the basic currency of all
social interactions? To be known as stingy, incompetent or uncouth can quickly, or
even instantly, destroy personal power.
For example, when Coirpre mac Etaine theJili went to visit Bres, the half
Fomirian king of the Tuatha De, he might have been braced for a bad time. The story
tells us that no matter how often the Tuatha De visited Bres, their knives were not
greased, nor did their breaths smell of ale. His reception was even worse than he
might have imagined, however. He was shown to a small dark outlying building with
no fire or furnishings. They brought him three small cakes on a little disk-and they
were dry.

164
Upon leaving the following day, he was not pleased. He then made what some
sources call the first satire in Ireland, saying “Without food quickly on a dish, without
cow’s milk on which a calf grows, Without a man’s habitation after darkness remains,
without paying a company of storytellers-let that be Bres’ condition.” He concluded
simply “Bres‘ prosperity no longer exists’‘ (Ni.fiZ a main trb Bresi), and it was
0 Cathasaigh has compared this incident of native satire or cier with the
maldacht or curse used by the clergy. In Acallamh nu Sendrach St. Patrick curses an
unrighteous, ungenerous king. Like Coirpre’s curse. St. Patrick’s takes the form “of
an incantatory verse wound round the name of the king.” This clearly suggests magic,
as does the fact that both maldacht and aer were quite effective. In Coirpre‘s case. the
epic battle of Moytura, deposing Bres and destroying many of the Formire, followed
on fiom his uer. In St. Patrick’s case the king was also deposed?
The effect of satirisation in the form of the spell called the gZam dicend. was
considered worse than physical death? The threat to unleash the singers aided tax
collection. One King, Eochaid of Connacht, was one eyed but ripped his remaining
eye out rather than be ~atirised.~’
The power of this invective should not be seen as a pure literary convention.
The “ritual sanctions available to churchmen and .fiZiS’ were still ”recognised and
invoked as instruments of public order in 16’ century Ireland? For example, 0’
Donnel of Tyrconnel and O’Connor of Sligo made a treaty in 1539. Archbishop
Tuan and other clerics appeared as guarantors, promising to excommunicate
O‘Connor if he broke the treaty and three members of the poetic families Ward and
O’Clery undertook to satirise him at O’Donnel’s behest?’
Incidents of satire both come forward in history to relatively recent times
and go back to more ancient times. Close Indo-European parallels would seem to
indicate that Coirpre‘s satirisation of Bres has archaic parallels. In Vedic India people
prayed that the singers spare them fiom their attacks. In Germanic as in Irish
tradition the attacks could raise welts and rashes and lead to death.

165
The songs had magical power-not just by virtue of their content, but by
their cadence. metre. rhythm, rhyme and most important, melody. This helps
explain why some Germanic and Irish songs not containing satiric content, but
sung with malicious intent, could harm. In fact, commonalties of metre between
Vedic, Greek, Irish and Slavic verses suggest that singing invective songs derives
from common Indo-European tradition4’
Of course, Indo-European traditions are also heroic traditions, which brings
us to the next use of power: duels to prove shamanic prowess.
SHAMANIDCUELS
Duelling is a frequent shamanic occupation. These duels may involve wars of
words, magical incantation, spiritual battle, and spiritually enhanced physical battle.
The pay&of the South American Tukano tribe lie in trance while their spirits shoot
each other with lightning, attack each other in the forms of serpents or jaguars. and
build stone walls round each others heart‘s to make their world smaller and smaller.
As a defence, one can become a fly to escape, but that shrinks his universe to the size
of an orange. and the shaman is lost f~rever.~’
This calls to mind the famous transformations of Cerridwen and Gwion Bach.

bird, she a hawk, he a fish, she an otter and so on, until she eats him as a chicken
eating a piece of grain and gives birth to him.42One Chukchee shaman asked what
form the other would fight him in. “Into a falcon.” He responded. The second became
a great auk and the battle ensued?
Many of the poems attributed to Taliesin’s later career as it is depicted the
imply shamanistic duels, or challenge other poets, although he has no direct
dialogue with them in the literature. (At least none where they get to respond. as in
Nede and Ferchertne’s poetic duel in the Immacullum in da Thuarad.)j4

casts a slur on the skilled one shall not have mead.” (Nyt ef caraf amiyssonyat; 1’
geibyl keluyd ny meued med.) He says “I am a leader, I am a sage in poetic contest..‘
(WyfZZyw, wyfsyw amrysson.) His leadership is clearly based, at least in part, on
shamanic gnosis. He says, “I know the gifts of inspiration when it flows, I know about
payments to a skilled man, about propitious days, about a joyful life, about the
customs of the fortress.” ( G o p y ndedyf rudeu / Awen pan deffreu / Am geluyd tuleu, //
Am detwyd dieu, / A m buched ara, / A m oesseu yscorua.) 45 As I showed in the last
chapter, the word awen probably denotes the ecstatic state of shamanic trance.
There are many other magical duels in Celtic tradition which mirror those in
shamanic cultures. They can range from a “war of words” to hexing. In one example.
Marbh shames the avaricious poets in Tromddm Gziaire, in revenge for the loss his
probably totemic pig, discussed below? Another example is the contest between the
two.filid in Immacalam in da Thuarad or Colloquy o f the Two Sages mentioned in the
last chapter .47
Here, Ferchertne is ollave of Emain Macha when the young Nede comes to
contest for the role. The text describes him as “Nede, son of Adnae of Connaught,
or he is of the Tuatha De Danann.”48After a lengthy and mythically fascinating war
of words, Nede flings himself under Ferchertne’s feet and acknowledges him as
senior, but Ferchertne tells him to keep the ollaveship.
A similarly friendly end is reached in other shamanic duels. For example.
the h i t shamans Titqatsaq and Muraoq met on a spirit journey when they were
both flying about in the sky like birds. Muraoq came too near Titqatsaq and they
collided, knocking Titqatsaq to the ice. Muraoq went to help, calling his helping
spirits to heal his friend. Upon Titqatsaq’s recovery, however, he rammed Muraoq.
With slight reluctance, Titqatsaq helped Muraoq in turn, due to their f r i e n d ~ h i p . ~ ~
An interesting point to make here is that shamanic figures such as Cu
Chulainn do not just use their powers against other humans. In fact, Cu Chulainn
battles quite an assortment of spirits. In Fled Bricrend he fought the malicious female

spirits, the geniti glinne. He was almost defeated when his charioteer Loeg, began to
mock him.He said, “You pitiable weakling, you one eyed sprite, gone are you valour
and prowess when phantoms destroy you.” ( ‘ a midach thruag a siriti lethguill
dochdid do gal 7 do gaisced in tan urtrochta not malartat.) 50 CG Chulainn then
became enraged and hacked them up.
Later in the same tale, when Cu Chulainn, Loegaire and Conall are
contesting for the champion‘s portion. Loegaire and Conall refuse to abide by
Medb and Ailill’s decision. Bude says that there is one who would dare to judge
them, and it is implied, make that judgement stick. This is Uath mac Imoman. Uath
means horror. Imoman combines the intensive imb with omun, fear.” Thurneyssen
takes ziath back to an archaic Irish root in “0th’ which can in turn be related to the
Old Norse Odr, meaning raving or possessed. The name Odin also derives fiom this
root.”
Uath has druidic powers, which should not surprise us, since judging was
originally a druidic function. He is clearly a supernatural being, and, like Cu
Chulainn, is called a sirite. He is called this because “of his capacity to form
himself into a multitude of shapes..’” Therefore, although sirite is translated as
“sprite,“ above, a more appropriate translation might be “shapeshifter.“
As Sayers notes, “There is a permeability between hero and supernatural
opponents that is doubtless traceable to archaic belief. The Norse berserkir and
shape-shifters, and their tie to Odinn invite comparison.“ I will go deeper into this
comparison in chapter five, because I think there is strong evidence that Cu
Chulainn’s riastrad may represent a form of trance possession.
In the later “beheading game” scenario of Fled Bricrend, Uath becomes a
sort of spirit teacher to Cu Chulainn, and also reveals him as the true champion of
Ulster. Though his duel for supremacy with Conall and Loegaire begins over his
personal status, ultimately, Cu Chulainn acts because Ulster will be dishonoured if
no one take up Uath’s challenge. In this tale, and on many other occasions, he uses
his power in the classically shamanic way of fighting for his community.

SHAMANIBCATTLES
I have already mentioned Mac Roth’s use to Medb and Ailill in her war
against Ulster, when he surveys the enemy troops on a spirit journey.” Another
example of a shamanic figure fighting for their community is that of Mog Roith in
Forhuis Droma Damhgaire. mentioned in the last chapter in relation to the word
sum.
This tale provides classic examples of a shamanic seance and spirit flight?
While Mog Roith does fight for his community, he does not do it for fiee. His king,
Fiacha, hires him at great expense on Munster’s behalf to defeat King Cormac Mac
Art’s army. He is worth it. There are “no enchantments that he cannot
accomplish.. .whether on this side or the other [of the worlds], because none other of
all the inhabitants of Ireland, has ever been in flesh and bone to learn magic in the
realm of the fairies save he.””
During his combat with the opposing armies, he calls for his shamanic
equipment, his encennach, his bull’s hide cape, his trident and his roth ramach in
which he can travel like a boat, items I’ll discuss fkrther in chapter four.
Munster’s troops asked him to cast down a magic hill raised by Cormac’s
druids. Mog Roith ”invoked his god and his power and grew so tall that he was
scarcely less high than the hill, and his head broadened so that it was as large as the
high hill crowned with oak woods, the sight of which brought terror to all those
who looked upon him.”57Compare this with the way the Yamana ye‘kamus of
Tierra del Fuego uses his shamanic power to “blow himself up to the size of a
mountain ridge to shield his patients fkom the attacks of hostile shamans. If the
hostile sorcerer proves the stronger, he pushes this ‘spiritual mountain’ aside; if he
is unsuccesshl at this, he must withdraw..‘js
When in his giant state, Mog Roith also goes through a distortion which
reminds one a bit of Cu Chulainn’s. In Mog Roith’s case, he became rough and

spiny like a pine. both his eyes bulge. and his knees turn backwards and heels
A similar process of disjointing happens in Australian shamanism-a
point I will return to in chapter five?
In another episode, Mog Roith “rose into the air and the heavens at the
same time as the fires and he started to beat the air, so as to turn the fires to the
North, [against the enemy] all the while chanting this spell, ’I make the druid’s
arrow...”’? Here he shows both shamanic power over fire and the power of spirit
flight.62The arrow reference is also of interest. Herodotus says, “For the tale of
Abaris, who is reported to have been a Hyperborean, I do not vouch for: how the
arrow carried him while fasting fkom all food about the earth.”“
One reference to a purely magical battle occurs in the Lebor Gabula Erenn.
The one-legged. one eyed, Fomoire battle Partholon. Some sources say that the
Fomoire were destroyed. This is obviously incorrect, since they arise to plague
future Irish emigres. Other sources. however, say that during the week-long battle
“not a man was slain there, for it was a magic battle.’*
European magical battles have been explored by Carlo Ginzburg in his
often quoted work, The Night Battles: Witchcrafi and Agrarian Cults in the J61h
and I7lh Centuries. Klaniczay makes a point that even Eliade failed to note in his
commentary on Ginzburg’s work-that the activities of the benendante bear a
strong resemblance to classical shamanism and have parallels in Hungarian and
other European cultures.65
We find many similarities to the benendante and connections to many
shamanic themes we have looked at in the Celtic context in the Slovenian and
Istrian kresniks. Their election to their role was indicated by their having been born
with a caul a caul. The caul in Celtic tradition is also often linked to shamanic
abilities. For example, the great judge Morann was born with a caul which was
ritually washed off by the ninth wave. When it was removed, Morann sang a

religious chant that Chadwick associates with the technique of the j X d , dichetal.
discussed below.66
The kresnik “fell asleep” and a big black fly called Parina went out of his
mouth to fight the witches. This has parallels to a Scottish incident of spirit travel
and soul loss, described below. The sleeping bodies of kresniks must not be turned
while they slept or they would die. The importance of not moving a shaman in
trance is stressed in Sami tradition and exactly the same caution appears in
Cormac’s glossary in relation to performing the imbas forosnai ritual, also
discussed below.‘”
As the benendante fought the witches, the kresnik fought the kudZak (a
sorcerer) or the strigos (witches). The Hungarian taltbs has a rivalry with malefic
witches, and has been compared with the kresniks in other ways. It has been argued
variously that the tultos is a descendant of the Siberian shamans or is specific to
Hungarian culture.
Klaniczay suggests that the clashes that later developed into a good versus
evil battle between shamans and “witches” were originally simply battles between
the shamans of different clans or tribes-and this is where a particularly interesting
Celtic comparison comes in.’*
The zduhuc‘, male sorcerers in Serbia and Bosnia carried out spiritual
combat against other tribes in favour of their own. The zduhac‘ typically fought in
the form of two animals, one light in colour, one dark. mostly goats, bulls or
horses. The tultos also fought amongst themselves in the shupe of buZZs of opposing
colours, i.e., black-white, red-blue, light-dark. (Italics mine.) Although the tultcis
sometimes fought as stallions, goats, pigs, blue and red fire balls, fire wheels, metal
wheels or birds, the Hungarian scholar Dioszegi devoted a whole article to the
“taltos bulls,” because there were so many examples that they seemed to be the
taltos’s favorite shape to fight in.69
One cannot fail to see the comparison with the battle of the bulls in the
Tain. The Reeses have already noted that their fight “has some points of similarity

with accounts of shaman
The combatants were originally the wizard swineherds of Ochall king of the
sid of Connacht and Bodb king of the sid of Munster respectively, so like the some
of the shamanic combatants above, they were fiom different tribes. They were first
friends then rivals. They appeared first as ravens who prophesied the slaughter they
would cause, then fought as water beasts, and when they fought “fiery swords
darted out of each other’s jaws and reached the sky.” They then became human
champions again, then demons, then water worms again. When taken out of the
water one tells Medb to marry Ailill. Fiachna mac Dairi takes the other from a river
in Cuailnge and prophesies the fight with Connacht’s bull. Both are swallowed by
cows and reborn as bulls, one dark, one light, like the taltbs bull^.^'
The BattZe of Findchorad gives a highly ritualised picture of the bulls’
battle, supporting the argument that it is a shamanic ~onflict.~W’hen the troops are
gathered. Medb. Ailill and Eochaid mac Luchta ask their druids to prophecy how it
will go. The druids perform a ceremony that sounds related to both turbfeis and
imbasforosnai. They sacrifice dogs, pigs and cats to the gods, and then lie on a bull
hide over rowan hurdles with their heads facing north, the direction traditionally
associated with magic. Their gods tell them to bring the two bulls together and the
side whose champion won would win. Here the druids clearly act as shamans,
sacrificing and engaging in visionary practices to answer questions for their tribe.
Eochaid asks what form the bulls have. Mac Roth says that the white bull is
*‘Whiteand red, a lad of the herd of A?’ (Mucaomh bhziar n-Aoi).’” White and red
are of course the classical Othenvorldly colours, and ai means poetic inspiration.
The Donn of Cuailnge is described as singing, and called “the greatest ox of Dil,
guardian bull of the world,” (Moamh damh nDile[nn] Diond damh nd~mhan).’~
Guardian of the world, of the cosmic order, is perhaps the central shamanic role, as
I will discuss in chapter six.

beings appear fiom the Sid of Bodb to comment. The druids see and converse with
these spectres, proclaiming that one of their poems is beautiful. Here again the
druids act in a clearly shamanic role, seeing other world beings and describing their
doings to their people.
The way the poet described the bulls gave Dobbs some conhsion in his
translation. He says that one section of the poem relating to the Donn is probably
an interpolation, in part because these lines “clearly have nothing to do with a
However, I would argue that this is due to the fact that the lines are about a
shapeshifting human shaman, battling with the shaman of a rival tribe in bull form.
Of course, as in the Tain, battle may be to the death
KILLING
Killing is one of the most straight-forward uses of shamanic power. Whether
the shaman uses his power to become possessed by a lethal spirit. like the Norse
herserkirs or “points the bone,” as in Aboriginal shamanism, killing is an unequivocal
manifestation of power. It can also seem one of the most divine powers, the most
impressive, the most mysterious. On a visceral level, the power to kill may seem more
God-like and mysterious than the power to heal. It is certainly more fiightening.
Some traditions would define using spiritual power to kill as “black” magic.
although there is a great deal of variation of belief here. Like physical killing, it may
be considered justifiable or even desirable in certain contexts. If a tribe is attacked by
another tribe they might use magic to kill in self-defense. Warrior shamans, just like
warriors ofthe physical realm, can see their activities as killing rather than murder. A
moral examination of the use of sorcery to kill is beyond my scope here, so in a
nutshell, I will define “black” magic as magic intended to harm another being or
manipulate their fiee will.
One reason black magic is so deeply feared in traditional cultures is that it is
notoriously hard to defend against. No amount of temporal power makes one proof
against sorcery. Even the great King Cormac was said to have been murdered by the
magic of In some versions, he is killed because he refuses to worship their

173
gods, in others, because he rehses to worship them as gods, a point I will return to in
chapter five.77
While the druids’ spell above worked without any physical contact with
Cormac, another way to use shamanic power lethally is to use it to enhance physical
abilities in combat.
ARTSOF WAR
Spiritual and physical combat are always paired to one degree or another in
shamanic cultures. In some cultures, the warrior role is by far the most important for
the shaman, out weighing that of healer. There are plenty of accounts of this sort of
sharnanic activity amongst South American tribes?
Warriors want all the help they can get. No member of a shamanic culture
would go into combat without the advantage given by invoking totemic animals and
other guardian spirits. These forces may be marshalled against other tribes fkom the
same culture, or against foreign invaders.
The results can be impressive. When the Romans confionted the chanting
Druids and black robed Druidesses carrying flaming torches at Anglesea, they were
momentarily, though not permanently, unmanned.79 The Zulus famously fared better
against the British in one decisive battle. It has been asserted that they used trance
practices including drug use to induce a state of “battle fury” and defeat the British. 8o
Like the Zulus, the Ulstermen apparently used shamanistic techniques in
combat. Cu Chulainn appears on several occasions in hisferg, or magical heat, and
has to be cooled with vats of water. As mentioned in chapter one, Eliade concluded
that Cu Chulainn’s ferg meant that he had gained possession of sacred power.8’
This state is not special to Cu Chulainn, however.
The Tain repeatedly depictsferg as a skill that renders warriors invincible.*’
The more experienced warriors are particularly good at it? Ferg means “anger,

I 74
wrath or ferocity,” yet there is good reason for seeing-ferg as a specific skill rather
than emotional state as I noted on in the introduction.
For one thing, whileferg is described as unique to the Ulster warriors as a
group, warriors as described in Irish literature all have the capacity to become
enraged. Therefore, .ferg must be different fkom normal rage. Sadowska discusses
this skill in detail in relation to the Tuin.
On two occasions prior to the battle Fergus specifically alerts Medb to
the fact that once.ferg came upon an Ulster warrior. there would be no match for
him (TBC I1 4225-7, 4362-5). This mysterious martial condition was apparently
unique to the Ulstermen, and made them invincible to armies both in Ireland and
Albu (Scotland) (TBC I1 4362-5). According to Mac Roth, it was fighting inferg
that increased the effectiveness and strength of the Ulster army so much that it
offset even significant numerical superiority of the enemy (TBC 11 4221-3).
Medb, however, failed to understand that unique martial quality, which her troops
could not avail of. She counted on her own “goodly warriors and goodly
soldiers,” dagluich 7 degciic, many of whom were undoubtedly present among the
Connachta, and dismissed Fergus’s warning with a sneering remark: “Ni dknam
robrig de,” bar Medh. “We make little account of it,” said Medb (TBC IT 4224).
Medb’s contempt forferg may show that her warriors, “good” as they were, were
nonetheless unfamiliar with some peculiar fighting method which utilised
extreme emotional arousal. The question then arises whether ferg-based
combative skills were the hidden asset that stood behind Conchobar‘s bold
declaration about his likely victory, buaid, in the forthcoming battle.84
Fcrg is consciously invoked as a martial tactic on various occasions. For
example, in Foglaim Con Culainn, the hero applies-ferg tactically in his combat
with Cuar. Scathach’s son. He lets Cuar wear himself out with repeated attacks.
Then when Cum is exhausted, Cu Chulainn induces-ferg and defeats C ~ a r . ’F~erg

the earth on one occasion, and right an entire house on another?
While Cu Chulainn‘s prowess in combat is well known, his lesser known
powers as a healer are revealed by another incident in the Tuin. In an encounter with
the Mom’gan, mentioned earlier. she tricks him into healing her fiom wounds he has
inflicted, because he is the only one who can.”
Finn is likewise both healer and killer. Renowned as a warrior, he has the
power to heal anyone who drinks water fkom his hands, a power he famously
withholds fiom the mortally wounded Diarmuid?
Saints, as well as pagan heroes, are described as having powers to both heal
and kill. St. Columba heals in various accounts, but also curses. Anyone who
disturbed a certain bell’s sanctuary would die within a year by his curse, and he also
cursed a man who would not give him land.89
St. Patrick magically murdered some of King Loegaire’s druids in the famous
account of him starting a “rival” fire to Loegairs‘s at Tara to spread the fire of
Christianity throughout Ireland. However, he heals other people.
I think these examples relate to a root idea that having power has to do with
having the ability to hold polarities, a point 1‘11 return to in chapter six. Deities like
Lugh, who are described as having great power in Celtic tradition, are also ambivalent
in that they are never purely “good.” For example, Lugh defeats the Fomoire, the
forces of chaos, yet he is half Fomoire himself. He uses a one-eyed, one-legged trance
posture that mimics the Fomoire in the process of killing his own grandfather. He is
good and bad, a hero and a kinslayer.
Needless to say, the implications of this theory may be profound in terms of
our understanding of the nature of deity, heroism and what constitutes “goodness”
itself in Celtic tradition. I do not have the space to do hll justice to these ideas here,
but they certainly constitute an area for hture research. For now, I will move on to
shamanic healing.

HEALING
In some ways, even in shamanic cultures, many kinds of “shamanic healing“
are only shamanic because they are done by shamans and based on information they
received fiom the spirits. This makes it difficult to be clear about what is shamanic
and what is not.
For example, Davis and others have commented on the incredibly precise
knowledge of medicinal and hallucinogenic plants that South American shamans
possess. While healing with herbs is not the exclusive province of the shaman, these
shamans attribute their knowledge to their shamanic experience?
This sort of knowledge is mentioned in a vignette in the Cath Muige Tuireud.
Miach magically heals Nuadu by replacing his lost hand first with a silver one, then
with one made of flesh. His father, Dian Cecht, is jealous of Miach’s healing abilities
and kills him. Three hundred and sixty five healing plants grow from his grave. His
sister arranges them according to their properties, but Dian Cecht’s jealousy
overcomes his goodwill to humanity again, and he mixes them up so that no one
knows what they are good for, “unless Spirit showed them later?’
The Tuutha Dk’s physicians combine a herbal bath with magical chant to
restore the dead to life? In the same way that some shamanic qualities of the druids
seem to have come down in thefilid, others may have come down in the families of
hereditary physicians.
One term used to describe druidic doctors in ancient texts is-fuithliaig which
seems to combine root words for “seer.‘ and “leech.” These druid doctors were said to
have knowledge of medicinal herbs and other sorts af treatment. As Mary Beith points
out in her book 7he Heuling Threads. it is well nigh impossible to untangle the
physical elements in Scottish traditional cures f?om the metaphy~ical.’~
One method of determining if the healing is shamanic is if it seems likely it
was done by a shaman. Therefore, if someone gains power via shamanic means, one
might call the healings they perform shamanic. Some of these ways of gaining power
fall more under initiatory illness, already discussed.

177
There are references in the later folklore, particularly in some of the witch trial
accounts, of a person acquiring the power to heal by being supernaturally healed of
the same illness herself? For example, in 1597 in Lothian, Jonet Steill was accused of
witchcraft. She had been healed of the plague, and thus gained the power to heal, by
being cured by a strange man. Bessie Dunlop claimed to know the Queen of the
Fairies and received all her healing knowledge fi-om Thomas Reid, who had died in
1547. She was tried and burned in 1576.95These healer figures are sometimes referred
to as being fiom the land of the Fairies, particularly in the earlier Scottish cases, and
of course are later classed as diab01ical.~~
One 1720 account of a female tultos. Mrs. Antal, said she lay dead for nine
days, and visited God in heaven, and was only sent back to heal. God even affixed a
certificate to that effect between her shoulder blades. The tultds, like the benendante
and Scottish healers, frequently rehsed, even under torture, to say that their practices
were diab~lical.~'
I will look at two facets of shamanic healing below. One is the removal of
power that is there and should not be, like a spiritual parasite and the second is
bringing back power that should be there and is not, like a soul part.
EXTRACTION
Power that is there and should not be may be a parasitical or possessing entity,
or a sort of spiritual poisoning, or "fairy dart." It may manifest as a definable physical
disease, or general lethargy and debility. This is treated by extraction, that is,
removing the offending thing.
The "power intrusion'' may be seen in many ways, it commonly appears as an
insect, voracious serpent or reptile.98One Celtic example may be when Miach and his
brother Ormiach discover a chafer gnawing Nuadu fiom within his silver arm. They

178
remove the chafer, and replace his silver arm with a flesh one?
The intrusion may be seen as a spiritual poisoning. On Lewis, they have a
wealth of charms against “adder bite.” Interestingly, there are no adders on the island,
which leads one to suppose that this is not a physical poisoning.
Treatments for the evil eye bear some resemblence to classical shamanic
extraction healing. Prayers to remove the evil eye speak of taking a malign power out
of the sufferer and putting that power on or in other things. In shamanism it is
common to put the malign power, sometimes referred to as a ‘power intrusion” in
water.I”’ Because fire and physical heat are associated with power. placing the
intrusion in water is believed to disempower it, to cool it down. One Scottish spell to
remove the evil eye treats it much as a shaman would treat a power intrusion. I
mentioned the part of this ‘exorcism’ in the introduction where the practitioner
invokes elemental powers over the evil eye. They then go on to remove the evil eye
and place it elsewhere.

Elizabethan source says that fairies are suspected of causing an illness if it began with
a fall or mishap in an open place. If a man falls sick after such a mishap, they call on a
“woman skilfid in that kind,” and she goes to the place where it happened to
determine the cause. It seems likely that the trip is to see if there are any fairies about
the place. If she diagnoses uesain, she treats it by speaking “an odd prayer” in the ear
of the afflicted person, and dumping hot coals in a bucket of water.’”
One healer also seemed to display a typically shamanic response during and
after various kinds of healing work. She used the “charm of the thread” to cure evil
eye, and often felt ill afterwards and took to bed for days. Many shamans feel ill after
extraction. She was also a midwife. and said that ‘when called to attend” she felt
herself “helpless in the grasp-the fiiendly grasp” of a power that controlled her, and
attributed her success in that line to this power.’04
RESTORIVPGOWER:SOULRETRIEVAL
Another healing method is that of restoring power that should be there and is
not. This could be a totem animal or other guardian spirit, or a part of the person’s
soul. In most shamanic cultures there is the view that souls can be fragmented in times
of trauma, as a defence mechanism so all of the person’s soul is not injured.”’ It m y
also be stolen. The shaman must then return the soul parts to the person.
There may be a subconscious reference to this kind of idea in how people
refer to trauma. They may say, “I was never the same after I fell out of the boat and
nearly drowned.” Or, they may say, “When my wife left she took a piece of me with
her.”
I have not found explicit references to soul retrieval as a healing method in
the later folklore-although references do exist to soul loss as a form of spiritual
illness.
One reference to a possible soul retrieval that failed is the story of Thomas
Kirk, the famous minister who researched fairies.’%He “died” on a fairy hill, but
told a relative in a vision that he was not dead, but imprisoned in the Otherworld.
103 Quinn 1966. p. 87 104 Mackinnon. 1908-9. pp. 343-344
106 See Kirk 1893
105 Inwan.1993, pp. 1-5



180
He told his relative that he would appear at his own son’s christening. When he
appeared, his relative was to throw an iron knife over his head, and he would be
freed. He appeared as promised, but the relative was too stunned to remember to do
as asked, so Kirk was lost forever.
From the references to transmigration, there is evidence that a view existed
that the soul was immortal.’07There are also references to an external soul, kept in
an egg, for example, showing that the soul could be separated from the body. These
stories also make the point that destroying the egg or other object can damage or
destroy the soul. Therefore we see that a soul can be thought to exist outside the
body and can be damaged or destroyed.
One of the most interesting soul loss references is of a man whose soul
“wandered through the regions of time and space.” Upon its return. it “alighted on
the face of the man in the form of a bee or butterfly.” and was about to enter its
home in the body through the pathway of the mouth when a neighbour killed it.
One version of the story says the body of the man died when his soul was killed;
another version says that the man’s body “lingered long in the land ajier the soul
M ~ dYeud, busying itself up and down the earth.” (Italics mine.)’”
Although in this circumstance the soul was felt to have been killed rather than
simply lost, there seems to be a connection to the idea of soul loss here, whatever the
precise method. When the Chukchee perform soul-retrieval, they capture the soul in
the form of a fly or bee and may re-introduce it through the mouth.‘09
There are also references to rescuing hostages held in the Otherworld. After
defeating a Connacht prince, he gives Cu Chulainn a “destiny” that he shall not know
peace until he discovers what has taken the three sons of Doel D e m i t out of their
country.’”Ultimately he sets off in a boat belonging to the king of Alban’s son This
prince replaces him at court.
An immram of sorts follows, as Cu Chulainn goes to various magical islands
with his friends Lugaid and Loeg, in search of Doel D e m i t ’ s sons. Finally they
reach the island where they are held and Cu Chulainn does magical battle with the

giants there. He reaches peace with one, and kills the other, Echaid Glas. When he
does, Doe1 Dermait's three sons and all Echaid's other prisoners flock out to bathe in
the giant's blood. They were all healed of their ailments (the ailments are not
specified) and returned home. as does Cu Chulainn, loaded with treasures fiom the
other giant.
The Preiddeu Annwn, attributed to Taliesin, gives us a famous example of a
perilous journey to retrieve things fiom the Otherworld."' Haycock calls it "the most
valuable source we have for the dark underside of the early tradition, for the oracular,
pseudo-learned facets of early poetic activity in Wales."' I 2 She notes the shamanistic
parallels to this journey, where Taliesin and Arthur's company go to seize a magical
cauldron, and quite possibly to rescue the prisoner Gwair.'I3
Gwair is chained in a dungeon that he alone has entered.'I4This may be of
some significance, because shamans doing soul retrieval often find the lost soul part
in a prison of the person's own making. The traumatised soul part is "stuck" in the
moment of trauma, re-living it repeatedly as ghosts are said to re-enact the moment of
their death. The shaman fiees them when he returns the soul part to the person who
has lost it."' Gwair's dungeon may represent this kind of personal hell in the poem.
. The expedition to retrieve Gwair and the cauldron is made overseas in a boat.
The fortress they plunder is on an island, making it likely that the dungeon Gwair
inhabits would be under the sea. The undersea Otherworld is of course well known in
Celtic tradition, but it also appears in the traditions of various shamanistic cultures,
including in soul retrieval accounts.
Inuit shamans retrieve souls either h m the heavenly realm or h m under the
sea. The ordeals the shaman goes through to retrieve the soul may be depicted as
dramatic and dangerous. Nootka shamans attribute soul-theft to marine spirits, and the
shaman must journey to the bottom of the sea and fight ghosts to get the soul. When
they return, they are often wet and bleeding at the nose and temples. They also show

make the process dramatic. They may create a physical opening into the ground and
imitate crossing a stream, miming their struggle with the
Emphasising the hardship and danger of the process emphasises the reality of
the process, its great value, and of course, the value of the shaman. Only the shaman
knows the Otherworld landscape, and therefore, only the shaman can know where to
find the lost soul. Taliesin emphasis his knowledge of Otherworld beings and
landscapes throughout the poem. He mocks the Christian monks who do not possess
such knowledge. Indeed, to a shaman, one who claims to act as a guide to the
Otherworld without basic knowledge of its territory would be considered laughable.
One of the shaman's functions to his culture is revealing selected aspects of
his Otherworld knowledge to his community.
REVEALING
Shamans of all cultures act as revealers because they can step outside the
limitations of time, space and physical perception. They may see into the hture,
discover who is magically causing an illness in the present, or reveal a breach of taboo
in the past responsible for a misfortune. They act as mythographers, building the
cosmology of their communities through their spirit journeys. Obviously no person
was physically present at the creation of humanity by the gods, so these kinds of
stories come from shamans who can go back through time to recover information.
One well known example fi-om Old Irish sources is the story of the Tuin's
recovery byfiZid in Tromdam Guuire."7The-fiZidare one of the two classes of people
we can most readily see as shamanic in Celtic culture, the other being the druids.
Eliade himself identified-filidwith shamanistic prophets, and as the scholar who wrote
the first definitive work on shamanism, his opinion is invaluable."'
In Tromdam Gziaire, a group offiZid led by chief poet Senchan Torpeist pay
an unwelcome visit to the generouq king of Connacht, Guaire mac Colmain. These
filid extort MarM's pet pig. This was a bad move not only because Marbin was the
king's brother, but because he and his pig are both supernaturally powerfbl figures.

183
The pig was described as being a herdsman, musician, physician and
messenger. Marbh was described as chief seer of heaven and earth.’’9Swineherds
often take on an othenvorldly roles in Celtic myths, as at the beginning of the Tuin Bb
CuaiZnge, and fiom Marbiin’s description of his boar in the Yellow Book uf Lecan, he
clearly fulfils functions beyond those of a “pet.”
When I return fiom the swine at night, and the skin is torn off my feet by
the briars at Glen-a-Scail, he comes to me and rubs his tongue over my foot, and he
goes after the swine...He is musician to me, for when I am anxious to sleep I give
him a stroke with my foot, and he lies on his back with his belly uppermost and
sings me a humming tune, and his music is more grateful to me than that of a sweet
toned harp in the hands of an accomplished minstrel.
From the above it seems that this pig hlfils a totemic fimction, and when the
poets destroy him, Marban is understandably vengeful.’’l He enters into verbal
combat with them. Marbin, like Mongin, has questionable poetic pedigree but
“overwhelmingly convincing” authority.”’ In both cases I would suggest that the
reason for this authority is their contact with the Otherworld.
Marban proves his power by revealing the other poets’ ignorance of the
origins and proper performance of their art.”3 The final straw is when the poets
confess they do not remember the Tain. Marbiin forbids them to practice their art until
they recover it. Tellingly. the onZy way they can fulfil their proper hnction asjilid is
through shamanic means-by communicating with Fergus’ spirit and receiving the
tale afiesh.
This is done by “f-ing against God” and asking that Fergus be brought back
to life to tell the story. In the last chapter I showed that fasting is a well known means
of changing consciousness. In this chapter, above, I have also shown that shamans do
not shrink fiom battling even the gods to accomplish their will. They write the Tain
down on the hide of Ciariin of Clonmacnois’ COW."^ Elsewhere it says that anyone

who lies upon it goes “straight to heaven,” echoing the tarbfeis and related journeying
methods discussed in the last chapter. All in all, this incident yields a potent
combination of shamanic themes.
As we have seen, in combat and at other times, Cu Chulainn exhibits an
assortment of supernatural abilities. Another example occurs when he leaves a withe
thrown on a pillar stone inscribed with an ogham message to Connacht‘s army. The
Tain says he will know if it has been disturbed, but there is no indication how. The
means are therefore likely to be magical, meaning that he, like a typical shaman, can
be aware of what is happening beyond the range of his physical sight.”‘
While the revealing function, like spiritual healing, is not the exclusive
province of shamans, it tends to be predicated on a shamanistic world view.
For example, the shaman-oracle, Maria-JOG, a Brazilian Macumba priestess
said, “Everything can serve prophecy, You only have to pay attention. The universe is
full of signs...The shape of clouds, the way birds fly. the sounds of nature. an
unexpected meeting-all these transmit a message that expresses the will of the gods.
The universe is a whole that f ~tosgether logically and maintains itself and develops in
a meaningful way.-1L26
Therefore, although techniques such as ndudcirucht, divination fiom the
shapes of clouds, or divination based on the movements of ravens and wens are not
explicitly shamanic, they’re based on a shamanistic idea of the immanence of the
divine in all things and their interconnection.“’ Some of these ideas can be found to
make purely practical sense. For example, birds hear infi-asounds,below the range of
human hearing, and so can hear noise from storm fi-ontshundreds of miles away, so
watching birds’ behaviour can enable one to know something about the weather, just
as many ancient cultures professed.‘28So, for practical and spiritual reasons, there are
no inanimate objects in shamanic cultures. They can all “speak.”
In a Celtic example, Niall of the Nine Hostage’s grandson, Breccan, was
trading between Scotland and Ireland with a number of coracles. They were wrecked
in the Coke Breccan whirlpool (presumably later named for the event). No one knew

their fate, however, until people brought a dog skull found on the strand to Lugaid, a
blindfili. Lugaid asked that they place the end of his wand upon it. Through the
technique of dichetal di chennaib, he saw that this was Breccan’s dog, and they had
all drowned.129This account brings us to three terms that loom large in any study of
CeItic metaphysics.
TEINMLAIDIA M,BASFOROSNAAIND D~CHETDAILCHENNAIB
Cormac and others mention three techniques that had to be learned byfilid in
ancient times, teinm laida, dichetal di chennaib and imhas.fbrosnai. These techniques
combine skills of extemporaneous recitation and poetic composition with shamanic
techniques of vision.
Chadwick has discussed these practices in detail, so here I will restrict myself
to those aspects of these techniques that seem specifically shamanic.130As discussed
in the last chapter the-filichews a piece of raw flesh fiom a pig, dog or cat, then offers
it to his spirits in the imbasforosnai ritual. He invokes his spirits, and if they do not
give him the answer immediately, he lies down, covers his eyes and others make sure
he is not disturbed. He then receives the information, although it may take as long as
three days.
This ritual has many shamanic analogues. Spirit journeys in many cultures
involve sacrifice, and all involve invoking the shaman’s helping spirits in one way or
another. Lying down in darkness is a very usual form for the shamanic journey to
take. Some cultures also place great importance on not moving the shaman when he is
away on a journey. For example, the Simi shaman was not allowed to be touched
when he was journeying. If his body was moved, he could not return.132Three days is
also a ritually significant period in shamanic cultures.
Imbas .forosnai is used to see many things not physically visible. In one
account Finn uses it to track an enemy at a distance.133In Finn and the Man in the
Tree, Finn receives imbas directly through Otherworld contact of the most violent sort

when his thumb is slammed in the door of a sid mound.’34He put his thumb in his
mouth and tasted the liquid the fairy woman spilt on it and was enlightened and began
to chant a dichetaZ.‘35The combination of references show that imbusforosnui gives
both the ability to see the unseen spiritual dimension and to hear the spirits and
communicate with them.’” In short, the ritual gives him shamanic powers.
Meyer translates dichetal di chennaib as “extempore incantation.””’ The
words used to describe this technique vary. I think that the key form may be
dichetal di chennaib nu tuaithe, extemporaneous chant from the heads o f the tribe.
This form occurs in the second of the Metrical Tractates Thurneysen published
from the books of Bullymote and Leinster. It appears in the context of describing
the three techniques thefilid had to learn in their eighth year of training, those
being imbusforosnai, teinm luidu and dichetal do chennaib nu t~uithe.‘~’
Cenn can mean “head,” but can also mean “chief’ or “leader” of a natural
or supernatural realm. Heads in Celtic tradition have well known supernatural
connotations. and the corresponding word in Welsh, penn, does as well. For
example, Pwyll becomes Penn Annwn, “Head of Annwn,” after an oracular
exchange with Arawn, lord of Annwn, and I think it is here that we may look for
the deepest reading of this term.
Amergin’s R2in is also called a cetal do ~henduib?~Towards its end, he
says “I am the god who forms a mind of fire.”’“ I think it is very likely that this
term refers to oracling. The “heads” being the gods of the tribe, who transmit
messages through their oracle. Chadwick also associates this term with the singing
done by severed heads in the tales. These heads are dead, yet not dead. This puts
them in a similar position to the shaman who, by virtue of his initiatory death is
neither fully dead nor alive. I will return to this point in chapter six.14’
I will discuss the evidence for Celtic oracular practice in detail in chapter
five. For now. I will just make the point that I think that it is possible that St.

Patrick is said to have allowed dichetal di chennaib to continue in a Christian
context precisely because it was an oracular pra~tice.’~A?n oracle can switch
allegiance fkom one deity to another. Since this ritual, unlike imbas forosnai,
involves no specifically pagan elements such as animal sacrifice, there was no
reason to stop it. An oracle can be “inspired” by the Holy Spirit as easily as by a
pagan deity.
The final term mentioned is teinm Zaida, which Meyer translates as the
“illumination of song.”i43This method seems to overlap with the other techniques
in some respects. Finn and others use the technique to identify bodies. The
incantation is also associated with severed heads in ways that suggest magical
practices.
It is generally regarded that the word tenm comes fiom the root *tep-,
meaning “heat.”ia This is, of course, the same root that gives us the Sanskrit tapas.
meaning mystically generated heat and spiritual power. This mystical heat results
in the kind of manifesting power we hear of in relation to yogis and shamans. In
India, tapas was obtained by breath control and meditating in close proximity to a
fire.’45It is intriguing that in the story of Finn’s death, his severed head is placed
close to the fire, and Chadwick theorises fiom this and other examples that this was
a custom with heads. In the stories, such heads often chant teinm Zaida. Therefore, I
would suggest that the term may mean something like the “fiery power of song,” in
that generating spiritual fire both illuminates the hidden, and gives the shaman
manifesting power.

seem to indicate that they were expected to be clear communicator's at least some of the time
ThefiZid in Tromdam Guaire can only fulfil
their proper function as poets through shamanic means-by communicatingwith Fergus' spirit and recovering the Tain. Other
sources, such as Taliesin's poems, also suggest that poetic function is predicated on Otherworld contact.
There is evidence that thefilid lost their power because they lost their abilities to receive and
transmit clear information from the
Otherworld.
I have shown various examples of sharnanic functions above. While all of
these functions are not limited to shamans, their collective presence indicates the same
range of functions shamans possess in other cultures. This is especially true in the
case of thefilid. Perhaps the most persuasive argument that the power they held in
Celtic culture derived at least in part fi-omtheir shamanic role is that they lost much of
their power over others when they ceased to perform shamanic functions.

CONCLUSIONS: THEDECLINEOF BARDIPCOWER
One of the shaman’s most important hnctions is being a clear conduit for
the spirits’ messages, an ability Taliesin may refer to when he says, “I am a poet, I
am a clear singer.” (Wyf kerdolyut, wyf keinyut c l ~ e r . )T’h~e~word kerd like creth
relates to forming and shaping. likely in a magical or semi-magical sense. as noted
in the introduction.14’
The bards andjilid obviously had many roles in Celtic culture. They made
praise poems, told stories and fulfilled other hnctions such as maintaining
genealogies. However, some stories referring to their loss of power do not refer to
any inability on their part to perform these well known, and ostensibly primary,
functions. Rather, these accounts place the blame squarely on a loss of their
abilities to both utilise visionary techniques and communicate the product of
visionary experience to the community. In a nutshell, it appears that the point when
the-filid lost their shamanic abilities was also the point when they lost what was
essential about their role in Celtic culture.
Nagy discussed the idea that audiences may have grown tired of poets
claiming prestige based on knowledge they no longer possessed in relation to the
story of the Thin ’s recovery.’48One can only speculate that the lack of clarity may
perhaps be attributed to the fact that shamanic techniques were increasingly
repressed over time. Therefore,&filidwere expected to maintain their prior level of
“inspiration” while growing increasingly cut off from their source.
The hacallam provides additional evidence for this idea.’49At the end,
Nede acknowledged Ferchertne as senior, and Ferchertne told him to keep the
ollaveship. Unfortunately for the poets, this warm and fuzzy moment of mutual
admiration came at the end of a demonstration of verbal and metaphysical prowess
that was only comprehensible to other shaman-poets. Witnessing their puzzling
display led Conchobar to ban the bards as a class fkom ever pronouncing on matters
other than bardic because no one understood a word out of their mouths.’5o

We know that some oracular utterances are deliberately or incidentally
obscure-a language of initiates. For example, in Peru, the priests fell in trance. and
upon “recovery” they gave forth the oracles in a language incomprehensible to the
~ninitiated.”’~T’his calls to mind thefordorcha, the “dark speech” of the poets, that
can be compared to shamanic sacred language world-wide. People within the culture
may accept or wonder at this use of language. Plutarch, for example, ponders the bad
quality of verse coming out of the Delphic oracles, when their inspirer is, after all,
Apollo, leader of the Muses. 152
In Kumaon in the Himalayas in modern times, people generally acknowledge
that the language of the Gods is hard to understand. However, when oracles speak in
what they consider to be a garbled, gasping way, they call it fiifi-phi$-bhiisii, “broken
up, shabby, messy, dissolving language,” and attribute it to the oracle’s impurity. One
scholar’s research assistant said that communicating with the Gods is like a telephone
call, and garbled speech is analogous to ”static on the line.””’ It may be that the Irish
saw it this way and decided that inaccurate oracles could do little harm if their
judgements were restricted to poetic matters.
After Conchobar’s pronouncement, the next clear wave of bardic
disempowerment came when St. Columba declawed the poetic institution at the
Council of Drumcett by stripping the poets of the weapons of satire and extortion, as
well as other pagan elements, and reducing their numbers. This was not entirely
without reason. The bardic orders were going around with “pot of avarice,” made of
silver held by bronze chains and gold hooks and held by nine bards. Not to contribute
was to invite satire.’54
Where Conchobar’s act seems to have been mainly about c o m n sense,
Columba’s is of a different quality. The pagan Conchobar seems to have been
concerned with oracular clarity, where St. Columba seems to have been concerned
with oracular orthodoxy and abuse of metaphysical power. The distinction is no
longer between clear and unclear, but morally acceptable and unacceptable. As
indicated by the story of St. Oran in the last chapter, all knowledge must be brought

into line with church thinking.Is’ The Irish Ziterati distinguished between sous.
knowledge acquired by Christian learning or Christian revelatory experiences, and
imbas acquired through mantic revelation, i.e., shamanic methods.’56
Of course, we cannot h l l y know all the reasons the$Zid lost their power. It
may be a combination of the reasons given above, from losing oracular clarity to
losing a shamanistic community who could understand what they were speaking
about. Thefilid might also have become such an elite group over time that they no
longer cared about communicating with those they perceived to be of lesser status.
Ferchertne and Nede clearly cared primarily for their status among other poets.
Nagy says that in Tromdam Gziaire the “poets have become hopelessly and
helplessly modern.” (Italics mine.) They had written the Tuin down in a manuscript
and then swapped it for a manuscript with Isidore of Seville’s Etymologiae, giving
up their heritage to become nouveau intelligentsia, Nagy argues that Marban‘s
challenge is about getting the poets back to their roots, “unwritten and based in the
living context of performance.” Perhaps it is also about getting them back to still
more ancient roots, based in the kind of visionary experience they resort to by
invoking Fergus’ spirit and recovering the Thin.
Having discussed both how shamanistic figures in Celtic tradition may have
used, and lost, their power, it makes sense to look next at the totemic figures who
supported that power. One example already given above was Marbh’s magical boar.
Like Marban’s boar, totemic figures act to support the shaman spiritually, physically
and psychologically.

"Take the cup with you, to distinguish truthfromfalsehood, '' Manannan told him. "and keep the branch to bringyou hurmony. I broughtyou here to see the Land of Promise. Now I '11 explain all you've seen. f t
Otherworld..la'ventuue qfCormuc.
The best way to understand totems, divine teachers and ritual objects in
psychological terms, may be as what British psychologist, D.W. Winnicott called
"transitional objects." These "objects" may be physical or psychological. They can
range from a child's teddy bear to a shaman's spirit guide.
To me, the idea of transitional objects makes the most sense of the wide
variety of material and non-material beings shamans believe support them and their
work. For example, the guardians of Thompson Indian shamans include the spirits of
"night, mist, the blue sky...sexual organs. the bat...graves," and even other world
locations like the land of souls2
All these transitional objects support the person holding what Winnicott calls
"transitional space." Transitional space is a state of consciousness where
psychological change can occur, because in that state one is not locked into day to day
mental habits. It is not real like a brick, but not purely irnaginary, since something
experiencedas real has real power, as the placebo effect repeatedly shows.
Transitional space is "betwixt and between" realities, as we sometimes hear
the other world described in Celtic tales. It can be compared to the state of sziun
discussed in chapter two. It is a liminal space, an unchallenged area of experience
which acts as both a buffer zone between the individual and life in the world, a realm
where myriad different ideas, roles and emotions can be freely experienced.
In Winnicott's research with children, the object that helps them access this

194
space, the “transitional object” is ofien a stuffed toy, such as a teddy bear. which takes
on a living reality like a totem animal to the child.’
Interaction with transitional objects reveals clear patterns of behaviour. For
example, a person with the power of a totem has obligations to that totem, like
making offerings to them. Similarly, as a recent documentary showed. a child meeting
up with that ever popular transitional object, the “imaginary friend,” may habitually
offer them food, to the extent that one mother found herself making a separate tea
each night for her son’s dragon^!^ The offering of food or drink. whether pouring a
libation or sacrificing a bull to the spirits has to be one of the great universals of ritual.
Even in the absence of a shamanic culture, the children in t h s documentary
instinctively followed certain classic ritual patterns in relation to their transitional
objects, which may partially explain some of the universals in shamanic practice.
These children’s imaginary friends also helped them come to terms with
dificult situations. One child‘s imaginary brother ”died” around the time Princess
Diana did, and was then resurrected, enabling her to come to terms with grief and find
a reassuring belief in immortality. The confidence she built in her imaginary world
helped her in physical reality.’
Likewise, the shaman‘s totems and their lessons provide him with an ever
present, unfaltering support system and clear assurance of eternal life. In some
respects the shaman is one who either never loses his imaginary fiends, or recovers
them and their power at a later stage of life, returning to a paradisical childhood state.
In many traditions the bond the shaman shares with his animal helpers
cosmologically represents a return to another sort of paradise, that of the “beginning
times” when mankind was at peace with the animals. This golden age features in
numerous mythologies and was followed by a “fall” when man became what he is,
living in a state of enmity with animals and the natural world. The shaman transcends
this state of affairs, restoring the lost harmony.6
As the totem animals restore lost harmony, the spirit teachers restore lost
wisdom, and give fiesh revelation. They bring primordial truths into the life of the

community. In Celtic tradition, the divine figure Trefidgid Tre-eochaire -fulfils this
sort of fimction. In The Settling of the Manor of Taru he tells the people how to
arrange the land in harmony with cosmological ideas they have forgotten'
The shaman's costume and implements make the spiritual reality he
experiences visible to all who see him. Physical objects used in the shaman's work act
as tangible representations of their other world helpers. As physical transitional
objects, they also help invoke their spiritual counterparts, bridging the gap between
worlds.
In what follows, I will frequently use the term shamanic practitioner rather
than shaman, because all members of a shamanic culture have totems, totemic objects.
and sometimes spirit teachers who they interact with.
TOTEMS
The shamanic totem may take many forms in traditional cultures.8 Plants,
animals and elemental spirits like lightning or thunder can all serve as totem-and
any combination of the above is possible. For example, the animal helper of a Salish
shamanic practitioner sometimes comes down in a stroke of lightning, implying that it
brings the power of both animal and element.'
TOTEMICPLANTS
Plants and trees can have a totemic function, especially in healing work. Their
use blends into medicinal herbalism, which, as I have mentioned, seldom worked on a
purely physical level, but invoked spiritual powers as well. l0
As is true of animals, we have examples of names derived fi-omtrees. Among
the ancient continental Celtic tribes, we have the Eburones, the Yew People. In Irish
literature, one Tuatha De Danann king is called Mac Cuill, Son of the Hazel. Other
examples include Mac Cairthin, Son of the Rowan, Mac Ibair, Son of the Yew and
Mac Cuilinn, Son of the Holly.' '

We may see a later example of a totemic plant in the suaicheantas or clan
badge. Clan members wore a part of this plant into battle, ostensibly to identify
themselves. Some might interpret this as medieval heraldry. In response, one might
question whether or not heraldry itself is likely to originate in some sort of totemic
associations in earlier times. This question is beyond the scope of this study, however.
I think we can be reasonably sure that the suaicheantas was more than a simple clan
identifier or heraldic device.
For one thing, neighbouring clans might have the same badge. Because a clan
would be more likely to battle its neighbours than anyone else. it would be
impossible for clan members to identify their enemies in combat in these cases.
The second point is that some clan badges, like fir club moss or mistletoe,
would hardly stand out in battle.12 If they do not identi@ clan members, an obvious
point to wearing them is totemic. A MacRae poem about the fir club moss makes this
purpose explicit.
The Fir Club Moss is on my person,
No harm or mishap can me befall,
no sprite shall slay me, no arrow shall wound me.
no fay nor dun water nymph shall tear me.’’
These associations are likely to go back to ancient times. The types of plants
used are most often those with long standing sacred associations, for example, the
mistletoe. Pliny said that the Druids “hold nothing more sacred than the mistletoe**
and the tree it grows on, especially if it was an oak. “Hailing the moon in a native
word that means ‘healing all things‘ they prepare a ritual sacrifice.” It consisted of
two white bulls, and was made after a priest had cut the mistletoe with a golden
sickle.l 4
In much later times, mistletoe became the emblem of the Hays of Errol. The
fate of the family was said to be bound to that of the mistletoe growing on a particular
sacred oak, showing clearly the alter ego or external soul aspect of the totemic
relationship. Its protective aspect is shown in the fact that the plant was considered to

be an infallible protection against witchcraft and injury in battle ’”when cut by a Hay
at the right time and in the proper manner.”IS
As in this case, a cutting of a totemic plant may be carried as a talisman. In the
case of a tree, which you cannot really carry around entire, the cutting becomes a
“pocket edition“ of the tree’s power. We have a clear example in the craeh sida, the
poet’s musical branch, discussed below. While plants do occupy a totemic role as
shown above, the animal is the most fiequently mentioned form of totem in all
shamanic cultures.
TOTEMANIMALS
The totem animal may be seen as a messenger of the Creator, acting as a kind
of “transformer” that makes the power of Absolute Deity into something the shamanic
practitioner can use personally. Hence, it is referred to by some Pacific Northwest
Coast tribes as a “power animal.””
The fairy or supernatural animals that appear throughout Celtic legend and in
Celtic iconography fulfil all the classic shamanic h c t i o n s of the totem animal. They
act as protectors, as friends and guides in the other world, and as sources of personal
power and healing.
Totem animals are often wild rather than domestic. Since the shamanic
practitioner uses them to access the other world, the spiritual wilderness, it makes
sense that allies of a more “liminal” character may be helpful. However, canines and
horses are frequent shamanic totems, perhaps because their long-term role as man’s
helpers seemed to extend naturally into the other world.
As spirits, totem animals may also appear as humans, or humans with animal
qualities, calling to mind the selkies and the numerous “bird-men” of Celtic legend,
such as the one who doffs his bird-hood and fathers King Conaire Mor. Later another
bird man of the same tribe forbids Conaire to kill birds.” Sometimes, as in Conaire’s
15 K m & 1953, pp. 188-189 16 Elide 1964,p. 89. also Durkheim, 1982, p. 104-5 17 Elide. 1964. p. 103. also Hamer. 1980. pp. 57-58 18 Harner. 1980. p. 64 19 Hamer, 1984, 138-139.

I98
case, the totem is also an ancestor. For example. Yakut shamans are considered to be
the children of Bird-of-Prey-Mother; a mythical, eagle-headed, iron-feathered being.”’
As the above example indicates, we see totemic themes in Celtic tradition
similar to those in more generally recognised shamanic cultures. For example, the
MacCOdrums of North Uist were thought to descend f?om the seals. due to the fact
that one of their men had snatched a selkie’s skin when she was in human form. He
kept her as wife, and had children by her, until she found where he had hidden the
skin and went back to sea.2’My own clan, the Camerons, went by the name of Clann
‘ic Gill Onfhaidh, the Clan of the Lad of the Storm, linking them to an elemental
spirit. The witch’s familiar of later folk tradition also fulfils all the classic hnctions of
a totem
The shamanic practitioner may have one totem or many.23 One totem in
particular, usually an animal. is generally the shamanic practitioner‘s main power
source and animal alter ego. For example. the Yuki tribe of California have “bear
doctors,” shamans with bear totem spirits.24 A person training to become a bear
doctor lived as, and sometimes even with, bears, eating the same food and sleeping in
the same places.2sSimilarly. in an Irish tale. Derg Coma, banished by Finn, fled to the
woods and “used to go about on deer’s legs...for his lightness.” Finn finds him living
in a tree, sharing his food and water with a blackbird, stag and trout. 26
A later, similar account from the Isle of Jura describes a man called Iain Mor
na Beinne, who ”went away with the deer.”
He fed with them on heather tops, and ran as swiftly as themselves when
alarmed and lay in their midst when they rested. His body had become hairy all over
like them. Many attempts were made to capture him, and ultimately he was caught
and returned to the community of his kind. In course of time he became tame and
settled and his body shed the rough hair grown in his wild state.”27

We can easily recognise the same pattern in the tales of Mis, Suibhne and
other figures of Celtic tradition living as wild beasts and taking on their attributes.
even to powers of flight.
There are also many instances of human identification with animals in Celtic
tales, Cu Chulainn. the Hound of Culann, perhaps being the most famous. The word
dog or hound appears frequently in early Celtic names such as the British
Cunobelinus, “Hound of Belinus,” the Welsh Cynon, “Great or Divine Hound,” and
the Irish Cu Roi, Conmael and so on.28Other animal names include Oisin “Little
Deer” born of a fairy wornan enchanted in doe form, Conchem ”Wolf-Head,”
March, “Horse,” who had horses ears, Bran, “Crow,” Cairbre Caitchenn, “Cairbre
Cat-Head,” not to mention the protagonist of CuZZwch and OZwen, whose name, as
well as narrative themes in the tale, associates him with pigs.”
The shamanic practitioner interacts more frequently, and on more familiar
terms with his totem than with any other spirit. He may journey to a deity or spirit
teacher, or summon them in formal ritual, but the totem is “on call” twenty-four hours
a day.30 Besides channelling the Creator’s power to the shamanic practitioner, the
totem also has a soothing role, as a best friend and constant companion.”’ You will
recall Marban’s white boar and its soothing qualities fiom the last chapter.
S h a n i c power of all sorts may be transmitted along family lines, and that of
the totem animal is no exception.32 Many shamanic cultures, like that of the
Australian Aborigines, or the Pacific North West Tlingit, are organised into clans who
each possess, (or are possessed by) a specific totem, usually an animal or plant,
though elements and natural phenomena like thunder are also repre~ented.’~
It has been argued that the symbolism of the Pictish stones may represent just
such a totemic clan system with the pairings of symbols such as snakes and boars
symbolising the intermarriage of clans represented by these totems.34

The totem generally has a long standing reciprocal relationship with the
shaman. This type of relationship is shown clearly with numerous repetitions for
emphasis in the tale of a fisherman’s three sons, assembled from various oral and
manuscript sources by Campbell in The Celtic Dragon Myth?
THECELTICDRAGONMYTH
This story is far too long to give in fidl here, but what interests us is the clear
totemic association between the three sons and a whole menagerie of animals.
It began when a smith and fisherman living with his “old wife, old mare, and
old dog,’’ met a mermaid who offered to provide him with fish if he would deliver his
first born son to her.” He agreed, and the first fish he caught asked that he prepare it
himself,giving a piece to his wife, mare, and dog, and bury the three bones in the side
of its head in the garden. His wife bore three sons, his mare three black foals, his dog
three black pups, and three trees sprouted where the bones were buried, that would be
in good health so long as the three sons lived.”
When the mermaid came to collect on the deal, the fisherman made numerous
delays, but ultimately had to reveal his actions to his sons. The story of each son from
this point consists largely of variations on a set pattern.
He sent the first son out with a bit to tame his horse, and a special cake for his
dog. He was meeting these anirnals now for the first time, though they have been
spiritually linked to him all his life. He went out on the moor, and hadn‘t gone far
when the horse came “rushing as if to trample the lad under foot and tear him; but the
lad shook the bit till it clinked and rang, and the black steed came and put his nose
into the halter, and they were good fi-iends at on~e.”When he and his horse left the
forest, the hound came with a similarly savage demeanour, but he tamed it by giving
it the cake.
His father then made him an iron club and unearthed the fish bone at the base
of his tree. When he gave it to his son,it became a golden sword. “Thanks to thee, Oh
King of Princes and Mercies,’’ said the lad. “Now I have done learning, wisdom, and

201
knowledge, and now I may start.‘’This calls to mind the similar statement the boy in
the Canain nan Eun makes. The boy goes on to say, “Yonder tree will be in bud
blossom, and leaf fiom autumn to summer, and from spring to winter, now and for
ever till I meet death...39
The boys headed for the hills with their respective black dogs and horses.
They took three separate paths into the forest, and each encountered animals who
would prove to be of great benefit to them. The first son’s encounter set the basic
pattern.
He saw a WOEa, hawk, and a fox standing beside a sheep. The wolf asked him
to divide the carcass. He did so, and put the pieces in front of the animals so they
could choose. That pleased them, and they promised him help.
The wolf said, “When you are in a bad way, remember me.”
The hawk said, “When you are still worse, remember me.“
The fox said, “When all seems lost, think of me.“
They blessed the fisher’s son, and he blessed them, and he mounted again and
rode through the forest at speed until he reached “a palace in a realm that was not of
this realm at all.” The boy lodged there, and became a herd boy for the king’s cattle.
Then a huge and hideous giant appeared to steal the cows and he battled the
giant. When the boy “began to think he was far fiom fiends and near his foes, and he
thought of the wolf, and he was a wolf And he gave the giant a little light easy lift
and tossed him up and knocked him down and stood upon him.”
He asked the giant what his eric, his price was, since death was surely upon
him. To be spared the giant offered him all his goods. He expanded his goods and
realms by going further afield, and fighting various other giants. In the final of these
battles, on his knees in f?ont of the worst giant of all, “he thought of his friends the
beasts. And he was a wolf and a hawk and a fox all at once,” and overthrew the giant.
When finally confronted by the giants’ hideous mother “he thought of the hawk, and
he was a hawk, and he flew to the top of the high tree” to escape and ultimately defeat
her, acquiring a host more magical treasures in the process.38
When he appeared for his final battles with the dragons who had been causing
38 Campbell.J.F.. 1911.p. 54-55, PW.69-74



202
trouble in the realm it was with all his magical powers, allies and accoutrements, as a
fully magical being himself. Before one encounter, the people awaiting the dragon see
“a rider riding through the sky in a glittering green garment on a yellow golden-brown
palfrey, with a bright, glancing, glittering, bright sword of light in his right hand, and
when they saw him they all fled to their lairs as was their wont.*’39
In the final battle, in his attempt to cut off the last of the dragon’s three heads,
“he thought of the wolf and he was a wolf, and he tore at the dragon, and was a man
and clutched his sword and cut off the dragon’s third head, and won the fight. And the
dragon was a pool of water and a heap of sand.’Ao
This story goes on a good while longer, recounting the tales of the other
brothers and eventual complete triumph of the protagonist, but the passages above
give enough for the purpose at hand.
The father is an old fisherman and a smith, living on the seashore. His age
connotes wisdom. The smith is master of an arcane discipline involving repetitive
sound and mastery of fue, like the shaman. They are so closely linked in Siberian
tradition that a Yakut proverb says that “the shaman and the smith are from the same
nest.” ‘
A seashore is a liminal space, between land and water, where the boundary
between one thing and another, and so between this world and the other, was thin.42
The symbolism of fishing is likewise liminal, the fisher being one who draws things
from the depths. especially in Celtic tradition, when what he draws forth may be the
salmon of wisdom.“ Whatever species of fish the fisherman’s first catch was. it was
clearly not ordinary since it spoke, brought fertility to his household and its bones
became magical weapons for his sons. The fkequent Celtic three-fold scheme, the
significance of which I will explore in a later chapter. is present in the sons, their
totems and their magical e q ~ i p m e n t . ~ ~
The shamanic practitioner’s life and fate are bound to his totems. The idea of a

tree being related to a person’s life is shown in later folklore by the custom of burying
a child’s afierbirth under a tree, which then had a mystical relationship with the child
fkom birth.45Since the tree is the omphalos in so many cultures, as well as the Celtic,
it should not surprise to see it representing the soul’s umbilical connection to life.
The trees here are a manifestation of the “life-token,” a common, and, I would
argue, shamanically based motif in folk-lore. This life-token generally takes animal or
plant form and manifests in some way that the human it is connected to is in danger,
ill or dead.46In Old Irish, this life token is called a cornsueg~lT.h~is~means literally a
“contemporaneous life.” In one story, it is three trout that guarantee the life of a
“White Gr~agach.”“~
In shamanic cultures the state of a person’s health is similarly linked to that of
their totem in the shaman’s diagnosis. If the shaman sees a patient’s totem animal
lying limply near them rather than looking lively, it does not bode well for their
recovery fiom any illness. 49
In this story, the three sons are born in relationship with their first animal
totems as well, the dogs and horses, just as Cu Chulainn is born on the same night as
his two famous chariot horses.” However, the boys do not know of them until their
father sends them out with the special bit, cake, and instructions for dealing with
them. The h l l totemic bond is established via a two stage process.
Some shamanic cultures like the Jivaro in South America also connect with a
totem in two stages. The Jivaro believe that almost all people have at least one totem
fiom birth, since the totem is an essential source of power and health. If a child dies, it
is thought to be because they do not have this invaluable protector and power source.
However they usually only meet their totem later life on a vision quest.5’
The shamanic practitioner may be required to make an offering, perform a
service or otherwise demonstrate their worthiness to the totem. In this story, the first
brother, later called “the Gray Lad,” shows courage and discipline by following his
45 Leach. Maria 1950. p. 145. headword: birth tree. 46 Leach. Maria 1950. p. 619. headword: life-token.

father’s instructions when confronted with the wild and foaming black horse and dog.
Similarly, in Eskimo and other traditions the shamanic practitioner is confronted and
even dismembered by his totems before he gains their p o ~ e r . ” ~
Shamanic practitioners are not limited to one totem, but may also find more
spiritual help in the form of additional totems, again, usually via making offerings of
goods or services. When the Gray Lad meets the fox, hawk and wolf, he helps them
by dividing the carcass, an incident echoed in his brothers’ st~ries.~’
Another way of gaining a being’s power is to kill, defeat, or even ingest that
being. In this story the defeated giants and carlin yield all their goods. and the magical
potency attached to them, to the Gray Lad. In a more oblique way, although no
specific powers are mentioned, he later gains the princess and the kingdom by slaying
the three headed dragon. An Irish example is the way Cu Chulainn takes the name,
and by inference power. of the huge hound he killed.
There are numerous interesting examples of gaining power by ingestion of a
special animal or substance in Celtic tradition. Most famous is perhaps the tale of how
Finn mac Cumaill ingested the salmon of wisdom while cooking it for his master,
accidentally burning his thumb and sticking it in his mouth.” Equally accidentally.
Taliesin ingested a brew which gave him knowledge and the power to shapeshift into
all sorts of animals. There is also the curious episode I mentioned in chapter two in
the Camin nan Eun, where the protagonist consumes the birds, and gains “fkrther
acquaintance with bird language.””
Another example is that of the famous white snake, whose ingestion gave the
Beatons their healing power? The snake has been associated with both shamans and
healing fkom the most ancient times to the modern medical Caduceus, based on the
staff of Asklepios, Greek god of healing?’
The fisherman’s sons perform services to the animals whose power they have.

In the case of the wild forest animals, one service gains their power. In the case of
their dog, it is the magic cake. In the cases of both dog and horse, a give and take
relationship is implied because of the ways humans typically relate to these animals.
The dog and horse appear to be accessible on an ongoing basis, while the wild
animals seem to be accessible for emergencies. The final brother’s wild animals say
he may only call on them three times each.
The shamanic practitioner has specific obligations in relation to his totem and
often its species. For example Cu Chulainn, named for the large hound he killed,
cannot eat dog meat. King Conaire was forbidden to cast at birds, because he was
descended f?om a supernatural bird or bird man, of which more below? The CZunn
‘ic Codrum nan ron, the MacCodrums of the seals, would not kill them according to
some accounts.
The shamanic practitioner can communicate with animals as the fisherman’s
sons all do in this tale.” There are numerous examples of human communication with
animals in Celtic tradition, one being the conversation between the ancient Fintan and
the equally venerable Hawk of Achill!’
In the tale of Cullwch and Olwen, Gwrhyr, Interpreter of Tongues, helps
Arthur and Cullwch speak with the ancient Blackbird of Cilgwri, the Stag of
Rhedynfre and the other animals whose help they seek. It is right for him to do so, as
Arthur says to hm,because “all tongues hast thou, and thou canst speak with some of
the birds and the beasts.”61
In the last chapter, I spoke of shamans turning into animals to do battle. The
story that Campbell has called The Celtic Dragon Myth says that all the fisherman’s
sons become their totems simply by thinking of them.
There is ample further evidence of people having animal alter-egos or totems
in Celtic lands. For example, on the Isle of Jura, the Buies were so strongly identified
with the deer that it was said that “To dream of deer was to dream of Buies.” Here it
seems that the dream animal and totemic animal were one and the same, especially in
light of a tale of one Buie patriarch.

It was said that when Mac Ille-bhuidhe of Cnocbreac grew old, he asked his
sons to help him to Beinn an Oir, the highest of the paps of Jura. When he got there he
said:
IS mise Mac Ill hhuidh namfiudh, ‘S mi ‘mshuidh air sliahh Bheiiin at1 Oir,
‘S ged U tha mi aosmhor liath, h comasach le Dia mo dheanamh og.
“I am Buie of the deer,
1 am sitting on the side of Beinn an Oir.
And though 1am aged and grey
God has the power to make me young.”
He went home looking more like his sons’brother than their This tale
calls instantly to mind that of Tuan maccairill, who shape shifted from form to form
including that of a stag, when he grew old and needed rej~venation?~
Different kinds of totem animals may be perceived as carrying different
qualities. Shamanic practitioners might merge with a bear, tiger or wolf for combat,
an eagle for spirit flight, or a fish for a journey to the under world. Different totems
appear to be seen as carrying different energies, and helping the shamanic practitioner
in different ways in Celtic tradition as well. The Gray Lad’s totems appear in
traditional shamanic cultures, as well as in the Celtic context.
The Gray Lad has a magical black dog, a wolf and a fox as totems. The Inuit
consider the fox, dog and wolf to be powerful shamanic helpers.64 The dog is
particularly associated with the underworld, and the shamanic practitioner often
encounters them when journeying in this realm.
The Gray Lad’s horses are swifter than the March wind, and sometimes fly
through the air. In many traditions, the horse is the animal that enables the shaman to
fly through the air and attain the heavens!’ The swiftness of supernatural horses, and
their ability to fly over land and sea, as the Grey Lad’s horses do, is continually
emphasised in Celtic tradition. Manannan has a horse who can travel over sea and
land, as does Iubdh. In Norse tradition Sleipnir is Odinn’s horse, and has obvious

shamanic association^.^^ The Gray Lad’s hawk has counterparts in Celtic literature.
such as the venerable Hawk of Achill, among the oldest of animals. who has the
famous colloquy with the equally ancient Fintan. This hawk also has many shamanic
counterparts because the bird is the most common shamanic totem of all.
THEBIRD: SHAMANIC TOTEMPAR EXCELLENCE
The ideal bird to accompany the shaman is often seen to be one with power of
flight and swimming, with access to all realms. We have already seen the prominence
of the swan in stories such as the Aislinge Oenguso.
Birds of all species are the most common shamanic totem worldwide. The
reason is not hard to imagine, since spirit flight is central to shamanism. From the ha
soul we see hovering above mummies in ancient Egyptian paintings to the white bird
souls of the righteous perched in the “Downward Growing Tree” of the Irish
apocrypha, the idea of the soul as bird is an almost universal phen~menon.~’
Of course, in traditional shamanic cultures, the shaman is considered to be the
most “righteous” person there is. Feathers and avian designs are also prominent
features of shamanic costuming in Celtic as in other traditions.
EQUIPMENT
The principle of gaining power by identifying with birds or other entities
through costuming is easy to understand.
One becomes what one displqs. The wearers of masks m e really the
mythical ancestors portrayed by their masks. But the same results-hat is, total
transformation of the individual into something other-are to be expected from the
various signs and symbols that are sometimes merely indicated on the costume or
directly on the body: one assumes the power of flight by wearing an eagle feather, or
even a highly stylised drawing of such a feather; and so on.68
Yakut shamans make an entire bird’s skeleton of iron as their costume. Even
when bird symbolism is not quite this blatant the shaman’s head-dress is often made

of feathers and imitates a bird.” A prominent pagan Celtic example of an item that
may well have had totemic bird significance is the Ciumegi helmet. Found in a
warrior’s grave in Ciumegi, Romania, it features a large bird of prey with hinged
wings that would have flapped and red glass eyes7’
In later times, we can draw a comparison between the Siberian shaman‘s
feather head-dress and the encennach made of speckled bird‘s wings Mog Roith
wears in Forhuis Droma Damhgaire in connection with his spirit flight.” Some
sources also say that gelta like Suibhne wore “feather dress” as well.72
The*filidwore tuigen, bird feather capes. The name means a “bird ~overing.”’~
Cormac‘s Glossary says it was made fkom the skins of white and multi-coloured birds
fiom the girdle down, and fiom mallard’s necks and crests fiom the girdle up to the
neck.74Eliade noted its shamanic parallels7’ Identification of thefilid with a bird can
also be seen as totemic. In one story, a group of bird capedjlid say that an interloper
is not “a bird fit for their flock.“”
The central image found on the over 200 pieces jewellery of the Celtic
“princess” at Reinheim, Germany is “that of a woman, her arms folded across her
stomach, a large bird of prey perched above her head.“ Green suggests it is either a
Goddess image, like that of the Morrigan who could shapeshift into bird form, or that
of the woman dead, with the bird representing her spirit flying to Otherworld.
However, she would not have had to die to engage in spirit flight. It would
also seem that a person would be more likely to wear jewels that had a talismanic
fwlction, depicting them as they’d like to be,rather than as a corpse. As the song goes,
“Everybody wanna go to heaven but don’t nobody wanna die t~night.~’’~
Cu Chulainn’s war helmet is a transitional object on two levels. First as a
piece of spiritually charged equipment, and second because it is inhabited by an
assortment of familiar spirits. A passage in the Tuin says that “Goblins and Sprites

and Demons of the air“ used to cry Erom Cu Chulainn’s war helmet “before him and
above him and around him wherever he went, prophesying the shedding of the blood
of warriors and champions.” It is interesting that a vivid account of Cu Chulainn’s
riustrud follows this, a point I will return to in the next chapter.78One source also
refers to the druid, Cathbad‘s “powerful crown“ like the Siberian shaman‘s powerful
head-dre~s.~~
We can see various universal shamanic themes emerging. There are certain
items of equipment common to shamans throughout the world. But this leaves us with
a question about one ubiquitous piece of shamanic equipment-the drum. There has
been debate about when and how the drum came to Britain and Ireland.
The iconography does not present us with clear answers. A round object being
held up by a figure may be a drwn, a shield, a symbol of some kind, and so on.
Archaeology does not help much either, because leather and wood rot.
I mentioned various uses of percussive sound in chapter two, and of course,
drums are not always present in shamanic cultures. A gong may be used in Ceylon,
China and South Asia, calling to mind the Irish saints’ bells.8o
In some places drums are not used for purely practical reasons. For example.
South American tribes tend to use psychotropics rather than drums. The rain forest is
a humid place. To get a drum skin to remain taut enough to produce the ringing,
resonant tone required for a shamanic journey one would have to sit quite close to a
blazing hot fire while drumming-no fun in the jungle. Drum skins do not stay
particularly taut in Britain and Ireland either, though it is more pleasant to sit by a hot
fKe here.
Accounts in other cultures may provide a clue to the apparent absence of the
drum. The Siberians have tales of How the Shaman Got His Drum, however.
something of this sort would have been impossible to Christianise and so would not
have been passed on to
However, the way the drum is referred to, or not, in shamanic cultures may be
more informative. In Siberian tales of what the shaman does, going to the land of the

210
dead and so forth, the drum is taken as a given. The shaman does not say, “I drum.
and go to the land of the dead.” Rather: “I go to the land of the dead.”
A name taboo can also apply to the drum because of its great power. It is
referred to by other names. In some cultures, it is thought to be made fkom the wood
of the world tree, and so is the tree that the shaman climbs. Among some Mongolian
tribes that make their drum from roebuck, the shaman sings “I am travelling with a
wild roebuck!” as he is spiritually “carried” out of himself by his drumming.82
Therefore, references to riding Otherworld horses, as in the Gray Lad’s tale above,
may contain oblique references to drumming. (They may also. of course, simply be
horses, albeit supernatural ones.) In Siberian culture the horsehide drum is the
shaman’s horse, which he rides, or the boat he sails to the other world in.83
Some words used to describe druid’s equipment have not been satisfactorily
translated. I think one of these may relate to the shaman‘s drum. The druid Mogh
Ruith, and his daughter. Tlachtga use the roth ramach as a component of their gear in
the spirit journey.84
Ramach can mean “branch” as in the phrase f i i fidradfonnram: a wood of
delighthl boughs.R5Bear in mind here the world tree associations of the shaman’s
drum. In later Scottish Gaelic the word can be branch or tree. A drumbeater would
have been made fi-oma branch of wood.
I think it is possible that the drum is the roth and the ramach the beater. This
sort of paired symbolism is not unusual. For example. for the Altaians the drum is
their “horse,” the beater the “Whip.”“
Siberian drums are often made of horsehide, sometimes complete with a tail
and “reins.”*7The Hobby Horse may relate. One cannot help but notice that it bears
more resemblance to a drum in shape than to a horse, through it is impossible to say if
this has any shamanistic significance. 88
I believe there is a riddling reference to drums and drum beaters in the

Imacallam in Da Thuarad. Nede asks Ferchertne by what path he came. and
Ferchertne answers:
"Not hard: on Lugh 's horserod,
on the breasts of soft women,
On a line ofwood,
On the head of a spear.
On a gown of silver,
On a chariot without a wheelrim,
On a wheelrim without a chariot..."" (italics mine.)
I think the last two lines are particularly suggestive. Another curious worG is
timpan. Caer, in the story Aislinge Oenpso. appears initially playing a timpan." This
is generally regarded as a stringed instrument, but the reason a drum word is used for
a stringed instrument remains a bit mysterious. I can think of no clear reason for its
use myself. It is, of course, a Latin loan-word.
Celtic tales feature many other kinds of magical instruments. I don't have the
space to discuss them all here but they include Finn's crane bag, other magical bags,
the four treasures of the Tuatha De, magical cauldrons, and all the equipment used in
drinking, which, as discussed in chapter two, seems to relate to spiritual power.9'
Earlier I mentioned the druids using a golden sickle to cut the ~nistletoe.'~The
fact that the priest's robes and implement, the bulls and the mistletoe all share a
similar colour-scheme may indicate a totemic identification of priest, bulls and sacred
plant.
Perhaps the most obviously shamanic piece of equipment in Celtic sources is
the craebh ciziil, or musical branch. It was a stick with (usually three) metal balls or
bells on it. Carried by thejilid, it was used to signal the start of meetings. bring peace
to assemblies and play the music of sziantraige. The branch nourishes and produces
harmonious sounds.93It was also said to harmonise even the most agitated throng. In

Mesca Uuid the.fiZid Sencha, Conchobar’s chief advisor, was the only one who could
bring peace to the proceedings with his branch.Y4In Fled Bricrend he again shakes his
“peace-keeping branch” to stop a battle.95 Various kinds of staffs, bells and rattles
appear in shamanistic contexts in other cultures.96
A particularly close comparison can be found in the bough Aeneas carries into
the llndenvorld in the Aeneid. Charon is surprised at the sight of the bough, “rarely
seen in Hades.” Hull takes this to mean that “it was only those who entered the realms
of the dead in Zfe who presented the branch to Proserpine.” (Italics mine.) This bough
grants admission to Hades. After a bath, Aeneas fixes the bough above Pluto‘s palace
gate before entering. “It was the property of the queen of the unseen abode.” She
theorises that the branch is talisman that allows humans to enter the Otherworld while
living-an obvious piece of shamanic e q ~ i p r n e n t .T~hi~s piece of equipment is given
to King Cormac by a figure who is apparently his spirit teacher.
TEACHERS
Examples of spirit teachers, like totems, occur throughout this thesis. One
particularly clear example occurs in the tale of The Otherworld Adventure o f
Cormac.
In the story King Cormac was out on the hill of Tara when mist surrounded
him. A dignified warrior emerged fiom the mist bearing a silver branch with three
golden apples on it. Its music was so beautiful that even the sore wounded would go
into s u m upon hearing it. He tells Cormac that he comes Erom a land “where there is
naught but truth. There’s no decay or sorrow, no envy or jealousy, and no hatred or
pride.”
“It is not so with us.*. responded Cormac. Cormac proposed an alliance
between them, and the warrior agreed. Cormac asked for the branch, and the warrior
agrees on the condition that Cormac gives him whatever three things he asked for in
Tara. Cormac agrees. The warrior then appears three times. First he asks for, and

213
takes, Cormac’s daughter, next his son. The court’s grief is terrible each time, but
Cormac shakes the branch and banishes their grief with suuntraige. Finally, the
warrior returns to take Cormac’s wife, Ethne.
Cormac could not stand this and pursued the warrior. Another mist
descended, so none of the throng could see each other and Cormac found himself
wandering alone. He saw a host of strange things. For example, he came to a bronze
fortress. Inside. a host of horsemen of the Sid were thatching a silver house with white
bird wings. Each time it was half thatched, a gust of wind blew the wings away.
Then he came to another fort, with four houses in it, He entered the largest,
which had beams of bronze and was well thatched with white bird wings. Five
streams flowed fkom a sparkling spring in the courtyard making a sweet melody, and
many drank kom them. The nine eternal Hazels of Buan grew over that spring.
Cormac entered the palace and found a beautiful young woman and handsome
warrior within. She was bathing in water heated with magical stones that floated in
and out of the bath of their own accord. When she was done, Cormac bathed in the
water. After various other magical events, the warrior revealed that he was Manannh
and restored his family and warriors to him.
Manannan also gave Cormac a golden cup that reveals truth and falsehood.
“Take the cup with you, to distinguish truth fiom falsehood,” M a n u told him,
“and keep the branch to bring you harmony. I brought you here to see the Land of
Promise. Now I’ll explain all you‘ve seen.”
He explained that the horsemen of the Sid Cormac saw endlessly thatching the
house with white bird wings were the Aes Dha, the poets andJiZid of Ireland who
collected cattle and wealth which passed away to nothing. He also explained all the
other things Cormac saw. The following day Cormac awoke back at Tara. His family
and Manannh’s branch and cup were with him. However, neither the cup nor branch
remained after Cormac’s death, but passed away with him.
In this story Manannh clearly acted as a spirit teacher. He expressly told
Cormac that he initiated Cormac’s Otherworld journey to teach him,and he gave him
magical implements to return with.
Finn provides us with another example. He barely escapes with his life in



214
some of his many Othenvorld journeys, but he always comes out the wiser for his
experience. In one however, his Otherworld host, Cuanna, explains the symbolism of
what he experienced the previous night, much as Manamin explained Cormac’s
journey to him.
Finn and his men lose their food to a ram they cannot control, but a twelve
eyed man can. This man represented the power of the world. A hag represented the
power of age. The two wells he drank fiom are a well of falsehood and a well of truth.
“Thus, at least in this particular bruidhean tale, Finn’s othenvorldly experience is an
extended initiation into a state of enlightenment supervised for Finn’s benefit by his
otherworldly “mentors.’”’”

TRANSITIONAOLBJECTS:TOTEMTS,EACHERASND EQUIPMENT
SHAMANCICULTURES
Totems are supernatural helpers, amongst the Buriat, Tungus, Inuit and many others. Totems may be acquired via a two stage process. Children are generally believed to have totems fiom birth, but may only become aware of them later during a formal vision quest, among the Jivaro, the Southern Okanagon of Washington State, and others. The health of an individual may be diagnosed by a shaman by observing the health of the totem. Power may be acquired via defeat, and/or ingestion of a being. Shamanic practitioners are identified with their totems. Shamanic practitioners transform into their totems. There are often tribal totems Shamanic practitioners speak with their totems in animal language. Shamanic practitioners may live as animals, eating the food of animals.
Shamanic practitioners make offerings of food or other items to their spiritual allies.
Water birds are considered to have particularly strong supernatural powers, and to be particularly appropriate totems for the shaman. Canines and horses are frequently totems in Siberian and other shamanic cultures. The bird is the sharnanic totem par excellence amongst the Buriat, Tunes, and others. Bird motifs are the dominant theme in shamans' costuming:world-wide. The drum is an important piece of shamanic equipment in many cultures.
CELTICCULTURE Totems are supernatural helpers.
Some totems in the Celtic Dragon Myth are acquired via a two stage process. The dog and horse counterparts of each son are born when they are. but the boys are ignorant of them until they reach maturity and are sent to seek them.
The health of the boys in the Celtic Dragon Myth may be ascertained by observing their totemic trees. Power is acquired by the defeat of giants and their mother. Shamanic practitioners are identified with their totems. Shamanic practitioners transform into their totems. There are clan totems Shamanic practitioners speak with their totems in animal language in many tales. Mis, Suibhne, Derg Corra, and others live as animals in the forest, eating animal's food. Derg Corra shares his food and water with a blackbird, stag and trout. Others offer food to their animals. Water birds such as swans are clearly associated with supernaturalpowers, and with shamanic figures in stories such as Aislinge Oenguso and TochmarcEtain.
Canines and horses are fiequently totems.
The bird appears to be shamanic totem par excellence.
Bird motifs are a dominant theme in the costuming:of filidand druids. There is some evidence for the drum in Celtic culture.



216
Various other equipment is used by the shaman, including ritual staffs.
Shamans have spirit teachers.
The craebh ciziil, or musical branch, is clearly a piece of shamanistic equipment in Celtic tradition. Spirits act as teachers in shamanic contexts to figures such as Finn and Cormac.

CONCLUSIONS: THEUNION OF TOTEMAND SHAMAN
There are so many references to "transitional objects" in Celtic sources that I
could only scratch the surface. I hope I have shown evidence above for objects that
correspond to the classical equipment of the shaman, and for shamanistic relationships
with totems and teachers.
The relationship with the totem can be so close that the practitioner becomes
The Gray Lad's fml battle with the dragon shows how fluid the
the
identities of all parties concerned are. The tale tells us, "he thought of the wolf and he
was a wolf, and he tore at the dragon, and was a man and clutched his sword and cut
off the dragon's third head, and won the fight...And the dragon was a pool of water
and a heap of sand. Here we are dealing with spiritual and material realities
undistinguished from each other in the tale. so often the case in Celtic narrative.
VI01
We see this occurring in various legends, such as the story of Taliesin, where
both he and Cerridwen change shapes into various animals.'02 The theme of animal
transformation is reflected in later Scottish folklore in an invocation in Curminu
Gudelicu. This is the Ora Ceurtus, the invocation for justice, performed before going
into court. In the section invoking the animal powers the person takes on their
attributes, like the white swan, they are flying above the heads of the dark townsfolk,
superior. The power of their totems makes them stronger than all persons.

in likeness of Serpent, in likeness of King:
Stronger will it be with me than with all persons."-'
The practitioner here also describes himself transforming into the likeness of a
king who can be seen as an axis mundi, linking this world with the other. The shaman
can fidfil this world-linking function by transforming into another likeness, that of
their spirit teacher or tutelary deity.

Karl Pribram, a Professor of neuroscience at S t d o r d , has concluded that
memory is held in the brain not in cells, but in fields, and learning occurs through
the resonance of these fields. In collaboration with the physicist, David Bohm, he
theorised that the field of the mind as a whole can be extended beyond the physical
body. This could lead to the experience of seeing into all things and experiencing
them as part of oneself, as Amergin speaks of doing in his well known run?
Chapter five focuses on the ways these studies, and others like them, shed light on
Celtic experiences, myths, and practices.
An oracle acts as a vehicle for the gods on earth. They merge with tribal
deities, totemic spirits and their own personal spirit teachers to manifest the power
of those beings to the community.

Eliade initially de-emphasised the shaman’s oracular role. but later admitted
that he did not attribute the importance to possession he should have.4 “Both
experiences,” he says, “are equally constitutive for shamanism; ecstasy and
possession are not contrasts but two aspects of the same reality.”’ Oesterreich, in
his definitive work on possession, also found it to be clearly related to shamanism
in many cultures, as do others.‘
An important source of living information on possession is to be found in
Haitian Vodou and other modern religions such as Santeria. While Eliade didn’t
think Vodou could be classed fully with shamanic phenomena in the strictest sense.
he felt that the “morphology of the trance, the techniques of possession, the
initiatory rites, etc., form invaluable documents for comparison with shamanistic
phenomenon.”’
The relationship between shamanism and possession is a natural one. first
because the shaman‘s goal is in many ways to become us a spirit. leaving behind
human qualities. Next, because there can be a continuum between the spirit journey
and possession. In Tungus and other traditions, the shaman may enact his travels in
the Otherworld to his audience, chanting his dialogues with gods and spirits, and
dramatising their actions through dance.’ It is easy to see how this sort of ritual
performance segues into trance possession-the shaman dancing the god becomes
the god?
Possession further empowers the shaman. and sometimes even begins a
shaman’s career. One example is that of the Sakha Siberian man mentioned in
chapter two who gained his power by accidentally camping the night on a Tungus
shaman’s grave. The source of his power was possession by that shaman‘s spirit.”
The Tuvans also commonly believe that a man becomes a shaman due to

possession by a dead shaman‘s spirit.’ ’
When the shaman leaves his body on the spirit journey it can create the
opportunity for a spirit to take over.” Celtic tales reflect ideas of gaining power via
possession and that possession can be a swap, where the god inhabits the shaman’s
body while the shaman adventures in the Othenvorld. One example examined
below is the tale of PwyZl, Prince qf’Dyfed, who becomes a better king by trading
places with Arawn, king of Annwn. There are many examples of possible trance
possession or relics thereof in the literature, like the way poets frequently spoke in
the first person as figures such as Merlin and Llywarch Hen in early Welsh
poetry.13
There is considerably more than a relic to be found in a biography of St.
Samson, the Vita Samsonis. The Saint is said to have lived in sixth century Wales,
and attended the Council of Paris around 560 AD, although these dates are far from
certain. While passing through Cornwall on his way from Wales to Brittany, he
came across what he found to be a disturbing scene.
Now it came to pass, on a certain day, as he was on a journey through a
certain district which they call Tricurius, he heard, on his left hand to be exact,
men worshipping a certain idol after the custom of the Bacchantes, by means of a
play in honour of an image. Thereupon he beckoned to his brothers that they
should stand still and be silent while he himself, quietly descending from his
chariot to the ground and standing upon his feet and observing those who
worshipped the idol, saw in fiont of them, resting on the summit of a certain hill,
an abominable image. On this hill I myself have been and have adored and with
my hand have traced the sign of the cross which St Samson with his own hand
carved by means of an iron instrument on a standing stone. When St Samson saw
it (the image), selecting two only of the brothers to be with him, he hastened
quickly towards them, their chief, Guedianus, standing at their head, and gently
admonished them that they ought not to forsake the one God who created all
things and worship an idol. And when they pleaded as excuse that it was not

wrong to celebrate the mysteries of their progenitors in a play, some being
furious, some mocking, but some of saner mind strongly urging him to go away.
the power of God was made clearly manifest. For a certain boy, driving horses at
full speed, fell from a swift horse to the ground. and twisting his head as he fell
headlong, remained just as he was flung, little else than a lifeless corpse.
Then St Samson, speaking to the tribesmen as they wept around the body,
said, ‘You see that your image is not able to give aid to the dead man. But if you
will promise that you will utterly destroy this idol and no longer adore it. I. with
God‘s assistance, will bring the dead man to life.’ And they consenting. he
commanded them to withdraw a little further off, and, after praying earnestly over
the lifeless man for two hours, he delivered him, who had been dead, alive and
sound before them all. Seeing this, the) all with one accord. along with the afore
mentioned chief, prostrated themselves at St Samson‘s feet and utterly destroyed
the idol.l 4
St Samson then helped them by destroying a malefic serpent and set up a
monastery near the cave where it had lived. He moved into the cave himself.”
Tolstoy has argued that the ”play” described here was of a shamanistic.
oracular sort, involving people portraying or possessed by the spirits.I6 Although
we cannot be certain that this was the case, the reference to Bacchantes clearly
implies a spiritually ecstatic or abandoned state. Before looking further at these
states in Celtic tradition, it will be useful to see how the states themselves have
been viewed by anthropologists.
PSYCHOLOGICAL AND ANTHROPOLOGICVAILEWS OF POSSESSION
Some anthropologists have seen possession as a compensatory mechanism
for social powerlessness. Particularly in the case of women involved in the Zaar
possession cult in Northern Sudan and Egypt, possession by a powerfd spirit, good
or bad, brings the woman prestige and power.l 7
Trawick says of possessed women in Tamil Nadu. that “What the possessed

dare not demand for herself. the possessing spirit will demand. What the possessed
feels but dare not speak. the possessing spirit will scream O U ~ . ’It”i~s interesting to
note in this context that, as I will discuss below, women in oracular roles are very
prominent in Celtic literature, which might mean that they continued in the role
longer .
This may be in part due to disempowerment in other spheres of life. The
role of women in Celtic culture is of course highly contentious. I do not have the
space to deal with this difficulty here. Whatever the complete truth of the matter is,
I think that it is of interest in relation to my topic that women are depicted by
Classical authors and in the later literature as holding considerable power in ancient
Celtic culture. Some of these accounts are definitely not fictional. For example,
Queen Boadicca was clearly a real historical figure and she cannot have been the
only female warleader.
There are numerous accounts of women wielding political. spiritual. and
military power in Celtic materials and Classical materials relating to the Celts in
the pre-Christian period. There are many fewer, however, in the post-Christian
period. I think it is therefore likely that the degree of power women enjoyed in pre
Christian Celtic culture. whatever degree of power it was, must have decreased
under Christianity.’
One example is the Cain Adomnan. While it was intended to protect
women, it also would have disarmed them-and we know that being unarmed does
not make one proof against attack. This all clearly requires further research, but in
relation to my current topic, it would make sense that holding an oracular role
would fulfil1 women’s needs for power and prestige in post-Christian Celtic
culture, especially if they were being disempowered in other facets of life. As in the
modern examples above, women in Celtic culture might have used oracular
practice as a compensatory mechanism for social powerlessness.
Of course, trance possession and shamanic rites in general fulfil a valuable
social function for the shaman’s community as well as the shaman. On one level it
provides entertainment. The Russian ethnographer Shirokogoroff asserted that the
18 Trawick, 1997, p. 62 19 For various articles on the roles of women in Medieval Ireland see Meek and Simms. 1996



224
satisfaction of participating in a shamanic rite is infinitely greater than that derived
from a Western theatrical performance.20 This would of course depend on the
quality of the play or the abilities of the actors or shamans in question!
As in a cinema or theatre, the shamanic rite brings the “mundane and the
supramundane realms“ together.” Pwyll acts in a classically shamanic way in the
Muhinogion when he is described as uniting “the two realms in one’’ through his
oracular role and exchange with the Othenvorld.LL
The shaman’s dramatic talents are of great importance to the oracular
process, but it is not simple play-acting. Shamanic cultures acknowledge to varying
degrees the importance of the “vessel” as well as the god who fills it.” They carry
the audience along with them in a kind of mass ecstasy where the inhibitions and
stress of daily life are released, and the audience is drawn to a higher sphere along
with the shaman?
As Kalweit notes, ecstatic release through dramatic performance can be an
instinctive process, where humans “divest themselves of inveterate patterns of
thought and behaviour and of rigid ideas in order to heal themselves.”25
Although divesting the self of rigid ideas may be instinctive for the
indigenous person, it requires more work for the scholar. as evidenced by the
different ways possession has been perceived and described by anthropologists and
other observers.
THEORACLEPERCEIVED
The perception of what the shaman actually is in relation to their god ranges
all the way fEom avatar or incarnation to momentary embodiment. The underlying
point to bear in mind is, as I have mentioned before, that shamanic cultures see the
world in eitherall. rather than either /’ or terms.
In Castaneda‘s first book. Don Juan speaks of shape-shifting.
...to become a crow is the simplest of all matters...it takes a very long

225
time to learn to be a proper crow, he said, but you did not change, nor did you
stop being a man. There is something else.'6
An indigenous person can accept the multifarious identities of the shaman
as a human in daily life, as a magician when healing or invoking powers and as god
when trance possession. Norse deities seem on one level like archetypes enacting
cosmic dramas, on other like human magicians. and at times, like human beings
with all the usual interpersonal issues. Components of both mythic and historical
reality are present in Norse myth. For Snorri, there "is no one-way explanation of
the gods." but I believe shamanistic rites and world views can give a reason for the
multiple explanations.27
Of course, in shamanistic cultures, the lines between gods and oracles may
blur, especially in speech, where to constantly draw distinctions between god and
oracle would be even more hopelessly clumsy than drawing such distinctions
proves in describing shamanic experience in general.
These blurred lines have led to a misapprehension among some researchers
that the natives themselves do not know what is going on. One anthropologist,
writing of a tribe in Kerala, appears to throw up his hands saying, '*About avaturs
in the Kurichiya belief system, I am not sure; nor are they.":8
It seems unlikely that they are really not sure, rather that, unlike outside
observers, they can hold a continuum of identity concepts between man and god
simultaneously without cognitive dissonance. Being able to hold both realities, that
of a person as human and divine and all the points between, is quite different from
confusion. I think the problem of perception sometimes arises when outside
observers fi-om Western belief systems cannot distinguish between traditional
cultures' capacity to experience multivalent reality and confusion because they
cannot do it for themselves.
One piece of common ground between natives from traditional cultures and
modern Western observers is in speech about the oracle. They both often
they cannot separate oracle and god in their discussion, or find that they
find that

226
more accurate to refer to the oracle by the name of their spirit or god's rather than
their personal. human name.
THEORACLDEESCRIBED
For example, Trawick refers to the oracle Sarasvati as Mariamman, her
goddess, when possessed. She also speaks of the many differences of action and
speech between the two that makes the distinction natural and necessary to her.
Unlike Sarasvati, Mariarnman uses cryptic language. She has absolute certainty and
confidence, making ongoing references to her power. She is very blunt, lacking
social niceties."
Roy Willis gives good examples when discussing the Lungu ngulu cult.
One of his research assistants wrote of the possessed oracle Lisita during a
ceremony, that "the spirit went outside and danced and sang."3o
Willis goes on, speaking of his own responses to Lisita's possession,
And so it did, moving in that slow, almost languorous way I remembered
from Jenera's performance, a smooth, gliding movement, sensual too, with
simultaneously gyrating hips as the human-spirit-body turns through a wide arc,
and then suddenly stops. perfect control...Mama Ngulu...begins again the spirit
dance of power and desire, gliding...31
If anthropologists and other modem observers blur the distinction between
spirit and oracle in their written descriptions, it makes sense that an early Irish-fili
might do the same as he told tales of the gods and their human oracles. Especially
if, as I will argue below, he might have acted as an oracle as well.
Additionally. the Zifelcatiwho transmitted these tales clearly understood that
divine and human could merge, even in Christian contexts of demonic possession
or the descent of the Holy Spirit.
Of course, Willis has made the effort to understand the Lungu view of
reality. The same effort is needed if we are to understand the evidence for trance
possession in Celtic sources, most particularly those that deal with the Tuatha De.
29 Trawick. 1997. pp. 73-75 30 Willis. 1999. p. 86 3 1 Willis. 1999. p.86



227
Anthropological observation and textual analysis require some different
skills, but as I noted in the introduction, my approach is based on the premise that
the literature to some extent reflects real practices, individuals and events.
Therefore anthropological methods are valid for helping to decipher what occurrs
in the tales. As I will detail below, the overlap between oracle and god as it appears
and is described in anthropological accounts of trance possession may go some way
towards explaining the sometimes human, sometimes divine natures of the Tuatha
De in the literature.
It will prove helphl to look at possession in the larger Indo-European area,
before focussing on the Celtic.
TRANCPEOSSESSIOINNINDO-EUROPECAUNLTURES
Some scholars trace yogic practices to the shamanistic practices of the
Indus Valley culture of 2500 BC. The practices of the sadhus. the wandering
ascetics, to attain total identification with god are particularly likely to come from
older sources, and retain many shamanistic features to the present day.32
In some respects sirdhus are still worshipped as living idols. “After all, in
appearance and behaviour they most closely resemble the gods as they are known
through popular mythology and i~onography.”~T’hey outwardly imitate their god.
Shaivites bearing tridents, for example, or sitting on a tiger or deer slun, which
conveys to them the power of the They also consciously try to become
the divine “vehicle” of the god, a concept we will see arise in horse symbolism,
b e l ~ w . ~S’hankariichiirya, a Shaivite teacher of about 800 CE, shared Shiva‘s title
of Shankara, “auspicious one,” and was regarded as His avatar.36Additionally, of
course, any number of Hindu gods, including Krishna, Rama and others are
described as having been human kings, or otherwise incarnate, at different times.”
India yields numerous examples of trance possession today, although the

shamanic links have faded in some cases.” The Todas of South India have a
shaman called a tenuol who becomes possessed by a god, but in earlier times was
able to travel to the land of the dead, crossing a thread bridge, like the Siberian
shamans.39
Moving to other Indo-European cultures. Greece had the famous Pythia,
oracle of Apollo, who sat on a tripod and spoke words that the priests interpreted.
This oracle and others saw themselves as married to the god, as in shamanic spirit
marriage. This oracle became very popular. Originally an annual event, it became
ongoing, with three oracles working in shifts.4o There were many other Greek
oracles as well, ranging from priestly to poetic.
Poet as oracle is very well documented in Greece. The performance began
with an invocation to the muses, and assertion of the poet’s prophetic abilities and a
statement of authority sometimes thought of as “boasting“ common to many
oracular performances.“ We can see many Celtic parallels, including Amergin ‘s
Run, above.
In Euripedes’ Bacchae, Tiresias speaks of the god‘s visitation.
This god’s a prophet, too, for those rituals
the Bacchic celebrations and the madness
unleash considerable prophetic power.
When the god enters the body fully,
he makes those possessed by frenzy prophets.
They speak of what’s to happen in the future?
Given the above examples, it is not surprising to find that the Greeks
thought a lot about the gods’ natures and to what extent they connected to man’s.
EUHEMERAI NSDMTHE ORACLE
Euhemerism has been defined as the process by which certain gods,
“functioning in an early Indo-European mythical structure are ‘transposed,”’ into
38 Jones. Rex I,.. 1967-1968. pp. 343-345. See also Rahmann. 1959. pp. 683-715. Eliade, 1964. pp. 421-427 and Harper, 1957. pp. 267-287 39 Jones.

229
heroic figures, the keywords being historisation and humanisation. The process is
named for the Greek writer Euhemerus, who lived in the 3rd to 4th centuries BC. In
one story he wrote that Zeus and other gods had once been humans who became
divine via good works.43
These accounts have been viewed in different ways, ranging from Muller’s
idea that myth can be based in historical fact to Jan de Vries that euhemerism is the
result of the intellectual reduction of myths. Hume had the idea that the polytheistic
process, involving euhemerism, was essentially that of an ignorant humanity
making gods ‘*just like them” because they caraot think of anything better?
Brennus, the Celtic chief who sacked Delphi and mocked the idea that humans
could depict the gods as tidy marble statues, would probably have agreed with
H ~ m e .O~’R~ahilly believed that the early Irish pseudo-historians vigorously
euhemerised the Irish gods to eradicate pagan beliefs, turning Manannan into a
skilful navigator rather than a deity, for example?
However, euhemerism may not be reducible to one idea. Diodorus, and
probably Euhemerus, believed that some gods were eternal, but “the other gods, we
are told. were terrestrial beings, who attained immortal honour and fame because of
their benefactions to mankind.’A7Hindu myths describe people who become Indra,
leader of the gods, through their tapas, mystic heat generated through a u ~ t e r i t i e s . ~ ~
Here we get closer to a shamanic world view, that the divine pervades all
and can manifest through humans even as it remains transcendent. Also that the
human can, through his own efforts, ascend as the shaman does to the heavens.
Thus, the concept of a “human god,” not in an euhemerised but rather, a religious,
sense has ancient authority.
The relevance to the question of oracles is evident. and, if we move closer
to home, we find that Germanic tradition gives us a particularly useful and
straightforward example of a “euhemerised” account.
Sax0 describes Odin as a person honoured falsely as a god in the first book

of his Danish Histov. Snorri tells us that Odin and his wife had the gift of
prophecy, and left Turkey for parts north because their vision revealed that they
would become famous there.49
All appears to be going to plan at first. Kings eagerly worship him and give
him gifts, including a gold covered statue of himself. However. his wife strips it of
gold for her own adornments and engages in other kinds of misbehaviour. Publicly
shamed by all this, Odin goes into exile, replaced by a man called Mit-Othin
“famous for his juggling tricks” who was “...likewise quickened, as though by
inspiration from on high to seize the opportunity of feigning to be a god.“
His reign is a disaster, and finally he dies, as does Odin’s wife. Her death
evidently “revived the ancient splendour of his name, and seemed to wipe out the
disgrace upon his dei@.. -7 .
...so, returning from exile. he forced all those who had used his absence
to assume the honours of divine rank to resign them as usurped; and the gangs of
sorcerers that had arisen he scattered like a darkness before the advancing glory
of his godhead. And he forced them by his power not only to lay down their
divinity, but further...quit the country. deeming that they, who had tried to foist
themselves so iniquitously into the skies, ought to be outcasts from the earth.”
Viewed from a shamanic perspective, it seems quite clear that the figures
here were oracles, engaged in a spiritual, political and interpersonal power struggle.
Snorri depicts them as ambitious humans. with shamanistic powers. The idea that
these powers might include being possessed by a deity is implied in part by the
shared name. Both Odin and Mit Othin have a similar name, which I suspect may
be a title possessed by those the god Odin possessed. In fact, the name Odin itself
derives in part from the Old Norse Odr, meaning raving or possessed.”
Where Sax0 says that Odin was honoured falsely as a godl Snorri seems to
feel that he was not honoured as falsely as those who “had tried to foist themselves
so iniquitously into the skies“ who went on to scatter “like a darkness before the

better oracle than
his power forces
Then, as now, the oracular role brought great perks. Snorri tells us that Odin
Odin and his wife with their gifts of prophecy were ambitious and sought a fame
and degree of power that they ultimately attained.53
For a modern example of what’s involved politically, financially and
spiritually in this kind of contest we need look no W h e r than the recent,
sometimes armed, struggle of two groups of Tibetan Buddhist monks. each
supporting a different candidate as reincarnation of an ancient religious leader, the
Karmapa, a living god, and head of the wealthy Kagyu sect.54The issues involved
are religious, yes, but also political and financial.
Given all the examples above, it seems clear that there are examples of
possession in Indo-European tradition. The next question is how shamanic cultures
conceptualise what happens during possession, and what evidence we can find in
Celtic tradition for similar concepts.
THEMECHANICS OF POSSESSION AND CELTIC SOURCES
Possession can take three essential forms. The most classically shamanic by
Eliade’s definition would be exchange, where the shaman goes to the Otherworld
and the spirit takes over his body in this one. Second is when the possessing spirit
displaces or merges with their oracle. Finally, the most complete possession might
be more properly termed incarnation, where the oracle is avatar of the god or spirit.
POSSESSION AS EXCHANGE
A Celtic example is found in the tale PwylZ, Prince of Dyfed. Pwyll gains
power by encountering Arawn, king of Annwn, the Otherworld, and trading places
with him? Pwyll meets Arawn while hunting. He commits a great discourtesy by
driving Arawn’s hounds off a stag they’ve killed and feeding his own pack on it.

54 Smtt-Clark and Levy. January 30th 2000. pp. 22-29



232
Arawn swears to have Pwyll satirised. Pwyll asks how he can make peace. Arawn
requests that Pwyll swap roles with him and defeat Hafgan, another king in the
Otherworld who wars with Arawn ~ o n t i n u a l l y . ~ ~
Iwill form a strong bond with you in this way: I will put you in my place
in Annwfn, and give you the fairest woman you have ever seen to sleep with you
every night. You will have my shape and manner, so that neither chamberlain,
nor officer, nor any other who has ever followed me shall know that you are not I.
And that until a the end of a year from tomorrow, when we meet in this p l a ~ e . ~ ’
Despite the physical resemblance, Pwyll’s people notice the superiority of
Arawn‘s rule. Similarly, although the oracle may look the same, with perhaps the
addition of deity specific costuming. the spiritual or personality differences
between oracle and shaman are evident to observers.58
When they switch back, Pwyll has defeated Arawn’s enemy and loyally
rehsed to sleep with his wife, and Pwyll‘s people say they have never been ruled
so well as they were by “Pwyll“ over the prior year.59
The tale of Cu Chulainn’s immram to rescue the three sons of Doe1
Dermait, told in chapter three, relates a similar swap. Cu Chulainn gives a prince a
magical spear, and the prince replaces him at court while he is in the Otherworld.
They so resemble each other that no one knows Cu Chulainn is gone.60
TITLES
Pwyll receives numerous gifts after his “mission” is completed. In his case,
the ongoing spiritual commerce with the Otherworld is described as an exchange of
gifts. This is exactly the sort of commerce that exists between the oracle and his
god. The shaman makes offerings and receives spiritual bounty in return, often in
the form of totem animals, jewels, crystals, magical objects and the like? When
Pwyll tells his tale, his people ask that he continue to rule as Arawn did, and he

233
agrees. Pwyll then receives a title: Arawn's. The hll passage is as follows:
From that time on, they began to strengthen their friendship, and sent
each other horses. hunting dogs, hawks, and treasures of the sort that each
supposed would give pleasure to the other. Because of his living for that year in
Annwfn and ruling it so successfully, and bringing together the two realms in one
by virtue of his bravery and valour. his name, Pwyll Prince of Dyfed, fell out of
use and he came to be called Pwyll, Head of Annwfiz, henceforth.6' (Italics mine.)
I already discussed in chapter three how the dichetal do chennaib nu
tuaithe, extemporaneous chant fiom the heads o f t h e tribe. may in fact be trance
possession.6' Cenn, like penn, can mean "head," but can also mean leader of a
realm as it does in Pwyll's case. To add to the case is the fact that he is said to
bring together the two realms. It might be argued that it is Hafgan and Arawn's
realms he has joined by getting rid of Hafgan. However, I think that the context
makes it quite clear that the realms spoken of are his kingdom and Annwfb.
Uniting this world and the other is, of course, what oracles do.
This is far fiom the only time in Celtic literature when a title suggestive of
assuming a divine role is given to a tale's protagonist after a significant interaction
with the Othenvorld.
As you'll recall, in the Aislinge when Oengus goes to the lake to take the
fKst ritual action on his own behalf and claim Caer as his beloved, his name
changes fiom Oengus, possibly "Chosen One," to in Macc Oc, or "the Young
Son.'"4 (Italics mine.) When he takes a title like those of his parents (the Dagda, or
Good god, and the Boann, or She of the White Cows or something to that effect) he
becomes the young son in the divine family. I emphasise the because the use of the
definite article implies that we are not dealing with a name but a title. One says. the
bus driver, or the professor, not the .Toe Bloggs (unless he is so famous that his
name has become a title in and of itself, like the Harrison Ford).
Yet another titling comes when Finn eats the salmon of wisdom and gains
the name or title of the other Finn to whom he was apprenticed. After he eats the

salmon, this other one, called Finneces, (Finn the poet), told that the boy’s name is
Demne, says, “Finn is your name my lad, and to you was the salmon given to be
eaten?’ He goes on to say, “and it is you who are the Finn in truth.” (ocus is tu in
Find cofi.).66The name Finn itself could mean either “Radiant One” or “Knowing
One,” or both, referring to “one who has bright knowledge and becomes
resplendent by its ~ i r t u e . ‘ ~ ’
Oesterreich, commenting on the way some worshippers of Dionysos took
on the god‘s name says, “Such identification always indicates a psychic
transformation. If the worshippers had not been changed into Dionysos the
transference to them of the god’s name would be inexplicable.”“ This
identification also explains why the worshippers described the god‘s voice.
expressions, in short, his physical presence so vividly at festivals. He was
physically embodied in one or more of his worshippers.
It is typical that the shaman takes on the attributes of his god. as he does
those of his totem. Indeed, many shamanic cultures, such as that of Kumaon in the
Himalayas, as well as much of South Asia. see possession as less an “eviction” of
the oracle than a merging of oracle and god.” Therefore. shamanic cultures often
call the possessing deities and their oracles by the same name. This can cause
confbsion even amongst contemporaries without the additional distortions of time
and text rescensions.
For example, one scholar said that there is difficulty in understanding what
is told about Melanesian spirits because ’The name Nopitu is given both to the spirit
and to the person possessed by the spirit, who performs wonders by the power and
in the name of the Nopitu who possesses him. Such a one would call himself

Obatala through his possessed oracle. ’
We may also contemplate the relation of the goddess Brigit to the Christian
saint Brigit. The ancient goddess Brigit. daughter of the Dagda, had two sisters.
The three were patronesses of poetry and seership, smithcraft and the healing arts.”
She was also concerned with fertility.73The saint retained many of the Primal
goddess’s features, not to mention sacred sites, as has been well chronicled
elsewhere.74In light of oracular ideas it may be more appropriate to think of this
saint as the Brigit.
Brigit’s name is a title to begin with, meaning something like “Exalted
One.”75 There is no doubt that she “represents the meeting and merging of
paganism and Chri~tianity.”H~er~ identity and mythos may in fact be a confluence
of the ancient Celtic goddess and the personality and history of that goddess‘s
oracle at the time of the Christian conversion.
Odin and Mit-Othin above may be Indo-European examples, and it’s worth
noting that the various double-barrelled deity names we find in the iconography,
generally interpreted as being local aspects of deities, may also have something to
do with this.77
One can go too far, of course. As Dr. Mark Scowcroft once said to me, to
say that every Irishman in the literature whose name incorporates “Lugh” in it is his
embodiment is like saying every Spanish girl called Maria is an avatar of the
Blessed Mother. Our next example, however, is more conclusive than a single
person named for a deity, it is a group described clearly as oracles.

not journey to the Othenvorld. Here the oracle may merge with the god, mingling

describe the Lwu, the Vodou deities, driving the gros bon unge, the big good angel
(one of two souls everyone has) out of a person’s head.78
A well known and clear example of this type of trance possession is to be
found in Giraldus Cambrensis‘ account of the twelfth century Awenyddion.
There are certain persons in Cambria, whom you will find nowhere else,
called Awenyddion, or people inspired; when consulted upon any doubtful event,
they roar out violently. are rendered beside themselves, and become, as it were,
possessed by a spirit. They do not deliver the answer to what is required in a
connected manner; but the person who skilfblly observes them, will find after
many preambles, and many nugatory and incoherent, though ornamented
speeches, the desired explanation conveyed in some turn or word: they are then
roused from their ecstasy, as from a deep sleep, and, as it were, by violence
compelled to return to their proper senses. After having answered the question
they do not recover till violently shaken by other people; nor can they remember
the replies they have given. If consulted a second or third time upon the same
point, they will make use of expressions totally different; perhaps they spoke by
means of fanatic and ignorant spirits. These gifts are usually conferred upon them
in dreams: some seem to have sweet milk or honey poured on their lips; to others
(it seems) that a written document is applied to their mouths, and immediately on
rising up from sleep after completing their chant, they publicly declare that they
have received this gift...they invoke, during their prophecies the true and living
god, and the Holy Trinity and pray that they may not by their sins be prevented
from finding the t r ~ t h . ’ ~
This fits many examples of trance possession precisely-we can compare
the elements point by point.
First, the Awenyddion are described as possessed. Cambrensis says that the
Awenyddion are possessed, and their name is based in a word that explicitly states
that their inspiring force comes fi-om outside themselves. Speaking of the “poetic”
78 MCtraux. 1972, p. 120 79 Tolstoy, 1985. p. 140



237
form of knowing, called the awen in Welsh sources, Ford says that the “special
characteristic of this knowledge is a ‘blowing’ or ‘breathing in,‘ literally
‘inspiration.’ In Irish the related word is az’. fiom *awi, ‘poetic art;’ its Welsh
cognate, still in use, is awen ‘poetic inspiration. One could thus even translate
their name as “the Possessed Ones.”
7’980
The Awenyddion become hysterical and incoherent in the early stages of
trance. Incoherence and hysteria are the first stages of possession in many cultures.
When one of the Alledjenu spirits possesses an Afkican member of the Bori
religion, the Alledjenu “fells this man or woman to earth.” Sometimes the “person
is so strongly affected that he becomes as if insane...”.*’ An African woman fkom
of the Bori “threw herself upon the ground in all directions, and imitated the cries
of various animals.”g2Cambrensis similarly describes the Awenyddion “roaring.”
The Awenyddion’s speech is ambiguous and convoluted. The meandering
and obscure quality of speech Cambrensis then describes is also present in some
cases of possession. This calls to mind shamanic sacred language, discussed in
chapter three in relation to thefordorcha, the “dark speech” of the poets.
The use of obscure sacred language can imply trance possession in a variety
of ways. First, it is sometimes based on animal cries, suggesting possession by the
spirit of that animal, or at the least a spiritual affinity or communion with them.
Even when language is recognisable, the oracle still sometimes requires an
interpreter, like the priests who interpreted the often obscure speech of the Delphic
oracles. Jamblich’s work on the mysteries states that divine possession “emits
words which are not understood by those that utter them...they pronounce
them...with an insane mouth...and entirely yield themselves to the energy of the
predominating god.’783One observer’s description of a Batak oracle’s language is
similar to Cambrensis’ description of the Awenyddion’s. “The words of this special
language are...in part cautious circumlocutions...and in part quite strange words.”84
This language was reminiscent of ancient Batak.
80 Ford. 1974a pp. 7-8 81 Oesterreich. 1974. p. 254 82 Oesterreich. 1974, p. 256 83 Oesterreich. 1974. p. 343 84 Oesterreich. 1974. p. 272. The Batak are a Sumatran tribe.



238
Similarly, Celtic poems with an oracular character like Amergin’s Rzin and
Taliesin‘s Cad Goddeu are crammed with archaisms and obscure words. We can
see these as survivals, deliberate archaising, or combinations of both. In any case,
the aura of age gives legitimacy to oracular utterance, suggesting that it is truly not
the medium himself speaking, but a god or ancient ancestor.
The Awenyddion do not remember what they have said. This is true in
many cases of possession. Sometimes the possessed have admitted that they
remember something to observers, but the quality of memory is changed. One
woman said she sees those assembled at the seance but does not recognise them?
Others believe themselves to have been genuinely possessed, but merged with the
god, so they retain memory, but feign that they have forgotten because this is a
convention that enhances the possession’s “authenticity” in the eyes of observers.86
The Awenyddion must be brought out of trance by violent means. This is
not entirely unusual in shamanism, as I showed in my examination of initiatory
illness. Although most shamans have good control of their state of consciousness,
there are occasions, especially when trance possession, when help is required to
return to a normal state and/or release the possessing spirit. For example. the
hamatsa must be doused in salt water to restore him to usual consciousness after
his p o s s e ~ s i o nI.n~ ~some cases a person possessed by a Vodou Lwa needs help to
come out of trance?* Cu Chulainn required a similar submersion to bring him out
of his riastrad!’
The Awenyddion‘s powers come in a dream, conferred by contact with a
substance. As discussed earlier, the idea that ingesting a substance can bring
spiritual awakening may possibly be a memory of psychotropic drugs used by
Indo-European peoples, or simply the result of their ongoing use of ale, wine and
mead.
There are various specifically oracular examples of this theme in shamanic
cultures. The Batak oracle’s lips were “unsealed” with a substance called piri

239
before he made his pronouncement^.^^ The oracle of Apollo at Deiradiotes at
Argos, and the Achaian priestess of the Earth became possessed by drinking the
blood of the sacrifices. This is closely paralleled in Santeria. In one account, a
student was upset that priests drink animal blood because of the Biblical injunction
that “the blood is the life” and properly belongs to god alone. A senior priestess
responded that ”the Orishas are manifestations of god. And as such, blood also
belongs to them.” Only a possessed priest will be seen drinking the blood of
sacrificed animals. These examples recall Mis’ blood drinking.”
That the substance that gives the Awenyddion their power may be honey or
milk has other associations in Celtic and other traditions. In Hunza, one shaman
acquired his powers when he went away to the peris or fairies on a mountain for
five days, receiving their power in a glass of blue m i k g 2I have also mentioned
earlier that milk is a powerful Zetoxifier of amanita muscaria, and can be combined
with it. Given the raving state of the Awenyddion. drug use would not seem entirely
outwith the bounds of possibility, though there are other explanations.
According to legend, to consume fairy food often means you become one of
them. As I will argue, fairies and oracles seem to be identified in some Celtic tales,
and milk is often the offering left out for the fairies.93
Cambrensis tells us that the Awenyddion’s power may also come through a
document being applied to their lips. Magical objects are typically given to the
shaman, sometimes placed in their bodies, in their visionary experiences, as
discussed in chapter four in relation to the shaman‘s physical equipment. In a
typical example, Arunta initiates receive numerous small crystals and magical
shells fiom he spirits.94
The Awenyddion declare their authority, Cambrensis says that
“immediately on rising up from sleep @er completing their chant, they publicly
declare that they have received this gift.” (Italics mine.)
This begs the question-was this “sleep” actually trance that they chanted

240
throughout, or did the chant occur after awakening and before the declaration of the
power that has come to them? In any event, it sounds more like a deliberate quest
or spirit journey than something that just happens to them. Although the text is
unclear on this point, the immediate declaration of authority is typical of an oracle.
For example, in Fiji, when the oracle is “seized by the possession. the god
within him calls out his name in a stridulous tone, ‘It is I! Katouivere!? or some
other name,”’ declaring his power.95
The Awenyddion invoke God. Invoking divine power is obviously an
essential component of oracular work. The Awenyddion invoke the power of the
Trinity. As noted earlier, oracular practice and other kinds of shamanistic practice
can easily co-exist with Christianity.
They pray that their sins may not prevent them from finding truth. Where
oracles are concerned, traditional cultures commonly believe that an oracle’s sins
or impurity can create ”static in the line“ and prevent the spirits manifesting
through them.96
POSSESSION AS INCARNATION
The final type of possession, if one can call it that, is total incarnation,
where the oracle is not just identified with the god or goddess during moments of
possession, but all the time. For example, Pele‘s priestess in Hawaii proclaims with
certainty. “I am Pele, and I shall never die.””
The famous woman oracle. Veleda. described by Tacitus, seems to have
been no less confident. She was ally of the Batavian leader Civilis in the first
century AD.98There has been much argument as to whether Veleda was German or
Celt. Classical authors sometimes conhsed Celtic and Germanic tribes and there
was a good deal of interaction between Celtic and Germanic tribes in the Rhineland
and elsewhere. Her name is more likely to be Celtic, corresponding to Irishfili and
Middle Welsh p e l e t both literally meaning “seer.”99As such, it is a title.

Veleda’s prophetic abilities brought her temporal as well as spiritual power.
since she had successfully predicted German victories. loo To inspire greater respect
among the people, Veleda “dwelt in a lofty tower, and one of her relatives chosen
for the purpose, conveyed, like the messenger of a divinity, the questions and the
answers. Elsewhere Tacitus says specifically that she was ”regarded by many as
a divinity. She was later “succeeded” by a woman named Ganna, showing she

established religious role.
THEWISECHILD
The avatar of a deity may be conscious fkom infancy of who they are, or the
realisation may come in stages later on, after being officially recognised as an
avatar and trained in the role as a child, like the tulkus, “Living Buddhas” of
Tibetan tradition.104
The figure of the “wise child“ of Celtic myth suggests the avatar-after all,
their wisdom has to come from somewhere. Taliesin speaks of many other lives. “I
have been a blue salmon,” he said, ‘‘I have been a dog, a stag, a roebuck on a
mountain. A stock, a spade, an axe in hand, a stallion, a bull, a buck.” When
Gwyddno, the father of his finder and patron, Elffin, wonders that this tiny baby
can speak, Taliesin responded that he was better equipped to answer than Gwyddno
to question him.lo5And no wonder-not only has he had numerous incarnations, he
is coeval with the Divine.

“first times,’’ primordial periods of history, such as Taliesin refers to above.
We may debate what deity or deities Taliesin embodied, in the poem above
he even shares Christ’s cross. However, the Irish branch of Celtic tradition has one
deity more associated with oracular practice than any other.
LUCHAND HISAVATARS
Lugh seems to be associated more closely with oracles than any other Celtic
god.”’ Like the Norse Odin, with whom he is so often compared, Lugh may have
been a deity to be emulated and possibly embodied, as well as worshipped. It is
also possible that the god Odin is a Celtic “import” into Germanic religion, or at
least strongly influenced by the figure of Lugh. l 2
Like Apollo, also well provisioned with oracles, Lugh’s focus on
manifestation through skilled action would make it seem natural for him to appear
in the bodies of his priests or avatars. Two related tales, one directly involving
Lugh, Baile in Scail, usually translated as the Phantom ’s Frenq, and Buile Chuinn
Chktchathaig both depict an apparently oracular process. l3
BAILEI N SCAILAND BAILECHUINN CHETCHA THAIC
Baile in Scail begins when Conn, High King of Tara, was walking Tara‘s
ramparts with his three Druids and filid each night, to prevent the Fomoire fi-om
taking Ireland unawares.
One night, he stepped on a partially buried stone. Its shrieks echoed
throughout Tara. Conn asked his fili, Cesarn, what sort of stone it was and why it
cried out. After fifty three days, Cesarn discovered it was called Fal, f?om fo-ail,
meaning the “under-rock,” that is, under a king, since it was used to inaugurate
kings. Its screams indicated the number of Conn’s progeny who would inherit the
throne of Tara.
“Tell me their names, Cesam.”
“It is not my destiny to reveal them.” he responded.

112 See Enright. 1996, pp. 270-279 I13 Dillon, 1946, pp. 11-14
1 11 Tolstoy, 1985, pp. 92-98



244
Suddenly they were surrounded by mist. A man on horseback approached
and cast his weapon at them three times. Conn stood his ground, though Cesarn
shouted in alarm. The man stopped and invited Conn to go with him. He did, and
soon they came to a plain with a golden tree, and a great palace with a centre pole
of white gold. A beautiful girl sat on a crystal throne in the house, wearing a golden
crown. She was the goddess of sovereignty, and had a gold and silver vat before
her, and a golden vessel and goblet beside her.
A magnificent figure was beside her on a throne, who said “I am not a
phantom and I am not a spectre,.’ he began. “and I have come after death to be
honoured by you, and I am of the race of Adam. 1 am Lugh, mac Ethniu, mac
Smretha, mac Tigernmar, mac Faelu, mac Etheor, mac Irial, mac Erimon, mac Mil
of Spain. I have come to tell you the span of your sovereignty and of that of every
prince that will come of you in Tara forever.“
The goddess fed Conn and each time she poured ale. she asked Lugh for
whom she poured, and he named another king descended fi-om Conn. Cesarn
inscribed them all on yew staves in ogham. Then Lugh, the goddess and their
palace disappeared. but the vat, vessel and staves remained with Conn.
Lugh does not just prophesy who will inherit Conn‘s throne He and the
goddess of Sovereignty dispense the dergzaith, a pun which can be translated as red
ale or red sovereignty. The yew tree has the potential to regenerate infinitely, so it
is an appropriate wood for recording a long-lived lineage. The entire experience
has an initiatory quality.
Baile Chuinn Chktchathaig is an earlier text. In this version, Conn himself
speaks the prophecy in an archaic rhetoric, with many of the names disguised as
poetic kennings. While Bailc! Chuinn and Baize in ScuiZ differ in form and content,
it is interesting that both are prophecies of the kings to reign after Conn, and that
one features Lugh speaking, the other Conn covering the same ground. It is also
interesting that the oldest one is Baize Chuinn.’I4This may possibly mean that the
earlier text is Conn‘s oracular utterance when merged with Lugh, taking the form
of poetic rhetoric that refers to Ireland as personified by the sovereignty goddess.’”

245
I have already shown the relationship between this kind of alliterative verse and
shamanistic practice in chapters two and three.
Chadwick suspects a connection between dichetul do chennuib and the
baile literature. She says, “It is impossible to avoid a suspicion that these
expressions somehow contain a veiled allusion to the haile literature. such as the
Baile in scail and the Echtra Cormaic. though so far as I am aware, ‘heads‘ are not
actually mentioned as playing a part in these stories. The redactor of the Echtru
Cormaic is at pains in his colophon to bring the baile literature, and these two
stories in particular, into the circle of Christian orthodoxy, and he tells us, in words
which sound like an echo of the colophon to Imbas.fbrosnai, that these experiences
were brought about by divine means, and were not connected with ‘demons.,,YI I6
In chapter three, I discussed the possibility that dichetal do chennuib nu
tuaithe may refer to trance possession. As will be recalled, this version of the name
means extemporaneous chant from the heads q f the tribe.”’ C‘enn can mean “head.”
but can also mean “chief’ or “leader” of a natural or supernatural realm. Amergin’s
Run, in which he says “I am the god who forms a mind of fire” is also called a cetal
do chendaib.”’ Therefore. ‘heads‘ in the decapitated physical sense do not need to
come into it at all. Rather, the connection between these tales may be trance
possession. The fact that the redactor clearly states that these experiences were
brought about by divine not demonic means. also points to trance possession of
either deities or ancestors.
In the Baize, Lugh says, “I am not a phantom and I am not a spectre, and I
have come after death to be honoured by you, and I am of the race of Adam.””’ He
traces his descent through the Milesian line, though he is also clearly the pre
Milesian god, Lugh. This alone suggests a line of oracles. Oracular abilities, like
shamanic abilities in general, can move through family lines, and Conn. as well,
was of Lugh’s lineage. It also suggests that Lugh is a god who can manifest in
mortal form, via oracular or other means. Of course, we cannot discount the fact
that contacting a pre-Christian ancestor would be seen as less ‘‘suspect‘’ than
1 16 Chadwick, N.K.,1935%p. 135 1 I7 Stokes and Windisch. 1880-1909. vol. 3, p. 1 17, Chadwick, N.K.,1935a p. 3 118 Chadwick,N.K..1935%p. 107 I 19 Dillon. 1946. p. 13



246
contacting a pre-Christian god.
There may also be an interesting etymological point here. Bade means a
trance or frenzy arising fEom spiritual vision.120SchZcan mean a hero, phantom or
super-being, human or supernatural.‘21Scaile, compared with the former term by
Pedersen, can mean a shadow. reflection, semblance or image of something. An
oracle can be thought of as a “reflection“ of a god, O’Brien equates s k d with the
Gothic sk%sZ, which he interprets as “demon” or “evil spirit.’”22The term has a
great range of meaning-from human to divine to demonic-a range of meaning
we typically find in the descriptors of shamanic oracles.
Accounts call Lugh the s c d par excellence. Chadwick thinks that a poetic
reference to Labraid Loingseach both identifies him with Lugh, and implies that he
has similar powers, that his “spirit still lives and is capable of reappearance,
perhaps of reincarnation.””3 Of course, if this poem is a panegyric on one of
Labraid‘s descendants, as Chadwick thinks is likely, this may mean in part simply
that Labraid and his descendants are worthy of Ireland’s sovereignty.
Some sources say that Lugh is the son of Scal Balb, the “Dumb or
Stammering Scal.” Scal Balb is also said to be Finn’s great grandfather. associating
him, and the term scaZ, with another shamanistic figure. There is also a tradition
that he was a foreigner, not proficient in Irish, hence the epithet balb.”4
If scd may mean oracle, and I have already shown the relationship between
oracular and shamanic practice and poetry, the Old Norse and Icelandic skci.Zd, the
ancient Scandinavian term for a poet, provides an interesting comparison. The
word has no satisfactory etymology.”’ It has been equated with the Irish sce‘l,tale,
however, given the complex of meanings and connections above, I suggest that it
might be translated as “oracle,” one uttering the kind of divinely inspired shamanic.

to state this as one possibility.

Carey says that we may situate the Bade Chuinn within a “farflung, ancient

context,” that derives the sovereign’s legitimacy fiom the supernatural realm.
oracular component would seem a natural manifestation of this process. While the
baile tales do not explicitly state that the kings involved are actually oracles. Fled
Bricrend makes a strong case for either Conchobar, king of Ulster, or Senchae,
another of the Ulaid, being an ‘*earthlygod” of the Ulstermen.
CONCHOBAR OR SENCHAE AS ORACLE
During one of the many brawls in Fled Bricrend, Loegure and Conall have
attacked Cu Chulainn over the champion’s portion and the accompanying right to
be declared champion of Ulster.
Ni rabi la Ultu fer no lumad a n-etergaire, CO n-epert Sencha f i i

There was no man among the Ultonians who dared separate them, till
Sencha spake Conchobar: “Part the men,“ quoth he. [For at that period, among
the Ultonians, Conchobar was the earthly god.] Thereupon, Conchobar and
Fergus intervened [the combatants] immediately let drop their hands to their
sides. “Execute my wish,” quoth Sencha. “Your will shall be obeyed.” the),

248
responded. “My wish then,” quoth Sencha, “is to-night to divide the Champion‘s
Portion there amongst all the host, and after that to decide with reference to it
according to the will of Ailill mac Miigach, for it is accounted unlucky among the
men of Ulster to close this assambly unless the matter be adjudged in
Cruachan.7’ I30
Henderson translates this passage to read that Conchobar is the earthly
god-however, I believe the Irish is ambiguous on this point. Gantz translates part
of the same passage as follows.
Not a man of the Ulaid dared separate them, however, until Senchae said
to Conchobur, “Part the men,” for Senchae was the earthly god amongst the Ulaid
in the time of Conchobur. Conchobur and Fergus stepped betv+eenthe combatants
then, and the men at once dropped their hands to their sides. “Do my will.“ said
Senchae. “We agree.” said the men.I3’
One problem is that Conchobar’s name is abbreviated to Con in the
manuscript, so one cannot tell if it was a genetive, Conchobur, or a nominative,
Conchobar.’32A genetive would result in the end of the sentence reading, “in the
time of Conchobur” as Gantz suggests.
In favour of Henderson’s reading. the goddess personified as queen seems
to be an institution in ancient Irish culture, as I shall discuss below, so it should not
surprise us that the king would also be seen as an embodiment of the divine.
In favour of Gantz‘s reading, the structure of the sentence, a gloss, seems a
bit odd. Ar is c! dia talmunda rob& oc Ultaib ind inbuid sin Conchobur seems a
strange word order. If it was Conchobar, I would expect Ar is e‘ Conchobar dia
talmanda robbi oc Ultaib ind inbuid sin. “For it was he, Conchobar, who was the
earthly god of the Ulstermen at that time.” However, because it is a gloss, the
scribe might have written all but Conchobar’s name, realised the ambiguity of the
statement. and added Conchobar‘s name to try and make it clear in a parenthetical
way, meaning something like, “For it was he who was the earthly god of the
130 Henderson. 1899. pp. 16-17 131 Gantz 1981. p. 226 132 Henderson, 1899. p. 16. line 9



249
Ulstermen at that time. [That is] Conchobar.”
Another point in favour of Gantz‘s reading is that after (and before) this
point, Senchae is the one giving all the orders, not Conchobar. It is Senchae who
actually asks Conchobar to intervene in the fjrst place, and after he and Fergus do,
it is apparently Senchae‘s will that must be obeyed.
Given that the text is ambiguous, and we cannot know for sure. there are
other points that would make Senchae an interesting candidate for ‘.earthly god.’‘
Senchae is elsewhere described as one of the three best warriors of U1~ter.I~~
Cu Roi said he was “A man of the world from sun to sun. a man who can make
peace with three fair words.”’” Perhaps these words are the formula he says above
and repeats later in the tale. He commands Fergus, Conchobar and the Ulaid with
the words “Do my will,” perhaps more correctly rendered with emphasis as: “Do
My will 7.,135
The idea that even a king must show great respect to an oracle is a feature
of many societies. The King of the Hausa of West Africa, of the Bori religion,
traditionally had to throw himself at the feet of the oracle when they met and assure
him that he would do the will of the gods as transmitted by the oracle. Following
this the king collected any necessary offerings from the people to make the
sacrifices the oracle demanded. Frobenius said that this pattern is present
throughout Central Afiica, not just among the Hausa, and believed the Bori
religion, a “religion of possession,” originally came from the East, possibly
Persia.
Reflecting possibly similar protocols, Mesca Ulaid says that it was “geis for
the king to speak before his druids did. Druids were also arbiters of all
sacrifices, implying their oracular role. because shamanic cultures believe that for
someone to know what the gods want they must either be in communication with
them or he them. For example, the possessed Katandirale or “Devil-dancer’’ of
Ceylon is “worshipped as a present deity.” He tells the people what gifts and

sacrifices he requires and they consult him about a wide variety of life issues.’3s
Besides the oracle‘s obvious ability to transmit the god‘s wishes, he can
also transmit the god’s judgement about other matters with unimpeachable
authority. Caesar, Strabo and Diodorus all tell us that Druids were well known as
judges, and could even stop a battle if they walked between the approaching
lines. Again, we see Senchae in the Druidic role of judge and peacemaker.
In Mesca Uluid he shakes his “peace keeping branch’ to stop a battle.14’ He
makes a brief peace again when he alone somehow perceives that it is a tumult of
the Ulaid’s quarrelling wives at the door rather than enemies and orders the doors
shut against them.I4’
Although he is not described as such, his outfit and equipment are those of a
druid or-fili. He is ancient and sleek, with a “bright cloak” fringed in silver, a
musical voice, white clothes and a “bronze branch the height of his shoulder.-7 112
He is paired with a druid in some stories, which suggests they -fulfil the
same fbnction. In Mesca Ulaid, the kingdom had been divided into thirds between
Conchobar, Cu Chulainn and Findtan. Senchae was sent by Conchobar to request
Cu Chulainn’s third for a year, and his opposite number, sent to Findtan. is
described as “the most excellent Druid, Cathbad?’ He is again paired with
Cathbad in a druidic role in the Exile of the Sons of Uisliu. When the unborn
Deirdre cries out in Fedilmid’s womb, Senchae calms the Ulaid and says, “Let the
woman be brought to us that we might learn what caused this noise.’’’4 They bring
Fedlimid to Cathbad and him. and the former divines the problem.
Like just about all oracles, (except those kept in isolation, like Veleda)
Senchae displays mixed human and divine qualities. His authority, and nerve, are
not absolute. In Bricriu’s Feast he silences the men but has no luck with the
women, and later in Mesca Ulaid he “dare not intervene,” in a battle.

A very human and rather fed up side is revealed in Bricriu’s Feast when Cu
Chulainn has destabilised the building to let Emer in. This was a “problem” for the
Ulaid, but when they came running to him he said, “I can only advise you to ask
the man who made the house lopsided to set it straight.77146
Whether Conchobar or Senchae is the “earthly god’ of the Ulstermen is to
some extent secondary to the fact that there is an .‘earthly god” in this account. This
much, at least, is quite clear, but all cases in the literature are not as easy to
interpret. The figures that present us with the most evidence for oracular practice as
a group are the Tuatha De.
BLURRELDINEST: HETUATHADE AS ORACLES
The Tuatha De are cor.tinually identified with poets and druids, who each
seem to have fulfilled oracular functions in Celtic culture. For example. Ban
Buannan, who lived in Sid Cairn Breactanan and trained the famous Druid Mog
Roith is described as one of the Tuatha De and as a Druidess.’47
The Tuatha De are strongly associated with magical pracices, having come
from four cities in the northern islands of the world where they studied magic.“*
The Dagda, Father god of their pantheon, is the Master of the Druidic Arts.’” As
Lugh discovered when he sought admission to the Tuatha De‘s assembly by virtue
of his magical powers, they already had a sufficency of sorcerers.
He said, “Question me, I am a sorcerer.”
“We do not need you. We have sorcerers already. Our druids and our
people of power are numerous.”

The etymology of the name “Tuatha De Danann” is much debated. one

associates it with the word dan, and the fact that their gods were Aes Dana. with
Lugh being SurniZdunach, all-skilled. This is sometimes referred to as a “folk” or
“poetic etymology,” but it is also the one the Irish Ziterati stressed.’j2 The fact that
the earliest text mentioning the tri dee Danann “refers to them as the tri dee d u m ,
(‘three gods of art’)?’supports the latter view. The oldest texts always use the terms
Tuath(a) De, aes side or sometimes siabrai, a term mentioned above and discussed
further below. 153
-,I51
There is no question that their name was associated with the word ddn by
the Irish Ziterati, whether or not it originally came fiom this word. If, as I have
suggested in chapter three, the word clcin in the largest sense stands for a complex of
ideas of co-creation and interchange with the divine, it would be an appropriate word
to associate with oracles.154
For various reasons, including a misplaced trust in the absolute historicity
of the texts, earlier scholars such as O’Curry and O’Donovan regarded the Tuatha
De Danann as real immigrants to Ireland who might have been technically superior
to the natives.’” Now. however, scholars generally regard them simply as the gods
of ancient Ireland?
The literature describes the Tuatha De or Tuatha De Danann variously as
immortal gods or as mortal heroes or wizards. Our discussion of euhemerisation
and the way god and oracle may share a name or title is relevant here. It is easy to
explain scribal confusion by recognising the Tuatha De as shamans acting as
oracles for deities, making them mortal and immortal, god and human hero or
wizard by
If this is so. some accounts may be purely mythic, about the transcendent
gods or goddesses, while some may have the more mixed character of the shaman’s
experience in a journey, or the experiences of the oracle’s audience. This may be

253
reflected in the fact that the Tuatha De or Aes Side have differing degrees of
manifestation in the stories.
For example, at the end of the SergZige, when Fand goes off with
Mannanan, everyone can see Fand, but only Cu Chulainn’s charioteer, Loeg, can
see Manarman? In this case, Fand, who is, like Manannan, described as one of the
Sid or Tuatha De, seems more like a human shaman. Here, Manannan is
incorporeal, and seems like Fand’s spirit mate, however, in another story
M a n a d n has enough physical presence to sire Mongan. Interestingly, he does so
in the form of Fiachna, the boy’s “human” father. another possible incidence of
possession, comparable to the way in which anyone sired on the festival of a god
was the “child” of that god in Greek culture.’59
These kinds of peculiar inconsistencies seem to speak of the Tuatha De as
both gods who could manifest on a purely spiritual plane. and their oracles who.
depending when you encountered them, could be human or divine.
Accounts of their arrival underscore their dual natures. Some say that they
arrived in a cloud of mist from the heavens, lighting down on a mountain top, while
others say they arrived in boats and burned them, hence the smoke.*60In the Cath
Maige Tuired they hail from islands “in the northern islands of the world,” ( i n
indsib tuascertachaib an domuin.)’6’ However, the word actually used here is
based on tzius, meaning above. North can also be seen as above, i.e., ‘up north,’ but
we might equally translate this to mean that they came fiom islands ‘above the
world.’ The word tuas is also used of heaven, and this is the origin suggested by the
compiler of the Book ofthe Dun Cow for the Tuatha De.162
He says that although wise men are not sure where the Tuatha De come
from, it “seems likely to them that they came fiom heaven, on account of their
intelligence and for the excellence of their knowledge.,7163
By contrast, the SergZige’s scribe reviles them as demonic, but gives us
158 Gantz 1981. p. 178 159 Rees, 1961. p. 221 160 Rees. 1961, p. 107 161 Gray. 1982, pp. 24-25 162 Royal Irish Academy, 1990, p. 612. headword tuas. 163 Evans-Went4 1990. p. 286, quoting fiom Kuno Meyer. Voyage of Bran,ii. p. 300. Here we have a clear statement that knowledge is sourced in the Otherworld in Celtic, as in ancient Chinese and other shamanic traditions. For example, see Chang. K.C.. 1983. p. 45.



254
some useful information by doing so.
So that is the destructive vision sent to Cu Chulainn by the people of the
Sid, for demonic power was great before the faith, and it was so great that the
devils would fight bodily against the people. and they used to show them
pleasures and hidden things as if they existed permanently. It is thus that one
believed in them. Therefore, it is on account of those visions that the ignorant talk
about the Side and Aes Side.’h4
Just as Dionysos’ worshippers describe their god as a physical presence. the
scribe at the end of the Serglige tells us that the Tuatha De contended bodily with
men. They are physical beings and demons. He says that the Tuatha De were
believed in as gods because they manifested physically, I would argue via oracles.
and showed the people visions and secrets of the Othenvorld, just as the shaman
does in his seance.
GODS AND NOT-CODS
The Book of the Dun Cow calls the Tuatha De “gods and not-gods.” dke and
andbe, comparable to the Sanskrit de-rw and ude-rw?’s The phrase suits oracles
perfectly.
The gloss on these terms in the Tain says: batar 6 a ndee in t’aes cumachta
agus andee in t’aes trebaire, ‘the dee were people of power and the andee
farmers. C’ciir A nmunn ’s scribe explained it as poets and farmers. interesting
because of poets’ well attested oracular practices.I6’ In Fled Bricrend the term bes
cumachta is used of “apparently supernatural agents’’ who help Cu Chulainn raise
the house single-handed.168
166
Rankin relates the term to the Rig Vedu 1.602, which speaks of ‘*thegods
who are the gods and the brahmins who have studied sacred lore are the human
gods.“ He says that the “distinction between dee and andee may be a modified
164 Dillon.1975.par. 49.mq translation. 165 O‘Rahillq.T.F.. 1946a p. 581 166 Rankin 1999, p. 117 167 Evans-Wentz, 1990. p. 286. quoting from Cbir Anmann. in Irische Tale III, ii, p. 355 168 Rankin, 1999. p. 1 19. The phrase is Lies cumacha agus a lucht anantha. He quotes from Henderson, G., 1899. par. 28.



255
inheritance of just such a concept of deified human beings associated with divine
affairs.” Where previously dee / andee may have meant divinities and druids, in
later times it “slips a notch” and comes to mean druids or ues dunu and farmers.
This is a demotion to a more secular status. If the categories were originally simply
human ones, there would have been no reason for the divine pairing in the first
place. 169
POETS AND THE TUATHADE
There are various examples of poets being equated with the Aes Sid or Tuatha
De besides the dee / andee examples above. One early Irish poet specifically traces
their descent from the Tuatha De, saying “Every artist, harmonious and musical, /
Folk wont to resort to tricks of magic, / Are of the host of the Tuatha De
Danann. Echtrue Cormaic describes a group of people thatching a house with
feathers in the first instance as a host of the Sid. Later, Manannk says, “The host of
horsemen of the Sid you saw endlessly thatching the house with white bird wings
are those of the Aes Dam the Men of Art, the poets and filid of Ireland who collect
cattle and wealth which pass away to nothing. This may possibly refer to their
using shamanistic powers purely for self-aggrandisement. Many traditions have
taboos against using spiritual powers purely for personal gain. In this case, such
powers might be represented by the white wings, such as might be used in an
encennach, tuigen, or other piece of totemic clothing.

The next figures in Celtic tradition who demand our attention are the female
figures, most often described as Tuatha De themselves, seen as manifestations of
the “Sovereignty goddess.”
THESOVEREIGNTY GODDESS
The well documented “Sovereignty goddess” is the figure who, perhaps
more than any other, can be most convincingly identified as an oracle.’72In many
169 Rankin, 1999,pp. 120-121 170 Rhys, 1892. p. 603 171 Stokes, 1891. vol. 1, p. 216 172 See Mac Cana 1955-56.0 Riain 1994, p. 35. O’Rahilly, T.F., 1946a pp. 15-16. 176. Herbert, 1992. p. 266



256
tales, the goddess dispenses the power of sovereignty when she dispenses a libation
and often, gives herself in the.feis or hanfeis, the sacred marriage, to the king.173
These goddess figures differ in the degree to which they seem human. In
some stories, like that of Niall Noigiallack she seems pure archetype. A hideous
hag who becomes fair when Niall embraces her, as sovereignty is foul at first, won
by wars and bloodshed, but a good thing all in all by the end.’74
It has been noted, however, that although this marriage is often depicted
mythically, it must have been enacted physically by human beings, and some tales
strongly identify the goddess with a human woman.’75For example, Cormac Ha
Cuinn dreamt that his wife slept with Eochu Gunnat and then returned to him,
which his druids interpreted as meaning that his kingship would “sleep with’
Eochu, but he would only reign at Tara for a year.’76In another account. the queen
symbolically embodied the people as a whole. Cormac mac Art sees Lugaid mac
Lugna decapitating Ulster‘s queen in a dream, which his druids say means that the
Ulaid will be defeated by Corrnac’s allies.177
Represented as a historical figure, she and the sovereignty of the territory
with which she was associated are bound together, “so figures such as Medb
Cruachan and Medb Lethderg, really the same, were personifications of the
sovereignty of Ireland. To gain possession of Medb was to gain possession of the
kingship, a fact which explained the unusual number of her Medb is
far from the only queen to display the mixed human and divine qualities of the
oracle.
Etain for example, is clearly described as queen as well as human
incarnation of a goddess of the Tuatha De. Like some Tibetan tulkus, she does not
remember who she is until Midir “recognises” her and awakens her memories.’79
The Pictish Princess of the Sid mounds mentioned above, who married the king of
Tar% gives us another possible human example. Mis and Mor Muman. another

257
Munster figure who has been linked with Mis, provide us with two more.180
Mac Cana has shown clearly that on one level Mor is a goddess figure, but
she also has an “initiatory crisis” strikingly similar to that of Mis. She starts hearing
a voice and will not leave the house, yet, the tale enigmatically tells us, “the kings
of Ireland were seeking her.”
One day she heard the voice say, “Woe to thee Mor,” and she responded
that she would “prefer it to be given than constantly promised.” It was given
indeed, so that “a great derangement (#dung)was put upon her and she bounded
over the liss.” No one knew where she went and she wandered in rags for two
years. A Tuvan shaman, Mongush Kenin-Lopsan, says that a person hearing his or
her name called presages initiatory illness. “The oldest myth about human beings is
this. A person hears his name pronounced. Perhaps he is in the taigu. Perhaps she is
beside a spring. This is the first sign of the coming illness.vi81
Mor finally came to Cashel, where Fingen mac Aeda was king, and tended
his sheep. Then, in a curious episode. Fingen’s wife offered him her brooch to
sleep with Mor, otherwise she would not sleep with him again. He finally
consented, and, in bed with Mor, asked her who she was. When she told him her
name her senses came to her. In the morning Fingen gave her the purple cloak and
brooch of the queen, telling the queen he was leaving her for Mor because she was
“of better race.” As with Mis, “every excellent woman in Ireland was compared to
Mor Muman.,9182
The value system we see operating here is clearly different than that of the
modern west. As in Mis’ tale, where she was deemed so valuable she must be
saved despite her depredations, Mor is perceived as valuable despite her
derangement and scruffiness.
Why is this ragged, demented woman considered to be “of better race?‘
Why does the queen want Fingal to sleep with Mor? And why, when Mor’s crisis
begins and she will not leave the house because of the voice fiom the sky, are the
180 It‘s interesting to note here that both Piaras Mac Gearailt and Eoin Rua 6 Sliilleabhriin writing in the 18th century referred to Mis as one ofthe leading rnnd si. or fairy women of Ireland (O‘Rahill?. T.F.. 1946b. p. 382) This reveals the same possible fairy/shaman blending discussed above, since some sources speak of Mis as a woman and others as one ofthe Aes Side. 181 Quoted in Van Deusen, 1997. p. 9 182 Mac Cana 1955-56. p. 79



258
kings of Ireland seeking this agoraphobe, presumably as wife?
If we look at this tale through a shamanic lens, most of it snaps into clear
focus. Like Mis, Mor’s derangement is the focus of the tale. As discussed in
chapter one, these deranged women are considered valuable, and of “better race”
because shamanic cultures believe the quality of a lineage is based on its shamanic
power. Their illnesses illustrate that they possess a high level of this power.
That the queen wants her husband to sleep with Mor is still somewhat
inexplicable, unless for some reason she thought the king should have a child out of
M6r. We are not told if she had children of her own. If she does not, or cannot, it
could be a simple case of her choosing a suitable surrogate, as in the Biblical story
of Sarah and Hagar, perhaps as concubine. Then she had the rude shock of being
replaced as queen because the surrogate was all too suitable.
All this is pure speculation, however, when Mor accepts the queen‘s cloak
and brooch, one gets the sense that these are badges of ~ f f i c e . ’ ~A’later episode in
Mor’s life is still more revealing.
She remained with Fingen and bore him a son...Then Fingen died and she
went to Cathal mac Finguine, king of Glendomain. For the kingship of Munster
was centred in Cashel for one period (of three), in Glendomain for the second and
in Aine for the third; for these are all Eoganacht...one day Cathal heard Mor
mourning her former husband...He pointed out to her that it was not proper to weep
for one who was dead, and she then promised to forget her dead husband and love
the living.’“
Here, as Mac Cana points out, we clearly have the Sovereignty goddess,
because the sovereignty passes with her to the new king.lS5 However, he also
comments on the difficulty of squaring her divinity with her presence in
genealogies as a historical figure.
Unsure if she actually lived, he asks if we are to regard Mor “as a historical
personage of the early seventh century upon whom various attributes...of a pagan
goddess were foisted by later tradition, or...as an unhistorical figure conceived in
183 It must also be noted that the transformation ofthe Sovereignty goddess fkom ill dressed hag or lunatic to radiant beadfilly attired woman is a ”set piece“ in these stories. See Mac Cana. 1955-56, pp. 84-85 184 Mac Can& 1955-56, p. 7 9 185 Mac Cana 1955-56, p. 81



259
the traditional pattern of the goddess and set in a particular place and in a particular
period of Irish history?”’86Her name may point us in the direction of a third option
Mac Cana believes Mor is one and the same as another Munster
goddesdqueen figure, Mugain.’87Her name is a feminine of mug, meaning slave or
servant, often servant of a god. The name is often associated with spiritual figures
like Mog Roith. The name of the queen in Beowulf, Wealhtheow, has similar
associations, and may in fact be Celtic derived. Wealhtheow has been shown by
Enright to be an oracular, prophetic representative of the goddess?
One wonders if the second component might not relate in some w7ay to the
word ain, meaning bright, fiery and swift. relating to words meaning ”frequent
traveller.” It is oRen borne by Eriu as an epithet, and there is also a goddess named
Aine.‘” O’Rahilly focuses on the solar symbolism of the word, but ideas of heat,
light, swiftness and especially equine symbolism, as we shall see. have shamanic
and oracular associations.
Taking all this into account, we may see Mor as a human woman, regarded
as divine or semi-divine due to her shamanic calling and lineage. In the account
above, she performs her transpersonul role as oracle despite personal feelings of
sorrow for her dead husband. In Mor, we can clearly see both sides of the oracular
coin.
Other potential oracular queens include the various Gonnlaiths. Feidlimid
mac Crimthainn, a ninth century king of Caiseal, who aspired to, and some say
attained, the high kingship at Tara, carried off one Gormlaith, Niall Caille’s wife. If
this actually occurred, Mac Cana wondered whether or not Feidlimid carried out
his abduction of the queen with “an eye to tradition. Was his action intended partly
to suggest that just as he had taken possession of Niall’s spouse of flesh and blood,
so also was he in virtual possession of that other spouse claimed by Niall, namely
the kingdom of Ireland.79 190
Again, I propose to take Mac Cana’s idea just one step firther. I believe that

these royal oracular figures were not symbolic of deities, they were the deities
embodied, and as such, were conduits through which divine power could flow to
the land fkom the Otherworld. Therefore, to steal the queen was to steal an actual
link with the gods, not a symbol of that link.”*
A final source is of particular interest in that it is a historical rather than
literary account dating back to the qfhcentury BC. It describes a southern Gaulish
wedding. Euxenos was the Phocean guest of the Gaulish king, Nanos, who had a
daughter called Petta. Euxenos arrived on the day of Petta‘s wedding and was
invited. The girl was allowed to choose between a variety of suitors who had come
to present themselves by giving them a drink. She chose Euxenos. who took her.
“changing her name to Aristoxene; for even her father considered it right that he
should have her on the grounds that the girl had been divinelyprompted to give the
cup to him.,* 192
This marriage led to Euxenos founding Marseilles, so, like the goddesses of
Ireland, the territory came with Petta It’s unlikely that any culture of this time
would base such an important marriage on a young girl’s whim, and indeed, the
account tells us that the only reason her decision was accepted was because she did
not choose, but the goddess in her.
ORACULAR ECHOEISN LATERTRADITION
The early literature is richest with explicit references to trance possession
and others that could be interpreted as trance possession, but there are also what
one might regard as “echoes” of trance possession in later folklore. As we see in
many of the accounts above, women are prominent in oracular roles and continue
to appear in these sorts of roles into later times.
For example, keening women, according to some views, aren‘t so much
makers as vehicles, and are sometimes referred to as bean chaointe. also frequently
used for the supernatural death messenger, more often known as bean si.193
191 There‘s a similar idea that the dikine king. embodying the god ’Tammuz could be carried off to ill effect in
192 Enright. 1996, p. 82, quoting from Ioannes Zwicker, Fontes historiae religionis celticae (1934). p. 2,

O‘Brien, has said that “...anyone who has heard the keen will feel...the
keener is as one possessed. The tribe speaks through her, resenting, striving to undo
the ‘vile subtraction,’ ultimately accepting it and falling back on propitiation to the
departed.7,194
There were also village healers who seemed to act as channels at one level
or another for supernatural power. One woman mentioned in chapter three said that
when she was called to attend as a midwife she felt “helpless in the g r a s p t h e
friendly grasp-of a power” that controlled her, and attributed her success to it.’95
There is also a very late but interesting case from the 1920’s. The Irish
Pegni Lynchi used to fall into trance at wakes and give what has been described as
“public trance performances.” She spoke with the spirits, acting as their
mouthpiece, transmitting their messages to her community, who publicly
acknowledged that this was, ia fact, what she was doing. Community support and
benefit are important evidence that someone is acting fully as shaman. Indeed, 0
Crualaoich has said the term shaman “might be tentatively invoked” in her case.’96
Her example requires hrther investigation, of course. We cannot know how
much may have been drawn from later spiritualist influences as opposed to Primal
Celtic ones. Whatever the source, her “performances” gave her greater power in her
community-an observable feature of possession phenomena in many cultures.
Later folk-tradition has continues to attest powerful women with divine
attributes, and often blurs the lines between witches, fairies and druids, suggesting
the same sort of divine/human conhsion we saw in relation to the Tuatha De.197
For example, the Cailleach a’ Bheinn Mhoir, the Witch of Jura, like so
many fairy women in the tales, fell in love with MacPhie of Colonsay and captured
him. When he tried to escape she threw a magic ball of yarn into his boat and drew
him back, just as the fairy queen in Imramm Mael Duin does. The ball of yarn itself
is called a ceirde dhruidheachd.’98Many Scottish witch trial accounts reveal a
great deal of overlap between fairies and witches and Evans-Wentz has noted that

the F a i v Faith could be based on memories of Druids.’99
Fairy changelings behave in much the same way as earlier avatars like
Taliesin, revealing knowledge of ancient times. In the later tales, they are tricked
into speech by a bizarre act, like cooking in eggshells. One says, “I remember when
they were building Babel, and never heard before of a brewery of eggshells.+ 200
Now, however, the changeling is viewed with horror rather than the delight. Often
described as wizened or deformed, as well as possessing unusual knowledge, the
supernatural child is no longer the radiant child of a Deity, but the evil child of a
devil.2o ‘
With the advent of Christianity. knowledge must only come through
approved channels; any supernatural knowledge not gained through approved
sources (i.e. the minister or the Bible) is classed as demonic.202It is well put in the
Senchas Mdr which tells us that aAer Patrick, the speech of the chroniclers. men of
art and judges “is under the yoke of the man of white language-that is. of the
Bible.”203
Needless to say, this spelled bad news for the oracles. Obviously a caste of
such highly trained, highly revered figures would not “go gentle into that good
night,” so one would expect to find traces of the ensuing conflict in the literature
and we do.
THE CAILLEACH AND CORMAC’S DRUIDSO: RACLES DEPOSED?
The cailleach and sovereignty goddess figures are inextricably linked. One
of the most famous figures in Celtic tradition is that of the Cailleach Bhe‘arra. The
poem placed in her mouth depicts her mourning the loss of her succession of noble
kings. Significantly. she passed into seven periods of youth, rather than remaining
ever young, which suggests a succession of oracles. Also suggestive is the Book o f
Leinster’s statement that her people, the Corco Duibne, would “never be without

some wonderful caillech among them.
There is no lack of prose written about the poem and the figure of the
cailleach herself, most commenting in one way or another about her ambiguity.2o5
Mac Cana has said that perhaps “no text in Irish literature achieves such a rich and
dramatic expression of the interplay of the human and the divine, the temporal and
the eternal, as the Caillech Bhirri.” One reason it has such power and seems to
mask a deep underlying ideological complexity is that it epitomises a state in
society at the time, the tensions between Christian and primal ideas and ways of
being.206
In the poem, we seem to hear goddess and woman vying with each other.
She speaks ofher hands, bony and thm, yet in times past, “When my arms are seen,
all bony and thin!-in fondest fashion they acted, once: they used to be around
glorious kings. This seems to refer to a woman outside of time, wife of many

McKay interprets a later Scottish tale of the cailleach as describing a
priestess and possibly goddess spurned. The cailleach of this tale, protectress of the
deer, has a great battle with a hunter in which her dual human and divine natures
are revealed. As a mortal woman she is pulled over coals by her ankles in the
combat, yet, as McKay points out, the Cailleach Bheurr could wade across the

might mean either a goddess or priestess. divinity or mortal. and a time when story
tellers failed to distinguish between them.*,210
If the cailleach is in fact the ageing avatar of an immortal goddess, she
would particularly feel the bittersweet experience of age and loss in the knowledge
of eternity. However, there are additional losses.
In the poem of the Caillech Berri, the conflict between native myth and
Christian ethic is personalised in the individual predicament of the once beautiful
consort of kings who struggles to resign herself to her actual condition as an
uged und impoverished nun. At the same time, though on another leve!, the
introverted heroine is the great and immortal goddess of sovereignty who not
merely shaped the destinies of kings but also by her inexhaustible chthonic power
helped to shape, in other words create, the very landscape of Ireland. Yet in
accepting Christianity she has become subject to age and death, as Oisin, son of
Finn, succumbed to physical decay when he returned from the ageless
Otherworld and set foot once more on the finite shore of Ireland.2" (Italics mine.)
If she was an oracle, one with her goddess, she would not have felt subject
to death in the same way as most people, anymore than a tulku confident of rebirth
However, with Christianity, the god resided in a book rather than a body.
And though an eternal life in heaven was promised, it may have had less pull than
the eternity here and now in god's great day, where death was truly but the "mid
point of a long life.-32 13
CORMAC'S DRUIDS
King Cormac is said to have died when cursed by a group of Druids. In
some versions, it is because he refuses to worship their gods, in others, it is because
2 10 McKay. 193 1. p. 18. It's interesting to note that formerly cailieach meant veiled woman. A primal priestess might have gone about veiled to protect people from her power. just as the shaman is often veiled or masked during their uork. For example. the headgear I+ith fringes in front of'the face of the Siberian shaman. (VajnStejn.

he refuses to worship them as gods. As we have seen, both could essentially mean
the same thing.
One version of the tale says Maelchend the Druid’s wrath was aroused
against Cormac Mac Art because Cormac would not worship Cromm Cruaich. He
then cursed the king by turning stones in a convocation of Druids. However, in the
Four Masters version Maelchend is angry because Cormac “worshipped god rather
than them.” The insult to Cromm is not mentioned here, but rather the insult to the
priest’s divinity is the Maelchend was not alone in claiming divinity.
Other Irish druids evidently said that they were creators o f heaven and earth.’”
What‘s more, Maelchend “accomplishes his end by means of a siabrad,
which denotes the form of magic practiced by the Siabhras, or Daoine-Sidhe,
The association between

This manuscripts says that King Cormac was killed by “the Siabhras, i.e. the

Of course, the literary evidence was written down in a Christian context, so
we cannot tell which of the interpretations above is closer to the truth. Fortunately,
pre-Christian Celtic sculpture gives us further evidence for trance possession that
could not be similarly re-fiamed.

THEICONOGRAPHY OF POSSESSION
I do not believe that one can necessarily read objects or art like a book for a
clear narrative as some have It is extremely difficult for a scholar to
try to reconstruct an ancient belief system through the use of material and
iconographic remains.*I9
Celtic iconography is relatively scarce before the 7‘h century BC. This
might be due to the iconoclastic views the early Celts are described as having, as
demonstrated by Brennus mocking the whole idea of religious imagery at Delphi.
This changed dramatically in the Romano-Celtic period.
Celtic religious imagery blossomed, due largely to the adoption by the Celts
of Classical traditions of representation. Under the stimulus of Roman custom, Celtic
communities adopted the practices both of making images of their deities and
recording their names on dedicatory inscriptions. Thus, for the first time, Celtic
perceptions of the spirit world are brought into sharp focus.”’
Green goes on to discuss three themes in the iconography: the human head.
whose cult significance is well attested. triplism, reflecting ”the perception of
divine forces as triads,” and zoomorphism, stressing the importance of animals in
Celtic religion. “All three types of image-making have links with later Celtic myth,
where we read of heads with supernatural properties, triads, and shape-shifting
between animal and human form.””’
I would suggest that one way we could deepen our understanding of the
Celtic perceptions of the spirit world as expressed through the iconography is by
comparing the imagery with that of other cultures, particularly animistic and
shamanistic cultures. One reason for doing so is that there is evidence suggesting
that similar states of consciousness can produce similar expressions and postures,
which may, in turn, be expressed artistically in comparable ways.222 While
iconographic evidence is certainly not conclusive on its own, in this case it is
striking. (Figures 1- 16 are at the end of this chapter, pp. 285-291.)

267
It has already been observed that some figures generally considered divine
in Celtic iconography may actually be priests or shamans. For example, the
Cernunnos on the Gundestrup Cauldron, in figure 6 may actually “be interpreted as
a shaman, a shapeshifter, or a god perceived as having a part-human, part animal
shape.”””
A recent paper also identified the famous, torc wearing head shown in
Interestingly, that figure has

some attributes that may relate to trance and possibly trance possession. For one
thing, his mouth is pursed in a tight “0” which suggests that he is chanting, or at
least vocalising in some way. As will be remembered, in chapter two I discussed
the dordjiannsa, the droning chant the Fenians made by pursing the lips together,
possibly reminiscent of Tuvan throat singing or overtone chant. For an even clearer
example of this sort of expression on the face of an apparently chanting person, see
figure 2?”’ Next, he has a mask like face and large, staring eyes, frequent features
in Celtic depictions of sacred figures.
We may attain a possibly deeper understanding of these features of Celtic
art by reference to the art of one of the best known religions that feature possession
in the modern world: Haitian Vodou.2’6
There are physical manifestations of Vodou possession depicted in
photographs and sculptures that make for interesting comparisons to Celtic
iconography. These artistic conventions date back to ancient Afiica.
Thompson says that in Vodou a “face in trance inscribes, in the flesh, an
,2227
Afiican mask on New World soil. And with the mask go attitude and posture.
There is one element in particular he notes as a manifestation of possession.
...one of the unifying threads is a frequent bursting quality of the eyes as
they fiil with inner vision (ojzi inun in Yoruba terms).When this happens. the face
takes on a timeless gaze. That bursting quality of the eyes is one of the marvels of

the art of African antiquity...We can study a delicate rendering of possession eyes
on an early 15‘hcentury fragment from a ritual pot from the ancient Yoruba city
of Owo, now in the National Museum, Lagos.(fig. 9) The moment of truth is
underscored by massive reptiles issuing fi-omthe nostrils, “representing the power
of the ashe, (spiritual command) of those-who-keep-the-earth.9228
Various accounts of Kongo possession describe the same phenomenon. In a
1668 account a priest is described as chanting, then “his eyes would exorbit, and he
would become possessed by the spirit of Triko.” Compare this description and the
photograph of a possessed man taken in the fifties in figure 3 with the 1’‘ century
BC Celtic image of a staring man in figure 4.22’ “In the extremity of the eyes one
reads the coming of a spirit. astonished to find himself emerging, in borrowed
flesh, from the land of the lwa, Erom the island beneath the sea.9,230
I have included other images for comparison. See. for example, the
resemblance in expression and gesture between the photograph taken of the
possessed Kwakiutl Hamatsa emerging from the woods in figure 5 with the three
Celtic images that accompany it, figures 6 through 8.231The anthropologist
Felicitas Goodman has made a detailed study of the ways in which similar “trance
postures” found in iconography and modern practice, may produce or represent
particular kinds of trance experience, perhaps for neurophysiological
Now look at the similarly “exorbited” eyes in the two sculptures that
follow, the Afiican figure 9, and Celtic figure 10.233This type of eye. so common
in Celtic sculpture, has been seen as a sort of far away, mystical gaze, that oRen
appears in Deity representations.

oracle. The similarity of depiction is particularly marked in figures 11 and 12?
Finally, figures 13 through 16 show various animal / human combinations
that Green has interpreted as possible shaman shape-shifting figures merged with
or possessed by totems or deities. As we can see in these pictures, many animals
may be associated with the shaman and shaman oracle. In four I explored the
totemic associations of the bird and the shaman. Figures 13 and 14 possibly show
the shaman merged with a stag.236
However, the most intriguing animal association with the shaman us oracle
is one we may see depicted in figures 15 and 16.237In these, humans merge with
horses, one woman-headed horse being driven forward by a mysterious being
above her.
RIDDE BNY THE GODS: EQUINIEMAGERY AND THE ORACLE
The horse’s sanctity is well known in Celtic tradition.238It is often
associated with sovereignty, most obviously in the usvumedha type of sacrifice in
India and Ireland.239Most important to the issue at hand, the horse is especially
associated with queen figures, who, as we have seen, may also be connected with
oracular practices.
The Welsh queen Rhiannon is a prominent example. She appears to Pwyll
when he engages in what can only be described as a vision quest on a grave mound.
Arriving on a magnificent horse, she marries him, and finally bears a child. The
child is supernaturally kidnapped, and she is accused of infanticide. She is then
made to carry visitors to court on her back and tell them her tale.240
The three Machas of Ireland give us examples where the woman’s possible
oracular role seems closer to the surface. First, the repetition of the divine name
recalls the earlier discussion of oracular titles. The first Macha is then described as
a prophetess, wife of a druid. The second was called Mongruad, red-maned, and
her father, Aed, had contracted with two other kings to share sovereignty in a

triumvirate fashion for seven year periods, in a similar arrangement to that
described in Mor’s story. However. upon Aed’s death, Macha claims sovereignty
herself. and keeps it for seven years by force of arms. The third and best known
Macha could run like the wind, and was forced by king Conchobar to race against
horses despite her pregnancy. This resulted in her curse against the Ulaid that they
should be in the pains of a woman in travail when they most needed their
strength.24’Speed, as described in the cases of Mis and Suibhne, can be a shamanic
characteristic, and Macha was also capable of cursing a whole tribe, pointing to
further shamanic abilities.
Horse oriented epithets are very common in Celtic tradition. most especially
amongst divinities and royalty.
Medb is...a sovereignty-conferring warrior-harridan and fountain of
sexuality alike, whose nearest undebased parallels are the warrior goddesses
Morrigu and Badb. Her relation to the former is evident from the fact that Medb
and Morrigu both figure as interchangeably active in various versions of the
prelude to the Tuin, and bird symbolism ties her closely to the ornithomorphic
Badb...Her lover Fergus was known as Ro-ech, ‘Big Horse,‘ and the third of her
four husbands...was named Eochaid, a name also borne by the two husbands of
Tailtiu, the divine nurse of the god Lugh who closely resembles Eriu
herself...Emhaid may be connectable with Old Irish ech, ‘horse,‘ and with the
epithetal string Eochu Ollathir Ruadrofessa, ‘Horse, All-father, Red Great Sage,‘
that characterises the god Dagda.242
He goes on to say that he doubts that “Medb’s name simply means
‘intoxication’ or the like. and would rather interpret it as “a Celtic *Meduii,
uncornpounded feminine paralell to the Arvernian Epomeduos, much as Badb
corresponds to the Gaulish Cathubodua. Medb’s name would thus be associated
with horses as well as intoxication. This association can be seen as shamanic, and
particularly. as oracular.

shamans.’@ The Muri Luyd and hobby horse figures are of particular interest in
that they perform at a liminal time, typically twelfth night, and are often made of a
horse skull, seemingly between death and life, a theme we’ll return to in the next
chapter in relation to shamans.245The normal way of riding a horse 6om place to
place in this world often segues into an encounter with the Otherworld in the tales,
calling to mind the totemic horse and horse/drum of Siberian tradition that
transports the shaman into Otherworld.246
Shamans are often identified with horses. For example, the Hungarian
shaman is called a taltos, a noun also commonly used in folk tales to describe a
spiritually powerhl or magical horse.247In a Sakha Siberian ritual described in the
19203, the shaman calls himself a “stallion shaman.” The ritual .‘built in intensity.
enabling ecstasy and inspiration, until the shaggy stallion shaman dance-rides and
thus unifies himself with his sacred drum-horse.,9248
As the Siberian example infers, the symbolism of horse and rider can
represent the merging of separate yet allied powers to form a more potent whole.
Along these lines, possessed oracles are almost universally viewed and
described in shamanic cultures as a horse the god rides. Women of the Zar cult are
called yuzcir farus, the horses of the Zar spirits.249The relationship of the Lwu to
the possessed is that of rider and horse. The Vodou priests and priestesses are the
horses of the gods, the gods themselves the Divine Horsemen.”’ In the central
Himalayan region of Kumaon, the oracle is the dunguri, the ‘little carrier’ or ‘beast
of burden,’ or the ghori, the ‘little horse.’25’Examples could easily be multiplied
firther.252

272
THERACES OF FERADACH
All this symbolism provides further evidence for the oracular role of queen
figures with equine associations, and a couple of curious accounts in Irish literature
give us still more. First, there is an anecdote of women performing what’s
described as a grafuing. or horse race in the funeral rites for the Danish dead after
the battle at Sulchoit in 968 AD.
It was then they celebrated also the races of the son of Feradach, viz., a
great line of the women of the foreigners was placed on the hills of Saingel in a
circle, and they were stooped with their hands on the ground. and marshalled by
the horseboys ofthe army behind them, for the good of the souls of the foreigners
who were killed in battle. 253
Despite the fact that this is called a horse race, neither racing or even
motion is described, except that implied by the mairescud or “marshalling“ of the
gillies. Todd says that the “whole was no doubt a heathen performance, intended, in
some way, to benefit the souls of those who had fallen in battle.”254 This calls to
mind the equine figure as psychopomp, as in the case of Epona. mentioned above.
The women’s posture. and the fact that it is associated with horses, is also
interesting.
Describing the initial stages of Vodou possession, when the god “seizes his
mount,.’ Metraux tells of one oracle leaping and bucking like a wild horse who
“feels the weight of a rider on his back.””’ The possessing entity “seizes the head”
of the possessed, holding on at the base of the neck, and some possessed by the
Vodou Lwa compare the first “inrush of the spirit to a blow on the nape of the
neck.7‘256
The oracle often pitches forward in response to this, “as though projected
by a spring,” and stiffens and stays still “with body bent forward.77257 his bent

hands outstretched and palms downwards, is a frequent possession posture. The
Iroquois “False Faces,” a masked Medicine Society, are sometimes called
hunchbacks due to their characteristic crawling or hunched forward possession
postures. Goodman and others see these postures as motor behaviours characteristic
of dissociated states.258
The role of the gillies in “marshalling” the women also makes sense in this
context. In Vodou, the possessed are “protected ~ o tmhe possible effects of their
f?enzy by the crowd which surrounds them...if they fall, arms are ready to catch
them...their modesty is shielded: a woman rolling on the ground, convulsed, is
followed by other women who see to the disorders of her dress.” The sympathe ic
concern creates an atmosphere of trust and safety “conducive to total abandon in
the state of trance.,7259
Putting all this together with our Irish account leads me to believe that what
we may be seeing here is a garbled description of trance possession. The writer
clearly understood that the women were at least imitating other beings, horses. One
could imagine that the idea of the oracle as a horse of the gods, coupled with the
trance posture could come down to us this way, although we cannot know for
sure.260
THEDRUIDSOF FERCNA
There is also a strange, possibly related, incident in the Book of Fenagh.
The Druids of Fergna of the Steeds, Son of Fergus, King of Brefne perform a
curious ceremony in resistance to St. Caillin and his clerics. Fergna was enraged
when St. Caillin converted his son and others, and ordered his druids into action.
They are then described as putting their rumps (tona) in the air and advancing
towards the saint reviling him and his clerics. The saint turns them into stone. but
Fergna do not convert till his “body separated from his soul.7 7 2 6 1 Hennessy

comments on the similarity of this and the prior account.”’ This is not conclusive
in and of itself, but again we see the same curious posture used to attempt to effect
a spiritual purpose, in this case cursing the clerics, where in the prior instance it
was for the benefit of the dead. There is even an oblique horse reference
immediately before the episode in Fergna’s epithet, “of the Steeds.”
For another possible example of trance possession, I must turn again to the
figure who has thus far demonstrated more shamanic features than any other in this
study, Cu Chulainn.
C U CHULAINN :WARRIOR AND ORACLE?
The tale of Cu Chulainn‘s conception, as the Reeses have noted, s e e m to
represent a three-fold process of transition from fully divine to fully incarnate.263In
one version, Dechtine, Conchobar’s daughter, and the rest of the Ulaid pursue a
flock of beautiful but destructive birds.264At night they arrive at a house where
they are welcomed. The man says his wife is in labour and she gives birth to a son.
Simultaneously a mare gives birth to two foals. In the morning, these three are all
that is leR of house and host. Dechtine takes the boy but he dies.
Then she dreams of Lugh, who tells her that the first boy was his son, and
he will now come into her womb and she will bear a child called Setanta. Her
mysterious pregnancy causes the Ulaid to suspect her father has slept with her. She
is betrothed to Sualdaim mac Roich, but is so ashamed she aborts her child. Finally
she conceived again with Sualdaim, and this Setanta becomes Cu Chulainnzhs
Other figures like Mongan are children of a god or divine being, but none
have such an elaborate gestation process. This process seems to be one of
emanation. where the divine father manifests by elaborate stages in the world,
rather than one of a divine father and human mother producing a third party.
Like Lugh, Cu Chulainn has many skills, including shamanic, and his
riastrud strongly suggests possession. He said his education with the druid Cathbad
had “made him master of inquiry in the arts of the god of druidism...and rendered

him skilled in all that was excellent in visions.
He certainly thought well enough of himself, but was also adored by the
Ulaid, and likely seen as an avatar, evidenced by the fact that they wanted to be
sure that he have a son for they knew “his rebirth would be of himself.77267
The only way a direct reincarnation of his own soul could be accomplished
is if he died at the moment of conception. or at least during the pregnancy. We
cannot rule the idea out, aRer all, he was supposed to have a short life, but it is not
mentioned as part of the process. However, if he is an avatar or oracle of Lugh,
then. as is the case in many shamanic cultures, his son could inherit his link with
the god.
The first recension of the Tain gives us an incident that strongly suggests
trance possession. When Cu Chulainn is wounded and exhausted, Lugh appears to
him, and tells Cu Chulainn that he is Cu Chulainn’s father. He sings healing spells
and replaces Cu Chulainn for three days in a battle without anyone knowing.
Revealingly, only Loeg sees the god at first, no one else in camp can?” In the Book
of Leinster version, Cu Chulainn sleeps for three days and nights, a shamanically
significant number, as mentioned in chapter two.
When Cu Chulainn is rejuvenated. his and Loeg’s preparations for battle.
and the subsequent battle itself, have many supernatural elements.269Loeg puts on
his raven feather mantle (forbratt faing) made by Simon Magus, and other
elaborate equipment.”’ Cu Chulainn casts spells of protection and invisibility on
his horses and on Loeg. His attire, like Loeg’s, is elaborate and has supernatural
associations. He wears a protective raiment given to him by Mannanan f?om the
king of Tir na Sorcha (the Land of Light). He also wears the helmet mentioned in
chapter four, that “goblins and sprites, spirits of the glen and demons of the air”
cried f i o q prophesying the deaths of other warrior^.'^^
It is interesting to note that the description of Cu Chulainn’s war helmet,

276
apparently inhabited by an assortment of familiar spirits, immediatezy precedes a
vivid account of Cu Chulainn’s riastrad. Cu Chulainn’s riastrad is a fascinating
and much debated phenomenon. In practice, it refers to Cu Chulainn’s battle
fienzy, which contorts or distorts him.272
In this account, Cu Chulainn is quite literally “ridden’‘ by the spirits (of the
helmet) and goes into riastrad. After Cu Chulainn creates great carnage the Tain
says that some say that “Lug mac Eithlend fought along with Cu Chulainn at
Sesrech Breslige.” This seems a clear indication that the riastrad is some kind of
possession, and certainly bears a closer look.
R~ASTRAD
All the Ulster warriors, including Cu Chulainn, can go intoferg, the battle
rage described in chapter two. However, only Cu Chulainn gets a riastrad-and no
one else seems as likely to be an avatar or oracle of the god L~gh.‘~I.t‘is therefore
reasonable to investigate whether trance possession and the riastrad may be linked.
His riastrad gives him power in combat and in some cases power over
animals. like the swans and deer he ties to his chariot after he kills his first men.
Like the possessed Kwakiutl hamatsa. he is only restored to reason by immersion
in tubs of water and exposure to naked women.274
An easy way to spot the supernatural in literature is, obviously, when
something happens that could not possibly occur in physical reality-at least not
while leaving our hero intact.
Then his first distortion came upon Cu Chulainn so that he became
horrible, many-shaped, strange and unrecognisable. His haunches shook about
him like a tree in a current...every limb and every joint, every end and every
member of him from head to foot. He performed a wild feat of contortion with his
body inside his skin. His feet and his shins and his knees came to the back; his
heels and his calves and his hams came to the front...He sucked one of his eyes
into his head so that a wild crane could hardly have reached it to pluck it out from

277
the back of his skull...His mouth was twisted back fearsomely. He drew the cheek
back from the jawbone until the inner gullet was seen. His lungs and his liver
fluttered in his mouth and throat...the torches of the war goddess...were seen in
the clouds and in the air above his head with the seething of fierce rage that rose
above him...Though a noble apple tree weighed down with h i t had been shaken
about his hair, scarcely one apple would have reached the ground through it but
an apple would have stayed impaled on each single hair because of the fierce
bristling of his hair above him. The hero‘s light rose from his forehead...As high,
as thick, as strong, as powerful and as long as the mast of a great ship was the
straight stream of dark blood that rose up from the very top of his head and
became a dark, magical mist like the smoke of a palace when a king comes to be
attended to in the evening of a wintry day.27s
Cu Chulainn shakes ~iolentlyat the start of the riastrad. In Kimbanguist
tradition to shake, (zakama). or shake violently, (tuntuka), is a sign of possession,
of being chosen by the Strange contortions and distortions are not
uncommon in possession, as anyone who has seen The Exorcist knows. One
Polynesian account describes a case of voluntary possession t h s way:
As soon as the god was supposed to have entered the priest. the latter
became violently agitated, and worked himself up to the highest pitch of apparent
frenzy. the muscles of the limbs convulsed, the body swelled, the countenance
became terrific, the features distorted, and the eyes wild and strained.”’
Though no one else gets the full riastraid, the earlier account of Mog Roith
in chapter three has his knees turning backwards, also in the context of shamanic
battle, and his hair becomes rough as a pine. A similar process of spiritual
disjointing happens to each Australian shaman as part of his initiation. It has to do
with making him symbolically dead-the point being that a dead man cannot be
killed.278
Sayers discusses symbolism of heat and eruption “with strong graphic ties

to blacksmithing” associated with the images above.779Eliade has discussed the
generation of mystical heat as a key feature of shamanism and yogic practices, and
as one Siberian source says, “the smith and shaman are fiom the same nest.280
In chapter three, discussing the teinm Zuidu, I mentioned that the word tenm
comes fiom the root *tep-, meaning “heat.” the same root that gives us the Sanskrit
tupus, meaning mystically generated heat and spiritual power.’81There are many
Hindu stories of people who rise to the position of Indra, leader of the gods,
through their tupus. 82
Perhaps the ultimate manifestation of the 1Jlstermen.s .ferg, martial fury or
heat, is Cu Chulainn’s ri’ustrad. Where the Ulstermen have spiritual and martial
power, Cu Chulainn may have attained an ultimate goal of this power-merging
with the god.
The character of this “possession” if it is in fact possession. is ambivalent.
As I will discuss in the next chapter, Lugh in particular is a deity that encompasses
many polarities of action and identity. Celtic deities in general seldom seem wholly
“good” or “bad” but rather, may behave benevolently or aggressively as it suits
them.
Cu Chulainn‘s ri’ustrad can be seen as positive or negative by the Ulaid. In
the most severe state, he cannot tell fiiend f?om foe. He is described as binding
himself tightly with ropes and thongs beneath his battle gear so that “his mind and
understanding might not be deranged when his rage should come upon him.” an
expedient that was evidently not always effective.’”
“He would recognise neither comrades nor fiiends. He would attack alike
before him and behind him.Hence the men of Connacht named Cu Chulainn the
Distorted One.’’284One Himalayan oracle said she sees those assembled at the
seance but does not recognise them. “Her faculties are functioning, but the link to
family and society has been cut, and with it, the need to know who and where she

is.m285
His riastrad seems akin to a whole range of psychotic possession
behaviours in different cultures, including the hamatsa possession, herzerker and
uZjhednar possessions by bear and wolf spirits respectively for combat, and others
such as amok, latah, koro, imu,witiko or windigo, pihloktok and negi negi.’“O
Lugh may possess Cu Chulainn on at least one other occasion. When Cu
Chulainn is in his serglige, he utters the briatharthecosc, instructions to the future
king. Carey says that “here too it is Lugh who is acting on behalf of his
unconscious son. The god of the Tara kingship speaks out of Cu Chulainn’s body,
enunciating the principles of perfect rule, just as the lord of Annwn practices
perfect rule while wearing Pwyll’s appearance.” Carey notes that Pwyll’s name
means “mind.” and therefore “mind” goes off into the Otherworld for a year, the
period of Cu Chulainn’s illness.**’Therefore, both accounts may refer to a similar
process of initiation and possession.
A related term of interest in relation to Cu Chulainn as oracle is the verb
siabraid, verbal noun siabrad. Sayers translates it as “arouses to fury, distorts,
transforms.”288As I have shown above, this word is also clearly identified with
druids acting shamanistically and with the Tuatha De Danann in Cormac’s death
tale. 89
Sayers comments that the “accumulation of superhuman force, an entry into
the world of the supernatural, also poses a threat to the host society of the hero. In a
sense, Cu Chulainn passes to the ranks of his supernatural opponents.” In chapter
three, I described how Cu Chulainn is referred to by a variety of terms that suggest
he is seen as a supernatural being, as shamans are in so many cultures. Still another
term used was sirite, or shapeshifter, a term that is also linked to his riastrad?’ As
I have noted in chapter three, I translate this term as “shapeshifter” because one
source tells us that the supernatural figure, Uath, like Cu Chulainn, is called a sirite

CELTICCULTURE
There are some explicit references to trance possession, such as that of the Awenyddion, who clearly show all facets of possession phenomena, Veleda, and Cu Chulainn's possession by Lugh in combat, others where it is very likely. such as Pwyll's case. Terms such as dichetal do chennaib, siabraid and baile suggest possession. Cu Chulainn's riastrad, and the passive way in which the word is used, strongly suggests possession. In tales such as Pwyll, Prince o f w e d . shamanic figures gain power through apparent possession. Senchae, Mor, Pwyll and other possibly oracular figures gained prestige and Dower fiom their role. Pwyll is described as uniting "the two realms in one" through his oracular role and exchange with the Otherworld. The Tuatha De and other figures seem neither fully human nor fully divine. Other Indo-European cultures like the Norse give clear examples. Cu Chulainn is referred to by terms that suggest he is a sDirit. Figures such as Pwyll, Oengus, Finn and Merlin receive titles at ritually significant points, or are referred to by titles, suggesting trance possession to greater or lesser degrees. The Awenyddion become hysterical and incoherent at stages of Dossession. The Awenyddion&nergin, Taliesin and others may use strange, archaic languaee. The Awenyddion often do not remember what they said. Cu Chulainn "sleeps" during the three days Lugh fights for him.
The Awenyddion must be brought out of trance through violent means.

Oracles may receive their power from spirits in dreams or journeys. Oracles declare their divine power and authority.
Oracles invoke their god. Oracles believe that their sins or impurity can prevent the gods manifesting through them. Oracles may be avatars. incarnations of a god. and thus be “wise children.” Particular deities may be channelled more frequently than others.
The oracle’s power and prestige is not explicable by purely social concerns but derives from the supernatural. Oracles accustomed to great power do not take kindly to being deposed when a new religion, etc. takes over. Art work suggests and depicts possession states. Oracles are frequently associated with equine imagery and called by equine names. Oracles generally have shamanic biographies.
The Awenyddion receive their power in a dream. The A wenyddion, Senchae, Amergin, Cu Chulainn and others declare their power and authority, often in ways that suggest divine authority behind the assertion. The Awenyddion invoke god. The Awenyddion pray that their sins may not prevent them from finding truth. Taliesin and others show prodigious wisdom and skill as children. There are more frequent references suggesting trance possession Lugh and the ”sovereignty goddess’‘ in her various forms than other deities. The Gaulish girl, Petta, is accorded power far beyond what her social role would justi@. Figures like Cormac‘s druid. Maelchend, and the Cailleach do not adapt comfortably to power loss. Art work suggests and depicts
Dossession states.

Figures we may see as oracles are frequently associated with equine imagery and called by equine names. The biographies of Cu Chulainn, Mor and others have other shamanistic features like initiatory illness.

CONCLUSIONS
I hope I have shown sufficiently clear examples above to indicate that
trance possession is a highly likely branch of shamanistic behaviour in Celtic
culture. Given all that I could not include, I am sure that this theme alone would fill
another thesis. I believe that a particularly good case can be made for Cu
Chulainn‘s riastrad.
The etymology of this word is unclear. Zimmer believed it was related to
the Welsh, rhuystr, meaning to hinder or fr~strate.’I~th~ink Sayers’s translation is
more likely. He derives it from a root *re&, meaning “to twist.**
But there are also other words that may be relevant to the etymology of
riastrad. For example, the word riata, fiom re‘idid, “ride?”means to be broken, as
horses are. The other re‘idid can mean to smooth the way, to disentangle, or to
ransom. Riarad means to “serve” or “do the will of..17-93
While these words are not definitely related to riastrad. it is interesting to
note that they compass a shamanic complex of meanings. The shaman oracle is
“ridden” or “broken” to the gods’ will, and is also one who ransoms or fiees others.
The fact that the verb riastraid is used “in an impersonal passive, with the
preposition imrn” reveals that the transformation is “seemingly imposed externally
without the hero’s volition. The word siabraid, “transforms,” mentioned above,
relating to the Tuatha De and used of Cu Chulainn, is also used in an impersonal
,9294
passive. This word was also used in relation to Maelchend and the other druids in
the story of Cormac’s death, above, who claimed to be
We saw in chapter one how the use of impersonal passive verbs also
coincides with Oengus’ initiatory crisis, imposed spiritually from outside.2%In this
case, I think that the use of the passive along with all the other features noted above
is a clear indication of trance possession.
The idea of the shaman as one who rescues or ransoms is a common one in
shamanic cultures. Yet it is not just by doing, but by being, that the shaman acts as

a guarantor of the cosmic order. The shaman's role as guarantor is a central
shamanic hnction, one demonstrated in a number of Old Irish sources, and once
again, quite clearly in Cu Chulainn's case.

Oengus. of Cti C'huiainn. in the Sergiige'
It feels appropriate to return to the place I began at this stage, as Old Irish
poems often conclude with their first verse. In this chapter I will look at the
pervasive idea that the shaman is not just a mediator between this world and the
Otherworld, but a guarantor of the co-creative process that maintains all worlds in
right relationship.
I first found this concept reflected in Celtic sources in a word in the
Serglige, the first text I translated and studied in detail. My later work on the stories
of Mis, Oengus and others served to confirm and amplify my initial thoughts.
Because I am mainly looking at questions of meaning in this chapter, the
results will naturally take on a more speculative character, since the sources
available to us do not make pagan religious symbolism clear. Themes such as
cosmology, sacrifice and the shaman as guarantor could also quite easily be
expanded to form chapters, or even theses, of their own3 Here I can do no more
than touch on these important topics. I chose to do an overview of all of them to
show that they exist in Celtic culture as they do in more generally recognised
shamanic cultures. I hope to expand on these themes in later research.
In the last chapter I showed how various figures in the literature seem to
symbolise deities, act as oracles, or somehow represent an overlap between human
1 Grof, 1989,p. 137, quoting Von Diirkheim, from The Wqri of 7rarqformation 2 Dillon. 1975, p. 3. lines 92-93. (My translation.)

and divine. As noted in the last chapter. these include druids like Maelchend, queen
figures like Mor,.fiZid like Senchae, and possibly kings such as Conchobar, since
either he or Senchae was called the “earthly god” among the Ulstermen. Cu
Chulainn is called a sirite, shapeshifter, on assorted occasions and the same word is
also used of spirit^.^
All these figures can be seen as shamanic, because the shaman stands for
the attainment of the goal of becoming us a spirit for his people, inspiring them to
transcend the limits of corporeal existence? Eliade has compared this to the
situation in Yoga, where the yogi seems to try “in every way to do exactly the
opposite of what is done ‘in the world,’ that is, what men do us men, prisoners of
their own
In the chapter on initiatory illness, I showed the shamanic novice
transcending all human rules of behaviour. At its ultimate stage, the process begun
in initiatory illness finds its hlfilment as the shaman becomes a vessel for vast
supernatural power in a focussed rather than destructive way. He becomes able to
act as a guarantor of the order he transgressed against through the very powers that
moved him to transgress. As I noted in the last chapter, Cu Chulainn passes into the
ranks of his supernatural opponents, he becomes as a spirit, but does so in defence
of ~lster.’
The shaman is, paradoxically, a breaker and sustainer of boundaries. Nagy
has clearly shown that Finn does both throughout his career. “This paradoxical
combination of the transcending and the protecting of metaphysical boundaries is
very much a part of the role which Finn and his men play. They are only peripheral
members of human society inasmuch as they are fe‘nnidi, hunters who live in the
wilderness. But because their existence is so liminal, Finn and his men can perform
a vital service for society?
If we see the shaman as one who straddles all boundaries, who sustains and
sometimes disrupts cosmic order, it makes sense to investigate the possible

cosmological significance of the process of his initiation and career. Aiding poetry
is of particular significance to this issue. Though it occurs in later. Christian
contexts, its content suggests that it retains more archaic cosmological ideas.’
THEAISLING
In aisling poetry, the Goddess of the land is often represented as a deranged
and suffering madwoman like Mis, showing that Ireland is in a bad way. The
cosmos has been thrown out of order. From a political view, poets such as
Aodhagan 0 Rathaille tie their depictions to the Jacobite cause.“) There is, of
course, also a close link between the welfare of the divine monarch and the well
being of the land, and the marriage of the king to the goddess of the land. In these
poems, the land is in a bad way because she does not have the right spouse.
“...Banba is in pain without consort, wedded though she be.“”
She is described in one poem as the “brightness of brightness,” also as a
spe‘ir-bhean, or isky-woman.”i2 She can transmit knowledge, and things the poet
fears to reveal. When fi-ightened by mention of the Virgin Mary, she retreats to the
fairy mansion of Luachair.I3In another poem she is described as being reduced to a
state where “...the hair of her head falls down in heavy showers! Streams of blood
gush forth in torrents fi-omher eyes! Her whole visage is of the appearance of black
coal! Her limbs are shrunken, bound and t~rtured!”’~
The only thing that can restore her is what restored Mis, her right spouse; in
this case, a fit ruler for Ireland. Here we have ideas of sovereignty, the goddess of
the land, and a deranged, yet spiritually powerhl figure, all bound up together.
The hoped for restoration of the madwoman in the poems can be seen as a
restoration of cosmic order. In some respects, this is what the restoration of the
hamatsa represents to the Kwakiutl.

The Pacific Northwest Native American Kwakiutl culture of the 1800's and
pagan Celtic culture had many similarities. Both were tribal and placed great stress
on generosity. Needless to say, no culture is perfect, and the ideals of any culture
are just that, ideals. However the ideals of 19* century Kwakiutl culture and pagan
Celtic culture were positive. and seem to have been adhered to more than they were
violated-at least from the anthropological accounts in the former case, and the
classical accounts and later literature in the latter.
As the Irish kings were obligated to give great feasts the Kwakiutl chief had
to give great potlatches. In contrast to the modern situation. wealth and prestige
seem to have been measured more by how much they gave, rather than how much
they h ~ a r d e d . 'C~onsequently, untempered voracity was one of the worse vices
thinkable.
I believe that figures such as Mis and the hamutsa in both of these societies
helped the people come to terms with life's harsh realities in very particular ways.
As should be clear fiom the earlier chapters, this isfurfrom all they did, but it was
certainly one of their shamanic functions. Shamans do act as "therapists" for lack
of a better word, along with their other functions in traditional cultures. They help
members of their tribe make sense of all facets of their lives, and make meaning of
the hardships that all beings face.
Ceremonies to return the shaman to the world after initiatory crisis are often
elaborate. Amongst the Kwakiutl, in particular, the cannibal dance takes up an
enormous amount of time, energy, resources, and sacrifice, to the point of the flesh
offerings given by the participants.
We see community involvement in the healing of both Cu Chulainn and
Oengus. In the case of Mis, Dubh Ruis is the only one physically present, yet the
communities' interest in her is indicated by the fact that the king wants her saved,
despite her epic depredations.
Because cosmological themes and paralells to Kwakiutl ideas exist in pieces
in a wide range of Irish tales, I will have to cast my net widely to provide
examples. As discussed in the introduction, one difficulty of this study is that Irish

297
literature containing vestiges of pagan and / or shamanistic themes was written by
Christian scribes. Therefore, we do not have one large coherent statement of pagan
Celtic cosmology and philosophy in the literature. We have to piece it together
f?om diverse sources where the pieces appear.
There are stages to any cosmological ordering process. We find the idea of
the cosmos being ordered in particular stages in the Lebor Gahdla Erenn. where the
land is divided up in different ways by different immigrants. The Rees' have
spoken of this as representing different stages of spiritual and societal
development.'6 The Settling qf the Manor qf' Tara has been interpreted as
containing ideas of a cosmological ordering process deriving fiom a divine
~ o u r c e . 'E~mily Lyle has also explored numerous cosmological themes in Celtic
and related sources.'*
In a Kwakiutl myth of the "first time", there is hunger and enmity in the
land. The parents of Transformer, the order-bringing divine figure, will not even
feed him and their other son. This illustrates the Kwakiutl prime vice of greed.
Likewise, a lack of generosity was regarded as a sufficiently severe vice to deprive
Bres of the kingship of the Tuatha De Danann in the Cath Maige Tuired."
In the Kwakiutl myth, Transformer then goes forth to set things right in the
world.20He sets up rules for meals, reincarnation, and the continual interchange
between this and the other world. Before he does this, there is no harmony between
the worlds. Without the organising power of the spirits, the Kwakiutl lived in a
world of undependable resources, and constant hunger.' '
A very important aspect of this tale is that before Transformer, there is
helplessness. Hunger and passion govern humans, and they have no certain way of
obtaining food. Untempered voracity reigns. After Transformer, there is at least an
idea of how the universe works and a workable system of exchange with the spirits.
Helplessness and lack of control also characterise the initial stage of

shamanic initiatory illness as well as schizophrenia.22This trauma is brought about
by what is felt by the sufferer to be inadequate behaviour or helplessness in the face
of life situations that are “culturally acknowledged as crucially important.”23The
inability to control a traumatic life situation is what Mis experiences in the death of
her father, as we have already seen.
If we look at it more deeply, however. we will see that in a larger sense, all
humans must face death and chaos in life. The sense of order can be shattered at
any moment by disease, death, or injury. The person diagnosed as psychotic will
generally exhibit nothing that any human does not exhibit under extreme and
prolonged threat.24
Since each person continually lives under the threat of possible death or
disaster, the shaman in initiatory illness dramatically acts out the state of all
humans. The shamanic candidate perceives the fearsome actuality of life with
greater intensity and emotional resonance. However, the shaman does more than
observe, or even act out-he mediates.
INITIATORY ILLNESS AS A MICROCOSMOF CREATION
I believe that the shaman’s initiation in Kwakiutl, Celtic and other cultures,
often represents a microcosm ofthe creation process itselJ:Eliade writes that “The
total crisis of the hture shaman, sometimes leading to complete disintegration of
the personality and to madness, can be valuated not only as an initiatory death. but
also as a symbolic return to the precosmogonic chaos, to the amorphous and
indescribable state that precedes any cosmogony...7, .25
Amongst the Kwakiutl, the winter ceremonial is seen as a point when time
stops, when the events that brought about creation are re-enacted in both spiritual
and physical dimensions.26 The shaman during this time, as the wild cannibal
figure, goes through the stages of creation. He is hlly absorbed in chaos. He is
mad, forsaking all laws of human conduct, becoming one with the devouring power

of the abyss.
Likewise, Mis devours humans and animals brutally and indiscriminately,
as the forces of destruction and death come to all, forsaking all laws of man, but
also not being limited by them. For example, she can fly and run with incredible
speed. By tearing down all limitations, she moves beyond the limits of the rest of
humanity.
This must be considered valuable, as the king wants her returned to the
world, not just killed. Yet if these powers remain sunk in the chaotic state, she
remains a danger to all around her. We see the same thing with Cu Chulainn, when
his warrior heat, so useful in battle, must be quenched lest he turn on friend as well
as foe.
Wildness tamed and harnessed yields its healing power. This may be
inferred when Cu Chulainn experiences his first riastrad and harnesses stags and
swans to pull his chariot. Like the wildness of the animals, his wildness is
harnessed to Ulster’s service. In South America, the Wild Woman of the Forest
deity became Our Lady of re me die^.^'
Tamed and returned to society the hamatsa, Cu Chulainn, Mis and others
embody creative forces in the end. To become a shaman, the shamanic candidate
must go through the creation processfully, emerging fkom chaos. The shaman must
be healed. He or she must return from the primal chaos, bringing its potency with
them, but at the same time, harnessing that power for society’s benefit.
SHAMAN AS GUARANTOR
Because of all this, I believe that we may see the shaman as a guarantor of
the creation process. The shaman, in repeating creation’s journey fiom chaos to
order in his initiatory crisis, shows that order still flows from chaos. By then
becoming the vehicle for continued interchange between spirit and humanity, they
show that the exchange still works. The shaman may be seen as a living
demonstration of a “covenant” between this world and the Other.
We may see a reflection of this concept in the use of the word commairge in

the Serglige Con Culainn. This word can mean a guarantor in a legal sense, or
more generally a protector. It can mean that one will not violate an agreement, or
that one is pledged to protect others.28
In chapter one, I described the point in the Serglige when Cu Chulainn had
been in a catatonic state for some time. One of the kcs Sid, Oengus, son of Aed
Abrat, came to speak with him. Cu Chulainn’s companions asked why Oengus was
not afi-aidto come into the midst of the Ulaid.
Oengus responded that if Cu Chulainn were healthy, he would be a great
guarantor for Ulster, but, “when he is weak and sick from wounds, he provides you
with an even greater guarantee.” (Inid i lobrai 7 i n-ingus dano atu, is moo de as
chomairche airthiu.)29 Oengus adds that he fears nothing because he has come to
speak with Cu Ch~lainn.~’
His statement is curious to say the least, as Cu Chulainn is out like a plank.
The guarantee Cu Chulainn gives Ulster in this state is only explicable from a
shamanic perspective. Traditional cultures see a shaman in his initiatory crisis as
more powerfd than before because the spirits cause the crisis by coming to him.31
Fand coming to Cu Chulainn as wife later is one manifestation of this.
That Cu Chulainn’s illness is seen as positive is confirmed by the fact that
Emer uses it as a boasting point in Fled Bricrenn. She says that Cu Chulainn is “a
man who lies wasting away” (fer seirges i lliga,,,in a sequence of statements
praising his beauty and prowess in battle. Carey notes that we cannot be positive
that Emer speaks of the same illness, but it seems very likely. Carey also notes the
clear resemblance of his illness to shamanic initiatory illness.32
That Emer and Oengus both see Cu Chulainn’s incapacity as positive might
be interpreted as an idea that the worse off the shamanic candidate is in his distress,
the deeper he descends into chaos, the more powerfully his recovery represents the
restoration of order. Even while in his distress, the candidate is a repository for
enormous power. Thus in this case, the fairy man says that even in his current state,

more is [the] guarantee on their [the Ulstermen’s]behalf.“



301
Cu Chulainn is more a guarantor for Ulster than ever before.
When the initiated shaman passes through the fires of his or her torment to a
place of power, and through a spiritual and possibly physical mating, to a place of
union and love, they demonstrate the power of the spirits to heal. Even Silverman,
the anthropologist who said shamans were “culturally supported schizophrenics,”
says their personality is far different fiom that of the schizophrenic in at least one
important way: they are “remarkably resilient.”33
By this resilience, the shaman demonstrates the power of the human soul to
emerge fiom adversity and helplessness in the face of the life’s chaotic reality as a
co-creator with sacred powers. By doing so, I believe the shaman may well
represent first a covenant, then an intermediary, between the community and the
forces of creation. I think this idea underlies both the Celtic and Kwakiutl tales.
As noted in the introduction, throughout this study I have been comparing
narratives f?om known shamanistic cultures like the Kwakiutl with Celtic
narratives. If the tales fiom shamanistic cultures have similar or identical elements
and themes to Celtic tales, as in the examples I have been discussing, then we have
another reason to suspect that Celtic culture, particularly before the 7th century AD
or so, was also shamanistic.
A passage in the Serglige also draws our attention to other examples of
guarantor figures in Celtic culture. When Cu Chulainn lies in sickness, he acts as
instructor to Ireland’s future king. As discussed in the last chapter, this may
represent an incident of Lugh possessing Cu Chulainn’s body while Cu Chulainn
embarks on a spirit journey.34
Lugh can be more convincingly associated with trance possession than any
other deity besides the sovereignty goddess. Both can be associated with other
shamanistic themes, and because both also have to do with sovereignty, they
naturally direct us to monarchs as shamanistic guarantors.
SOVEREIGN AS GUARANTOR
Monarchs are generally considered to fbnction as axis mundi. They link the

302
worlds and embody the divine on earth. Their shamanic and oracular character is
generally a c k n ~ w l e d g e d .T~h~e monarch’s power in Celtic and other traditions can
also be bound up with the ability to give feasts “awash with alcoholic liquor.?’In
short, enabling people to alter consciousness was a key part of the king’s claim to
rule, giving the sovereign further shamanic association^.^^
Sihler also contests the etymology of the Proto-Indo-European “king” root.
*r@, related to the Old Irish, do-rig? “to extend,” in favour of a root in *reH lg,
meaning “to have mana or spiritual power.”37 This etymology will no doubt be
hotly debated. Indeed, Indo-European etymologies must be speculative to at least
some degree due to the fact that we have no living speakers of ancient Indo
European, let alone Proto-Indo-European. I believe, however, that this etymology is
well worth considering given all the other associations between the king and divine
power in Celtic and other Indo-European traditions.
In fact, it seems quite clear that the king’sprimary function in shamanistic,
traditional and / or ancient cultures has always been to do with maintaining cosmic
order through the exercise of his divine p ~ w e r . ’It~ goes without saying that the
king has many other socio-political functions which might take up the majority of
his time and attention. However, what a culture holds as symbolically important
and says is the king’s purpose may be quite different fiom his day to day activities.
For in the typical archaic mode of conceiving the organisation of things,
the kingdom was so identified with the world that one was coequal and
coextensive with the other, the outer margin of one containing also the other, and
both schematically symmetrical in their symbolic arrangement...What lay outside
these confines belonged to chaos and darkness, and thus to the demon, associated
with dessication and death; those outer lands were then the representation of the
“King’s Enemies,’?which played a role in the ritual combat or cosmic conflict.39
We can see this idea clearly in Irish examples. Baize in ScaiZ begins when

each night, to prevent the Fomoire fiom taking Ireland unawares.4oHis role is divine.
but also shamanistic, since he defends the boundary of his realm against the chaotic
Otherworld incursions of the Fomoire. To do so, he and his druids can obviously see
them, and the fact that the tale says he patrols to prevent them taking Ireland
“unawares,” may imply that others cannot-at least not as well.
The shamanistic, divine ruler appears in many cultures. For example. the
Norse godi was believed to concentrate and distribute divine power to such an
extent that our word “God” ultimately came from his title.41The punning between
the words for ale and sovereignty (dergiaith) in the Celtic tales where Lugh and the
goddess dispense both gives sovereignty further supernatural associations.
When we look for a word in Old Irish that refers to cosmic order, fir
automatically comes to mind. The king upheldfir, a word somewhat inadequately
translated as “truth.”
Since the sovereign was the ultimate custodian and embodiment of-fir on
earth, their stories are full o f f i r ’ s importance to the spiritual and even structural
integrity of the universe. A tale of Cormac’s childhood, when King Lugaid was on
the throne, illustrates the point.
The sheep of one of Lugaid’s tenants got into the queen’s woad and ate
some of it. King Lugaid ordered that the sheep be surrendered to him as payment
for the wode. “Nifir!” said Cormac, emphasised by a mudslide collapsing half the
Hill of Tara, “That is a false judgement. The wode was cropped, but will grow
again, so the sheep too should be cropped, and their wool taken as compensation
for the wode.” The crowd responded, “Thus speaks the son of aJir-Jlaith!” Cormac
spoke in the nick of time, for his utterance of truth alone prevented the collapse of
the whole hill.42
The concept offir andJirJaithemon, the prince’s truth, were clearly seen to
maintain cosmic order. Truth was also a sustaining principal, if not the sustaining
principal, in many Indo-European cultures. Dillon has compared this passage from
40 Thurneysen, 1936, pp. 2 13-214 41 Perry, 1991, p. 181. This was done in part through the ale-feast. I have already discussed the ways in which royal distribution of food and beverages. particularly alcohol, may have been symbolic ofthe transmission of divine power in chapter 2. 42 Dillon, 1946. p. 140

the Audacht Morainn, the Bequest qf Morann with the following ones from Indian
sources:

For by <fir f.luithemon great kingdoms are ruled... Byfir-fluithemon fair weather comes in each fitting season. Winter fine and frosty, spring dry and windy, summer warm with showers of rain, autumn with heavy dews and fi-uitful.

Everything i s founded upon truth.
By means of truth the sun is warm,
By means of truth the sun shines, By means of truth the wind blows, By means of truth the earth endures.43
It may be that as Manandn reunited the shattered vessel in Echtrae
Cormaic by speaking truth, and as Cormac’s utterance of truth in childhood upheld
the Hill of Tara and all it literally and figuratively stood for, the utterance of truth
was believed to support truth in the world, like the Indian satyakriya, the act of
truthsu
Fir is more than telling the truth, it is the truth of being, righteousness and
cosmic order. To allow guu or falsehood to have the upper hand was to risk the
forces of chaos being unleashed on the earth.
The tale of Conaire Mor, with its many shamanistic components, goes a
long way to demonstrating both Conaire’s shamanistic identity and the way in
which he serves as a guarantor of cosmic order. Like the bards mentioned at the
end of chapter three, his role may be best understood by the results when he stops
fulfilling it.45
Conaire’s biography has many shamanistic features fiom the start.
Conceived by a “bird-man,” he is informed of his heritage by a bird-troop
43 Dillon, 1946. pp. 127-131 44 Dillon 1947. Kelly, 1976 45 Stokes, 1901, p. 57



305
associated with his father. Geiss is placed on him that he cannot cast at birds,
indicating totemic aspects of the relationship. His prosperous reign is described as
an enflaith, a “bird reign.”46 I have discussed the centrality of bird symbolism to
shamanism in chapter four.
He is elected through a turbfeis, and the way it is arranged would seem to
indicate a shamanistic brand of redpolitik, where the druid order selects, and
perhaps even selectively “breeds” the next king. When he arrives naked to be
chosen king, three druids wait on each of the four roads to Tara with clothes to
cover him. Similarly, as he awaits his death at Da Derga‘s Hostel, twelve men are
stationed around him. Like Cromm Cruaich and the twelve idols that surrounded
him, Conaire is one figure surrounded by twelve, which can be seen as the twelve
months of the year and the timeless hub they orbit
Conaire Mor has an incredibly prosperous reign until he breaks geissi. He
begins by being lenient to his marauding foster brothers when it was geis that he
not allow marauding during h i s reign. He says that “the judgement I have given is
no extension of life to me” and charitably sends them to Scotland.
What follows seems inevitable. He breaks geis after geis and ends up at Da
Derga’s Hostel. When his marauding foster-brothers land, he says, “I do not know
what it is unless the earth that has been rent, or the Leviathan with its tale that is
encircling the earth that is striking with its tail to overturn the world, or the boat of
the sons of Donn Desa that has come to land.”48
“The violation of gessu is such a sure omen of approaching death that it
might almost be inferred that a hero is safe fiom death while his gessu remain
i n v i ~ l a t e .I’n~s~ome cultures black magic is often considered to be the on& cause
of sudden or untimely death. For example, in Hungary and amongst ethnic
Hungarians in Romania, sudden death often arouses the suspicion of black magic?’
Conaire’s and Cu Chulainn’s deaths both bring cosmological disruption,
indicating their roles as guarantors. Chaotic forces play prominent roles in Conaire

and Cu Chulainn’s deaths. Cu Chulainn‘s killers, the sons of the Calatin have had
one foot and one hand cut off during their seventeen years of training as wizards,
and the daughters have been blinded in their left eyes, making them Fomoirian in
their aspect.” A one-eyed one-legged monstrous figure also appears in Conaire’s
tale. The Fomoire generally represent the forces of chaos in the tales.
A final interesting comparison to elements of Conaire’s tale, relating
shamanistic concepts, bird symbolism, truth and the disruption of cosmic order is to
be found in the Iranian Avesta and later Persian sources. The term that invites
comparison with the Old lrish.Fr is farr in Middle Persian, xvarenah in the earlier
Avestan texts. Like .fir, xvarenah brings the good things in life. One text says,
“May there now come to this community right, possessions, prosperity, xvarenah,
and easefbl life.”
Xvarenah is associated with both the sun and kingly vocation. “Papak one
night in a dream saw / that a bright sun from the head / of Sasan was shining. and it
/ illuminated the whole world.” It often appears in the form of a bird hovering
above the king’s head. The xvarenah is not limited to one of Dumezil’s three
hnctions, but where it is associated with a fimction it is the first.
In the Avestan text, the Zam Yasht, the xvarenah leaves king Yima in the
form of a bird because of druj, “the lie.” Greppin concludes that xvarenah orfarr
must mean more than the “good things in life” but doesn’t state the obvious, that
the opposite of a lie is truth-the broadest definition of truth as cosmic order, like
the Old I r i ~ h J i r .L~ik~e King Yima, Conaire loses his truth to falsehood, and his
enluith, his bird reign, and his life, is at an end.
Moving on fiom the idea of king as guarantor of the cosmic order, I want to
look at another device traditional cultures use to maintain right relationship
between human and divine realms: sacrifice.
SACRIFICE
There is no question that sacrifice was important to the ancient Celts. There
51 Rees. 1961, p. 331 52 Greppin, 1973, pp. 232-234.237-241



307
is some evidence in the archaeology for sacrifice on a limited scale.” In the
literature, the triple-death theme suggests ritual death.54
A Latin prayer attributed to St. Sechnall from the Antiphonay of Bangor,
says “Christ hath each one of us saved and released, He is our sacrifice, He is our
priest. Victims of olden time-so the law willed-shadowed God’s mysteries, now
are fblfilled.”” On one level, this statement refers to the eucharistic symbolism in
the Mass and draws on sacrificial themes throughout the Bible. However, it does
not seem outwith the realm of possibility that it might also refer to Celtic sacrificial
practices. Human sacrifice certainly appears in Old Irish tales so the memory of at
least the idea of sacrifice, if not its actuality, had been preserved.
A Middle Irish poem attributed to St. Columba makes the statement that
“Christ is my druid.” On one level, in context, the author is rejecting druids and
divination. Because he has Christ he needs no diviners. However, one might
speculatively ask if it might not also refer to Christ as sacrifice, implying a self
sacrificial role for the druids?
For the shaman, in a sense, each journey is a sacrificial death-leaving the
body for the spiritual benefit of the tribe. Possession is still more dramatic in this
respect. Each eviction fkom the body is a sacrificial death for both shaman and
deity. This is explicit in some North Indian rites during possession by the Snake
King?
Some possessions end with the khiin, which literally means ‘blood,’ but in
this context means something more like ‘murder,’ that is, the removal of the Snake
King fkom the oracle’s body. The khiin is a chant, only performed if “it is
absolutely necessary to remove the Snake King and return the oracle to lfe.” It
ends with the lines “If life is in the edge of the nails or cells of the hair / Arise,
awake, be c o n s c i ~ u s . ~ ~ ~ ~
The shaman’s initiatory death, his repeated deaths in possession and the
recurrent deaths of the Gods through him become irrevocably bound with the

308
primordial sacrifice of God in creation, a sacrifice we find re-enacted throughout
many Indo-European traditions.
“Insofar as the creation myth depicted the first death as sacrifice, so also
are all deaths understood as sacrifice. In truth, death is the last sacrifice that one
can offer, a sacrifice in which one becomes the victim rather than the sacrificer.“
The resurrection, where the body goes to the elements, then begins fiesh creation.
Lincoln identifies this ideology as not just Indo-Iranian but Proto-Indo-E~ropean.~~
The cosmos is fuelled by sacrifice. In one of the Upanishads, the dead man
whose component parts “return to the elements,” his speech to the fire, breath to the
wind, eye to the sun, and so forth, is spoken of exuctly as the Rig Veda speaks of
the first victim of sacrifice, whose substance created the universe.” Each death
therefore, is a participation in God’s primal sacrifice. As we have seen above, no
figure is seen to stand in for gods in Celtic tradition as much as the shamanic
figures.
SELFSACRIFICE
Given this, it would not be entirely surprising if druids might have taken on
a self-sacrificial role, as AM Ross theorised!’ This is all purely speculative. of
course, however, given the shamanistic significance of sacrificial symbolism,
particularly ideas about the shaman as “wounded healer,” it is worth considering.
The man found in Lindow Moss who Ross and others believe to have been
sacrificed was certainly a member of the upper classes, possibly a druid?
One can only conjecture that perhaps druids, as shamanic figures, would
have been the logical ones to make a “long journey” for the people in times of great
need. A spiritually powerful person’s death would be considered more effective
than the proverbial virgins and children. Their life force might be seen as stronger,
and their blood, ffom a line dedicated to the gods, might be seen as more effective.
The “ordeal” methods of altering consciousness, discussed in chapter two,
can be related to sacrificial symbolism. Rituals such as binding, fasting and praying

in freezing water create pain. The shaman undergoes this pain, at least in part, to
benefit his tribe. One might see the shaman’s sacrificial role as altruistic, however,
some have seen the shaman’s ongoing practice as a mode of warding off the
psychological dysfunction that first manifested in their initiatory illness.62
Continuing ecstatic practice, even those, or especially those, of a sort that
create physical stress, with its concomitant release of endorphins and other “happy
chemicals,” would serve a sound purpose in keeping psychological demons at bay.
The general idea in shamanic cultures that a shaman who ceases shamanic work
will be destroyed by spiritual forces may relate to this.
A possible example of a shamanistic kind of self-sacrifice is the way in
which Finn is said to chew his thumb to reawaken his imbas. One story describes
the frrst occasion as follows: He put the thumb he’d burnt on the salmon of wisdom
in his mouth, and “to ease the pain, put it between his teeth, and gnawed the skin to
the flesh, the flesh to the bone, the bone to the marrow and when he had tasted the
marrow he received the knowledge of all things.” Often, in future, he washed his
face before he does the rite, which compares to seers’ preparatory rituals in other
cultures.63
What are we to make of this procedure? Of course, it is impossible to know
for sure, but one potential meaning may be implied by the symbolism. If we look at
what Finn does literally, it is a nice trick-but one could only do it once. Finn did it
repeatedly. He chewed his thumb like a piece of raw meat, as the sacrificed pig
flesh is chewed in the imhasforosnai ritual. The implication may be that he is
chewing sacrificed flesh, that Finn is a living sacrifice to the spirits.
The idea that the shaman is a living sacrifice is common to most shamanic
cultures. In his dismemberment experiences, physical ordeals, and arduous rites to
heal others, he is continually in the “sacrificial posture.” Finn symbolically reduces
his thumb to marrow to kindle imbas, or illumination. Similarly, enlightenment in
shamanistic cultures is bound up with ideas of reducing things to their essentials.
Shamans are dismembered by spirits and reduced to bare bones in

The shaman occupies the most liminal place of all-he is considered neither
alive nor dead. We get this sense about Finn. In one tale, Finn is made old by a
supernatural figure. Another gives him a rejuvenating drink, but his hair remains
grey. The supernatural being offers to change it, but Finn chooses to keep it, and
ever after, a “deathly chill” remains on his person and his children stink of death?
THESHAMAN AS O N E DEADW H E N ALIVEAND ALIVEW H E N DEAD
As noted in chapter two, words for trance, sleep and death overlap in
various cultures. The shaman is one who dies repeatedly, one who, like Finn,
always has an aura of death about him. Eliade says, “it is clear that it is the shaman
himseywho becomes the dead man” and that the shaman’s journey is a ritual death
and rebirth? As the shaman is somewhat dead when alive, he is also somewhat
alive when dead.
Cu Chulainn continues to take a liminal role after his death. It is very
interesting that he returns to die by the very stone where he was attacked by
Otherworld women in the SergZige. Thus Airbe Roir, a place with a standing stone
by the lake near Mag Muirthemne. is the place of both his “spiritual death” in
initiatory illness and his physical death!’
I believe it is also significant that Cu Chulainn binds himself to the standing
stone, given my earlier discussion of binding in shamanistic contexts. Binding has
many symbolic layers of meaning that I do not have the space to go into here?
Earlier I noted that Cu Chulainn bound himself tightly beneath his battle
gear to “keep his head” when in riustrud, but more than this, to be bound to a pillar
stone is to appear as a living axis mundi. Bound to the stone, dead but vertical, he
seems neither fully alive nor fully dead, neither fully of this world nor fully of the
Other.
In physical, as in spiritual death, he is a safeguard of Ulster. The enemy
troops are reluctant to approach, and when Lugaid cuts off his head, Cu Chulainn’s

sword cuts off Lugaid‘s hand.69Therefore Cu Chulainn, even when dead, continues
to seem somewhat alive.
He also returns after death in a siaburcharpat, a “spectral chariot,” and
makes a siaburchobrae, “spectral speech.” It will be recalled, however, that Cu
Chulainn is identified as a siabra in Zi$e as well. In some respects. the shaman’s lot
is not seen to change at death. In death as in life, Cu Chulainn “bridges the gap
between life and death and between the past, to which he belongs, and the future,
which he predict^."^' He predicts Christ’s coming, and his life story is
-‘synchronised” with Christ’s in some sources. With Christ, he predicts another
visionary, sacrificed hero.
Other shamanistic figures in Celtic literature speak of being simultaneously
alive and dead. The “three reds” travelling to Da Derga’s Hostel say “Though we
are alive, we are dead.??7’Taliesin says, “I am old, I am new...I have been dead, I
have been alive...I am Talie~in.”’I~ spoke of Marban as a shamanic figure in
chapter three. His name is based on marb, “dead.” Nagy suggests this may be in a
Christian sense of “dead to the ~ o r l d . ” ’I~ would suggest it may also be in a
shamanic sense. In the Imacallam, Ferchertne says that one of his tasks is “To go
into death‘s hills where I may find great honour.”74Examples could be multiplied
further, but I think I have made the point.
The association of being one-eyed with supernatural power in Celtic
literature may also relate to symbolism of being simultaneously alive and dead.
Examples include the incident in the Cath Maige Tuired where Lugh casts a spell
on Balor and the Fomoire by hopping on one leg while covering one eye.” Many
figures have one eye yanked out by a bird in particular, as the Hawk of Achill pulls
out Fintan’s eye.76St. Brigit performs the operation on herself to avoid marriage.”
Cu Chulainn becomes effectively one eyed in his riastrad, since one sinks
69 Carey, 199% p. 194 70 Nagy, 1997, p. 225 71 Rem. 1961, p. 128 72 Rees. 1961, p. 242 73 Nagy, 1997, p. 308 74 Stokes. 1905, pp. 28-29, my translation based on Stokes 75 Gray, 1983, pp. 58-59, par. 129 76 Hull, 1932. pp. 27, par. 20-21, my translation 77 Tom& 1997, p. 12



312
far into his skull and the other bulges out. An interesting comparison is to be found
in figure 17, (p. 271).” This is a carving of Odin as the hanged man, sacrificed on
the World Tree. Like Cu Chulainn in riastrad, h i s mouth gapes, and he shows only
one eye. Odin can be linked with Lugh as well, and the one eye open, one closed or
missing theme is certainly common to them both.
It is worth noting that one of Cu Chulainn’s epithets is uathbusach, or
“horrifying.” I noted in chapter three that Thurneyssen takes uath back to an
archaic Irish root in *oth, which can in turn be related to the Old Norse Gdr,
meaning raving or possessed. The name Odin also derives fkom this root.79
We can see the resemblance to Cu Chulainn’s riastrad in this image. The
eyes give him an ambiguous quality, neither dead nor alive, seeing into the physical
world with the open eye and into the spiritual with the closed: the two sights.
The Bantu Kimbanguist cult sings of its founder, “Tata Simon [Kimbangu]
is not dead; / One eye is closed, / One wide open.”8o
Shamans exist “betwixt and between” in life and death. The fact that
shamans can hold contradictory polarities is also a source of their power. I earlier
mentioned Nagy‘s idea that Finn had great power because he was simultaneously a
breaker and maintainer of boundaries.
In one story mentioned in chapter four, Finn drinks fiom a well of falsehood
and a well of truth. Nagy assumes that thejios thoighe Cuanna, “knowledge fiom
the house of Cuanna,” that Finn gains, has come fiom the well of truth.” But
perhaps this knowledge has come f?om drinking of both, fiom holding both
polarities.
In Finn we have a sacrificial shamanic figure, one seen as dead in life.
Similarly, great yogis are also thought of as dead. Their bodies are buried rather
than burned, because they have already immolated the personal self in the fires of
fapas, they have been sacrificed already. The sacrificial posture is the essence of
their yoga. Yoga means to “yoke,” to unite polarities of divine and human, flesh

and spirit, life and death. Therefore, the practitioner’s sacrificial posture may be
seen as what unites polarities.
POWER AND POLARITIES
The remainder of this chapter (excluding my diagrams and conclusions at
the end) is a speculative work in progress. Proving the ideas that follow will be the
work of future research. However, part of my purpose in writing this thesis is to
look at the potential meanings of Celtic shamanistic behaviour and symbolism, as
well as showing that the “bare bones” of such symbolism and behaviour exists.
Therefore, I include what follows to touch on possible deeper meanings that I
believe are present in the tales and worth exploring. The reader should just be
aware that my ideas are very much at the theoretical stage here.
Ann Ross refers to the symbolism of the torc, the Celtic neck ornament that
denotes status and power. Torcs are in the form of an open circle with two knobs,
spheres, or other decorative terminations at the ends of the open circle. Some take a
form more like a noose, and Ross believes they once represented the sacrificial
noose.82
If Ross is correct, torcs might be symbolically akin to the “sacred thread”
worn by Brahmins. It is fixed with the words “You are the sacred thread, with the
sacred thread of sacrifice I initiate The torc’s symbolism may relate to
shamanic symbolism of binding, touched on in chapter two.
There may also be an echo of the idea that wearing a torc represents
symbolic sacrifice in Canain nan Eun, discussed in chapter two. In the story, the
Prince of Spain sacrifices his three children and bathes Alasdair in their blood to
restore him aRer an initiatory type episode as a wild man. When he and his queen
go to mourn over the bodies they fmd the children are alive again. The story then
notes that “the children were wearing their necklaces,” though these necklaces are
not mentioned before or after.84There is no question that the likeliest explanation
for this is that the “necklaces” are the red scars where their throats have previously
82 Ross, 1989, p. 1 1 3 83 Panikkar, 1977, p. 128 84 Mackay. J.G., 1931, p. 177



314
been cut. But I think it might also be conceivable that the children were ritually
rather than physically sacrificed as symbolised by “necklaces,” possibly torcs.
This is all speculative, of course, and cannot be f m l y justified fiom the
evidence, but the idea of the torc as sacrificial symbol has interesting cosmological
implications. If the torc is a sacrificial symbol, it would mean that the symbol of
ultimate authority was the symbol of ultimate sacrifice. This goes along with what
we know about status in Celtic culture, that generosity rather than wealth itself was,
at least in part, what gave status.
What else might the torc symbolise? On the most obvious level it is an
object with terminals or knobs at either end-poles at either end of an open circle.
It most obviously calls to mind opposites or polarities somehow “held” together.
Again, this is speculative, but interestingly, the idea that spiritual power derives in
part fiom the ability to hold polarities-that is, to bear different or opposite states
of being or ideas simultaneously in one‘s awareness without difficulty-does seem
to be implied in a variety of Celtic sources relating to shamanistic figures.
For example, Maelduin’s trinity of foster brothers, discussed in chapter two,
who tag along on his Immram. One was lost essentially to presumption. (stealing
the torc from the place with the cat, and the other two to islands of sorrow and joy
respectively. At the end of the journey, Maelduin has apparently transcended
personal pettiness to the extent that he can forgive his father’s murderers-he has
successfully moved beyond p ~ l a r i t i e s .In~ ~this he is similar to Celtic deities in
many of the tales.
GREYAREAS
In Celtic sources, particularly in the mythological cycle of tales, we do not
see a tidy opposition of good versus evil. We certainly see chaotic forces, like the
Fomoire, who seem to represent disorder, and sometimes evil. Yet these same
forces represent fertility.
At the end of the Cuth Muige Tuireud, the Tuatha De Danann make a treaty
with the deposed half-Fomoirian king Bres, because they cannot cultivate the land
85 Stokes. 1888



315
without Fomoirian assistance.86Could this relate in some way to a perception of
necessary oscillation in the cycles of life? Prior waves of immigrants were wiped
out by the Fomorians and illness, yet the Tuatha De survive. Can it be that this
indicates that they are the first to successfully come to terms with this reality?
They defeat the forces of chaos in battle, as they manifest in a specifically
evil way. i.e. Balor of the evil eye, and so forth, but they also realise that they need
them to ensure the fertility of the land. Union and loss may be viewed as necessary
oscillations. The soil itself is made from things which are dead and broken, crushed
seashells, dead leaves, plants. and so forth. The death and rebirth theme contained
in harvest myths world wide is well attested.
But it seems to me that the Cath Muige Tuireud goes beyond this. The
beings most responsible for the defeat of the Fomorians are deities who partake of
their chaotic power. The Dagda is generally depicted as benevolent, yet he is a
figure of contrasts. Known by epithets that indicate great wisdom, he is also
uncouth, called “The Rebirth of the World,” his club kills with one end and revives
with the other.87
The Morrigan, the “Great Queen,” sometimes referred to as wife of the
Dagda is most often referred to as a war goddess, yet place names like the “Paps of
the Morrigan,” refer to a more maternal aspect.88 Her poem at the end of Cath
Maige Tuiread does not indicate a love of chaos, but is a celebration of the return
of order. “Peace up to heaven, heaven down to earth, earth below heaven, power in
each, a cup very full, full of honey, mead in abundance, summer in winter...peace
up to heaven.”89
Most prominently, Lugh, a product of the union of Cian with a Fomorian
woman, Ethlinn, is the only one who can slay Balor of the Evil Eye. his own
Grandfather. He does so by utilising a one legged, one eyed trance posture. In
essence, he does so by acting as a Fomoirian.90

SAMILDANACH
This is not the only time Lugh skilfully handled polarities. Gray gives
several examples in her article on Lugh and Cu Chulainn. One relates to
kinslaying.” Lugh’s father, Cian, was killed by his kinsmen, the sons of Tuirenn.
Lugh learned what had happened Erom the earth where the murder occurred. Cian’s
murderers denied their guilt, but agreed to pay compensation. Lugh gave them a list
of apparently innocuous items; three apples, seven pigs, three shouts on a hill and
so on. Cian’s murderer’s were stunned to get off so cheaply, and happily accepted.
Then Lugh revealed that the items were magical treasures owned by
formidable opponents. He intended to have these items for the battle against the
Fomoire, and have the murderers’ lives in the process. He succeeded in blood
vengeance, but got others to perform it, remaining free of the crime of kinslaying.
Gray contrasts this to the way Cu Chulainn fails to deal with a similar
dilemma in a way that resolves the conflicts well. When he is faced with his son,
whom he has bound by his own geissi in such a way as to create insoluble hture
problems, Cu Chulainn cannot gracefully resolve the contradictory demands of
honour and kinship. When placed in a world where right and wrong merge, he is
lost.92Where Lugh fights frre with fire, Cu Chulainn bums.
The way Cu Chulainn dies is revealing. He dies in part because he cannot
resolve polarities. It is geis for him to pass a hearth without eating some of the food
and geis for him to eat dog. Of course, hags cooking by the road offer him dog.93
This all seems to lead us to the idea that in Celtic tradition, effective power
comes fiom being able to encompass polarities. Spiritual gnosis as well. The
stanzas of early Welsh Gnomic Poetry resemble Zen koans. They present opposites
and disparate images. Connections between elements in gnomic poetry are not
rational, but relate more to “visionary or mystical e~perience.”’~
Poems like, “Mountain snow, the stag is on the strand; / the old man misses
his youth; / an ill countenance hampers a man,” don’t seem to invite a “solution,”
as much as invoke the same kind of contemplative space generated by a Zen koan. a

space generated by the pull between polarities.
The diversity of materials in these poems would leave the audience with a
sense of the intricacy of the world and the complexity of life, an idea of the
enormous knowledge to be mastered and the difficulty of doing so. The world is
easy to understand in its particulars, like each line of poem is easy to understand,
but mysterious overall. By implication, the poet who could master the complexity
and see the hidden patterns became mysterious him~elf.~’
Lugh stands as an example of one who successfully did so, a “super
shaman” of a golden age. He is a guarantor of cosmic order, as Cu Chulainn is, but
fills the role more through skill than suffering. As master of all arts he is
“equivalent to all the ues dana in Tara-who themselves represent the entire
~ociety.”’L~ugh becomes the microcosm that is the macrocosm.
Cu Chulainn does so through his initiatory illness and restoration, yet he
also shows the pitfalls of the path. A more human, through still discernibly
shamanic figure, he struggles with the conflicts Lugh resolves with ease. As Gray
suggests, “the ability to transcend conflict, reconciling the irreconcilable, marks the
divine, as contrasted with the mortal within these myths.””
Lugh gives us the sense that ultimate power comes f?om the ability to hold
all possibilities, to navigate the true course gracehlly between good and bad,right
and wrong, chaos and order. By encompassing the skills and powers of the Fomoire
and Tuatha De, the powers of this world and the Other, he presents an all skilled,
and shamanic, ideal of sovereignty, wisdom and dan, co-creative power.
Shamanic cultures typically conceive of a golden age, where shaman’s
powers were greater and their personalities stronger and better able to withstand the
force of the spirits. Later generations of shamans demonstrate more frailties, more
petty, personal issues, and less equanimity in their dealings with the spirits. Lugh,
Cu Chulainn and later sources may reveal Celtic evidence of these ideas.
Most traditions acknowledge that remaining close to the sacred requires
hard work and sacrifice. Like Finn chewing his thumb from bone to marrow, and

318
fiom marrow to inner marrow to access his imbas, illumination takes effort, and
usually begins to come in a series of moments, not all at once and for good. Human
fi-ailties make the process difficult to sustain, perhaps more for the shaman than for
others, because of the intensity of his contact with the Otherworld.
“Such an exalted and silent concentration of the divine is not easily borne.
Withdrawing it from man is an ironic act of grace on the part of the gods:
‘Asa weak vase isn’t alwclys able to receive it,
$7.98
Only at intervals can man bear divinefulness.

319
THE SHAMAN AS GUARANTOORF COSMIC ORDER
SHAMANICCULTURES Shamans occupy a liminal, paradoxical role in that they are breakers and sustainers of boundaries This liminal quality means they can fulfil a vital protective role in their community. In cultures such as the Kwakiutl, the shaman’s descent into chaos in initiatory illness symbolises a return to the pre-cosmogenic chaos. Their restoration represents the emergence of order fiom chaos.
The shaman, in repeating creation’s journey from chaos to order in his initiatory crisis, shows that order still flows fiom chaos. He becomes a living covenant between the worlds. As the Kwakiutl hamatsa is the son of a chief or a chief himself, and acts as a guarantor of cosmic order, many kings or chiefs hlfil this shamanic role. If the guarantor ceases to hlfil his role things descend into chaos.
Themes of sacrifice and self-sacrifice are pervasive when one looks at the role of shaman as guarantor.
The idea of the shaman as a living sacrifice to the gods is pervasive in shamanic cultures. The idea that shamans are dead in life, and alive in death, that they exist between states, appears in most shamanic cultures.
The idea of someone being a living sacrifice is symbolised in Indian tradition by the “sacred thread” worn by Brahmins. Shamans are often thought to have power in part because they can hold polarities, they can encompass contradictory ideas and impulses.
CELTICCULTURE Figures such as Mis, Finn and Cu Chulainn are breakers and sustainers of boundaries Cu Chulainn and Finn fulfil a vital protective role in their community.
There is strong evidence that Mis, queen figures, and Cu Chulainn‘s descent into chaos in initiatory illness symbolises a return to the precosmogenic chaos and that their restoration represents the emergence of order ftom chaos. The use of the word commairge in the Serglige indicates that he is seen as a guarantor of cosmic order. Other figures seem to fulfil this role as well.
Celtic sovereigns like Cormac and Conaire fblfil the role of guarantor of cosmic order. Other features in their biographies are also shamanistic. When Conaire and Cu Chulainn cease fulfilling their roles as guarantors, things descend into chaos. Themes of sacrifice and self-sacrifice are pervasive in Celtic tradition in relation to the shaman’s role as guarantor. The idea that shaman’s are living sacrifices to the gods is reflected in many Celtic sources. Shamanic figures such as Finn, Cu Chulainn, Marban and others have qualities that suggest that they are somewhat dead in life and somewhat alive in death. It is possible that the idea of someone being a living sacrifice may be symbolised in Celtic tradition by the torc worn by druids and nobles. Shamanic figures such as Lugh have power in part because they can hold polarities, encompassing contradictory ideas and impulses.

CONCLUSIONS
It is evident that there are many cosmological themes in Celtic sources that
may pertain to shamanism. In this chapter, more than any of the others, I have had
to cut much material due to space. I would have liked to include a great deal more
exploration of the possible cosmology that Celtic shamanic figures may have acted
as guarantors of
Works on possible Celtic cosmological structures that I Believe would shed
greater light on shamanistic themes include Sayers work on cosmological themes,
Lyle’s work on the “three strains of music,” and their relationship to the year’s
structure, and Read’s work on time and sacrifice in the Aztec cosmos.99Melia’s
work on Adamnan’s initiation as “shaman saint,” also seems to bear an interesting
relationship with the shamanistic initiatory processes described in the
Kuthopanisud.‘”(’
Shamanic themes of death and rebirth, the triple binding, three day burial
and rituals such as the Caerlin of the Mill Dust, discussed in detail by
MacilleDhuibh, are also important subjects for hture research. Eliade’s work on
the shamanistic figure of Zalmoxis, a Dacian deity who undergoes ritual burial, will
provide extremely useful comparisons with Celtic sources.‘01
There is clearly much firther work to be done on Celtic cosmology and the
shaman’s possible role in it.

CONCLUSIONS
THESHAMANIBCIOGRAPHY
I have diagrammed specific shamanic themes in the previous chapters,
comparing them as they occur in Celtic cultures with the ways in which they appear
in more generally recognised shamanic cultures.
Below, I look over the full biographies of shamanic figures in Gaelic
culture to see how they relate to shaman’s biographies in other cultures in twenty
two points of comparison.
Campbell has done much work in defining the stages of the hero’s
biography. Shamanic heroes generally follow this trajectory as well but I also
include elements below that relate to shamanic fimctions.
0 Cathasaigh has also addressed the question of the “heroic biography,”
with reference to the 1963 English translation of Jan de Vries 1959 work. Heroic
Song and Heroic Legend.’ He notes that the Echtrae Cormaicc corresponds to
Campbell’s “monomyth,” which can be described as follows:
A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of
supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory
is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to
bestow boons on his fellow man.*
Below, I give shamanic biographies of Lugh, Cu Chulainn and Finn mac
Cumaill in outline form. I could easily do the same for Cormac (especially given 0
Cathasaigh’s prior work), Conaire M6r, Oengus, Pwyll, Taliesin and various
others, but in the interest of space, I have limited myself to these three. More
details on each shamanistic element can be found in the chapter diagrams.

LUGH
Lugh is the archetypal shaman in Celtic sources. Where the other figures below are more human shamanic figures, Lugh’s biography is more that of the mythic shaman of the golden age.
SHAMANICBIOGRAPHY
The future shaman’s birth or conception may be unusual in some way.
The shaman goes through initiatory illness.
Shamans may have a spirit spouse.
~~ ~ ~~ ~ ~
The shaman goes through other training with humans and spirits.
The shaman gains powers through supernatural encounters. These may involve combats with spirits. Shamans win victories in these battles. Shamans return from their adventures with the power to bestow boons on their people. Shamans have magical equipment.
Shamans enter trance.
Shamans undertake spirit journeys.
Shamans may use their power to kill. Shamans may use their power to heal.
Shamans may use their powers to reveal. Shamans may have spirit teachers.
LUGH’BSIOGRAPHY
Lugh’s conception has supernatural features and represents the union of Fomoire / Tuatha De wlarities. There is no clear description of initiatory illness in Lugh‘s case-but that stage of Lugh’s life is not described. He appears “hlly fledged” at Tara. Lugh is associated with the
There is also no clear description of this in Lugh‘s case-but again, sources do not describe that stage of Lurrh’s life. Lugh fights beings such as Balor. His adoption of a Fomoirian stance may imdv his taking Balor‘s Dower. Luah defeats Balor. Lugh acts as king and uses his many gifts in the service of the Tuatha De.
Lugh is described with the vessel that gives sovereignty and other equipment in Baile in Scail.
Lugh‘s use of a probable trance posture and his oracular role implies chance. Lugh has so many spiritual encounters it is difficult to tell which could be described as journeys. He is in many other people’s spirit journeys, however. Lugh uses supernatural power to kill. Lugh uses h i s power to heal Cu Chulainn. Lugh is often in prophetic role.

Lugh acts as a spirit teacher, but there is no mention of him having one.

Lugh is clearly a divine being who also possesses human qualities.



326
Cu CHULAINN
To my surprise, Cu Chulainn probably has the most complete shamanic
biography I have found in Celtic sources, fi-om initiatory illness to his final death /
not death. A cursory look at his stories would seem to reveal a standard warrior
figure, however, closer scrutiny reveals a highly shamanic figure. It seems curious
to say the least that one of the least obviously shamanic figures, not a druid or%filid
or king, presents such a perfect shamanic archetype when examined more closely.
This is clearly a topic for hture research. At this juncture, I can only
speculate on reasons why Cu Chulainn seems to be the archetypal Irish shaman.
One reason might possibly be the very fact that he is a consummate warrior. If the
hypothesis discussed at the end of the last chapter is correct, it might be that the
person who could hold the most extreme polarities was seen as being the most
powerfd. Cu Chulainn is a great killer and a great enough healer that he can even
heal a deity, the Morrigan. Killing and healing are of course two of the most
extreme polarities.
Another possible example of Cu Chulainn holding an extreme polarity may
be the riustrud. It is described as the most gory transformation possible, and no
other Irish literary figure has a riastrad. If this relates, as I discussed in the last
chapter, to the idea of a shaman as one simultaneously dead and alive, we have
another extreme polarity to add to the list-killer / healer, alive / dead. I could go
on, but that is the gist of the idea.
Cu Chulainn also shrinks fiom absolutely nothing in the service of Ulster,
even slaying his own son and dying himself. His bravery and self-sacrifice for the
tribe could be seen as the supreme shamanic qualities. The shaman in many
cultures is seen as a wounded healer, sacrificing himself for the people.
There are other possible reasons. As I noted in the introduction, I believe
that tales may build up around historical individuals over time as a pearl grows
around a bit of grit in an oyster.
Say Cu Chulainn was once a real person with shamanic powers, perhaps
primarily a warrior like many Jivaro shamans. Over time, beginning within his own
lifetime, various impressive stories might have begun to circulate about this tribal



327
hero. They might have incorporated elements of his Otherworld adventures and
battles that he himself told.
After his death, such tales would continue to circulate and become
increasingly exaggerated and mythic. Over time, stories of lesser known
shamanistic figures might have been “hung on the peg” of Cu Chulainn. If nothing
existed about a particular shamanistic figure other than say, one incident or story, it
would make literary sense to add that incident to the corpus of Cu Chulainn stones.
Just as storytellers often bring immediacy and personal relevance to tales
by saying, “and it happened right over there,” they might also have attached stories
fiom various sources to Cu Chulainn, since the audience is always more keen to
hear stories about characters they already know and love.
Those are a few possibilities, however it they are only that, and firmer
conclusions will require a great deal more thought.

CU CHULAINN’S BIOGRAPHY
Cu Chulainn is sired by Lugh in a three stage process unparalelled in Irish literature, suggesting that he may be Lugh’s avatar. Cu Chulainn has initiatory illness.
Cu Chulainn has a sDirit mate. Cu Chulainn is trained by Scathach. a female of supernatural aspect. Cu Chulainn encounters and battles spirits repeatedly. He has more pleasant interchanges with Fand.

Cu Chulainn’s helmet is magical Cu Chulainn goes into trance. Cu Chulainn has many spirit iourneys. Cu Chulainn uses supernatural, and supernaturally enhanced physical power to kill.

FINN’SBIOGRAPHY
Cumall, Finn’s father, is rigfiennid and has a magical bag, so Finn comes from a shamanic heritage. Finn is immediately fostered after his birth in the wilderness, and his mother. Muirne is shown as a liminal, ambiguous, being. In some stories of his birth, he is thrown or dropped in water, and emerges with a salmon, eel or both in his hands.3 Finn has many initiatory experiences which lead him into physical peril and a state of being symbolically semi-alive and semi-dead, but the initiatory illness is not as clear as in Cu Chulainn‘s case. Finn has a son, Oisin, by an Otherworld woman. Finn’s training asfi’nnid in general has liminal, supernatural qualities. His apprenticeship to Fionn Eces also has supernatural elements. He also learns fkom Cuanna on an Otherworld iourney. Finn battles the Fomoire and other spirits. He gains imbas initially through contact either with the salmon of wisdom or by shutting his thumb in a sid mound. Finn wins various victories.
Finn acts in the service of his people.

Finn often reveals by using the imbas forosnai. Finn is taught by Fionn Eces and also learns from Cuanna. Finn gains imbas ftom consuming the salmon of wisdom.
Possession may be implied when Demne gains the name Finn, which may be more of a title. When he eats the salmon of wisdom, his teacher Fionn Eces, told that the boy’s name was Demne, says, “it is you who is the Finn in truth,” Finn is many skilled asfilid, warrior, etc., and h i s name may derive either fi-omjhd, bright, luminous, or ro-Jinnadar, allknowing or very knowledgeable. Finn is considered valuable as rigfennid Finn is a liminal protector of boundaries.
Finn has qualities of being both alive and dead. After certain Otherworld experiences his body has a deathly chill. Self sacrifice is evident in his method of the imbas forosnai. Finn has many liminal qualities.
Finn is in many ways like an Otherworld being.

I hope that I have proven that there are a wealth of shamanistic themes in
Celtic literature and that the understanding of shamanism can be hrthered by
adding Celtic culture to the list of more generally recognised shamanistic cultures. I
also hope I have shown that obscure points of Celtic myths may be elucidated by
viewing them through a shamanistic lens, and the shamanistic worldview may well
make the most coherent sense of primal Celtic spirituality as a whole and some
elements of later Celti spirituality.
Last but not least, I hope that I have provided strong evidence that there
were figures functioning fully as shamans in early Celtic culture, figures reflected
in the later literature. I hope that this thesis may make it possible for a wider range
of scholars from fields as diverse as Celtic studies, anthropology and psychology to
research shamanic themes in Celtic tradition more safely and more soundly.
