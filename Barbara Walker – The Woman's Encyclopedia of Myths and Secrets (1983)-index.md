Editor's Note
Cross references. Words printed in the text of this book in bold
face type indicate main-entry treatment of those subjects. Such cross references have been designated only if the reader might find
additional information pertinent to the subject at hand. Short articles
have been supplemented by generous cross references, to avoid frequent duplication of material. Some main entries serve as cross references in themselves: rather
than introducing articles, they refer the reader to treatment
elsewhere. For example, the entries for alphabet, blood, and world egg indicate the various other articles in which the reader will find
information about these topics. Cross references have also been
included for alternate spellings of main-entry headings Isolde
instead of Iseult, Beelzebub instead of Baal-Zebub, and so on.
The customary differentiation between see and see also does not
appear in this book. The reader can decide to seek further
information either for direct expatiation or simply for general interest.
Marginalia. An unusual aspect of this encyclopedia is its marginal notations. There are three kinds.
First, since so many terms appear in different languages and
different historical eras, variant spellings are given in the margin to
show their cross-cultural associations.
Second, as an extension of the above, where the etymology is
particularly rich and might tend to interrupt the main story, it has
been put in the margin. Third, the author has drawn on such an abundance of sources that all cannot be included in the Bibliography. Hence, those used
only once or twice have been given a brief description or definition in
the margin.
References. The notes are numbered from 1 for each article. Information is abbreviated but sufficient to clue the reader to the
full reference in the Bibliography. The sequence is: author's last name
(preceded by distinguishing initials if there is more than one author
with the same last name); title (abbreviated) if there is more than one work by the same author; volume number if pertinent; and page
reference. For example:
1. Budge, G.E.2, 47.
This indicates that note 1 cites Sir E. A. Wallis Budge, Gods of the
Egyptians, volume 2, page 47. The rest of the publication data is in
the Bibliography, which is arranged alphabetically by author.

Thousands of popular fantasies and hidden facts are expounded in this
Encyclopedia, where the complex subject of sexism is approached from both the historical and the mythic viewpoints. Standard encyclope
dias usually omit such material, or give it a brief, uninformative note.
There is need for a complete study of the many-faceted process of transition from female-oriented to male-oriented religions in western
civilization.
Our culture has been deeply penetrated by the notion that "man" nor woman is created in the image of God. This notion
persists, despite the likelihood that the creation goes in the other
direction: that God is a human projection of the image of man. No
known religion, past or present, ever succeeded in establishing a
completely sexless deity. Worship was always accorded either a female or a male, occasionally a sexually united couple or an androgy
nous symbol of them; but deities had a sex just as people have a sex. The ancient Greeks and others whose culture accepted homosexuality
naturally worshipped homosexual gods. (See Hermes.)

Introduction Modern Christians take it for granted that they must revere the
figures of a Father and a Son, never perceiving divinity in corre^^^^^^^^^^ sponding Mother and Daughter figures, as the ancients did. Though
Catholics still worship the Goddess under some of her old pagan
titles, such as Mother of God, Queen of Heaven, Blessed Virgin and so on, their theologians refuse to admit that she is the old Goddess in a
new disguise, and paradoxically insist on her non-divinity. (See Mary.) The older concept of the female Holy Trinity ruling all cycles of creation, birth, and death in her Virgin, Mother, and Crone forms,
was destroyed by Christians' attacks on her temples, scriptures, rituals, and followers. The church declared from the first that the Great
Goddess "whom Asia and all the world worshippeth" must be despised,
"and her magnificence destroyed" (Acts 19:27). This is virtually the only Gospel tenet that churches followed through all their centuries
with no deviation or contradiction. It seemed necessary to hide the
fact that Christianity itself was an offshoot of Middle-Eastern Goddess
worship, skewed by the asceticism of Persia and India. (See Jesus
Christ.) As a salvation cult, early Christianity based its scheme of redemption on the premise of female wickedness. Salvation was needed
because there had been a Fall, brought about by archetypal Woman. Without the myth of Eve's defiance, there would have been no sin,
hence no need for salvation or savior. (See Eve.) Fathers of the church
declared that the original sin was perpetuated through all generations by every woman, through sexual conception and birth-giving. Woman's mysterious, devilish sexual magnetism seduced men into the "concu
piscence" that, even within lawful marriage, transmitted the taint of sin
to every man. (See Sex.) So said St. Augustine, and the church never
altered his opinion.
Throughout history we find clergymen advocating abuse of women, to express their horror of female sexuality and their conviction
that all women deserve punishment for the primordial crime that
brought death and damnation to man. Adam, representing all men, was less guilty than Eve, representing all women. St. Paul even
regarded Eve as the only guilty one (1 Timothy 2:14). The tradition
persisted up to the present century, when the clergy, if not advocating active abuse of women, at least refrained from too much interference
with it. Some clergymen have been found to be wife-batterers. Many still counsel women to be subservient to men, in accordance with
"God's will." (See Sexism.) Man's and God's attack on women was not usually justifiable as
revenge for real injuries. Therefore the mythical injury of the Fall was essential to the early theological scheme. The practical goal was not
to prevent women from hurting men, but to prevent women from
acting independently of men: from owning their own property, earning their own money, making their own sexual choices, or raising their own children without interference.
Patriarchal religion declared war on pagan societies where mother



hood was once considered the only important parental relationship
where women owned the land and governed its cultivation; and sexual
attachments were made and unmade at women's discretion. (See
Matrilineal Inheritance.) From a biological viewpoint, patriarchal
religion denied women the natural rights of every other mammalian
female: the right to choose her stud, to control the circumstances of her mating, to occupy and govern her own nest, or to refuse all males
when preoccupied with the important business of raising her young.
(See Motherhood.)
Such basic biological rights of the female were set aside by
patriarchal human societies although, at the dawn of history, the
social role of male begetters was very differently conceived, in'a way
alien to modern patriarchal thought. (See Kingship.) Today's scholars habitually call all female and male deities of that ancient world
"gods," as they also call humanity "man." Yet the supreme deity of
that world was usually a Goddess, the creatress or Mother of the gods;
and the very word "man" used to mean "woman," an incarnation of
the same lunar Mother, in its original language. (See Man.)
Early Christian thinkers rightly perceived that destruction of the women's Goddess would mean a crushing blow to women's pride
and confidence, since men's pride depended greatly on their vision of a
God like themselves, only better. Women were not called daughters
of this God, who gave men their souls. In the sixth century, churchmen
even denied that women had any souls.
Forbidden by Christian conquerors to express their own faith, the
women of Europe eventually adopted the men's faith perforce. Sometimes they were lured by specious concessions, which were afterward rescinded. (See Convent.) Sometimes they were coerced by Christianized husbands or overlords. The myths and secrets of
women's spiritual past were buried, just as men buried the sheila-na
gig figures of semi-pagan Irish churches, hoping they would never be
found. (See Sheila-Na-Gig.) However, what Christian histories rarely admit is that, after more
than a thousand years of alternate violence and guile, the western
world still was not truly Christianized. The ancient faith persisted,
because every man was still born of woman and nurtured by woman,
despite the theologians' insistence that a father was the only significant
parent. (See Paganism.) This was mere verbal learning, as contrasted with the direct experience of infantile dependence on the mother.
When it appeared at all, father-love seems to have been a somewhat
less satisfactory artificial imitation of mother-love. (See Fatherhood.) In relations between fathers and children the more dominant emo
tion was fear. Men were enjoined from the pulpit to instill "the fear of
God" into their children through harsh punishments.
Harshest of all were the Heavenly Father's punishments: a terrible
vision of eternal torture developed out of men's fears. The Christian
hell was the most sadistic fantasy ever to masquerade as fact. (See Hell.)
Churchmen used it, not only to terrify naive congregations into
Introduction



Introduction compliance, but also to excuse the torture and burning of witches.
Inquisitors said the eternal punishment of such heretics should begin
^^^^^^^^^^ in this life, continuing up to the victim's death. (See Inquisition.)
The religion of the Goddess and her sons and lovers, the old gods, came to be called devil worship because these deities were redefined
as devils (when they were not adopted into the Christian canon as pseiido-saints). The link between "woman" and "devil" in the
patriarchal mind was as old as the Garden of Eden story. (See Serpent.)
It persisted even after the dawn of a more enlightened age brought the decline of organized persecution. However, the rack and stake were replaced in the 18th and 19th centuries by more subtle abuses, aimed
at suppressing women legally, politically, economically, and psychologically. Clergymen helped by opposing women's education and supporting all physical or legal measures for keeping women "in their place." As Sir Hermann Bondi accurately observed, men made God
their primary source for "the common and undisguised contempt for women enshrined in the three great Western religions, the basis for
the cruel, inhuman and wasteful sexism still so rampant." Women's
feelings of unworthiness and insecurity, even aberrations like mas
ochism and depression, often may be traced to training in a male
oriented religion, at variance with their own nature.
Recently, some women have begun to seek better understanding of that feminine nature, buried as it was under western society's
proliferation of masculine images and values. One interesting idea to
emerge from this new research is, if women's religion had continued, today's world might be less troubled by violence and alienation. Gods,
including Yahweh, tended to order their followers to make war; whereas the great mother Goddesses advocated peaceful evolution of
civilized skills. Cooperation rather than exploitation was the matriar
chal rule. (See War.) Goddess worship usually entailed frank acceptance of the natural cycles of sexuality, birth, and death; and maternal concern for the
welfare of coming generations. Love was not the abstract principle that "love of God" was to become. In the very process of worship it could
be directly, intimately, and physically experienced. (See Karuna.) Certainly there was still a strong element of this Oriental-feminist concept in the medieval "heresies" that aroused the ire of the church.
(See Romance.) Perhaps the most important part of any religion is the direction it
gives to interpersonal behavior patterns. The patterns evolved by women in honor of their ancient Goddess surely deserve close study
today. As one of the Goddess's scriptures pointedly said, "What use are grand phrases about the soul on the lips of those who hate and injure
one another? . . . Religion is kindness." (See Atheism.) Traces of the "kind Goddess" are still to be found in a thousand
hidden pockets of history and custom: myths, superstitions, fairy tales,
folk songs and dances, nursery rhymes, traditional games and holidays,



magic symbols, sagas, and scriptures both original and revised, apoc- Introduction
ryphal and otherwise in addition to the valuable material recovered by
archeologists, orientalists, and other scholars. Patterns emerge from
comparative studies, which can be fitted together like pieces of a jigsaw ^^^^^^
puzzle. The puzzle is far from complete; but many of its pieces are here, in this book.
These Myths and Secrets are drawn from more than paganism.
Biblical myths are especially significant, not only because they shaped the attitudes of western culture, but also because they were written and
rewritten during centuries of transition from matriarchal to patriarchal
systems. The later development of Christian myths contributed much to sexist thinking. In Europe, sexism was a primary product of the Christian church. Patriarchal religions like Judaism and Christianity established and upheld the "man's world" largely by an elaborate structure of falsehood. Among the Secrets in this book are many
surprising historical secrets that were covered up, whitewashed, or
otherwise falsified through 1 500 years when the church maintained a
monopoly of literate records, and virtually wrote its own history to its own order.
Some of the facts concealed by that Christian history have come to
light in recent decades. Others are being kept secret even now, by
religious organizations still dedicated to preserving a patriarchal society. Laymen and especially women are theoretically forbidden to investi
gate them. Nevertheless, they can be found out. Naturally, the secret most deeply concealed by Christianized
history was the many-named Goddess, the original Holy Trinity who created and governed the world, gave birth to its Saviors, sent her tablets
of divine law to the prophets, and watched over every life from womb
to tomb, according to pre-Christian belief. Today she is viewed as
"mythical," having been replaced by a God (equally mythical, but more acceptable to a male-dominated culture), who took over most of
her attributes. It is not usually understood that the spiritual life of
western man, and especially of western woman, was greatly impoverished by her violent suppression. The unremitting warfare of the church against followers of the
Goddess is a large part of what feminists now call our hidden history.
Even though Christianity itself grew out of the once-universal religion
of the Goddess, it was a matricidal son whose bigotry tinged every thought and feeling with woman-hatred. In the end it produced a
society in which members of one sex invariably oppressed members of the other, and both came to regard this inequity as a natural state of affairs, ordained by a male "Creator." Matters were otherwise in the pre-Christian world where the "Creator" was more often a "Creatress."
Through making God in his own image, man has almost forgotten that woman once made the Goddess in hers. This is the deep secret of
all mythologies, and the fundamental secret of this book.

Abaddon Sacred alphabets of the ancient world signified birth and beginning by
the letter A. This letter meant the Creatress, who invented alphabets and gave them to mankind though most traditions said womankind had them first.
Babylonians called the Great Mother "A", the Beginning; or Aya, the Mother of All Things. 1 Tantric sages called her birth-letter Alpa
Akshara, "the letter A, which is considered the 'mother of all wisdom,'
and therefore of all men of genius; all Bodhisattvas and Buddhas are
said to have been produced by 'A'." 2 The Greeks held similar views about the letter Alpha, which de
noted the river of birth or creation. Its other name was Styx, the river
of death, for in the cyclic system of the ancients, birth and death merged in a circular continuum. The river Styx circled seven times through
the earth's womb and emerged again as Alpha.

Ab
Egyptian word for the heart-soul, most important of the seven souls: the one that would be "weighed in the balances" by the Goddess Maat
in the underworld Hall of Judgment after death. As in India, the
heart-soul was pictured as a tiny dancer treading a constant rhythm in
the midst of the body, as Dancing Shiva or Dancing Kali kept the
rhythm of life in the midst of the cosmos. The hieroglyphic sign of the
ab was a dancing figure.

var. Abaton Abaddon
The god Apollo was a solar king in heaven during the day, and a Lord of Death in the underworld at night. His latter form became the
Jewish Apollyon, Spirit of the Pit (Revelation 9:1 1). Apollo-Python was the serpent deity in the Pit of the Delphic oracle, who inspired the seeress with mystic vapors from his nether world. The Greek word
for the Pit was abaton, which the Jews corrupted into Abaddon later a
familiar Christian synonym for hell.
Also called a mundus or earth-womb, the abaton was a real pit,
standard equipment in a pagan temple. Those who entered it to
"incubate," or to sleep overnight in magical imitation of the incubatory sleep in the womb, were thought to be visited by an "incubus" or
spirit who brought prophetic dreams. 1 Novice priests went down into
the pit for longer periods of incubation, pantomiming death, burial, and rebirth from the womb of Mother Earth. Once initiated in this way,
they were thought to gain the skill of oneiromancy: the ability to
interpret dreams.



The Old Testament Joseph earned his oneiromantic talent by Abishag
incubation in a Pit. The "brothers" who put him there seem to have
been fellow priests. He could interpret Pharaoh's dreams only after he ^
had submitted to the ritual. Assyrian priests derived similar powers
from a sojourn in the Pit. 2 They then assumed the priestly coat of many
colors, signifying communion with the Goddess under her oneiromantic name of Nanshe, "Interpreter of Dreams." 5 It seems likely that Joseph's coat of many colors would have been given him
originally not before the initiation but afterward, by a "father" who was
actually the high priest. 4 The same burial-and-resurrection ritual is found in the lives of
many ancient sages. It was said of the Pythagorean philosopher Thales of Miletus, accounted one of the Seven Wise Men of the
ancient world, that he derived his intellectual skills from communion with the Goddess of Wisdom in an abaton. 5

Abishag
The Bible claims the maiden Abishag was chosen for her beauty, to
engender "heat" in the aged King David (1 Kings 1:2). This "heat" was not mere warmth, but the sacred fire of sexual potency, without
which no king could be allowed to rule. If an impotent king were kept in
office, his land would become barren. Hence, when David failed to
"know" Abishag, a more virile prince (Adonijah) immediately prepared to assume the throne, and "exalted himself, saying, I will be king"
(I Kings 1:5). David's death occurred with suggestive promptness after his failure of the virility test.
Abishag's name might be related to the Hindu abhiseka ceremony,
the anointing of kings with the sacred fluid of the Goddess Sarasvati. 1
From China to the Mediterranean, ancient kings derived their
legitimation from a mating with the Goddess through her priestess
surrogate. 2 Mesopotamian kings and their deified souls, the gods, were constantly described as "beloved" of the Goddess known as creatress of the earth and "maker of fate, she who decrees the fate of
the men and gods." 5 Like the eastern Goddess, Abishag represented the land in the same way as Solomon's bride, whose mating was chronicled in the requisite intimate detail by the Song of Solomon. After David's death, the queen mother chose between rival candi
dates Solomon and Adonijah. She crowned Solomon with her own
hands (Song of Solomon 3:11), after the custom of the royal women
whose business it was to enthrone or depose kings, as in India, Egypt,
and the lands of the Fertile Crescent. 4 However, Adonijah still had
designs on the throne, as shown by his request for the hand of
Abishag in marriage. To prevent this symbolically and politically significant marriage from taking place, Solomon had Adonijah murdered



Abortion (1 Kings 2:17-25). The Bible fails to explain Solomon's strangely violent reaction to Adonijah's request; but it can only have meant that ^^^^^^^^^^^ the crown was at stake. This in turn shows that a sexual union with
Abishag was a prerequisite for royal office. See Kingship.

Abortion
The ancients generally viewed abortion as a woman's private busi
ness, in which no man had any right to interfere. As Hartley put it, "Each woman must be free to make her own choice; no man may
safely decide for her; she must give life gladly to be able to give it well." 1
But with the rise of patriarchal religions especially among the Greeks came a belief that a father's semen conveyed the soul to the
fetus. Men feared for the safety of any of their body effluvia (hair
cuttings, fingernail clippings, spittle, blood) lest sorcery might damage the living man by damaging what was once a part of him. The fear was particularly pronounced in the case of semen as an extension of the
father's soul. If the fetus he conceived were destroyed, then surely the
man himself would suffer spiritual injury according to the principles of magic. St. Thomas Aquinas held this same opinion, since he asserted
that semen was the vehicle of souls. 2 It was a logical extension of this
notion that abortion should be outlawed, not because it was danger
ous to women, but because it was thought (magically) dangerous to men.
In the east, however, abortion was perfectly legal at any time
before the fifth month, when "quickening" was felt. After that,
according to Brahman scriptures, a woman who destroyed her fetus was held guilty of murder, but before that time the fetus was soulless and
could be destroyed with impunity. 3 This opinion was embodied in the Catholic church's Doctrine of Passive Conception, which contradict
ed Aquinas in order to prove that the soul comes only from God. Up to
the late 19th century, the Doctrine of Passive Conception declared
that the soul arrives in the fifth month of pregnancy, to quicken the
fetus, which was previously soulless.4
In 1 869 the church again revised its opinion, tacitly admitting either that God had misinformed his church about his method of
instilling the soul into the body, or else that he had decided to alter it.
Pope Pius X announced that the soul was received at conception
after all. 5
Actually, the church was only coming around, several decades late, to follow some new laws made by man, not by God. Abortion was
not classified as a crime in Europe until the 19th century. 6 The United
States first defined abortion as a criminal offense in the year 1830. 7
The church now falsely pretends that it officially "always" opposed abortion. The medieval church's ire was aroused not by abortions per



se but by the midwives who performed them. The handbook of the Abraham
Inquisition stated: "No one does more harm to the Catholic faith than midwives." 8 (See Midwifery.) The church was not averse to ^^^^^^^^
killing the unborn, since it burned many pregnant women as witches. Even the pregnant wife of a city councillor was tortured and burned at Bamberg in 1630. 9
Recent opposition to legalization of abortion apparently stemmed
from ignorance of how recently it was illegalized; and also from male belief that women must be controlled by forcing childbirth on them.
"Male legislators have laughed at the idea of the legalization of abor
tion, hinting at unprecedented promiscuity (on the part of women, not men) if such a thing were allowed. Meanwhile, thousands of desper
ate women die each year as the direct result of male laws making
abortion illegal. Women are learning the meaning of this male laughter and indifference in the face of the most hazardous and serious
biological enterprise women undertake, willingly or not." 10 The Catholic church still claims authority over women's repro
ductive functions. Catholic hospitals will refuse to abort even a fetus conceived by rape. 11

Abraham
This name meaning "Father Brahm" seems to have been a Semitic
version of India's patriarchal god Brahma; he was also the Islamic
Abrama, founder of Mecca. But Islamic legends say Abraham was a
late intruder into the shrine of the Kaaba. He bought it from priestesses
of its original Goddess. 1 Sarah, "the Queen," was one of the Goddess's titles, which became a name of Abraham's biblical "wife." 2 Old
Testament writers pretended Sarah's alliances with Egyptian princes
were only love-affairs arranged by Abraham for his own profit which
unfortunately presented him as a pimp (Genesis 12:16) as well as a would-be murderer of his son (Genesis 22:10). In the tale of Isaac's near-killing, Abraham assumed the role of
sacrificial priest in the druidic style, to wash Jehovah's sacred trees with the Blood of the Son: an ancient custom, of which the sacrifice of
Jesus was only a late variant. Jehovah first appeared to Abraham at
the sacred oak of Shechem, where Abraham built his altar. Later Abraham built an altar to the oak god of Mamre at Hebron. Even in
the 4th century a.d., Constantine said Abraham's home at the Oak of
Mamre was still a pagan shrine: "It is reported that most damnable
idols are set up beside it, and that an altar stands hard by, and that
unclean sacrifices are constantly offered." 3

Abraxas Absalom
var. Abrasax
Abraxas
Gnostic god identified with both Mithra and Jehovah, called "Our
Father" and "Lord of Hosts" in the early Christian era. 1 Like Mithra,
Abraxas represented "the 365 Aeons," 365,000 years allotted to the present world's life span, based on the Hindu idea that one god
year equals a thousand man-years. Jewish scripturists incorporated this belief into Psalms 90:4, and into the First Book ofAdam and Eve,
where God said his five and a half days meant 5,500 years for man. 2 Numerical values of Mithra's and Abraxas's names each totaled 365.
Both were gods of numerology. Orthodox Christianity came to view Abraxas as a demon, because he was assimilated to the Gnostic "Lord of This World" whose attributes were both divine and demonic. As the Creator of the material
universe, he was declared a devil via the Gnostic opinion that all
matter was evil. Thus, he and his works the material world itself
would be destroyed at doomsday. 5 Nevertheless, through the Middle Ages Abraxas was a favorite deity of several heretical sects.
1. Budge, AT., 209. 2. Forgotten Books, 6. 3. Legge 2, 239.
Absalom
The Bible presents Absalom as either David's son or David's neigh
bor (2 Samuel 12:1 1) because biblical writers couldn't decide just where
he came from. He was important only as a surrogate "king" of the Jews. His name, Father Salm, was a widely distributed sacred-king name, also rendered Salma, Salem, Salomon, or Solomon; in Assyria, Shalmaneser; in Crete, the "son of God" Salmoneus. 1 The name meant Prince of Peace, which was synonymous with Lord of Death because "Peace" was the Lord's word of farewell as he descended into
the underworld. Canaanites worshipped Father Salm at the city of Salem, whose
Palestinian counterpart was Jeru-salem, "House of Salem." Kings of David's ancestral tribe, the Kenites, took the sacred name when ruling
in Jerusalem. Probably several of these kings were called Solomon, including the biblical one whose real name was Jedidiah, according to 2 Samuel 12:25.
Absalom received the sacred name and died as a surrogate for the
incumbent king, David, whose mourning for him was really a liturgical formula. He called Absalom "my son, my son," and cried "Would God I had died for thee" to disguise the fact that the victim
really had died in his place. Among ancient Semites generally, someone
had to die for the king at regular intervals, to preserve the fertility of the soil and the people with his blood. See Kingship. Time-honored precedent dictated the format of the drama. The
chosen victim sat on the throne, and publicly copulated with the royal
women under a marriage canopy (2 Samuel 16:22). See Huppah.



After this, Absalom was declared a god and his phallic spirit was Abtu
immortalized by an erect pillar (2 Samuel 1 8: 1 8). He was hung on a Achilles
sacred oak "between heaven and earth," like all victims offered to ^^^^^^^^^m
deities of the air and sky. 2 He was pierced through the heart by three
darts, like the Egyptian god Set. He was dismembered by ten men in
priests' livery (2 Samuel 18:14-1 5). According to the old custom, pieces of him were then distributed to the fields and vineyards to encourage
the growth of crops.

Abtu
The "Abyss," sometimes called Fish of Isis, representing her genital orifice, which "swallowed" the penis of Osiris. Abtu was the Egyptian
name of Abydos, an early yonic shrine where the god died and entered his Mother's womb, the underworld. See Fish.
Acedia
"Abysmal apathy," ecclesiastical term for the acute depression afflict
ing those in the monastic life. 1 They recognized that acedia
made monks and nuns especially susceptible to demonic possession. See Possession.

Achamoth
Mother Goddess who gave birth to the creator of the material uni
verse, according to early Gnostic Christians. 1 She was the third
person of a primordial female trinity consisting of Sige, Sophia, and Achamoth comparable to northern Europeans' divine GreatGrandmother, Grandmother, and Mother. 2 The three of them
chastised the male creator for excessive hubris and other offenses.
See Sophia, Saint.

Achilles
Homeric hero of the Iliad, greatest of the Greek warriors at the siege
of Troy. Achilles was a son of the Sea-goddess, here called Thetis, "She Who Disposes." Most of his body was invulnerable because his
mother dipped him in the holy river Styx when he was an infant; but
the spot on his heel, where her fingers held him, was not exposed to



Aciel the magical waters. Therefore he could be, and was, killed by an arrow
Adam in his heel, as was the Hindu Krishna. Hence any area of vulnerability
^^^^^^^^^^^ in an otherwise strong structure or person is known as an Achilles Heel.
Like Heracles, Achilles lived for some time in female disguise,
recalling the priesthoods of Homeric and pre-Homeric times who wore women's clothing to attain the powers of divinity.
Aciel
Black Sun of the Chaldean underworld; the god of darkness at the
bottom of the sevenfold Pit, exactly mirroring the gods of light at the top of the seventh heaven. Most underground gods and Lords of Death
were similar to Aciel Hades, Pluto, Saturn, Ahriman, Apollyon,
Python, Zeus Chthonios, and their later composite, the Judeo-Christian devil. Jewish writers made Aciel a "prince of Gehenna" and corrupted
his name to Arsiel. 1 He was not always devilish or evil. Oriental religions
generally recognized that a principle of darkness was necessary to life, for only in the nether darkness could regeneration take place.

Actaeon
Sacred king of the Artemis cult, impersonator of the Horned God; a man "turned into a stag" and devoured. His antecedents went back to
"paleolithic paintings in the Spanish caves of Altamira and in the
Caverne des Trois Freres at Ariege dating from at least 20,000 b.c." l
1. Graves, W.G., 229.
Adah and Zillah
"Brilliance" and "Shadow," biblical wives of Lamech; a trans
formation of the two-faced Goddess of birth and death, light and dark,
Alpha and Omega known in Anatolia as the Two Ladies, in Egypt
as the Two Mistresses. 1 The Goddess appeared in many light-and-dark,
heaven-and-hell, new-moon-and-old-moon combinations, such as
Isis-Nephthys, Ishtar-Ereshkigal, Kore-Persephone.
1 . Larousse, 29.
Adam
Literally, a man made of blood; in pre-biblical myths, a creature formed by the Goddess of Earth from her own clay (adamah), given life



by her blood. (See Eve.) The idea of Adam's rib was taken from a Adam-Kadmon
Sumerian Goddess who formed infants' bones from their mothers' ribs. Adelphos
She was both Lady of the Rib, and Lady of Life. Her name carried ^^^^^^^^^
both meanings at once. 1 See Birth-giving, Male. l.Hooke.M.E.M., 115.
Adam-Kadmon
Gnostic image of primordial man: an innocent know-nothing, a brute
Adam made of mud. Probably based on the most ancient Middle
Eastern view of humanity as a race of peasant-slaves created by the
gods to be farm workers and nothing else. In occult tradition Adam
Kadmon was the perennial Fool, or Prince of Fools, symbolizing the unenlightened man. His name was given to the zero-numbered FooloftheTarot. 1
l.Gettings, 111.
Adamu
Sumero-Babylonian version of the first man; one of the sources for
the biblical figure of Adam. The gods tricked him and his descendants
out of immortality because they didn't want mere mortals to become
deathless like gods. They lied to the man, telling him the magic food of
eternal life would kill him if he ate it. So he refused it and lost his
chance to escape death forevermore. 1 The biblical God also showed concern lest human beings should
eat the food of eternal life (Genesis 3:22). God told Adam the same
lie that the Babylonian god told Adamu: "Thou shalt not eat of it: for in
the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" (Genesis 2:17).
Adam ate, but he didn't die in the same day. On the contrary, he lived
to the age of 930 years (Genesis 5:5). It was the serpent who told the
truth about the controversial food: "Ye shall not surely die; for God
doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be
opened, and ye shall be as gods" (Genesis 3:4-5). l.Hooke.M.E.M., 57-58.
Adelphos
Greek word for "brother," dating back to the matriarchal period when kinship was reckoned only through a mother. Its literal meaning is "one from the same womb." 1

Aditi
Adonis
Aditi
Hindu Great Goddess as the Woman Clothed with the Sun, mother of all the lights of heaven. She gave birth to the twelve zodiacal
spirits called Adityas, "Children of Aditi," among whom was Aryaman,
the ancestral god of all "Aryans." ' See Sun Goddess.

Magic Papyri Collections of
exorcisms, invocations, charms, and spells widely circulated during the early Christian era, used as bases for
later grimoires and Hermetic texts.
Adonis
Greek version of Semitic Adonai, "The Lord," a castrated and
sacrificed savior-god whose love-death united him with Aphrodite, or
Asherah, or Mari. In Jerusalem, his name was Tammuz. Adonis was born at Bethlehem, in the same sacred cave that
Christians later claimed as the birthplace of Jesus. 1 He was the son of
the Virgin Myrrha, a temple-woman or hierodule, identified with Mary by early Christians who called Jesus's mother Myrrh of the Sea. 2
Myrrh was a symbol of the Lord's death, in both pagan and Christian
traditions. He returned to his Great Mother, the sea, Aphrodite-Mari.
Alexandrian priestesses celebrated the event by throwing the god's
image into the sea. 3
Syrian Adonis died at Easter time, with the flowering of the red
anemone, supposedly created from his blood. Its name was derived
from his title, Naaman, "darling." He was also called the Beautiful God,
like other gods of the spring flowering, such as Narcissus, Antheus,
Hyacinthus. Another form of the same god was Anchises, castrated after his
mating with Aphrodite. Adonis, too, was castrated: "gored in the
groin" by Aphrodite's boar-masked priest. His severed phallus became his "son," the ithyphallic god Priapus, identified with Eros in Greece
or Osiris-Min in Egypt. Priapus carried a pruning knife in token of the
Lord's necessary castration before new life could appear on earth. 4
Castrating the god was likened to reaping the grain, which Adonis
personified. His rebirth was a sprouting from the womb of the earth.
Each year, sacred pots called kernos or "gardens of Adonis" were
planted with wheat or millet, and allowed to sprout at Easter. The
custom was followed in Mediterranean countries up to the present
century. 5 The clay pot signified the womb. Sometimes in processions
it was a gigantic kernos carried on a chariot, having the special name of kalanthos.6
Adonis died and rose again in periodic cycles, like all gods of
vegetation and fertility. He was also identified with the sun that died
and rose again in heaven. An Orphic hymn said of him: "Thou shining
and vanishing in the beauteous circle of the Horae, dwelling at one
time in gloomy Tartarus, at another elevating thyself to Olympus, giving ripeness to fruits." 7 He was buried in the same cave (womb)
that gave him birth. It is now the Milk Grotto, whose dust is supposed to
10



benefit nursing mothers; it was said Mary nursed Jesus there. 8 The Adultery
Grotto was sealed as Jesus's sepulchre, for in the cults of both Jesus and Aeneas
Adonis the virgin womb was the same as the virgin tomb, "wherein ^^^^^^^^^
never man before was laid" (Luke 23:53).
The Magic Papyri said Jesus and Adonis also shared the same name-magic. "Adonai" was the highest god, having the True Name
that could work miracles.9 Centuries later, Christian authorities declared that "Adonai" was a demon.

Adultery
From adalterum se conferre, "to confer (property) upon another." 1 In the age of matrilineal inheritance, female property owners could leave cast-off husbands destitute by conferring their "matrimony"
(wealth) upon another. Patriarchal societies therefore sought to insure wives' sexual fidelity for economic reasons. 2
To this end, the Bible commands stoning to death an adulterous
wife or a bride suspected of oremarital affairs (Deuteronomy 22:21).
The latter rule was to invalicate the pagan custom of premarital
defloration by a stranger, lest someone other than the husband might
have a claim on the bride's property. 5 Hebrew patriarchs also considered
"adulterous" a widow who might remarry "unto a stranger" outside the paternal clan. Widows were ordered to marry the brother of a
deceased husband, so their property would remain under the control
of male in-laws. This law of Levirate Marriage with its apparently divine
sanction caused much trouble in later centuries.

Aegis
Goatskin breastplate of the Goddess Athene, ornamented with
oracular serpents and the petrifying head of Medusa. The original
Libyan Athene was herself the Gorgon mask surrounded by serpents,
served by priestesses who wore the aegis as a goatskin apron. It was a badge of divine power. Later Homeric myths considered the aegis so
essential to sovereignty that not even Zeus could rule the other gods
without it.
Aeneas
Son of Aphrodite, founder of Rome according to one version of the
story. He saved the sacred fetish called Palladium from the sack of
11



Aeon Troy, and carried it to the site of Rome, where it was installed in the
Agape, Saint temple of Vesta. Like all sacred kings he visited the underworld,
^^^^^^^^^^^ clutching the magic mistletoe branch that would insure his return to
earth. 1
1. Graves, W.G, 101.
Aeon
"The Year," title of any god annually sacrificed and reborn, such as the Savior born of the Virgin Kore at Alexandria every January. 1 The
classic Aeon appears to have been based on Tantric worship of ShivaPrajapati, who became a Lord of Death each year to bring about
redemption of human life. According to the Aitareya Brahmana, "The Year is the same as Death; and whosoever knows this Year to be
Death, his life that year does not destroy." 2

Aesir
"Asians," the Norse gods led by Father Odin, who invaded the lands
of the elder deities (Vanir). The Aesir came from Asaland, or Asaheimr, meaning both "land of gods" and "Asia." Some claimed their home
city was Troy. Such myths record the recurrent western migrations of
Indo-European or Aryan peoples. The Norse word for a god was Ass, "Asian." The Egyptian god Osiris was formerly Ausar, "the Asian." 2 Etruscans also called their ancestral deities Asians. 3 Phoeni
cian king Cadmus was "the Oriental," from kedem, "the Orient." 4
The Asian invaders were aggressive. The Voluspa said war occurred "for the first time in the world" when the Aesir attacked the
peace-loving people of the Goddess. 5

Agape, Saint
"Love Feast," first of Aphrodite's holy whores (Horae), was canonized as a Christian saint when icons of the Horae were re-labeled
"virgin martyrs": Sts. Agape, Chione, and Irene. 1 Agape originally
personified the rite of sexual communion, as practiced in Aphrodite's temples and adopted by some early Christian sects as a Tantric type
of "spiritual marriage." By the 7th century a.d. the agape ceremony was declared heretical, but it continued secretly throughout the Middle
Ages. 2 See Menstrual Blood.

Agatha, Saint Agatha, Saint
"Kindly One," a spurious saint based on images of the lactating
Agnes, Saint
Goddess offering bared breasts in the usual Ishtar pose. As a fictitious p
"virgin martyr," Agatha refused to marry the king of Sicily, who
vengefully ordered her breasts sliced off. Early Christian icons showed
her carrying them on a patera (offering dish) as St. Lucy carried her
eyeballs. 1 Later, the amputated breasts were misinterpreted as bells; so Agatha became patroness of bell founders. 2 Her legend may have
arisen from the Christian habit of knockingthe breasts off statues of priestesses and Goddesses. 3
The original Agatha was surnamed Tyche (Fate), and worshipped at the subterranean womb-oracle of Trophonios at Lebadeia.4 Like
the Goddess of the similar womb-oracle at Delphi, she was accompa
nied by a Great Serpent: the oracular spirit named Agathodemon, god of Kindly Fortune, worshipped by Orphic sects up to the 5th and 6th centuries a.d. Far from tormenting Agatha as her Christian
legend claimed, Sicilian kings won their thrones by way of a sacred marriage with her. Many of these kings took the name of Agathocles, "Glory of Agatha," just as Heracles called himself "Glory of Hera." 5
The Golden Legend conferred on St. Agatha the curious title of
Savior of Her Country, saying "She accomplished the deliverance of
her native land." 6 This probably referred to votive images of the
Goddess which were supposed to preserve the land from all external
dangers.

Agnes, Saint
Scholars say "next to the Evangelists and Apostles there is no saint
whose effigy is older" than the popular St. Agnes. 1 Indeed, she seems to
have been much older than evangelists and apostles: a Roman-Jewish version of the Holy Ewe Lamb (Agna), virgin incarnation of the Ewe
goddess Rachel. Like the virgin Mary, Agnes came from "immaculate" parents. The Portiforium ad usam Sarum said her mother was a virgin, her father a purified soul who renounced sexual love. 2 Like all the legendary virgin-martyrs, Agnes was slain because she renounced the love
of a pagan youth. However, her true nature as an orgiastic priestessheroine might be guessed from her ineradicable connections with
love and marriage. A priest became her bridegroom by placing a wedding ring on the finger of her statue, as if it were the statue of Aphrodite-Galatea. 3 Bollandus's Acts ofthe Saints said Agnes founded
her nunnery in a house of sacred prostitutes, like priestesses of
Aphrodite-Salacia. 4 All the way up to the present century, St. Agnes's Eve was the traditional time for girls to divine the names of their
future lovers by means of magic mirrors. 5
13



Agni Unfortunately for St. Agnes's credibility, she is said to have sufAhriman fered in the reign of Constantine when Christians were not
^
wmgn persecuted. It was also falsely claimed that Agnes cured Constantine's
daughter of leprosy. Roman Jews were said to have worshipped her in a church on the Via Nomentana, built in her honor in 350 a.d.; but
Roman Jews didn't worship Christian saints, and no churches were
built in honor of female martyrs in 350 a.d. 6 Roman Jews probably did,
however, worship at least one version of Agna the Holy Lamb. Though Catholic scholars now say Agnes's legends have been
found "disappointingly" devoid of truth, her relics are still preserved in Rome and constantly adored by the faithful. 7

Agni
Vedic fire god wedded to Kali under her name of Ambika, "Little Mother." She represented the primal ocean of blood from which all
things arose at creation; he represented the fructifying fire from heaven (lightning); their combination meant vital heat. Vedic sages said
the soul of all the universe, moving and still, is made of a combination
of blood and fire. Agni also appeared to consume sacrifices that were
burned on their altars. He was a prototype of such Indo-European
fire-bringers as Lucifer, Prometheus, Etana, Hephaestus, and Heracles. 1
1.0'Flaherty,97, 148,339.
Ahriman
Great Serpent, Lord of Darkness, and rival of the sun god in Persian
myth; leader of the daevas, whom Zoroastrians called devils, though the
original Indo-Iranian word meant "gods." 1 (See Serpent.) The story of Ahriman's revolt against his twin brother, the Heav
enly Father, of their war in heaven, and of the daevas'faW to the
underworld, gave western Europe its basic myth of the fall of Lucifer, and its dualistic division of the universe between forces of good and
evil. Persian prophets predicted the defeat of Ahriman and his dark
angels during the final battle at the end of the world, and Judeo
Christian prophets adopted the same idea. As the Serpent, Ahriman also
tempted the first man and woman. But Ahriman was not considered inferior to the Heavenly Father.
On the contrary, they were twins, born simultaneously from the womb of the primal Crone of Time (Zurvan). Ahriman's influence on
earth was greater than his celestial brother's, because he created the
material world. Persian Magi regarded him as the source of their magic
power, and offered sacrifices to him. Mithraic shrines from Budapest
14



to York were dedicated to "Arimanius" as the underground god of
magic arts. 2
Ahriman was not originally Persian. He was the Vedic god
Aryaman, maker of "Aryans" the people he created of clay. Aryaman was one of the twelve zodiacal sons of the Goddess Aditi. 3
He also had a Celtic incarnation, as the divine king Eremon.
l.Lamusse, 317. 2. Legge 2, 239. 3. O'Flaherty, 339.
Ahura Mazda Akka
Ahura Mazda
Persian sun god born as the twin brother of the dark god Ahriman
from the womb of Infinite Time, the Primal Creatress. The fight
between the brothers, resulting in Ahriman's fall from heaven, had the same cause as the rivalry between Cain and Abel that is, the
sacrificial offering of one was accepted by the older deity; that of the
other was rejected. The older deity was Vayu, probably a derivative of
the Vedic celestial androgyne Varuna, or Mitra-Varuna, whose other name became "Mithra".
The story of the battle and the fall might have been a revision of
the ancient creation myth concerning the Goddess's punishment of
her first-created serpent-consort for his hubris. 1 The name Ahura was once a feminine name. 2
Middle Persian forms of the name were Ormazd, Ormizd, or Hormizd. These names were commonly taken by kings who embod
ied the god's solar spirit, especially kings of the Iranian Sassanian
dynasty. 3 Being naturally deified after death, such kings had cult centers and groups of priests who kept up their worship. One of these apparently became converted to Christianity and contributed another
apocryphal saint to the Christian canon, usually misspelled "St. Hormidz," though Hormizd was obviously meant. This saint was vaguely placed in the 5th century a.d. and declared a Persian martyr, though his
legend lacked every kind of foundation, even that of common sense.
It was claimed that, for a refusal to renounce Christianity, St. Hormidz
was condemned to serve as a military camel-driver which may not
have been precisely a life of luxury, but hardly qualified as martyrdom.4
This sun-god-turned-saint was revered through the early Middle Ages by cult centers located in Persia and Iraq.

Aladdin of Aquarius. A similar Central-American Goddess figure had curiously
similar names, Acat or Akna. 1 ^^^^^^^^^^^ Akka had many related names. Greeks called her Acco or Acca,
"She Who Fashions." 2 To Lapps and Finns in northern Europe, she was Mader-Akka Mother Akka who created humanity. 3 To Ro
mans, she was Acca Larentia, or Acca the mother of the Lares, which
were archaic ancestral spirits left over from pre-Roman Latium.
Acca Larentia was variously called the first Vestal Virgin, or a
temple prostitute, or a rich courtesan, or a virgin bride of God roles that may seem mutually contradictory but were not so (see Prostitu
tion; Vestal Virgins). As the divine midwife, she helped Rhea Silvia give birth to Romulus and Remus, founders of Rome. She drew the
divine twins out of their floating basket on the river Tiber, just as
Akka of Akkad drew Sargon out of his floating basket on the river Tigris, and "Pharaoh's daughter" drew Moses from the Nile. Acca Larentia was honored every year at the Roman festival of the
Larentalia. She was assimilated to the cult of Heracles, who became one of her husbands. In his Roman temple, Heracles was mated to "Acca, the Maker." 4

Aladdin
Marco Polo described Aladdin quite differently from his mythic
portrait in the Arabian Nights. As the fairy tale said, he was master of a
secret cave of treasures, but the cave was real. It was located in the
fortified valley of Alamut near Kazvin, headquarters of the fanatical brotherhood of hashishim or "hashish-takers," which Christians mis
pronounced "assassins."
Aladdin was an Old Man of the Mountain, hereditary title of the
chief of hashishim, beginning with a Shi'ite leader Hasan ibn al
Sabbah, whose name meant Son of the Goddess (see Arabia). The later name of Aladdin was taken by several chieftains. In 1297 the region
of Gujarat was conquered by a warrior called the Bloody One, Ala-ud-den. 1
By means of drugs and an elaborate "paradise" staffed by human
Houris, initiates into the brotherhood were persuaded that they died
and went to heaven, or Fairyland, where gardens and palaces occupied the valley of the secret cave. Special conduits flowed with the Four
Rivers of Paradise: water, wine, milk, and honey. Each candidate was
drugged into a stupor, then woke and "perceived himself surrounded
by lovely damsels, singing, playing, and attracting his regards by the most fascinating caresses, serving him also with delicate foods and
exquisite wines; until intoxicated with excess of enjoyment amidst actual
16



rivulets of milk and wine, he believed himself assuredly in Paradise, Alako
and felt an unwillingness to relinquish its delights." 2 Alani After this period of bliss, the warrior was again drugged and taken ^^^^^^^^^^
out of the secret place, to fight in the service of the Old Man of the
Mountain. He fought fearlessly, in the belief that death in battle would
instantly carry him back to that heaven cleverly made real for him. Promises of sexual bliss were the real key to the ferocity of Islamic
armies. The Koran said each hero who died in battle would achieve
an eternity of pleasure among heavenly Houris with "big, beautiful, lustrous eyes." 3
Aladdin's sect worshipped the moon as a symbol of the Goddess, like the Vessel of Light associated with both the virgin Mary and the
Holy Grail in western Europe.4 Eastern poets said the Vessel of Light
produced djinn, "spirits of ancestors." This Vessel was simultaneous
ly Aladdin's lamp, source of djinni (a genie), and the moon, source of all souls according to the most ancient beliefs. The moon was the realm
of the dead, and also the realm of rebirth since all souls were recycled
through many revolutions of the wheels of Fate. The divine Houris
also dwelt in the moon, which probably was the light of Aladdin's secret cave. See Moon.
The Arabian Nights gave the password to Aladdin's cave: Open,
Sesame. This was related to Egyptian seshemu, "sexual intercourse."
The hieroglyphic sign of seshemu was a penis inserted into an arched
yoni-symbol. 5 Every ancient culture used some form of sexual
symbolism for the idea of man-entering-paradise. l.Zimmer( 54. 2. Polo 53-54. 3. Campbell, Oc. M, 430. 4. Wilkins, 58. 5. Budge, E.L., 58.
Alako
Gypsy "son of God" who takes the souls of gypsies to the moon after
death. Gypsies said Alako had two enemies: the devil, and Christ. 1
1. Trigg, 202.
Alani
"Hunting dogs," Greek name for the Scythian tribes who worshipped Artemis as their Divine Huntress. The name Alan still carried
the original Greek meaning of a hunting dog when it became popular among the Scots during the Middle Ages. Artemis was often called the Great Bitch, and her hunting priestesses were the "sacred bitches"
who chased, killed, and consumed boar-gods and stag-gods like Phorcis or Actaeon. Thus, to Christians, "son of a bitch" meant a devil worshipper that is, a pagan devotee of the Goddess. See Dog.

Alban, Saint Alban, Saint
Alchemy Fictitious saint called "protomartyr of England," allegedly the first
mmmmtammmatmm Christian martyr in the British isles, slain on Holmhurst Hill in 287 a.d. However, no writer made any reference to him until two hundred
years later. Gildas finally developed St. Alban's legend in the 6th century, with some confusion of dates. He claimed St. Alban shel
tered a Christian fleeing from Diocletian's persecution, twenty years
before Diocletian's persecution began. 1
The real origin of St. Alban probably was nothing more than the British Goddess's title of Albion, "White Moon." Her shrine at
Holmhurst Hill had a sacred fountain, always shown between the feet of
"Alban" in Christian art. 2 In Bede's day the place was still holy, and
someone had to invent a Christianized and preferably masculinized
legend for it.
l.Attwater, 37. 2. Brewster, 293.
Alberich
King of the underworld in Teutonic myth, identified with the Saxon
fairy-king Oberon. Alberich appeared in the Nibelungenlied as a chthonian dwarf master-smith, guardian of the Rhinemaidens' buried
treasure. Like most versions of the demonic fairy king, he was a shape
shifter, appearing in such typically diabolic disguises as a toad and a serpent. He is still familiar to opera fans as a character in Wagner's Ring
ofthe Nibelung.
Alchemy
In Arabic, alchemy meant "matter of Egypt," Al-Khemeia, from Khemennu, "Land of the Moon," an old name for Egypt. 1 The Arabs
thought alchemy was invented by Egyptians. Christians learned it from the Arabs and believed it was invented by Thoth, or Hermes, or
the virgin Mary. 2 "Mary the Jewess" was said to have been the first great alchemist.
She discovered distillation of alcohol in the time of the Caliphate, and
invented the double boiler, still called bain-marie (Mary's bath) in France. During the Renaissance some female alchemists were perse
cuted as witches. Julius, Duke of Brunswick, roasted one of them alive in an iron chair in 1 575, because she could not tell him how to make
gold out of base metal. 3
As a system of mysticism, alchemy was permeated by sexual symbols. So-called "copulations" and "marriages" figured in alchemical procedures. Sexual drawings enlivened the texts. The Alchemical
Rebus was the usual bisexual image of male and female powers in
union, "a Hermaphrodite, born of two mountains, Mercury and
18



Venus." Sun and moon were shown as naked male and female Alchemy
figures, the moon saying to her spouse, "O Sun, thou dost nothing
alone if I am not present with my strength, as a cock is helpless
-
without a hen." 4
Alchemists sought the divine female power Sapientia, or Sophia (Wisdom), the Gnostics' Great Mother. Valentin's L'Azoth des
philosophes showed her as a crowned, fish-tailed Aphrodite rising from the sea, spouting streams of milk and blood from her breasts. This
was a direct copy of Hindu representations of the virgin Maya, mother of the world. 5 Alchemists called her the Siren of the Philosophers,
"born of our deep Sea (Maria), who pours milk and blood from her
paps." 6 An Italian manuscript showed two bearded sages avidly sucking her breasts, to absorb the secrets symbolized by her colors, milk white and blood red. 7 The same colors appeared on the Flower of the
Alchemists, a five-petaled red-and-white rose, sometimes called the womb of the FiJium philosophorum or Glorious Child. The same rose
symbolized the virgin Mary. 8 Mary-Sophia was the Goddess of both Gnosticism and alchemy.
The Philosopher's Stone was sometimes called the Sophistical Stone. 9 Alchemical writings called the hidden Goddess the Mother of
Wisdom, combining elements of the Madonna with those of the
pagan mother-image:
lam the flower of the fleldand the lily ofthe valleys. lam the mother of fair love and offear and ofknowledge and ofholy hope. . .lam the mediator of the elements. . . . lam the law in the priest and the word in
the prophet and the counsel in the wise. I will kill and I will make to live and there is none that can deliver out ofmy hand. 10
Since the ancient Great Mother was represented by a Holy
Vase, alchemists sought the vas hermeticum (Womb of Hermes), which
resembled the vas spirituale identified with the virgin Mary. Arab
alchemists adopted the rosary from Far-Eastern cults of the Goddess,
whose rosary-symbol was a vase-shaped bead, from which the other beads were said to "spring up." Rosaries dedicated to Mary also had the
vase-shaped bead. Arabs called the rosary wardija, "rose-garden,"
copying the Hindu japamala, "rose-chaplet," the necklace of Kali Ma,
who ruled the elements as alchemists also hoped to do. A Diirer drawing of 1 506 shows a turbanned Arab alchemist with his rosary at his
belt. 11
Many alchemical texts presented obvious sexual allegories, e.g.
from the Turba Philosophorum: "Take the white tree, build him a
round, dark, dew-encircled house, and set in it a hundred-year-old man and close it so that no wind or dust can get to him; then leave him
there eight days. I tell you that that man will not cease to eat of the fruit
of that tree till he becomes a youth. O what a wonderful nature, for
here is the father become son and born again." 12
Similar allegorical references to the mysteries of reproduction were

Alchemy common among Chinese alchemists, who spoke of attaining "longev
ity through liquid gold," by "a red sulphurous ingredient in ^^^^^^^^^^^ goldmaking" the male and female essences in Taoist and Tantric
symbolism (see Menstrual Blood). One text said:
/ must diligently plant my own field. There is within it a spiritual germ that may live a thousand years. Its flower is like yellow gold. Its bud is not large, but its seeds are round and like unto a spotless gem [i.e., the
Jewel in the Lotus]. Its growth depends upon the soil ofthe central place [womb], but its irrigation must proceed from a higher fountain. Alter nine years [or, months] ofcultivation, root and branch may be trans
planted to the heaven of the higher genii. n
Churchmen were baffled by alchemical language, and usually
let practitioners of this particular "devilish art" alone, unless they were women. Yet the official opposition to the whole science kept many of
the best minds away from it, thus helping to retard the development of
modern chemistry out of alchemical experimentation. 14 The deep secrecy of the alchemists' operations still puzzles many modern scholars. Carl Jung wondered why these chemical processes
had to be disguised and distorted by thickets of mythological symbolism; or, if a mystical sort of enlightenment was being described, why it was tied to laboratory procedures. 15 The answer could be found in the alchemists' political environment. "Natural science" was often de
fined as heresy by the church. In periods when the Inquisition was
active, almost anyone meddling with such matters was at risk. The
best defense was deliberately obscure allegorization, in which theological principles if any could be hidden.
Some of the secret is given away by the preponderance of sexual
symbols in alchemical literature. "Copulation of Athene and Her
mes" might mean mixing sulfur and mercury in a retort; or it might mean a sexual "working" of the alchemist and his lady-love. Illustra
tions in alchemical books suggested sexual mysticism more often than not. Adam and Eve were shown as naked lovers, halves of the Primal
Androgyne. Adam was pictured as incomplete male, who had to be pierced by the Arrow of Mercurius to stimulate his passionate desire
for Wisdom. After this, his phallus bloomed into the flowering Tree of
Life, signifying that he was ready for full union with a Goddess-like Eve, who would make him complete. 16 Mercurius or Hermes was the alchemical hero who fertilized
the Holy Vase, a womb-like sphere or egg from which the films
philosophorum was to be born. This vessel may have been real, a
laboratory flask or retort; more often, it seemed to be a mystical
symbol. 17 The Royal Diadem of its offspring was said to appear in menstruo meretricis, "in the menstrual blood of a whore," who may have been the Great Whore, an ancient epithet of the Goddess. Her
menstrual blood curdled in her womb to create the universe, including
20



its metals, minerals, and other raw materials of alchemy. The Rosar- Alchemy
ium Phibsophorum (Rosary of the Philosophers) said the soul of the world is made of male and female "matters": Anima est Sol et Luna. ^^^^^^^^^
Similarly a human soul was produced by male and female parents.
Sexual mystics held a theory that every individual person or thing had
but half a soul, which must find its other half in the opposite sex. 18
At times the alchemists appeared to be seeking a lost deity, like the
cabalists' Shekina: the Mother {mater) sleeping in the material matter of the world, having been separated from the God whose other half she
was. Alchemists usually rejected the church's teaching that matter was "evil" or "fallen." As Gnostic animists they thought the "savior"
destined to emerge from the alchemical matrix (mother-womb) was
both an anthropomorphic Glorious Child or Hlius macrocosmi, and a
"miraculous stone" or Philosopher's Stone, possessing corpus, anima, spiritus, the "redeemer" of the inanimate universe. 19 As an enlightened
mystic the alchemist hoped to attend the birth of this strange being,
who would teach him to transform base metals into gold, as eastern
yogis were said to do when they were sufficiently enlightened. One reason why the church opposed alchemy and identified it with black magic was that many alchemical texts offered greater
revelations, more simply achieved, than the Bible or the pulpit could offer, and thus took on the character of a rival. For example, the
Abtala Jurain (1732) presented the whole creation:
Take ofcommon rainwater a good quantity, at least ten quarts; preserve it
well sealed in glass vessels for at least ten days, then it will deposit matter and feces on the bottom. Pour offthe clear liquid and place it in a wooden vessel that is fashioned round like a ball; cut it in the middle
and Hll the vessel a third full, and set it in the sun about midday in a secret or secluded spot. When this has been done, take a drop ofthe consecrated red wine
and let it fall into the water, and you will instantly perceive a fog and a thick darkness on top ofthe water, such as also was at the first creation.
Then put in two drops, and you will see the light coming forth from the
darkness; whereupon little by little put in every halfofeach quarter hour first three, then four, then live, then six, drops, and no more, and you will see with your own eyes one thing after another appearing by and by on top ofthe water, how God created all things in six days, and how it all came to pass, and such secrets as are not to be spoken aloud and I also have not power to reveal. Pall on your knees before you undertake this operation. Let your eyes judge ofit; for thus was the world created. Let all
stand as it is, and in halfan hour after it began it will disappear. By this you will see clearly the secrets of God, that are at present hidden from you as from a child. You will understand what Moses has
written concerning the creation; you will see what manner ofbody Adam and Eve had before and after the Fall, what the serpent was, what the tree, and what manner offruits they ate; where and what Paradise is, and
in what bodies the righteous shall be resurrected; not in this body that

Alcmene
"Power of the Moon," virgin mother of the solar Savior, Heracles. She was the Greek form of the Hebrew almah, "moon-woman," who mothered sacred kings in the Jerusalem cult, and whose title was
bestowed on the virgin Mary. 2 Parallels between earlier myths of Alcmene and later myths of Mary were too numerous to be coinci
dental. Alcmene's husband refrained from sexual relations with her until
her god-begotten child was born. The couple went on a journey "so
that the child has a birth place which is pot his parents' home." 3
Heracles also grew up to die a sacrificial death, after which he visited
the underworld and harrowed it, then rose to heaven to be assimilated to
his divine Father and to marry the Goddess's virgin aspect all over
again, to beget himself anew.

symbol the crescent moon still appears on Islamic flags, even though modern Moslems no longer admit any feminine symbolism whatever connected with the wholly patriarchal Allah. See Arabia.

Alleluia Alleluia
Medieval Christian version of an international word for the funeral ^^
keening that announced a sacred king's passage to the land of death, in mmmihhh^ ancient religious dramas. It was called the "howl," or ululation. The
Akkadian god Alalu was a direct anthropomorphization of the liturgical cry. It was houloi in Greek, uluktus in Latin, hulluloo or hulla-baloo
in Old Irish. 1 Herodotus said the "howlings in the temple" were derived from the cult of Athene in Libya, where "the women do it very
well." 2
Alleluia was used as a battle cry in the Middle Ages, and credited
with powerful victory-magic. The legend of St. Germain describes its use in a battle between Saxons and Britons. As the cry of the god
Pan was supposed to cause "pan-ic" in his enemies, so the sound of
alleluia was thought to kill the enemy's fighting spirit.

Altar
The custom of burying relics of saints under an altar began with a
misunderstanding of the scripture, "I saw under the altar the souls of
them that were slain for the word of God" (Revelation 6:9). This was
based on a pagan teaching, that the souls of the enlightened became stars in heaven. Those recently deceased stood on the border of the
sky, under the constellation of the Altar, which lies close to the horizon as seen from Mediterranean latitudes. 1 The Altar was a feminine constellation because the earliest altars
were modeled on the maternal hearth, and altars symbolized the
Mother. The Earth's regenerative womb was often represented as an

the belly of a living woman. The Heavenly Virgin was also an altar, Ara Coeli, "Altar of Heaven," she who received the souls of the dead.
Christians adopted this symbolism from the virgin Mary. One of the
Nativity legends claimed the Cumaean Sybil showed Augustus a vision of Mary, saying, "This woman is the Altar of Heaven." A church was built on the spot, and named Santa Maria in Ara Coeli. 2

Amazons
Greek name for Goddess-worshipping tribes in north Africa, Anatolia, and the Black Sea area. 1 Due to an erroneous belief that Amazon
warriors destroyed the right breast to be unhindered in drawing the
bow, some derived the name from a-mazos, "breastless." But Greek representations of Amazons showed no such mutilation. The idea may
have arisen from Asiatic icons of the Primal Androgyne with a male right half and female left half, echoed by a coalescence of the Amazon Goddess Artemis with her brother-consort Apollo. Scholars now say the word Amazon meant "moon-woman." 2 Suetonius said, "Amazons once ruled over a large part of Asia." As
late as the 5th century a.d., the Black Sea was still known as the Amazon Sea.* Libya which used to mean all of North Africa except Egypt was also Amazonian. Herodotus spoke of Libyan Amazons.
Diodorus, first century Greek historian, called them "the warlike women of Libya." To this day, north African Berbers call themselves
Amazigh, though their common name came from Latin barbari, "barbarians." 4
The ancients said Amazons were the first to tame horses, which
24



may well account for their armies' legendary invincibility. 5 In open
country, mounted troops whether male or female would have a decided advantage over foot soldiers.
In Amazonian myths, the Goddess was often worshipped as a mare: India's mare-mother Saranyu, mare-headed Demeter, or Cretan Leukippe the "White Mare," whose priests were castrated and wore female dress.6 Among Scythians also, men entered the service of the Goddess by castrating themselves and adopting women's cloth
ing. The only deity shown in Scythian art was the Great Goddess,
whom the Greeks called Artemis, or Hestia, or Gaea (the Earth). 7
Some of the Scythians settled in Parthia, "Virginland," named after their Goddess. They came to be known as Sacae, and their chief city
was Sacastene, now Seistan. 8
Scythians were governed by priestess-queens, usually buried alone
in richly furnished kurgans (queen-graves). Five kurganswere discovered together at Pasyryk in southern Russia in 1954. Scythian
priestesses were elder women, old enough to have gray hair. They performed traditional sacrifices, catching the blood in sacred cauldrons
and taking omens from the entrails. They also accompanied their
armies into battle, to cast spells for victory.9 The moon-sickle used in mythical castrations of gods was a
Scythian weapon. A long-handled form therefore came to be called a
scythe, and was assigned to the Grim Reaper, who was originally Rhea Kronia in the guise of Mother Time, or Mother Death the Earth who devoured her own children. Scythian women apparently used such
weapons in battle as well as in religious ceremonies and agriculture.
Diodorus said Scythian women "fight like the men and are nowise
inferior to them in bravery." 10 A Scythian girl was allowed to marry
only after she had killed three enemies in battle. 11
It wasn't unusual for barbarian armies to include women. Femi
nine magic power was often considered necessary for victory. The
Bible says Barak commanded an army of 10,000 men, but refused to go
into battle unless the priestess-queen Deborah went along, to cast
victory spells for him (Judges 4:8). Tacitus told of druidic forces
repelling Roman invaders on the island of Mona (Moon) in 61 a.d.: among the soldiers, black-clad women waved swords and cursed the
enemy "like the Furies." 12
Greek myth says Amazon tribes occupied Cappadocia, Samothrace, and Lesbos, and founded the cities of Smyrna, Ephesus,
Cymes, Myrine, and Paphos all leading centers of Goddess-worship. Amazons came to the aid of matriarchal Troy in the Trojan War. The Amazon queen Penthesileia fell beneath the sword of Achilles,
who immediately violated her dead body. Homer attributed this
necrophilic act to Achilles's love of her beautiful corpse. More likely, it was a magic charm to immobilize her vengeful spirit. Greeks feared the ghosts of slain Amazons. They called them Beautiful Ones, built

shrines to them, and offered them propitiatory sacrifices for centuries
after the war. 13
Theseus, king of Attica, violated the Amazons' law of matrilocal
marriage by kidnapping their queen, variously named Hippolyta, Antiope, or Melanippe (Black Mare). Some said Antiope was the sister of Hippolyta. The former was slain by Theseus, the latter by
Heracles, who wished to steal her magic girdle. Enraged, the Amazons
invaded Greece, ravaged coastal towns, and besieged Athens. 14 Amazons and Greeks became hereditary enemies. A later Amazon
queen named Artemisia (Spirit of Artemis) joined Xerxes to fight the Greeks at the battle of Salamis in 480 b.c. not because she loved
Persians, but because she hated Greeks. 15 Greek myths mention several Islands of Women, where Amazons
lived without men, only consorting with neighboring colonies of males at certain seasons when they wanted to conceive their children.
Taurus, Lemnos, and Lesbos were said to be such all-female societ
ies. The Greeks apparently feared them. They said the women of Taurus sacrificed to their Goddess all men who landed on their
shores; and the women of Lemnos had risen up against their husbands and murdered all of them at once. 16 The Greek writers seemed to have no doubt that women could destroy whole populations of adult
males, and there was no effective defense against them. Northern Europe had mythical Amazons: the Valkyries, warriormaidens of Valhalla. There were also real Amazons among the
Vikings: female captains and war-chieftainesses. 17 In the 10th century
a.d. a Norwegian fleet invaded Ireland and devastated Ulster and the
northeast, under the command of a warrior queen called the Red Maiden. 18 Another warrior queen, Olga, was one of the first rulers of Kiev. 19 Medieval historians said Amazons ruled the city of Ulm from
before the time of Abraham to the time of Alexander the Great. The
city was named for the sacred elms (ulmae) of the grove where they worshipped Diana-Artemis. 20
Again and again, legends mention the women's magic battle-cries,
which made their enemies helpless. The Valkyrie Kara deprived her
enemies of power to wield their weapons by the sound of her voice. 21 A Celtic Valkyrie, Nemhain, cursed Cu Chulainn's warriors and made a hundred of them drop dead on the spot. 22 The Lebor Gabala Erenn Book ofthe Taking ofIreland said
the very first expedition of colonists to Ireland was led by a woman. 23
Ireland had female soldiers up to the 7th century a.d., when Christian
legal reforms forbade women to bear arms. 24 The tradition persisted
in connection with weddings. A bride's costume up to the 17th century
included a knife at the belt. 25 But after the 9th century, female warriors in Celtic lands were labeled "witches." 26 In the Amazons'
territory around the Black Sea, women retained certain Amazon
26



customs up to the 18th century: dressing in men's clothes, riding Ambrosia horseback astride, and fighting beside the men in war. 27 Amphitrite

A rabbi who opposed St. Paul. In the Acts of the Apostles, Ananias

though they seemed to think he must surrender all of it. For this offense, St. Peter made Ananias "fall down dead" along with his wife
Sapphira, and young men of the apostles' sect buried them. The
apostles were imprisoned for murder, but "an angel" came secretly at
night and let them out of jail (Acts 5:1-19). This curious story was much repeated in connection with collec
tion of church taxes. Withholders of tithes were called "liars" like
the sinful Ananias.

"Necessity," a Neoplatonic-Pythagorean title of the Goddess who governed the world according to karmic law; another name for Fortuna,

Greek images of Ananke (Necessity), Dike (Justice), Heimarmene
(Allotted Fate), and Nemesis (Retribution) all goddesses which were feared and respected." Anaximander said it was according to
Ananke that the "source of generation for all things is that into which
their destruction also leads." Stoic philosophers made Ananke or Hei
marmene the supreme all-ruling world principle, with absolute authority over even the gods. The Orphics said Ananke was mated to
Chronos (Time), which gave rise to the concept of supernatural duality known as Time-and-Fate. 1 It might be said there was no Greek
28



idea of "God" that could transcend or overrule the feminine image of
Ananke as the inescapable What-Must-Be.

Ananta
"The Infinite," a great serpent in whose coils Hindu gods spent their
periods of sleep or death between periods of activity.
1 The serpent might be compared to the ancient Egyptian goddess Mehen the Enveloper, a serpent who enfolded Ra every night when he was "dead" in the underworld. The sex of the eternal serpent was indeterminate.
Earlier myths tended to see it as female, a cosmic Kundalini. Later Vedic traditions tended to view Ananta as male.

Anastasia, Saint
"She Who Stands in Heaven," title of Rome's Great Goddess,
personified as a pseudo-saint. Her three "serving-maids" Agapeta, Theonia, and Irene were originally the three Horae or Graces who attended the Goddess.
Her Christianized legend associated Agapeta, Theonia, and Irene with a man who suffered a ceremonial death in the same way as
ancient victims of the pagan Mamuralia or scapegoat-sacrifice. He was
beaten with rods, reviled and spat upon, then shown a vision of the
Triple Goddess in his moment of death, whereupon he "fell into a sleep so deep" that no further blows could waken him. 1
Hagiographers claimed Anastasia was another one of the "virgin
martyrs" slain by Diocletian's persecution. However, modern scholars admit that she never existed except as a label on statues of the
Goddess, which were re-interpreted as images of a saint. 2 Her holy day was the same as that of the sun's birth from the Great Mother at the
winter solstice: December 25. By the old lunar calendar, this festival
began with its Eve, December 24, called Matrum Noctem, "Night of the Mother." 3

Anath
Ras Shamra texts Cuneiform tablets discovered in 1929 in the Ras Shamra mound, northern Syria, site of the ancient Canaanite capital city of Ugarit. The texts reveal Canaanite foundations of biblical material.
Heaven and Mistress of All the Gods. Under the Greek Ptolemaic
dynasty she ruled both Egypt and Palestine. Semitic texts named her
Virgin Daughter of Palestine, or Virgin Wisdom Dwelling in Zion. 1 The Jerusalem temple was occupied for centuries by both God (El) and this Goddess, variously known as Queen of Heaven, Anat, Asherah, Mari, or Miriam. 2 Her sanctuary Beth-Anath (House of
Anath) is mentioned in the 19th chapter of Joshua. Some early Israelite chieftains called themselves her sons, like Shamgar ben Anath,
who "slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad"
(Judges 3:3 1). The ox goad was a magic spell, represented by the letter lamedh, which means "ox goad." In Sicily, a Phoenician settlement
was named after this Goddess, Mach-Anath. Greeks called it Panorma, meaning Universal Mountain Mother. 3
Primitive sacrificial rites of Anath or Anat were described in the
Ras Shamra texts. She was fertilized by the blood of men, not by their
semen, because her worship dated all the way back to the Neolithic when fatherhood was unknown and blood was considered the only substance that could transmit life. Hecatombs of men seem to have
been sacrificed to Anath when her image was reddened with "rouge
and henna" for the occasion. 4 "Violently she smites and gloats, Anat
cuts them down arid gazes; her liver exults in mirth ... for she
plunges her knees in the blood of the soldiers, her loins in the gore of
the warriors, till she has had her fill of slaughtering in the house, of
cleaving among the tables." 5 In similar rites in Egypt, priestesses hoisted
up their skirts while dismembering the bull god Apis so his spurting blood would bathe their loins and fertilize them. 6
Like the Mexican "Lady of the Serpent Skirt," who made new life
from Quetzalcoatl's genital blood, Anath hung the shorn penises of her victims on her goatskin apron, or aegis. 7 When the Goddess was
transplanted to Greece and permanently virginized as Athene, her aegis was transformed from the ceremonial apron of Libyan priestesses
into a breastplate. 8 Athene still wore "serpents" (phalli) on her aegis, along with the Gorgon head of her Destroyer aspect. Gorgon, "Grim One," was Athene's title as a Death-goddess.9 See Medusa; Metis; Neith.
Anath annually cast her death-curse, anathema, on the Canaanite god who became Lord of Death: Mot, the castrated "Sterility" aspect of the fertile Baal. Like Set in Egypt, Mot stood for the barren season
that slew its own fertile twin, the god Aleyin. In typical sacred-king style, Mot-Aleyin was the son of the Virgin Anath and also the bridegroom of his own mother. Like Jesus too, he was the Lamb of
God. He said, "I am Aleyin, son of Baal (the Lord). Make ready, then, the sacrifice. I am the lamb which is made ready with pure wheat to
be sacrificed in expiation." 10
After Aleyin's death, Anath resurrected him and sacrificed Mot in
turn. She told Mot that he was forsaken by his heavenly father El, the
same god who "forsook" Jesus on the cross. The words attributed to
30



Jesus, "My El, my El, why hast thou forsaken me? " (Mark 1 5:34), Anath
apparently were copied from the ancient liturgical formula, which became part of the Passover ritual at Jerusalem.
The sacred drama included a moment when Anath broke Mot's
reed scepter, to signify his castration again foreshadowing a detail of
the Christian Gospels. The breaking of the scepter meant severing the connection of the old, played-out king with the Earth-goddess after the harvest of his reign. Anath therefore slew him and used his body and blood to refresh the soil for the next year's crop. "She seizes Mot, the
son divine. With her sickle she cleaves him. With her flail she beats
him." His pieces were scattered on the fields, like pieces of the Savior Osiris in Egypt. 11
Naturally, the god-killing Anath was much diabolized in later
patriarchal legends. Abyssinian Christians called her Aynat, "the evil eye of the earth." They said she was an old witch destroyed by Jesus, who commanded that she must be burned and her ashes scattered on
the wind. 12 The hostility of Jesus probably stemmed from the missionaries' deliberate reversal of his former identification with the destroyed
god. In the Christian Gospels, Anath 's death curse Anathema Mara
natha (1 Corinthians 16:22) has been very loosely translated "the
Bridegroom cometh." It really meant the Bridegroom's imminent death; it was the solemn curse pronounced over any sacrificial
victim. 13 It carried the same double meaning as Latin sacer, meaning
both "holy" and "accursed" like all dying gods, who were formerly
anathemata, "offerings." H Every nation has examples of gods chosen for the sacred marriage, then accursed and killed. The Celtic Goddess's fatal words marked for death such heroes as Cu Chulainn and Diarmuid. The god called Lord of the Hunt became le Chasseur Maudit, "the Accursed Huntsman." The origin of accursed heroes in general might be found in ancient India, where Shiva the Condemned One was chosen by Sati
Kali for the sacred marriage with her virgin incarnation, followed by his
death and journey to the underworld. 15 As a personification of the
Primordial Abyss, the Goddess was sometimes called Kala-Nath, which might have been related to the name of Anath. 16
Anath's capacity to curse and kill made even the Heavenly Father
afraid of her. When El seemed reluctant to do her bidding, she
threatened to smash his head and cover his gray hair and beard with
gore. He hastily gave her everything she asked, saying, "Whoever hinders thee will be crushed." 17 It was a long step from this Middle
Eastern tale to the Greek concept of the dread Goddess as the
Heavenly Father's ever-dutiful daughter. See Anne, Saint.

Anathema
Androgyne
Anathema
Christian term for a person or thing officially cursed and excommuni
cated; from the biblical passage "If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha" (1 Corinthians 16:22).
Originally it was the curse pronounced by the Goddess, Marah or MariAnath, on her dying god; see Anath. In medieval Christian usage, to
be pronounced Anathema was to be cast out of the congregation with
bell, book, and candle, and irrevocably consigned to hell: a curious reminiscence of the accursed god's temporary descent into the under
world, in the ancient religion.
X
St. Andrew's Cross
Andrew, Saint
From Greek andros, "man" or "virility," a title of the solar god of
Patras, in Achaea, where the apostle Andrew was supposed to have been crucified after founding the Byzantine papacy. ' St. Andrew's legend was invented by Byzantine bishops to counter Rome's claim to
primacy through its own legend of St. Peter. Eastern patriarchs upheld their magisterium by calling Andrew the elder brother of Peter,
to enhance his authority, and declaring him the first apostle to discover the Messiah. 2
The story that Andrew was crucified on an X-shaped cross, the
so-called St. Andrew's Cross, was unknown until the Middle Ages.
Apparently it evolved from a popular symbol of the eastern patriarchs, a solar cross in an orb. 3 It was also the Cross of Wotan carried by
Norse invaders into Scotland, where it became the present Scottish
national symbol.
Patras, the site of Andrew's alleged martyrdom, was an old shrine
of the phallic-solar father-god variously called Pater, Petra, or Peter, whose name had the same basic meaning as Andrew. Political battles
between the factions of Andrew and Peter in the 4th century a.d.
stimulated canonical disguises for local genii loci in both Byzantium and
Rome, and these are still preserved in the calendar of saints.4

Androgyne
Many Indo-European religions tried to combine male and female in the Primal Androgyne, both sexes in one body, often with two heads
and four arms. The Brhadaranyaka Upanishad said the Primal Androgyne was "of the same size and kind as man and woman closely
embracing." 1 Some said the male and female elements lived together in
one skin, experiencing constant sexual bliss and spiritual
completeness.
32



Shiva and Shakti-Kali appeared as the androgyne Ardhanaris- Androgyne
vara, the right side male, the left side female. 2 Rudra, the older form of
Shiva, was known as "the Lord Who is Half Woman." 3 Brahma ^_^__^^__
and Vishnu also appeared as bisexual beings united with their Shaktis. Chinese Taoists held the mandala of Yang and Yin to represent the
androgyne.
Western myths also assigned androgyny to the elder gods or the
first human beings. The Orphic creation myth said the firstborn deity was a double-sexed Phanes or Eros, "Carnal Love," whose female half
was Psyche, the soul, Greek equivalent of Shakti. 4 Hermes owed his phenomenal wisdom to his former androgynous existence with Mother
Aphrodite, as double-sexed Hermaphroditus. 5 Often, the androgyne appeared in myth as male-female twins born
simultaneously, e.g. Isis-Osiris, Jana-Janus, Diana-Dianus, FaunaFaunus, Helen-Helenus, or Artemis-Apollo, the "moon and sun" united in their Mother's womb. Probably an androgynous image on
Apollo's altar at Delos gave rise to the story that he copulated with his sister Artemis on that altar. Several forms of the sun god were
represented as requiring close physical union with the moon goddess, as even Brahma was useless without his female counterpart Bhavani,
"Being." 6 Egypt's "supreme" sun god was often an androgyne; the sun
was his right eye, the moon his left. 7 The same androgynous being is
still worshipped in Dahomey as Nana-Buluku, Moon-Sun, who created the world and gave birth to the first pair of human beings. 8
Many myths model the first human beings on the androgyne. Persians said the first pair in the garden of Heden (Eden) lived
together in one body, until Ahura Mazda separated them. Jewish imitators of the Persians also said Adam and Eve were united in a
bisexual body. Some rabbinical sources said Eve was not "taken out
of" Adam; they were parted from one another by a jealous God who
resented their sexual bliss, which was too Godlike for human beings,
and should be reserved for deities. Casting man out of the "garden"
meant detaching him from the female body, often symbolized by the Hebrew pardes, "garden." 9 This was another way of saying the original sin that angered God was not disobedience but sex. 10
Greek myths of the Golden Age told the same tale of a jealous God: Zeus, who punished humanity's friend Prometheus with eternal torture because he tricked the Heavenly Father for human
ity's advantage (see Sacrifice). The people of the Golden Age had been created androgynous by Prometheus, who made their bodies of clay,
and Athene, who gave them life. Father Zeus took out his anger on them by tearing them apart. A piece of clay was torn out of the
female part and stuck to the male part. That is why women have an orifice that bleeds, and men have a loose dangling appendage that seems not to belong to them but always craves to return to the female
body it came from.
33



Androgyne
Naassenes, or Naassians; from Hebrew nahash, "ser
pent." Jewish or Christian Gnostic sects of the early Christian
era, who worshipped the serpent god Ophis (Hermes) as a form of the Savior.
Mysteries General term for religious rites of the "secret initiation" type, which included early
Christianity.
Cruel Zeus permitted human beings to return the male appendage to its female home sometimes, to sense for a brief moment the bliss of
their former bisexual existence. Some Gnostic mystery cults of the first
centuries a.d. taught Tantric techniques to prolong the moment of
bliss, which angered most forms of the Heavenly Father including the Christian one, whose bishops denounced this training as schooling
in wickedness. 11 Church fathers especially deplored making or remaking the Beast with Two Backs, another term for the Primal
Androgyne. Though orthodox Christianity renounced both sexuality and androgyny in religious images, Gnostic Christians used them. As Kali was the female half of Shiva, so the Gnostic Great Mother Sophia was
the female half of Christ. This was revealed "in a great light": the
Savior was shown as an androgyne coupled with "Sophia, Mother of
All." 12
Gnostic Christians said those who received the true revelation of
the Father-Mother spirit were the only ones prepared for the secret
sacrament called apolytrosis, "release," a concept identical with Tantric
moksha or "liberation." n Obviously influenced by Tantrism or its
prototype, western Gnostics had made a direct translation of the Hindu
Yab-Yum, "Father-Mother," the sexual union of a sage and his Shakti at the crucial moment of death. 14 Sexual sacraments were in
effect practicing for that moment, when the enlightened one would be restored to the condition of primordial bliss as an androgynous
creature.
The Naassenes said no enlightenment was possible without the
Father-Mother spirit, an androgyne sometimes called Heavenly
Horn of the Moon. 15 In the 5th century a.d., Orphic initiations sought to awaken a female spirit within man, to render him sensitive to the
message of the Mysteries. After meeting the deities in a death-and
rebirth experience, he carried a bowl, emblem of the womb, and
touched his belly like a gravid woman, signifying "a spiritual experience uniting the opposed ways of knowledge of the male and female, and fused with this idea is that of a new life conceived within." 16
Such Gnostic subtleties were disliked by the orthodox, who viewed
all mergings of the sexes as unequivocally sinful. After Gnostic sects
were crushed, the androgyne was consigned to hell and gave birth to
many curious devils with both male and female attributes. A 1 6th
century book showed Satan himself seated on a throne, wearing a papal
tiara, with bird feet, a female face in his genital area, and pendulous
female breasts. 17 The Devil of the Tarot pack was usually androgynous,
as were many of the devils represented in cathedral carvings.

Andromeda Andromeda
"Ruler of Men," Greek title of the Philistine sea-queen won in Ange,s
marriage by Perseus, who supposedly saved her from the sea-serpent ^m^bm^m^
Yamm. Perseus seems to have been a Greek name for Baal in this
myth, for Baal annually fought Yamm for the love of Mother Astarte,
the Philistines' Goddess, locally named Atargatis. Baal replaced Yamm, then was himself replaced when the queen tired of him and he
became Yamm in his turn. Andromeda on her rock, in the classic
myth, was transformed from a critical observer of the combat into a victim.
That Perseus played the role of sacred king in the original myth
is shown by his apotheosis and rising to dwell in the stars. So also
Heracles was raised to the stars after performing the same feat
slaying the great sea serpent in order to mate with Hesione, "Queen of
Asia," probably just another name for Andromeda-Atargatis. 1
1. Graves, CM. 1,224.
Androphonos
"Man-slayer," title of the Goddess Aphrodite as a Destroyer or death-goddess. She was also the Black One, the Goddess of the Tombs, and the Queen Bee who killed her lovers as drone bees are killed, by
castration and evisceration. She had "many titles which seem inconsist
ent with her beauty and complaisance." ' That was because classic
mythographers sought to make her a love goddess only, ignoring her
earlier character as the creating-and-destroying Triple Goddess (see
Trinity).
1. Graves, CM. 1,71-72.
Angels
The earliest angels were heavenly nymphs, like Hindu apsaras, who dispensed sensual bliss to the blessed ones. Vikings called them
Valkyries. Greeks called them Horae. Persians called them Houris, or
Peris (fairies). A guardian angel was a personal Shakti who watched over a man and took him into her ecstatic embrace at the moment
of death. N
Hindu angels were created primarily for lovemaking. They had no
menstruation, pregnancy, birth, or nursing, though they were mothers. Each child appeared miraculously on its mother's knee at the age of
five years. Apsaras could copulate endlessly with gods without any emission of fluids or loss of energy. Such a being was "the perfect
dispenser of sensual delight and amorous bliss on a divine scale." 1
Like the queen of the Holy Grail palace in bardic romance, the angel
was a "Dispenser of Joy." (See Grail, Holy.)
35



Angerona
Magic Papyri Collections of
exorcisms, invocations, charms, and spells widely circulated during the early Christian era, used as bases for
later grimoires and Hermetic texts.
There were earthy angels too, the dakinis, "Skywalkers." Tantric writings said they lived in the Palace of Lotus Light. They were
sometimes called prostitutes' daughters, or yoginis, i.e., yoga
priestesses. 2 Although such angels seemed to be every man's wish fulfillment,
patriarchal religions denied the sexuality of angels. Moslems rejected the Houris (heavenly "whores"), and insisted the angels are without
carnal desires. 3 Yet this contradicted the teaching of the Koran, that
after death every hero would receive beautiful girls as heavenly
companions.4 European Christianity consigned the formerly divine Horae to
Fairyland, the earthly paradise distinguished from the celestial one. The place was called locus voluptatis terrestis, the Terrestrial Place of
Pleasure, or pratum felicitatus, the Paradise of Joy. 5 Angels were often confused with seraphs and cherubs. The former
were six-winged fiery flying serpents, the lightning-spirits of Chaldean myth. The latter were Semitic kerubh, from Sheban mu-karrib,
"priests of the moon"; sometimes they could take the form of birds.
Angels accompanying the Hindu Great Goddess were able to fly on the
wings of garuda birds.6 Biblical angels were "sons of God" who came to earth to beget
children on mortal women (Genesis 6:4). Later these were called
demons, or incubi, or "fallen" angels. The Book of Enoch blamed
women for the angels' fall. Women had "led astray the angels of heaven." 7 In the Magic Papryi, the words angel, spirit, god, and demon were interchangeable. 8 When St. Paul said women's heads must be covered in church "because of the angels" (1 Corinthians 1 1:10), he
meant the daemones (demons) supposed to be attracted to women's
hair. The Greeks thought each person had an individual guardian angel or daemon which could appear in animal form, and under Christian
ity evolved into the "familiar spirit." There were no really well-defined
distinctions between angels, demons, familiars, fairies, elves, saints,
genii, ancestral ghosts, or pagan gods.9 Among supernatural beings one
might always find many hazy areas of overlapping identities, even "good" or "evil" qualities being blurred. A Gallup poll showed in 1978 that over half of all Americans still
believe in angels. 10

Angerona
Silent Goddess of Rome, shown holding a finger to her sealed
mouth. Some said Angerona represented the secret name of Rome,
which it was illegal to pronounce. 1 In all probability she was a pre
36



Roman title of the same primal Creatress whom Gnostics called Sige,
"Silence," personifying the lightless and soundless womb that gave birth to the first deities. Gnostics said Silence was the mother of the Great Goddess herself.

Angurboda Ankamma
Angurboda
Eddaic "Hag of the Iron Wood," mother of Hel and of the Moon
dogs who bore away the dead. Danaans, or Danes, knew her as Anu,
Yngona, Nanna, or "Anna of the Angles." She was a "hag" in the ancient sense of "Holy One"; the Death-goddess. 1 See Dog.
1. Graves, W.G, 409.
Anima
Female soul, from the roots an, "heavenly," and ma, "mother," recalling a time when all souls were supposed to emanate from the
Heavenly Mother. 1 In the 16th century a.d. Guillaume Postel said every soul had male and female halves, the animus and anima. The male half had been redeemed by Christ, but the female half was still unredeemed and awaited a female savior. 2 This was a new development
of the old Christian view that only males had any souls at all. The
third canon of the Council of Nantes in 660 a.d. had decided that all
women are "soulless brutes." 5
Alchemists applied the word anima to all "spirits" considered
female: Anima Mercury, Anima Mundi, etc. The Spirit of the World was connected with the elements of earth and water, like Eleusinian
Demeter, "Mistress of Earth and Sea." One reason alchemists were
suspected of heresy was their notion that the World-Soul was a female anima.
Carl Jung revived the terms animus and anima to describe reason
ing and intuitive parts of the mind (i.e., left and right hemispheres). Every person's anima is "often symbolically connected with both earth
and water. She is pictured as timeless and profoundly wise. . . . Each
man's first and formative experience of the anima is with his mother.
Her true function in the mind, according to Jung, is creativity." 4

Guillaume Postel
(1510-1581) French scholar, teacher, and mystic, friend of
Ignatius Loyola, accepted into the Jesuit order but later
expelled for "wrong"
ideas. He was
imprisoned in Rome by the Inquisition, until a popular uprising opened the prisons and offered him a lucky
escape.
Ankamma
Emanation of Kali the Destroyer as the spirit of cholera. She had
many such emanations, each one specializing in a certain disease capable of causing death. See Kali Ma.

Ankh Ankh
Anne, Saint Egyptian "Cross of Life" representing union of male and female
^^^^m sexual symbols: a female oval surmounting a male cross. Its other name
was Key of the Nile, because the sacred marriage between God and Goddess was supposed to take place at the source of the Nile each year
before the flood. The Christian version of the Cross of Life, which
didn't appear in Christian art until after the 5th century a.d., sig
nificantly lacked the feminine oval and kept only the masculine part
of the figure.
1
The ankh seems to have evolved from an ancient symbol of the
Goddess in Libya and Phoenicia: a narrow triangle surmounted by
a crossbar and a round or oval head. 2
t
Egyptians regarded the ankh as a universal life-charm. "The life of
every being, divine or human, depended on his or her possession of it. From first to last the gods are seen carrying it in their right hands, and
they gave life to their kings and servants presenting it to them." 3
Early Christians also used the ankh occasionally as an emblem of
immortality, calling it an ansated cross. They knew the Egyptians had Ankh a certain letter-hieroglyph that "stood for the life to come; and this letter
had the form of a cross." 4 In hieroglyphics the ankh stood simply for
the word "life." 5

Anna-Nin
Sumerian prototype of the many forms of the Great Goddess named Anna, Ana, or Hannah throughout the Middle East and Mediteranean lands. The name meant Lady of Heaven. See Anne, Saint.
Annapurna
Himalayan mountain called Great Breast Full of Nourishment; a manifestation of the Great Goddess as the home and support of the
gods.
Anne, Saint
Mythical mother of the virgin Mary, from the Middle-Eastern Goddess Anna, or Hannah, or Di-Ana, mother of Mari. From Sumeria to pre-Roman Latium she was known as Anna, the GrandmotherGoddess; Anatha in Syria, Anat in Canaan, Ana or Anah in several Old Testament transformations. Long before the Bible was written, the Goddess Anna was already known as the Grandmother of God. Hence,
38



the choice of her name for the mother of God's Mother is hardly Anne, Saint
surprising.
1
Syriac versions of the Book of James said God's Grandmother was ^^^^^^^^
not Anna but Dinah, actually the same name, a Semitic Di-Ana or "Goddess Ana." Dinah was the ancestress of Dinaite tribes who settled
in Sumeria (Ezra 4:9). As Anatha, she was the consort of Yahweh at Elephantine. 2 As Anna Perenna she was Grandmother Time to the Romans, mother of the Aeons. As Ana or Anu she ruled Celtic
tribes. As Nanna, she was an incarnation of Freya in the mother-bride of
Balder. In Phrygia too, she was Nana, mother of the Savior. She was
really as old as the oldest civilization. A Sumerian prayer declared:
"Hear O ye regions, the praise of Queen Nana; magnify the Creatress, exalt the dignified, exalt the Glorious One, draw nigh unto
the Mighty Lady." 3 Romans worshipped the Goddess as Anna Perenna, "Eternal Anna," mother of the Aeons. She stood at the change of years, a twoheaded Goddess of Time with two faces named Prorsa and Postverta,
looking forward and backward from her heavenly gate among the
stars, where one celestial cycle merged into the next. So she stood for
both Alpha and Omega, beginning and end. Under the name of Carmenta she invented all the letters in between. 4 She was also Jana, or
Juno, mother of the January New Year. Classical myths masculin
ized her as the two-faced Janus, god of gateways. Christians may have
confused icons labeled IANA with the mother of the Virgin; for Jana
Juno was the virgin mother of the savior-god Mars.
Ovid said Anna was the same as the Moon-goddess Minerva.
Sappho named her "the Queen." 5 To the Celts, she was the same as
their Ana, first of the female trinity of the Morrigan, associated with the
Cauldron of Regeneration. Her moon-temple used to stand at Cnoc
Aine in Limerick, now a shrine of "St. Anne." 6 To Irish pagans, Ana
meant "mother." It also came to mean wealth, plenty, treasure.7
As Grandmother-goddess, Ana could be a destroying Crone. Some myths called her Morg-ana, "Invincible Queen Death." Medi
eval Christians called her Anna of the Angles, or Black Annis, or
Angurboda, the Hag of the Iron Wood, mother of Hel. 8 The magic
pentacle was the sign of Morg-ana.9 A similar five-pointed star stood for the underworld in Egyptian hieroglyphics. 10 This same star was the
official sigil of St. Anne. 11
In her Christianized form, Anne had three husbands, gave birth to many saints, and became the patron of midwives and miners. Neu
mann says, "All this bears witness to her original fertility aspect as Earth
Mother." n
St. Anne was of crucial importance in the dogma of the virgin Mary's immaculate conception, adopted as an article of faith in 1854, after seven centuries of controversy. 13 In the official Catholic view, original sin was transmitted by sexual acts. Therefore, so Mary
39



Antic Hey
Antichrist
Johannes Trithemius
15th-century German scholar, Abbot of Sponheim
could be born without taint of original sin, St. Anne herself had to be in
nocent of sexuality. Accordingly, Johannes Trithemius proclaimed that Anne "was chosen by God for her appointed services before the
foundation of the world. She conceived 'without the action of man,'
and was as pure as her daughter." H At first the church accepted this doctrine, because it seemed to
solve the problem of Mary's sinlessness. Later it was rejected. Two
virgin births made one too many. In the end, St. Anne was said to have conceived Mary in the normal way but the child was freed in the
womb of original sin. Though these intimate matters are supposed to be
known in minute detail, churchmen incongruously admit that "nothing whatever is known about the parents of the Virgin Mary." 15

Antic Hey
Dance step of the medieval Carnival King: antico from Latin
antiquus, "ancient, venerable." Carnival "antics" were connected with
the Old Religions, whose sacred processions were often accompanied
by clowns deliberately making obscene gestures and jokes to heighten
the spirit of revelry.
1 The "hey" was, and is, a figure-eight pattern paced on the ground, the sign meaning "infinity" in Hindu-Arabic numeral systems and in their descendant, modern mathematics.
Choruses of old folk songs call for the hey, in nonsense phrases like
"Hey, nonny nonny," or "Hey, deny down." Thus the antic hey was really a pagan liturgy in song or dance or both, performed at secularized versions of the ancient rites.
1. Funk, p. 54.
Antichrist
Virgin-born son of the devil, supposed to appear during the world's Last Days. Christianity never escaped the patterns of dualism, whereby each god had to have an equal and opposite anti-god. Antichrist was
the Christian equivalent of Chaldean Aciel, lord of the nether world,
counterbalancing the solar god of the heavens. The coming of Antichrist has been announced and re-announced
throughout the entire Christian era, especially in times of political
and social stress. His title has been laid on Nero, Attila, Genghis Khan,
Merlin, Frederick II, and many others including several popes. More recently, Napoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm, and Hitler were all nominated for
the position. See Doomsday.

Antinomianism
General term for Christian sects that followed the original doctrine of
apotheosis, believing they could become "one with Christ." Like their
pagan contemporaries, many early Christians thought the only route
to immortality was deification, and the object of their Mysteries was to
learn how to be deified. The distinction between men and gods was
that men died and gods didn't. Thus, one's immortality depended on becoming a god, often by sacramental procedures such as eating a god's flesh and blood (see Cannibalism). Clement of Alexandria said: "That man with whom the Logos
dwells ... is made like God and is beautiful [T]hat man becomes
God, for God so wills it [T]he Logos of God became man that from man you might learn how man may become God. . . . [T]he true Christian Gnostic has already become God." l
This doctrine of deification was soundly based on pagan prece
dent. Worshippers of Hermes the Logos believed that "This is the
good end for those who have attained knowledge, namely, Deification." They said to Hermes, "Thou art I, and I am thou; thy name is mine,
for I am thy image (eidolon)." Mithraists used the same formula, "I am thou and thou art I," which the Gospels put in the mouth of Jesus,
"Abide in me, and I in you" (John 1 5:4). Seneca said, "A holy spirit dwells within us." Epictetus wrote: "You are bearing a God with
you. ... It is within yourself that you carry him." Cicero said initiation
into the Mysteries taught a man he could be God, "inferior in no
whit to the celestials." 2
The theological pitfall in the concept of salvation through apotheosis was that identification of self and god led to what Tantric sages
called Svecchacara, "Do As You Will." In effect, the perfected sage could do nothing evil because he was God, and God was incapable of sinning. 3 Therefore he was above all man-made laws, and could do
as he pleased. Greek democracy was based on a related idea that through
enlightenment and reason each citizen would become capable of selfgovernment and would make no moral errors. This did not apply to slaves, women, or those who owned no property; such were not classed as citizens. Mature male landowners however could become
idiotae, "self-gods." 4 Thus the word "idiot" began in Greek with the sense of "one who will not be governed," that is, one who believed the
divine will dwelt in himself. Numerous medieval Christian sects took the Antinomian route to
salvation, believing that, like eastern sages, they could become one
with the divine. These mystics "in their identification with God sup
posed that upon their conscious union with Him they were exempt from the rules governing ordinary men." Leaders like Amalric of Bena,
Johann Hartmann, sects like the Alumbrados, Illuminates, Adamites,
and others taught that when their flesh was occupied by the holy spirit

Anubis they could commit no sins of the flesh. For them, sexual promiscuity
was only a natural "embracing of God." 5 ^^^^^^^^^^^ Brothers and Sisters of the Free Spirit undertook to demonstrate
the redemptive virtues of sexuality, nakedness, and scorn of the
conventions. The more openly they displayed their hippie-like behaviors, the more closely they approached the divine essence. Frazer remarked, "Their progress toward this mystic communion was acceler
ated by the Inquisition, and they expired in the flames, not merely with unclouded serenity, but with the most triumphant feelings of
cheerfulness and joy." 6 They had their own martyr, a literary sister who wrote the gospel of their sect, The Mirror ofFree Souls. She and her book both were excommunicated and burned in 1 3 10 a.d. 7 Antinomian ideas were often defined as heresy, as in the case of
Simon Morin, who seems to have had fairly standard delusions of
grandeur. He said he was the incarnate second coming of Christ, and
was incapable of committing a sin; anything he did must be worshipped. The church disagreed, and burned him as a witch. 8
The usual Antinomian excuses for sexual self-expression infiltrated a group of nuns in the Dominican convent of St. Catherine de Prato.
Early in the 19th century, a text of the official inquiry into this case was
published in Brussels, then "withdrawn at the insistence of the Papal Court. The second edition is . . . much expurgated." One of the nuns
expounded on her Antinomian teachings: "It is sufficient to elevate
the spirit to God and then no action, whatever it be, is sinful. . . . Love of God and one's neighbor is the whole of the commandments. Man who unites with God by means of woman satisfies both command
ments. So also does he who, lifting his spirit to God, has enjoyment with a person of the same sex or alone. ... In doing that which we
erroneously call impure is real purity ordained by God, without which man cannot arrive at a knowledge of Him." 9
Such ideas were typically Oriental, as opposed to the Christian idea
of entering into a relationship with a God who was an external
"other." Though the Gospels said "the kingdom of God is within you"
(Luke 17:21), orthodox Christianity treated this as a heretical idea. 10

Anubis
Jackal-headed Egyptian god of the underworld and of mummifica
tion; judge of the dead; Egypt's primary psychopomp, like Hermes in Greece. Mated to Nephthys, the underground aspect of Isis, Anubis was sometimes known as the Great Dog. He was considered essential to
the worship of Isis and Osiris. Plutarch said he had "a power among
42



the Egyptians much like that of Hecate among the Greeks, he being terrestrial as well as Olympic Those that worship the dog, have a certain secret meaning that must not be revealed. In the more remote and ancient times the dog had the highest honor paid to him in
Egypt." Anubis may have been originally a canine incarnation of Shiva, whose name also meant a jackal. 2

Apep
var. Anukis
Anuket
"The Clasper," an Egyptian Goddess personifying the yonic source of the Nile flood. Her symbol was the cowrie, always emblematic of
female genitals. Her union with the ithyphallic god was supposed to bring life-giving Nile waters to the land. She "clasped" a number of
gods, including in the 5 th century b.c. the Hebrew Jehovah. 1
Like Kali Ma in India, Anuket had four arms, representing union
between male and female principles. The general pattern for such deities was that two arms held symbols of the male elements, and two held symbols of the female elements. Yet she was known as "The
One." She was "self-begotten and self-produced, and whilst yet a virgin gave birth to the sun god." 2
At the Festival of the Inundation, Egyptians sang to her: "Thou
art the bringer of food, thou art the mighty one of meat and drink,
thou art the creator of all good things. Thou fillest the storehouses; thou
heapest high with corn the granaries, and thou hast care for the poor
and needy." 3 1. Graves, W.G., 405; Lamusse, 37. 2. Budge, D.N., 159. 3. Budge, D.N., 106.
Festival of the Inundation Annual celebration of the coming of the Nile
flood, which brought the water and fresh silt
necessary to the fertility of the entire Nile valley, where rain was almost unknown.
Apep
Egyptian and Greek names of the Great Serpent of the underworld, who threatened to swallow the sun god every night as he passed through
the realm of darkness, returning from west to east. (See Serpent.) Ra's priesthood evidently decided at one point that Ra faced danger in
the underworld, so the faithful would be encouraged to help the sun
return with their nightly prayers. However, the Serpent was a common personification of the Egyptian underworld or Tuat itself. The realm
of darkness with its various "chambers" was the interior of the serpent's
body, through which the sun god must pass, as he was always swallowed at each sunset. 1
In medieval alchemy the "Apophis-snake" was confused with the Hermetic Ouroboros, a hidden world spirit in the form of a serpent,
who might reveal the secret of the Philosopher's Stone.

Apex Aphrodite
Celtiberian Dating
from the occupation of the Iberian peninsula
by Celtic tribes,
especially the loosely-knit empire
known as Brigantia, ruled by the Goddess
Brigit.
Apex
Pointed conical cap worn by the Roman high priest, Flamen Dialis. When outdoors, he must always have the apex on his head. 1 It was a
phallic symbol representing his continual union with the Queen of Heaven. It has been shown that "In the symbolism of dreams and of
myths the hat is usually the phallus." 2 The Flamen's wife, the Flaminica, represented the Goddess. She
was the more important dignitary of the two. If his marriage was
terminated by her death, the Flamen immediately lost his sacred office
and reverted to a private citizen. Such customs show that the powers
of priests "in Rome as elsewhere, derived in the first instance from an
older priesthood of magical women." 3 The same conical cap belonged to the Lord of the Underworld in
Celtiberian pagan imagery. He was Helman: a man belonging to the Goddess Hel. 4 Sometimes he was said to be the god Frey, consort of
Hel's heavenly or lunar aspect, Freya. 5 The same conical cap evolved into the traditional headdress of sor
cerers and witches; the Fool's Cap (or Dunce Cap) worn by the
Carnival King; the bishop's miter; the pope's tiara; and before them all, the conical crown of Egyptian pharaohs, emblem of the king's union
with the Sky-goddess. To the present day, the conical witch-hat is worn
by Tantric priests and sorcerers in Tibet. 6

Aphrodite
Often dismissed as a "Greek goddess of love," Aphrodite was really
much more than that. Like Kali, she was a Virgin-Mother-Crone
trinity. She was once indistinguishable from the Fates (Moirai); her old name was Moira, and she was said to be older than Time. She gov
erned the world by ius naturale, the natural law of the maternal clan. 1 She was not only Greek. She was the Dea Syria, also known as
Asherah or Astarte, Goddess of the oldest continuously-occupied temple in the world. 2 She was the ancestral mother of the Romans, for
she gave birth to their founding father, Aeneas. 3 Under the name of
Venus, she was the mother of the Venetii, whose capital city became
Venice, called "Queen of the Sea" after the Goddess herself.
One of Aphrodite's major centers of worship was the city of Paphos on Cyprus, the island named for its copper mines. Thus, she was called "the Cyprian" or "the Paphian," and her sacred metal was
copper. She was also called Mari, the Sea. Egyptians referred to her
island as Ay-Mari.4
During the Christian era, Aphrodite's temple on Cyprus was converted into a sanctuary of the virgin Mary, another name of the
same Goddess, but in this sanctuary the virgin Mary is hailed to this day
as Panaghia Aphroditessa, "All-holy Aphrodite." 5
44



Continued worship of the goddess on Cyprus probably contributed Apis to the Christian belief that the whole population of Cyprus descend
ed from demons.6 In reality, Cyprian Aphrodite was like all other ^^^^^^^^
manifestations of the Great Goddess: ruling birth, life, love, death
time, and fate, reconciling man to all of them through sensual and
sexual mysticism. The Cyprian sage Zenon taught Aphrodite's philosophy: "mankind and the universe were bound together in the system of fate Diogenes Laertios tells us that Zenon was the first to define the end of human existence as 'life in accordance with nature.' " 7
Aphrodite had almost as many "emanations" as Thousand-Named Kali. She was not only Mari and Moira and Marina and Pelagia and
Stella Maris, all titles related to her control of the sea; she was also
Ilithyia, Goddess of childbirth; Hymen, Goddess of marriage; Venus,
Goddess of sexuality and the hunt; Urania, Queen of Heaven; Androphonos, the Destroyer of Men; and many others. She was often identified with Isis. Anchises, her lover who begot Aeneas and then was castrated, had a name meaning "he who mates with Isis." 8 Under
several of her names, Aphrodite mated with Semitic gods. Her cult
occupied the main temple in Jerusalem after 70 a.d. In the 4th century it was said that Constantine's mother found the true cross of
Christ buried in Aphrodite's Jerusalem temple. (See Cross.) One of Aphrodite's greatest shrines in Asia Minor was the city of
Aphrodisias, once dedicated to Ishtar. Up to the 12th century a.d.,
when the city was taken by Seljuk Turks, the Goddess was worshipped there as the patron of arts and letters, crafts, and culture.9 Recent
excavations have uncovered exquisite artifacts and statuary, bespeaking
a cultivated and sophisticated lifestyle under the Goddess's rule. 10
The calendar still keeps the name of Aphrodite on the month
dedicated to her, April (Aphrilis). The ancient Kalendar of Romulus said this was the month of Venus. 11

Apis
Egyptian lunar bull god annually sacrificed at Memphis. Later he was
combined with Osiris to produce the syncretic god of the Ptolemies,
Osorapis, or Sarapis. Apis was begotten in bull form when moonbeams fell on a cow in heat. He was identified by special markings,
notably symbols of the Goddess: a triangle on his forehead, a flying vulture on his side, a crescent moon on his flank. After death each Apis bull was elaborately embalmed and buried in the vast underground
bull-tombs. 1 In mummy form, like all Egyptian gods, he became "an
Osiris."

Apollo Apollo
Greek sun god who took over the powers of his twin sister Artemis,
^^^^^^^^^^^ the Moon. Originally, he was her child, as the sun was born of the Moon-goddess in Egypt and elsewhere. He was also her totemic
beast in several forms: a wolf (Apollo Lycaeus), a mouse (Apollo
Smintheus), or a golden-maned lion (Apollo Chrysocomes). The fully anthropomorphized Apollo laid claim to the Goddess's
powers of prophecy, poetry, music, magic, and healing. His priesthood adopted the Muses, the Graces, even the Great Serpent who gave oracles from the earth-womb, Apollo Python, known as Sol Niger
(Black Sun) during his nightly sojourn in the underworld. Egyptians called him Apep or Apophis, the serpent of darkness. In the Bible he
is Apollyon, "Spirit of the Pit" (Revelation 9:1 1).
Apollo's serpent-form inspired the Pythoness, priestess of the Delphic oracle, Greece's foremost temple of prophecy. This temple belonged to the Goddess in the beginning; delphi means womb. Even Apollo's priests admitted that she had owned the oracle in her
trinitarian guise as mother of earth, heaven, and the abyss: the first of all
deities to prophesy, the Earth-mother; and Themis, mother of the sea
and of all Themistes, "oracles"; and the Moon-goddess, Artemis, under the name of Phoebe another title stolen by Apollo, who became known as Phoebus. 1
Apollonian priests naturally directed their energies toward conquest of the oracles. "The reason why a deity associated with political
conquest and order should take possession of oracular shrines is obvious;
oracles were the chief means of controlling public opinion and public action, and to control the oracles was as necessary to a political god as it
is to later politicians to control the press or education." 2
Laurel became Apollo's sacred plant because it was the plant of
inspired poetic frenzy, which is why Britain's national poet is still
called Laureate, the laurel-crowned one. The Delphic Pythoness chewed leaves of cherry laurel to induce her poetic-prophetic trances.
Cherry laurel contains traces of cyanide, enough to cause delirium,
foaming at the mouth, and other symptoms of divine possession. Apollo's priests used the oracles to create new patriarchal laws, overturning the laws of the matriarchate. Apollo's most notable
judicial act was to absolve Orestes from the crime of killing his mother.
Apollo said it was no crime, because a mother is not a real parent;
only a father truly gives life to a child, the same "Apollonian" opinion later adopted by Christian theologians. 3 Yet this patriarchal opinion was negated by Apollo's own surname of Letoides, "son of Leto."4 He carried the name of his mother only, after the custom of the matri
archal Lycians who recognized strictly matrilineal ancestry, and in
whose country Apollo's cult first evolved.
In his earliest manifestations, Apollo was subordinate to the God
dess as her dog-faced or wolf-faced door-guardian: a "Spirit of the Pit" like Apollyon, another name for Anubis or Cerberus. Four Hittite
46



altars found in Anatolia were dedicated to a god named Apulunas,
Guardian of Gates, forerunner of Apollo Lycaeus or "Wolfish Apol
lo." 5 Once he walked at the Goddess's heel, like Anubis; but this
was suppressed and forgotten.
To some early Christians, Apollo became a junior God. He was even said to have fathered on mortal virgins several pagan sages
respected by the church, such as Plato.6 Healing miracles were widely
attributed to Apollo. 7 Christians sought his intervention in certain illnesses. It was claimed that if a naked virgin touched the afflicted part,
saying, "Apollo denieth that the heat of the plague can increase
where a naked virgin quencheth it," the patient would get well. 8
Under his title of Benedictus, "Good-speaker," Apollo was even canonized, and became St. Benedict.9

Apostles
Apostles
Describing the religious customs of the Aztecs, Father Acosta unwit
tingly gave one of the real purposes of Jesus's twelve companions:
They took a captive . . . and afore they did sacrifice him unto their idols, they gave him the name of the idol, saying that he did represent the same idol. . . . When he went through the streets, the people came forth
to worship him, and every one brought him an alms, with children and
sick folks, that he might cure them, and bless them, suffering him to do all
things at his pleasure, only he was accompanied with ten or twelve men lest he should fly. . . . The feast being come, and he grown fat, they killed him, opened him, and ate him, making a solemn sacrifice ofhim. '
This devoured Savior, closely watched by his ten or twelve
guards, embodied the god Quetzalcoatl, who was born of a virgin, slain in atonement for a primal sin, and whose Second Coming was
confidently expected. 2 He was often represented as a trinity signified by three crosses, a large one between the smaller ones. 5 Father Acosta
naively said, "It is strange that the devil after his manner hath brought a
Trinity into idolatry." 4 His church found it all too familiar, and long
kept his book as one of its secrets.
The Gospels contain hints that Jesus was as reluctant as the
Quetzalcoatl-victim. Once he ran away from his "apostles" and fled alone into the mountains, fearing men would "come and take him by
force, to make him a king" (John 6:1 5). That is, he didn't want the
fatal honor of being a sacred king of the Jews, the doomed Bridegroom
of Zion. The apostles caught up with him in Capernaum, and his subsequent speeches indicate resignation to his fate. He said he was the bread of God, come down from heaven to give
life to the world: "The bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will
give for the life of the world Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh

Apotheosis my blood, hath eternal life" (John 6:50, 54). On the eve of the
Apple sacrifice he prayed despairingly, "O my Father, if it be possible, let ^^^^^^^^^^^ this cup pass from me; nevertheless . . . thy will be done" (Matthew
26:39, 42). At least the Gospel narrator claims Jesus said this.
Naturally, any sacred king's guards would become popularizers of his cult, "dining out" on the divine sayings and actions for years.
However, the Gospels were not written by the apostles whose names
they bear. They were forgeries, compiled long after Jesus's time, some as late as the middle of the 2nd century. 5 Even this is scholarly
guesswork, since no authentic manuscript can be dated before the 4th
century. 6 Canonization of the apostles used an ancient Buddhist symbol, the
ushnisha or "flame of invisible light" appearing on top of their heads.
To Buddhists, this flame streaming from the "lotus center" of the skull
meant super-intelligence. It appeared over the heads of bodhisattvas. 7
The same phenomenon appeared over the heads of the apostles (Acts 2:4). The rest of their stories were as mythical as those of the
bodhisattvas. Guignebert says "not one of them is true. . . . [Tjhere exists no information really worthy of credence about the life and
work of the immediate Apostles of Jesus." 8

Apotheosis
"God-making," the ritual of raising a slain sacrificial savior to heaven,
to become a constellation among the stars or a part of his heavenly
father. It became a custom to apotheosize Roman emperors while they were still living. Most other ancient kings were also gods on earth.
Their surrogates, the "sacred kings" who died in their place, were
promised immediate godhood after death.
Apotheosis was similarly promised Christian martyrs who perished in the belief that they would be wholly assimilated to Christ and would sit "on the right hand of God" like him. The church's ritual of
canonization was a direct copy of pagan ceremonies of apotheosis.
The Roman emperors' souls winging to heaven as eagles contributed the idea of releasing white doves at the climax of the church's
canonization ceremony. 1 See Drama.
l.Gaster,769.
Apple
Eve's fruit of knowledge used to be the Goddess's sacred heart of
immortality, all over the Indo-European culture complex. The Goddess's many western paradises grew the apples of eternal life. The
48



Celts called the western paradise Avalon, "Apple-land," a country ruled Apple
by Morgan, the queen of the dead. Irish kings received the Goddess's
magic apples of immortality and went away to live with her under the ^^^^^_^_^^
sunset. King Arthur was taken to Avalon by the Triple Goddess in
person, as three fairy queens.
Scandinavians thought apples essential to resurrection, and placed
vessels of them in graves. 1 The Norse Goddess Idun kept the magic
apple-land in the west, where the gods received the fruit that kept them
deathless. 2 Apples carried souls from one body to the next. Sigurd's
or Siegfried's great-grandmother conceived by eating an apple. 3 The
Yule pig was roasted with an apple in its mouth, to serve as a heart in
the next life (see Boar).
Greeks said Mother Hera kept the magic apple garden in the west, where the Tree of Life was guarded by her sacred serpent. Graves
points out that the whole story of Eve, Adam, and the serpent in the
tree was deliberately misinterpreted from icons showing the Great Goddess offering life to her worshipper, in the form of an apple, with
the tree and its serpent in the background. Similarly, Hellenes misinterpreted icons of the hero-victim receiving an apple from the
Triple Goddess, before his journey to paradise, as the Judgment of Paris: a picture of a young man receiving the apple from three
Goddesses, not vice versa. 4
Romans gave the apple-mother the name of Pomona, which was
probably inherited from the Etruscans. She symbolized all fruition. A
Roman banquet always progressed ab ovo usque mala, from eggs to apples beginning with the symbol of creation and ending with the symbol of completion. It was recorded that King Herod finished every meal in the Roman style, with an apple. 5 One reason for the extreme reverence paid to this fruit is revealed
by cutting it transversely, as the gypsies and witches did. Hidden in
the apple's core was the magic pentacle, or sign of Kore (Core). Just as Kore the Virgin was hidden in the heart of Mother Earth (Demeter)
and represented the World Soul, so her pentacle was hidden in the
apple. The five-pointed star in a circle was the Egyptian hieroglyph for the underworld womb, where resurrection was brought about by the
mother-heart of "transformations."6 In Christian iconography also, this
apple-sign represented the Virgin concealed within the Mother, like Kore within Demeter. (See Anne, Saint.)
Among gypsies, "occult couples" carefully cut the apple to reveal its pentacle and ate it together as magical nourishment during Tannic
intercourse. 7 A gypsy maiden was supposed to bring about her partner s mystic union with the soul of the earth through her own body; thus she was a Shakti, and the apple was her sexual symbol. It was a custom
for a gypsy girl to choose her lover by tossing an apple at him, just as
Kali-Shakti chose Shiva to be her doomed bridegroom. 8
In Celtic paganism the Goddess's apple similarly signified a sacred

marriage and a journey to the land of death. Queen Guinevere, who
was really the Triple Goddess, according to the Welsh Triads, gave a
magic apple to "the Irish knight Sir Patrice," actually St. Patrick,
formerly the father-god or Pater. 9 (See Patrick, Saint.) The Irish knight died; Guinevere was denounced as a witch and condemned to the stake, from which Lancelot rescued her. Her offense was choosing a
sacred king in the ancient ceremonial style. Pre-Christian legends
show that each king who ruled Britain had to be chosen by the Triple
Goddess, and later slain by her Crone form, Morgan, lady of the blood-red pentacle and keeper of the Apple-Isle in the west. 10
Halloween apple-games descended from Celtic feasts of Samhain, the Feast of the Dead at the end of October. Catching at apples
suspended from strings, or bobbing in water, may have invoked hanged or drowned witches. The games hinted at cheating Death in the form
of Cerridwen, another name for Morgan as a Sow-goddess. At the end of the game, all players ran away "to escape from the black shorttailed sow." 11
Halloween apples were also used for divination, as if they were
oracular ghosts called up from the underworld. Such magic was
especially associated with women, harking back to the pagan tradition of
female control of the spirits in that world. The Volsung cycle showed
that a man must be provided with "apples of Hel" by his wife, whose gift had the power to preserve him when he died and descended under the earth. 12 Thus, Halloween apples were often linked with
marriage. One who peeled an apple before a candlelit mirror on Halloween would see the image of a future spouse. 13
Apple blossoms were wedding flowers because they represented the Virgin form of the Goddess whose maturity produced the fruit.
As the pagan symbols were Christianized, Apple-Eve-Mother-Goddess was said to be reborn as her own younger aspect, Rose-Mary-VirginGoddess: the five-petaled rose and apple blossom often mystically combined. The red and white Alchemical Rose was an allegory of the
Virgin Mother. 14 Some mystics said Mary, called the Holy Rose, had invented alchemy. 15
However, the dangerous aspect of apples associated with the Goddess as Mother Death were never forgotten. Since she was not
only the Virgin and the Mother but also Hel, or Hecate, her apples were often depicted in Christian folklore as poisoned. Churchmen declared that a witch could cause demonic possession through her gift of
an apple to her intended victim. 16 Old women were slain for giving
an apple to a child or other person who later became afflicted with fits.

Arabia
Before Islam arrived in the 7th century a.d., Arabia was matriarchal
for over a thousand years of recorded history. The Annals of Ashurbani
pal said Arabia was governed by queens for as long as anyone could
remember. 1 The land's original Allah was Al-Lat, part of the female
trinity along with Kore or Q're, the Virgin, and Al-Uzza, the Powerful One, the triad known as Manat, the Threefold Moon. 2
At Mecca the Goddess was Shaybah or Sheba, the Old Woman, worshipped as a black aniconic stone like the Goddess of the Scythian Amazons. 3 The same Black Stone now enshrined in the Kaaba at
Mecca was her feminine symbol, marked by the sign of the yoni, and covered like the ancient Mother by a veil. 4 No one seems to know
exactly what it is supposed to represent today. The Black Stone rests in the Haram, "Sanctuary," cognate of "harem," which used to mean a Temple of Women: in Babylon, a
shrine of the Goddess Har, mother of harlots. 5 Hereditary guardians of the Haram were the Koreshites, "Children of Kore," Mohammed's
own tribe. 6 The holy office was originally held by women, before it was taken over by male priests calling themselves Beni Shaybah, "Sons of the Old Woman." 7
Mohammed's legends clearly gave him a matriarchal family
background. His parents' marriage was matrilocal. His mother remained
with her own family and received her husband as an occasional
visitor. Mohammed lived with his mother until her death, because she
was his true parent according to the ancient system; "children
belonged to the woman's family . . . paternity in the biological sense was relatively unimportant." 8 She may well have been one of the "aged priestesses" who served the temple in Mecca. 9 The traditions of such
priestesses may well date back to Assyro- Babylonian um-mati or "mothers," the only people permitted to enter the Holy of Holies. Archaic Arabian shrines were usually served by seven high priest
esses, recalling the lawgiving Seven Sages, who were women. 10 The first collection of the books of law called Koran the Word of Kore,
or Q're was attributed to them. Pre-Islamic Arabia was dominated by the female-centered clans.
Marriages were matrilocal, inheritance matrilineal. Polyandry
several husbands to one wife was common. Men lived in their wives'
homes. Divorce was initiated by the wife. If she turned her tent to
face east for three nights in a row, the husband was dismissed and for
bidden to enter the tent again. 11 Doctrines attributed to Mohammed simply reversed the ancient system in favor of men. A Moslem husband could dismiss his wife by
saying "I divorce thee" three times. As in Europe, the change from
matriarchate to patriarchate came about only gradually and with
much strife.

Arabia
Shi'ites Minority sect
of Islam, tracing descent of a sacred
caliphate from
Mohammed's daughter Fatima and her husband 'Ali. One line of Shi'ites established the powerful Fatimid
caliphate, now represented by the Khojas, Bohras, and the Druze of Syria.
Many Koreshites remained faithful to the Goddess and to their
queen, Hind al-Hunud: the Hind of Hinds, similar to the title of
Artemis. She was also called Lady of Victory. But her victories came to an end with one of the last queens, whose husband betrayed her and
surrendered her city of Makkah to the enemy. Legend claims the step-daughter of the divine Hind married
Mohammed himself. 12 However, the history of early-medieval Arabia
is nearly all legend. Like Buddha, Confucius, Jesus, and other founders of patriarchal religions, Mohammed lacks real verification. There is
no reliable information about his life or teachings. Most stories about
him are as apocryphal as the story that his coffin hangs forever in
mid-air "between heaven and earth," like the bodies of ancient sacred
kings. 13 With or without Mohammed, Islam succeeded in becoming com
pletely male-dominated, making no place for women except in slavery or in the seclusion of the harem. Islamic mosques still bear signs
reading: "Women and dogs and other impure animals are not
permitted to enter." H
Nevertheless, traces of the Goddess proved ineradicable. Like the
virgin Mary, Arabia's Queen of Heaven received a mortal form and a
subordinate position as Fatima, Mohammed's "daughter." But she was no real daughter. She was known as Mother of her Father, and
Source of the Sun: "the illumination that separates Light and Darkness; the Tree of Paradise; the Red Cow who suckles all the children of the
earth; Fate; the Night, the World; the Moon; the Pure Essence of Being." 15 Like her western counterpart Mary, she was compared to the Burning Bush, and the Night of Power; "she personified the center
of the genealogical mystery." 16 Fatima's name means The Creatress. A Shi'a text, Omm-al-Kitab,
said she appeared "at the creation of the material world," crowned,
seated on a throne, holding a sword, and "ornamented with a million
varicolored shimmering lights" which illuminated the entire garden of
Paradise. She was the first to occupy the Seat of Dominion, "the
resting place of Allah, the Most High." 17 Her symbol as Holy Virgin, the crescent moon, still appears on Islamic flags. 18 She is called Al
Zahra, "Bright-Blooming," a former title of the Great Mother. It is
said the symbol of her hand, surmounting the solar disc, "represents the whole religion of Islam." 19
Within Islam, deviant sects like Shi'ites or Sufis carried on Tantric
worship of the female principle, maintaining that the feminine powers of sexuality and maternity were the powers that held the universe together. 20 The greatest medieval poet of Sufism, Ibn alFarid, was known as "the sultan of lovers." 21 He said true divinity was
female, and Mecca was the womb of the earth. As woman-worshipping minstrels of medieval Europe were attacked for their devotion to the
Goddess of Love, so the Sufis were attacked for their "voluptuous
52



libertinism." Ibn El-Arabi, the "greatest master" of Sufi mystics, was Arabia accused of blasphemy because he said the godhead is female. 22
Shi'ites split off from orthodox Islam and claimed to follow a purer ___^_^_^_
line of imams directly descended from the Fatimids. In the 1 1th
century they united under Hasan ibn al-Sabbah, i.e., Hasan benShaybah, another "son of the Matriarch." Hasan seized the fortress
of Alamut and made it the headquarters of a brotherhood of warriors,
the hashishim or "Assassins" (see Aladdin). The fortress fell to the concerted attacks of Mongols and Mamelukes in 1256, after having waged war on Turks and Christian crusaders alike for more than a
century. 23 Still the Shi'ite sect survived to the present, awaiting the coming of
the Virgin named Paradise (Pairidaeza), who will give birth to the
Mahdi, the "moon-guided" Redeemer, whose title in Europe was the Desired Knight. 24
One of the hidden secrets of medieval bardic romance is the
Arabian origin of the Waste Land motif, most prominent in the Holy
Grail cycle of tales. Despite monkish efforts to convert it into a
Christian chalice, the Grail was generally recognized as a female
symbol, whose loss implied fear for the fertility of the earth. Crusaders had seen for themselves the desolation of Arabia Deserta, one of the
most lifeless regions on earth. They heard the Shi'ite heretics'
explanation for it: Islam had offended the Great Goddess, and she had cursed the land and departed. Now nothing would grow there.
Western mystics thought the same calamity would strike Europe if the spirit of the Mother were not brought back from the limbo to
which the Christian church consigned her. This may have been a
reason for the frenzy of cathedral-building in honor of "Our Lady," the Queen of Heaven, during the 12th and 13th centuries. The Waste Land theme haunted the collective psyche of the early Renaissance with
a threat of conditions actually realized in the land of the infidel.
Traces of the matriarchate survived to the present among some of the Arabs of North Africa, ancient home of "Libyan Amazons." 25 Targi and Tuareg Berber women remained free of many sexual
restrictions. Virginity was not prized. On remarriage, a woman could
command twice the bride-price of a young virgin. Men of the Walad 'Abdi tribe insisted the success of their crops depended on the sexual freedom of their women, whom the French labeled common prostitutes. Hassanyeh Arabs of the White Nile allowed wives to be
unfaithful on certain days of the week, according to the marriage
contract drawn up by the bride's mother who took pride in preserving
her daughter's sexual liberties. 27 Most of Islam, however, restricted
women as much as possible. Many Islamic theologians said women couldn't enter paradise, and must not receive religious instruction because it might bring them "too near their masters." 28

Arachne
"Spider" or "Spinner," title and totem of Athene the Fate-weaver.
Man's helplessness in the web of Fate was symbolized by the helplessness of the fly in the spider's web. The fly was a common archaic
symbol of the human soul, even thought to be the actual embodiment
of the soul in passage from one life to the next; thus divine
psychopomps like Baal-Zebub (Beelzebub) were called "Lord of Flies" because they conducted souls. 1
Classical writers misinterpreted old images of Athene with her
spider-totem and web, and constructed the legend of Arachne, a mortal maid whose skill in weaving outshone even that of the Goddess. Therefore Athene turned her into a spider. 2

Ariana
Archaic name of Iran and its Great Goddess, sometimes rendered Mariana.
Arianism
Early Christian heresy founded by Arius in the 4th century a.d. The basic tenet of Arianism was that God was not a trinity but a unit or monad.
Orphics and other mystery-cultists of the early Christian era maintained the classic trinitarian pattern laid down thousands of years
before by the Triple Goddess. They said: "All things are made by one
godhead in three names, and this god is all things." From the
mystery-cults, some Christians picked up the idea that their deity too
should be a trinity. Other Christians objected, saying their deity must
be a monad like the Jewish Jehovah. St. Augustine found the notion of a
trinity incomprehensible. He scoffed at his pagan neighbors for calling their Great Goddess three persons and one person at the same
time. 1
Neither the Old nor the New Testament mentioned a triune God,
so early Pauline Christians worshipped God as one individual. How
ever, this monotheistic idea was abandoned at the 4th-century Council
of Nicaea. Arian Christians, clinging to the Hebraic belief in an
undivided God, suddenly found themselves labeled heretics. In increas
ingly acrimonious battles, partisans of one viewpoint or the other engaged in street fighting with stones and clubs, bloodying their opponents to prove the nature of their deity. 2
Arius's objections to the Holy Trinity were basically logical. He insisted that a divine son couldn't have co-existed eternally with his own divine father. There must have been a time when the father existed
alone, before bringing the son into being. But Arius's opponents wanted to be assured that, in assimilating the body and blood of Christ
in communion, they partook of an infinite divinity who had existed
55



Arianrhod from the beginning of time. Otherwise they might be robbed of immor
tality, through unwise identification with a lesser, finite power. ^^^^^^^^^^^ Therefore they insisted that Christ and God were one and the same.
Besides, pagan traditions universally supported the notion that divine fathers and sons were identical with each other, cyclically
alternating and united through the Mother. Proponents of the trinitar
ian theory borrowed myths and symbols from the pagans, and said
when the Magi saw the star in the east announcing Christ's birth, three
suns appeared in the sky and fused into one. 3 The emperor Constantine I at first defended Arius, because he
liked the idea of a single supreme deity whom he might identify with himself. He also disliked the Christians' incessant sectarian strife. He
wrote to Bishop Alexander: "I am sending to you, not simply suggesting, but imploring that you will take these men (the Arians) back . . .
that there is peace and concord among you all." 4 This was ignored. The Council decided that God, Christ, and the Holy Ghost were
one and the same, forever co-existent, equally potent. Arius was anathematized and driven into exile. At last he succumbed to a dose of
poison, apparently administered by one of his trinitarian opponents. 5
But the battle was not over. The Arian controversy dragged on for
many centuries, and spilled much blood, as theological arguments were wont to do in those days.
After 360 a.d., Arianism was carried by missionaries to the Germanic tribes, whose Christianity remained a vaguely Arian semi
paganism up to the time of Charlemagne and beyond.6 Arianism came to the surface again in Hungary and Transylvania during the 16th
century. Christian writers then denied the trinity altogether, starting a movement that led ultimately to the foundation of Unitarian churches. 7

Arianrhod
Goddess mother of Celtic "Aryans," keeper of the endlessly circling Silver Wheel of the Stars, symbol of Time, the same as Kali's karmic wheel. Some gave the Goddess herself the title of "Silver Wheel
That Descends into the Sea." l Arianrhod's wheel was also the Wheel of Light, Wheel of Fal, or
Oar Wheel. It was often likened to a vast ship carrying dead warriors
to the Moon-land, called Magonia or Emania or Hy-Many. The wheel
was made by "three druidesses" that is, the Triple Goddess, who created the cosmic wheel of the zodiac or the Milky Way. 2 Arianrhod seems to have been the same Goddess as Ariadne, another version of the "mother of Aryans." 3

\rinna
-littite name of the Great Goddess as "Mother of the Sun." In
Mesopotamia and Egypt, the sun god was generally considered a child
)f the moon-, earth-, sea-, or heaven-goddess.
Arinna Ark
Vrk of the Covenant
)n its earliest appearances in the Bible, the ark of the covenant was so acer (taboo, dangerous) that it would kill at a touch. While it was
eing transported on an oxcart, it teetered "because the oxen shook
:" and would have fallen, had not Uzzah "put forth his hand to the ark
if God, and took hold of it" (2 Samuel 6:3). In spite of Uzzah's good
itentions, God instantly struck him dead for daring to touch the
loly object.
Again, when the ark returned from Philistia, God perpetrated an
xtraordinary slaughter of 50,070 well-intentioned people for daring 3 look inside the ark in their joy: "And he smote the men of
lethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the Lord, even e smote of tlfe people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and
le people lamented, because the Lord had smitten many of the
eople with a great slaughter" (1 Samuel 6:19). Even priests feared the power of the ark, and resorted to ritual
/ashing before approaching it, "that they die not" (Exodus 30:20). Vater was a common prophylactic charm against the destructive power
f holy things. Philon of Byzantium said all the "ancients" used water
)r ritual purification before entering temples; they also spun prayer
'heels made of Aphrodite's sacred metal, copper. 1 For some reason God lost interest in his ark by Jeremiah's time:
Saith the Lord, they shall say no more, the ark of the covenant of
le Lord: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it;
either shall it be magnified any more" (Jeremiah 3:16). The probable cause of God's change of heart was a reform
lovement to purge the temple of sexual symbols. The arks or cistae of
le Greeks and Syrians held emblems of the lingam-yoni, such as eggs nd serpents, clay or dough models of genitalia. Rabbinical tradition lid the ark contained a hexagram representing the sexual union of God
nd Goddess, the same meaning given to the hexagram in India. 2 'hus the ark was a female container for a male god. Mary, God's
Dnsort in her later form, often received the title of "Ark."
Semitic Arek, "ark," descended from Hindu Argha, "great ship," letaphorically the Great Yoni: a female-sexual vessel bearing seeds f life through the sea of chaos between destruction of one cosmos and
reation of the next. 3 From the same root came "arcane," literally a
ark or crescent phase of the moon. The crescent moon boat symboled the Goddess's spirit dancing on her primordial uterine Ocean of

Artemidos, Saint
Fictitious Christian saint based on a votive idol of the Goddess
Artemis. 1 In some traditions she remained female, but in others she lost

1. H.Smith, 227.
Artemis
Amazonian Moon-goddess, worshipped at Ephesus under the Latin name of Diana or "Goddess-Anna." Like the Hindu Goddess Saranyu
who gave birth to all animals, she was called Mother of Creatures.
Her image at Ephesus had a whole torso covered with breasts, to show
that she nurtured all living things. Yet she was also the Huntress,
killer of the very creatures she brought forth. 1 In Sparta her name was
given as Artamis, "Cutter," or "Butcher." 2 Artemis's myths extend back to Neolithic sacrificial customs. At
Taurus her holy women, under their high priestess Iphigeneia, sacrificed all men who landed on their shores, nailing the head of each
victim to a cross. 3 At Hierapolis, the Goddess's victims were hung on
artificial trees in her temple. In Attica, Artemis was ritually propitiated with drops of blood drawn from a man's neck by a sword, a symbolic remnant of former beheadings. Human victims were later replaced by
bulls, hence the Goddess's title Tauropolos, "bull-slayer." 4 Her Huntress aspect was another form of the destroying Crone or waning moon. Like Hecate, she led the nocturnal hunt; her pries
tesses wore the masks of hunting dogs. Alani, "hunting dogs," was the Greek name for Scythians who revered Artemis. The mythological hunting dogs who tore the Horned God Actaeon to pieces were really Artemis's sacred bitches.
Classic mythographers pretended that Actaeon committed the sin
of seeing the chaste virgin Goddess in her bath, and she condemned
Cft



him out of offended modesty. Actually, the bath, the nakedness, and the tearing to pieces of the sacred king were all part of the drama. In barbarian Germany, the Goddess's ritual bath could be witnessed only
by "men doomed to die." 5 Actaeon's deerskin and antlers marked
him as the pre-Hellenic stag king, reigning over the sacred hunt for half
a Great Year before he was torn to pieces and replaced by his tanist
(co-king). In the first century a.d., Artemis's priestesses still pursued and
killed a man dressed as a stag on the Goddess's mountain.6 Her
groves became the "deer-gardens" (German Tiergarten, Swedish Djurgarden), once the scene of venison feasts.
One of Artemis's most popular animal incarnations was the Great
She-Bear, Ursa Major, ruler of the stars and protectress of the axis mundi, Pole of the World, marked in heaven by the Pole Star at the center of the small circle described by the constellation Ursa Major.
Helvetian tribes in the neighborhood of Berne worshipped her as the
She-Bear, which is still the heraldic symbol of Berne. The city's very name means "She-Bear." 7 Sometimes the Helvetians called her Artio,
shortened to Art by Celtic peoples who coupled her with the bearking Arthur. As Artio's Lord of the Hunt, the medieval god of witches came to be known as "Robin son of Art." According to the Irish, Art meant "God," but its earlier connotation was "Goddess" specifically the Bear-Goddess. 8 She was also canonized as a Christian saint,
Ursula, derived from her Saxon name of Ursel, the She-Bear.
There was a rather sophisticated astronomical reason for worship
ping the heavenly She-Bear who followed her track around the Pole
Star, year by year. It was probably discovered first in the far east. "The
months and seasons are determined by the revolution of Ursa Major.
The tail of the constellation pointing to the east at nightfall announces
the arrival of spring, pointing to the south the arrival of summer,
pointing to the west the arrival of autumn, and pointing to the north the
arrival of winter. . . . The Great Bear occupies a prominent position
in the Taoist heavens as the aerial throne of the supreme deity." This
deity in Taoist tradition is the Queen of Heaven, Holy Mother Ma
Tsu P'o, with characteristics similar to those of Artemis. She protects
seafarers and governs the weather; she is called a virgin, and Matron
of the Measure; she is a Mother of Mercy who has been compared to the virgin Mary and to the Buddhist Goddess Maritchi.9 The axis mundi was often associated with male gods, as either a
Great Serpent or a World Tree more or less recognized as a phallic
symbol. Similarly the Little Bear within the circle of the Great Bear was
pictured by the Greeks as Areas, her son (see Callisto). Yet among
the oldest traditions may be found hints that this world-supporting tree
or pole was female. Even as Yggdrasil, the World Tree of the
Vikings, it showed many parallels with birth-giving, fruit- or milk
producing mother trees of the Near East, under its older name of Mjotvidr or Mutvidr, "Mother-Tree." Sometimes it was Mead-Tree,
like "the milk-giving tree of the Finno-Ugric peoples, a symbol which must go back ultimately to Mesopotamia, and be of great antiquity." It

was said that "the tree is the source of unborn souls," which would
give birth to the new primal woman, Life (Lif) in the new universe after
the present cycle came to an end. Its fruit could be given to women
in childbirth "that what is within may pass out." The spring at the tree's
root was a fountain of wisdom or of the life-giving fluid aurr, which may be likened to the "wise blood" of the Mother that much
mythologized feminine life-source likened to the Kula nectar in the
uterine spring of Kundalini, as if the maternal tree upholding the
universe were the Mother's spine with its many chakras. 10 See Menstrual Blood.
"Many-breasted" Artemis was always a patroness of nurture, fertility, and birth. Male gods turned against these attributes in
opposing the cult of the Goddess. Her own twin brother and sometime
consort Apollo made birth illegal on his sacred isle of Delos;
pregnant women had to be removed from the island lest they offend the
god by giving birth there. 11 Christians continued to vilify Artemis.
Tatian said, "Artemis is a poisoner; Apollo performs cures." 12 The Gospels demanded destruction of Artemis's Ephesian temple (Acts
19:27). St. John Chrysostom preached against this temple in 406 a.d. Soon afterward, it was looted and burned. The patriarch of Constan
tinople praised Chrysostom's zeal: "In Ephesus he stripped the treasury of Artemis; in Phrygia, he left without sons her whom they called the Mother of the Gods." 13 See Diana.

(Freya) also bore a name meaning Wealth; so did Rhea-Pluto, Ops Opulentia, and Terra Mater. See Earth.
Arthur
King Arthur was the Welsh Arth Vawr, Heavenly Bear. His predecessor or "father" was Uther Pendragon, "Wonderful Head of the
Dragon." 1 Where did the dragon's head precede the bear? At the hub of the heavens, which the ancients always anxiously watched. In the 3rd millenium b.c, the north pole star was not the present
Polaris in Ursa Minor, the Little Bear. It was Alpha Draconis, the
Head of the Dragon. 2 Due to precession of the equinoxes, a slow subtle
shift of the celestial pole took place over the course of 5000 years.
However difficult it may have been to observe, the ancients seem to
60



have known about it. India as well as Britain placed the former north
pole in the constellation of the Dragon. The Mahabharata said the pole star, to which "the yoke of the world" was fixed, was the head of the
Great Serpent. 3
Greeks said the little bear-god who replaced the serpent was Areas, ancestor of the Arcadians. His mother was Artemis Calliste, the
Great She-Bear who used to rule all the stars. 4 As Ursa Major, she still
circles the pole. Western Europeans called her Artio, Art, Ursel, or Ercel. 5 Arthur was a Celtic version of her son, spouse, sacred king. Arthur was another humanization of an old pagan god apparent
ly very old, for he had no credible human parentage but rather many
contradictory miraculous-birth myths. Some said he had no father. Like the Norse god Heimdall and the Saxon hero Scyld, he was born of
the Ninefold Sea-goddess and cast ashore on the ninth wave, to land at
Merlin's feet.6 Bulfinch's Mythology said Arthur's father was Ambro
sius, an earlier name for Merlin.
The story of Uther Pendragon's fatherhood of Arthur bears marks
of strained revision. Arthur's royal mother was married to Uther's
rival at the time. Uther was far away, but with Merlin's help he sent his
spirit to her in the guise of her husband, while the latter was being
killed. Arthur was begotten at the instant his official father died. He was
taken away by Merlin to be raised in a secret place until he came of
age the cliche secret upbringing of every sacred king's career.
Arthur's mother was really the Triple Goddess, incarnate in the
queen as usual. Her three daughters represented herself in triad:
Elaine, the virgin Lily Maid; Margawse, mother of the four Aeons; Morgan, Queen of the Shades. Arthur later coupled with his sister
Margawse and incestuously begot his own son-nephew-supplanter, Mordred, who was likewise taken away at birth to be raised in hiding. As Galahad was the reincarnated Lancelot, so Mordred was the
reincarnated Arthur, destined to succeed him by both matrilineal and
patrilineal right, as both sister's-son and son. Like all kings threatened by
the Oedipal rival, Arthur tried to kill Mordred by a Slaughter of the
Innocents. He collected all the children born on May Day, the birthday
of his prophesied supplanter, put them on a ship, and sent them out to sea to be wrecked. Of course Mordred survived the wreck and grew
up to return incognito to Arthur's court. 8
Arthur lost his sacred mana when he lost his queen, the Triple Goddess incarnate in Guinevere, who was really three Guineveres
according to the Welsh Triads.9 Mordred seized her, thus symbolically
seizing the kingdom, and brought Arthur to his death. When Arthur died, the same Triple Goddess took him back into
the sea that gave him birth. "Three fairy queens" carried him away to
the western isles of paradise, singing his death-song, the kind of song
Welsh bards called marwysgafen giving-back-to-the-sea-mother.

The three fairy queens were really the final triad of the Ninefold
Goddess, Morgan le Fay and two of her alter egos: the Queen of

General name for Indo-European peoples, from Sanskrit arya, a man of clay (like Adam), or else a man of the land, a farmer or land

became known as Ahriman, the dark earth god, opponent or
subterranean alter ego of the solar deity Ormazd (Ahura Mazda). In Celtic Ireland he was Eremon, one of the sacred kings who married
the Earth (Tara).
Though there was nothing "pure" about either the name or the
far-flung mixture of tribes it was supposed to describe, the term
"pure Aryan" was revived in Nazi Germany to support a mythological concept of Teutonic stock, the so-called Master Race. Non-Aryans
were all the "inferior" strains: Semites, Negroes, gypsies, Slavs, and
Latinate or "swarthy" people whose blood was said to be polluting
the Nordic superiority of their betters.

Asceticism
The religion of self-denial, such as practiced by early Christian eremites, characterized by self-inflicted pain, hunger, and other auster
ities, and renunciation of sensual pleasures.
Perhaps the earliest sectaries to regard asceticism as the key
to heaven were Jain Buddhists (see Jains), whose theology influenced
Persian patriarchs, who in turn influenced Jewish eremites like the
Essenes. Jain Buddhist monks had already penetrated the courts of
Syria, Egypt, Macedonia, and Epirus by the 4th century B.C., and were glorified in legend for the alleged magic powers they developed through prodigies of self-denial. 1 Originally, men's ascetic practices seem to have evolved from a
notion that extreme forms of self-denial would bring them the
magical female capacity to give birth. Oriental myths said the first
62



creator-gods acquired the ability to produce living things by "practicing fierce asceticism for ten thousand years." 2
Though men never achieved the ability to give birth, they claimed other miraculous powers developed by asceticism. Perfected eremites were said to fly, to walk on water, to understand all languages, to turn base metals into gold, to heal lameness and blindness, and other
miracles that became the common property of all scriptures including the Christian ones. 5
Jain Buddhists looked upon women as hopelessly inferior in the pursuit of asceticism. Their handbook said no woman could achieve
Nirvana, because "in the womb, between the breasts, in their navel and
loins, a subtle emanation of life is continually taking place. How then can they be fit for self-control? A woman may be pure in faith and even
occupied with a study of the sutras or the practice of a terrific
asceticism; in her case there will be no falling away of karmic matter." 4 Some of the ascetics openly despised sexuality and motherhood.
The Mahabharata anticipated St. Augustine's remarks about the nastiness of birth: "-Man emerges mixed with excrement and water,
fouled with the impurities of woman. A wise man will avoid the
contaminating society of women as he would the touch of bodies
infested with vermin." 5 Some advertised their renunciation of sex by
castrating themselves or affixing large metal rings in the flesh of the
penis. 6 Essenic Judaism and early Christianity were offshoots of the Jain tradition, urging abandonment of the family and of all secular
concerns. 7 Like the art of the Jains, Christian art in the early medieval
period showed stiff, crude, doll-like figures, apparently bodiless under their wooden draperies, even hands and faces badly drawn. Not even
artists were permitted to study the human form. 8 To look at some
thing attractive especially if it was made of flesh was highly suspect
because the observer might enjoy the act of looking. According to St.
Jerome, a Christian must consider poisonous every act or experience having the smallest hint of sensual pleasure.9
Pain, however, was permitted and encouraged throughout the Christian era. St. Catherine of Siena was highly praised for whipping herself three times a day, once for her own sins, once for the sins of the
living, and once for the sins of the dead. St. Simeon Stylites was
glorified for remaining motionless on top of his pillar, like Buddhist
standing-yogis, until his living flesh rotted. 10
Fathers of the church constantly urged asceticism upon the faith
ful. Gregory of Nyssa touted it in terms of both wetness and dryness: "As the tympanum, from which all moisture has been removed so that it
is exceedingly dry, gives out a loud noise, so also is virginity, which
receives no life-giving moisture, illustrious and renowned." " Again he
said: "We often see water, contained in a pipe, bursting upward
through this constraining force, which will not let it leak, and this in
spite of its natural gravitation; in the same way the mind of man,

Asceticism enclosed in the compact channel of an habitual continence, and not
having any side issues, will be raised by virtue of its natural powers of
^B|^B^^^^Bi^^ motion to an exalted love." n
Moral tales told by the Christian fathers concentrated on renuncia
tion of sexual love, and acceptance of painful martyrdom. The tale of
Sts. Cyprian and Justina is typical. Cyprian, a pagan sorcerer, fell in love with the Christian maiden Justina and cast a love spell on her.
Though sworn to virginity like all good Christian maidens, Justina was tortured by desire. Nevertheless she conquered her desire and proved
her piety with such prodigies of asceticism that she impressed even
Cyprian: she fasted almost to death, she slept naked on the stony
ground, she mutilated herself to spoil her beauty. 13 Cyprian was so
intrigued by all this he turned Christian too, and was martyred along
with his incorrigible virgin. 14 Human love was anathema to the early Christians who insisted
that families must be abandoned. Sexual impulses were perverted
into unnatural obsessions. 15 The fall of Rome was not entirely unrelated
to Christians' abhorrence of the basic social unit of the state: the
interlocked loyalties and dependencies of the family. Jesus himself undermined the family in his teaching: "If any man come to me, and
hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and breth
ren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple"
(Luke 14:26). Becker says Christianity stood for "renunciation of this
world and the satisfactions of this life, which is why the pagans thought
Christianity was crazy. It was a sort of anti-heroism by an animal who
denied life in order to deny evil." 16
Principles of asceticism so embedded themselves in Christian
society that nearly every kind of sensual pleasure came to be regarded as wicked only because it was pleasant. The delights of sacramental
dancing were forbidden. A story from Ramersdorf in the Rhine
land tells of a Christian missionary priest who found youths and maidens
dancing together on the Sabbath. He called God's curse on them,
which forced them to go on dancing day and night until they lost their
minds. 17 Some European peasants still abstain from sexual inter
course during the sowing season, in the church-fostered belief that
sexual activity might call down a curse on the crop. 18
In the 18th century, theologians were still preaching the wickedness of even the most subtle feelings of pleasure. Beaumont
counseled women especially to attribute any enjoyable bodily sensation to the devil's influence: "If ye perceive a sudden sweet taste in your
mouths or feel any warmth in your breasts, like fire, or any form of
pleasure in any part of your body, or ... if ye become aware by occasion of pleasure or satisfaction derived from such perception, that
your hearts are drawn away from the contemplation of Jesus Christ
and from spiritual exercises . . . then this sensation is very much to be
suspected of coming from the Enemy; and therefore were it ever so wonderful and striking, still renounce it." 19 Yet the obsessive contem
64



plation of pain, starting with Jesus's pain on the cross, was always to Asceticism be encouraged. The most significant difference between Christianity and its pagan ^^^^^^^^^_
forerunners was this reversal of the pleasure-pain continuum. Earlier
societies regarded sensual pleasure as a touch of divinity, and "bliss" sexual or otherwise as a foretaste of heaven. Woman was a carrier
of the divine spark because of her capacity to give and receive physical
pleasure. The Christian theory turned this opinion completely around. Fathers of the church taught that the human race must die out
through universal celibacy, before Jesus could return and establish his
heaven on earth. Reasoning that man fell from grace through woman,
man could return to grace only by renouncing woman. 20 Therefore, medieval churchmen came to identify sexuality with the worst of
heresies and sins, especially since St. Augustine had labeled it the
pipeline of original sin. Even Protestant theologians adopted this view. Calvin said that, because of its origin in sexuality and in a woman's
body, every child was "defiled and polluted" in God's sight even before it saw the light of the day; a newborn infant is a "seed-bed of sin and therefore cannot but be odious and abominable to God." Martin Luther
married an ex-nun, but still didn't think much of sex. He said, "Had
God consulted me in the matter, I would have advised him to continue
the generation of the species by fashioning them out of clay." 21 This note of arrogance, even hubris, in the idea of man issuing
instructions to God, was always a hidden component of asceticism, despite its outward show of extreme or unnatural humility. "Nothing is
prouder than the humility of the ascetic of other-worldly spirit that
proclaims itself superior to the whole natural world, or than the
mysticism that renounces the self only to commune with God
himself." 22 Here lies the real reason for men's secret delight in ascetic
principles and practices. It must be remembered that the original purpose of such self-denial was to become identified with a god and to
acquire God's sacred powers for one's self.
Becoming a god meant acquiring the ability to perform miracles, as many Christian ascetics were supposed to have done. By definition,
miracles flouted the laws of nature. Thus the ascetic became deliberate
ly un-natural, confusing the denial of his own instinctual desires with
denial of Mother Nature's observed habits. Ascetic ideals therefore
placed body and spirit in conflict with each other. "Asceticism is the
ethical code which arises inevitably from a dualistic opposition between
the spiritual and the natural. These are represented as absolutely irre
concilable and mutually antagonistic; if a man is to escape the natural he must renounce the rights of his physical nature in the interests of his
spiritual." 25 The psychic problem of such dualistic opinion is still much in evidence.

Asherah
Semitic name of the Great Goddess, possibly from Old Iranian asha,
"Universal Law," a law of the matriarch, like Roman ius naturale. 1 Asherah was "in wisdom the Mistress of the Gods." 2 Sumerians
called her Ashnan, "strength of all things," and "a kindly and bountiful maiden." 3 Her sacred city Mar-ash appears in the Bible as Mareshah
(Joshua 15:44). The Old Testament "Asherah" is translated "grove," without any
explanation that the sacred grove represented the Goddess's genital
center, birthplace of all things. In the matriarchal period, Hebrews
worshipped the Goddess in groves (1 Kings 14:23), later cut down by patriarchal reformers who burned the bones of Asherah's priests on their
own altars (2 Chronicles 24:4-5).
The Goddess's grove-yoni was Athra qaddisa, "the holy place" (literally, "divine harlot"). Sometimes she was called simply "Holi
ness," a word later applied to Yahweh. Canaanites called her Qaniyatu
elima, She Who Gives Birth to the Gods, or Rabbatu athiratu yammi, Lady Who Traverses the Sea (i.e., the Moon). 4 Rabbatu was an
early female form of rabbi. Athirat, Athra, Aethra, Athyr, and Egypt's Hathor were all variations of the same name for the Goddess. 5 In Egypt
she was also a Law-giving Mother, Ashesh, an archaic form of Isis; the name meant both "pouring out" and "supporting," the functions of her breasts. Her yonic shrine in Thebes was Asher, Ashrel, or Ashrelt.
Some called her "Great Lady of Ashert, the lady of heaven, the queen
of the gods." 6 For a while, Asherah accepted the Semitic god El as her consort.
She was the Heavenly Cow, he the Bull. 7 After their sacred marriage,
she bore the Heavenly Twins, Shaher and Shalem, the stars of morning
and evening (see Lucifer). The marriage rite seems to have involved
the cooking of a kid in its mother's milk, a procedure later forbidden by
Jewish priests (Exodus 23:19). 8

Ash Wednesday
This allegedly Christian festival was taken from Roman paganism, which in turn took it from Vedic India. Ashes were called the seed of
the fire god Agni, with power to absolve all sins. Even if a man does
"a thousand things that one ought not to do, by bathing in ashes he will cause all of that to be burnt to ashes as fire burns a forest with its ener
gy." Another source said ashes stood for the purifying blood of Shiva, in
66



which one could bathe away sins, as Christians bathed in the blood of the Lamb. 1 At Rome's New Year Feast of Atonement in March, people wore sackcloth and bathed in ashes to atone for their sins. 2 Then as now,
New Year's Eve was a carnival of eating, drinking, and sinning, on the
theory that all sins would be wiped out the following day. As the
dying god of March, Mars took his worshippers' sins with him into death. Therefore the carnival fell on dies martis, the Day of Mars. In
English this was Tuesday, because Mars was identified with the Saxon god Tiw. In French the carnival day was Mardi Gras, "Fat Tues
day," the day of merrymaking before Ash Wednesday.
A Catholic directory of 1 5 1 1 ordered priests to say to the congre
gation on Ash Wednesday, "Remember, man, you are ashes and to ashes will return." Fuller's Church History said the purpose of Ash
Wednesday was to remind every man that he is "but ashes and earth,
and thereto shall return." 5 These maxims oddly contradicted the
church's official doctrine of the resurrection of the flesh. Their purpose
was to justify with* some Christian gloss the ancient notion that
redemption might be brought about by contact with ashes.

Christian demon often credited with possessing nuns or young women to make them lustful, because he was portrayed in the Book of
Tobit as a spirit of lechery. Tobit's Asmodeus was really "the god Asmo," or Aeshma, a Persian deity associated with Ahriman. Zoroastri

the Judeo-Christian canon of sacred scriptures but later eliminated from the official canon.
Ass
The ass-god Pales had an extensive cult throughout the ancient
world. Palestine, Philistia, and the Palatine Hill in Rome were named
for Pales, who was both male and female. 1 The Old Norse word Ass meant both "Asian" and "deity,"
possibly indicating that the divine ass originated in Asia. 2 The pre
Vedic sacred king Ravana sported ten crowned human heads
surmounted by one ass head, symbolizing the spirit of the ass god
incarnate in ten kings. 3 The long ears of the ass seem to have had the
same significance of virility in ancient India as the horns of the sacred
bull or stag.4
Tacitus said the Jews worshipped the ass because wild asses were
responsible for their survival in the desert. 5 According to Genesis 36:24,
Cornelius Tacitus Roman historian
and rhetorician, ca. 56-120 a.d.

it was the tribal matriarch Anah, or Hannah, who first found asses in the
wilderness. Balaam's oracular she-ass may have been a manifestation of the spirit of Anah, as Balaam himself was another name for Baal.
Samson slew the Philistines with an ass's jawbone, the same bone still
regarded as a seat of the soul by some African tribes.6 Jesus entered
Jerusalem on an ass's colt, symbol of the New Year. The lilim or
Children of Lilith were ass-haunched, for they were spirits left over
from the real source of the Jewish ass-cult: Egypt, home of the ass
headed god Set, or Seth.
Set once ruled the dynastic gods, and in token of his sovereignty
displayed a pair of ass's ears at the tip of a reed scepter. The Hyksos kings of Egypt revived Set's cult in the 2nd millenium B.C., perhaps
because their own ass-eared Midas was a similar god-king. The annual
alternation of Set and his brother Osiris (or Horus), who murdered each
other in perpetual rivalry for the favors of Isis, reflected constant
replacement of sacred kings in pre-dynastic times. 7 Ass-eared king Midas, a son of Cybele, died of drinking bull's blood. In other words, he was connected with the Taurobolium or bullsacrifice made in honor of both Cybele and Isis. Midas has been
identified with Mita ("Seed"), a king of the Moschians or "calf-men,"
who invaded the country of the Hittites from Thrace during the second millenium B.C. Midas's Golden Touch and ass's ears link him with the
cult of Set and the Golden Calf (Horus), whose image was worshipped
by the Israelites (Exodus 32:2-4). Under Egypt's Hyksos kings, Set was a god of the hot desert wind, known as the Breath of the Ass. He was "Lord of the Chambers of the South," whence storm winds came. 8 His wind from the desert was
supposed to bring pestilence, i.e., typhus, derived from Set's Greek name, Typhon. This name was interlingual and world-wide. It meant
both the ass god and the wind called tufan in Arabic and Hindustani; t'ai
fung in Chinese; and tuffbon or Typhoon in the South Pacific.9
Ass-headed Set was a sacrificial deity in the cult of Horus and
Osiris. He was crucified on a furka and wounded in the side. 10 He and
Horus were represented as alternating year-gods who fought and castrated one another, each being baptized in the blood of the other's
"phallic eye," as the Pyramid Text said: "Horus is purified with the
Eye of his brother Set; Set is purified with the Eye of his brother
Horus." n The Eye or phallus passed from one to the other. A statue
of Horus at Coptos carried Set's severed phallus in his hand. 12 After
castrating Set, Horus spread his blood on the fields to render them
fertile the usual fructification-by-male-blood found in the oldest sacri
ficial Mysteries. 13 Thus, Set and Horus were remnants of a primitive sacred-king
cult, which the Jews adopted. The story of the rival gods appeared in the Bible as Seth's supplanting of the sacrificed shepherd Abel, evidently
68



the same "Good Shepherd" as Osiris-Horus (Genesis 4:25). Their
rivalry was resolved in Egypt by having the pharaoh unite both gods in
himself. Tomb paintings of Rameses IV showed him as both Set and Horus, two heads set upon one neck. 14
Similarly, the Jewish God uniting both Father and Son was
sometimes an ass-headed man crucified on a tree. This was one of the
earliest representations of the Messiah's crucifixion. Some said Christ
was the same as the Jewish ass-god Iao, identified with Set. 15 Jews in
Rome were said to worship an ass's head as their deity. 16
The Roman cult of the ass apparently originated in Libya, home of the bisexual Pales, whose temple stood on the Palatine Hill and gave
rise to the word "palace." 17 Servius said Pales was a Goddess, the Diva
Palatua, a disguise of Vesta. Others said Pales was either a female
protectress of herd animals, or Vesta's male consort. In the first two
centuries a.d., Pales was worshipped as a priapic god at the festival of
the Palilia, traditional date of the founding of Rome, when the Palladi
um was brought to Vesta's temple. 18 Priests of Pales wore ass-head
masks as they danced in honor of the long-eared deity. The Palilia was taken into the Christian calendar as the Feast of St. George. One of
its old customs may have given rise to the Halloween game of "Pin the
Tail on the Donkey," which recalls Rome's sacrifices of equine tails
triumphantly carried to the temple of Vesta. 19

sovereign of the world," tirelessly creating and destroying, eliminating

To the Arabs the Goddess was Athtar, "Venus in the Morning." In Aramaic she was Attar-Samayin, "Morning Star of Heaven," uniting two sexes in herself, like Lucifer the Morning Star and Diana Lucifera. Her Hurrian name was Attart, or sometimes Ishara, another form of Ishtar, "the Star." 4 To Ca
naanites, she was Celestial Ruler, Mis

the old and generating the new. 2 Sidonian kings could not rule
without her permission. Each king styled himself first and foremost
"Priest of Astarte."
Sumerian cylinder seals from Lagash, ca. 2300 B.C., showed the Goddess in a pose identical with Kali's love-and-death sacramental
posture, squatting on top of her consort's body. 5 Astarte ruled all the spirits of the dead who lived in heaven wearing
bodies of light, visible from earth as stars. Hence, she was known as
Astroarche, "Queen of the Stars." 6 She was the mother of all souls in
heaven, the Moon surrounded by her star-children, to whom she gave their "astral" (starry) bodies. Occultists still speak of the astral body
as an invisible double, having forgotten the word's original connota
tion of starlight. 7 Astarte-Ashtoreth was transformed into a devil by Christian writ
ers, who automatically assumed that any deity mentioned in the Bible other than Yahweh was one of the denizens of hell. She was also
masculinized. One finds in books of the 1 5th and 16th centuries a demon Ashtoreth or Astaroth, a "duke" or "prince" of hell. 8 Milton
knew better; he spoke of "Astarte, queen of heaven, with crescent horns." 9
Scholars who really understood the mystery of Astarte recognized
in her one of the ancient prototypes of the virgin Mary. In Syria and
Egypt her sacred dramas celebrated the rebirth of the solar god from the celestial Virgin each 25th of December. A newborn child was
exhibited, while the cry went up that the Virgin had brought forth. Frazer says, "No doubt the Virgin who thus conceived and bore a
son on the twenty-fifth of December was the great Oriental goddess
whom the Semites called the Heavenly Virgin or simply the Heavenly Goddess; in Semitic lands she was a form of Astarte." 10

Astrology
Astrology
Study of the stars has been called "the basis of all intellectual
culture." ' It was highly refined by the Chaldeans, who were simulta
neously astronomers and astrologers. Unlike modern "Chaldeans,"
they were moon worshippers, basing their system almost entirely on the movements of the Moon-goddess. Their zodiac was known as Houses of the Moon.2
Apparently a majority of moon-watchers were women, the priestesses charged with determining correct seasons for planting and
harvest, drawing up calendars, etc. Pliny said the study of the heavens, to foretell events such as eclipses, was traditionally the business of
women. He suspected the priestesses' magic didn't cause eclipses, but rather foresaw them by scientific measurements; yet "the most part
of the common people have been and are of this opinion . . . that all the
same is done by enchantments, and that by the means of some
sorceries and herbs together, both sun and moon may be charmed, and
enforced both to loose and recover their light: to do which feat, women are thought to be more skilful and meet than men." He credited
the Goddesses Medea and Circe with special powers over the lights of heaven. 3
Divination by the lights of heaven was another particular province
of the Moon-goddess and her sybils, the word cognate with the Goddess Cybele and possibly derived from Chaldean subultu, the
Celestial Virgin (the constellation of Virgo).4 An archaic term for
astrological divination was mathesis, "the Learning," literally Motherwisdom. Chaldean astrologers were Mathematici, "learned mothers." 5
As a result of its ancient feminine associations, astrology was viewed as a devilish art by many fathers of the Christian church.
Some thought it indistinguishable from witchcraft. Others respected it.
Origen said the stars are intelligent spirits, able to foresee the future and communicate their knowledge by their observed motions. St.
Thomas Aquinas agreed with this. He said man's fate is the power
exerted by the stars in their movements.6
Savonarola thought it a disgrace, however, that in his day the
church was "wholly governed by astrology," as he said. Every important prelate had his "Chaldean" at his side, determining every
move by the stars.7 St. Jerome said astrology was idolatry. Sts. Gregory,
Ambrose, Chrysostom, Eusebius, and Lactantius all condemned it.
Origen (Origenes Adamantius) Christian father, ca. 185-254
a.d., an Egyptian who wrote in Greek, ex
erting a powerful influence on the early Greek church. At first he was accounted a saint, but three centuries after his death he was declared a heretic because of Gnostic elements found in
his writings.

A curious astrological work claiming Jesuit origin. Full title: Zodiacus Christianus

Peter of Abano
(1250-1318) Renaissance scholar, physician, geomancer, astrologer, and here
tic; an acquaintance of Marco Polo.
St. Augustine said astrology must be expelled from all Christian nations. It was prohibited by the Council of Toledo. 8
Despite all this, the church took astrology to its bosom in the 12th
and 1 3th centuries. Pope Julius II settled the date of his coronation on
the advice of astrologers. Pope Paul III planned the consistory by
horoscopes. Pope Leo X founded a chair of astrology in a major university.9 Signs of the zodiac were associated with the apostles.
Cathedrals were decorated with astrological symbols. The Zodiacus
Christianus compared the zodiac to the stages of Christian life and the
twelve virtues. 10
Peter of Abano was one of the few unbelievers. He openly scoffed
at God, and managed to avoid the Inquisition only by dying at an opportune moment. Toward the end, he remarked that he had devoted
his life to three noble arts: philosophy, which made him subtle;
medicine, which made him rich; and astrology, which made him a liar. 11
Protestants were not as enthusiastic about astrology as Catholics.
Queen Elizabeth I of England disapproved of the Chaldean art, fearing
implications of treason against the royal person in prognosticating the length of her life. Toward the latter part of her reign, she imposed
severe legal penalties for casting royal horoscopes. 12 Protestant leaflets listed among the "sins of the papists" such as "Observation and choice
of days, of planetary hours, of motions and courses of stars
. . . horoscoping, or marking the hours of nativities, witchcrafts, en
chantments, and all such superstitious trumpery." 13 Yet the common people retained many superstitious beliefs based on astrology. The idea that the stars are souls in heaven never really
died out. English peasants were sure that a falling star denoted either a
conception or a birth some said one, some said the other, for none were clear about which moment the soul descended from heaven to
occupy its new body. 14 Because it represented an essence of new life,

Atalanta
Amazonian huntress, the best athlete in Calydon. As an infant, Atalanta was suckled by Artemis herself, in totemic form as a She-Bear.
When she grew up, she took part in the famous hunt of the Calydonian Boar and drew first blood, pausing only to kill two centaurs who
tried to rape her on the hunting field. She was a faster runner than any man. Her suitors had to beat her

in a footrace, or suffer death. Many were killed before one managed
to trick her into losing the race by dropping golden apples to divert her
attention. Some said she and her bridegroom were turned into lions and yoked to the chariot of the Great Mother of the Gods. 1 Phrygian
Cybele always rode in a chariot drawn by two lions, male and female. 1. Graves, CM. 1,264-67.
Atargatis Atheism
Atargatis
Philistine Fish-goddess, called Tirgata in Syria, identified with Aphrodite. At the temple of Der, in Babylon, she was Derceto, "Whale of Der." Her daughter, Queen Semiramis, founded the city of Babylon. 1 She gave rebirth to Jonah in his earlier Babylonian form as the fish-god Oannes. Philistines called him Dagon, Atargatis's mate. At Harran, the Goddess's sacred fish were credited with oracular powers. In Boeotia
she was identified with Artemis who wore a fish amulet over her
genitals. 2 See Fish.

Atheism
Greek a-theos, one who denies the existence of any god. Christian
theologians tended to regard atheism as devilish, though atheism implied disbelief in devils as well as all other supernatural entities.
Oriental thinkers were less simplistic about atheism. The more
advanced sages taught that non-belief can be more "religious" than
belief indeed, atheism may make better human beings than faith can
make. In the east "it is not thought impossible that atheism may be as
profoundly religious as theism, nor is atheism regarded by religious men
as in itself unspiritual. This is extremely hard for a westerner to
understand he does not see that the essence of religion lies in the
religious experience, and not in any belief at all, and that all so-called
religious beliefs or doctrines are merely theories about the religious
experience." ' Evans-Wentz called attention to the same Oriental thought:
" The Fatherhood of God' as a personal and anthropomorphic deity is the cornerstone of Christian theology, but in Buddhism although the Buddha neither denied nor affirmed the existence of a Supreme
Deity it has no place, because, as the Buddha maintained, neither
believing nor not believing in a Supreme God, but self-exertion in right
doing, is essential to comprehending the true nature of life." 2
By these standards, no criminal could be considered religious, no
matter how much faith he professed. Conversely, no person who

Athene treated his fellow-creatures well could be considered irreligious, no
Atlas matter how many gods he denied. Oriental sages viewed theological
mmmm^mj,mam^^ reasoning with a certain contempt, as irrelevant to the behavior that
constitutes true religion: "Mere talk about religion is only an intellec
tual exercise. . . . Of what use are grand phrases about Atma (the soul) on the lips of those who hate and injure one another?
. . . Religion is kindness." 3

Athene
Mother-goddess of Athens, worshipped as Holy Virgin, Athene Parthenia, in the Parthenon, her "Virgin-temple." Though classic writers insisted on her chastity, older traditions gave her several
consorts, such as Hephaestus and Pan. 1 She was united with the phallic
Pallas, whose "Palladium" was a lingam, later Rome's greatest fetish. 2 Athene came from North Africa. She was the Libyan Triple
Goddess Neith, Metis, Medusa, Anath, or Ath-enna. An inscription at Larnax-Lapithou named her Athene in Greek, Anat in Phoenician. 3 Pre-Hellenic myths said she came from the uterus of Lake Tritonis
(Three Queens) in Libya. 4 Egyptians sometimes called Isis Athene, which meant "I have come from myself." 5 Greeks claimed Athene was born from Zeus's head, after he
Sign of Athene swallowed her mother Metis i.e., Medusa, "Female Wisdom,"
formerly symbolized by the Gorgoneum, Athene's snake-haired mask, invested with power to turn men to stone.6 Gorgo, or Gorgon, was
Athene's Destroyer aspect. 7 Funerary statues or phallic pillars were her "men turned to stone," perhaps even identified with the pillars of the Parthenon which was seized by Christians at an unknown date in
the 5th or 6th century a.d. and rededicated as a temple of the virgin
Mary. 8

Atlas
Pre-Hellenic Titan or earth-god, brother of Prometheus, condemned to carry the world on his back because he took part in the
Giants' Revolt against the Olympian gods. This was a re-interpretation of his primary earth-supporting function. As Prometheus was
associated with the Caucasus and Heracles with the "Pillars of
Heracles" in the west, so Atlas was associated with the Atlas Mountains
of Africa indicating that the Titans were originally divine pillars of
the heavens, upholding the world. Atlas might be compared to the
74



Vedic god Vishnu who took the form of a tortoise (Greek Tartarus) Atonement and supported the world on his back.
Atonement
In ancient Mesopotamia the Day of Atonement corresponded to the
beginning of the New Year, when all sins were collectively purged for a
new time-cycle. The Jews' Yom Kippur, Day of Atonement, was based on the Sumero-Babylonian kupparu, an atonement ceremony in which a sheep was ceremonially loaded with all the community's sins, and killed. The sheep was an animal substitute for the man who in
earlier times died as Sin Bearer, Savior, or Good Shepherd that is,
Dumuzi or Tammuz. A ram played the part of Sin Bearer at atonement festivals of
Egypt, which is why Aries the Ram is still the zodiacal sign of the
New Year that began in March, by ancient reckoning. Egyptians called him Amon the ram god; the Jews assimilated him to the paschal lamb
and sacrificed him at Passover.
All over the world, the sheep stood for the shepherd as an
atonement-victim. In China the name Ch'iang, "Shepherd," was
given to war prisoners who provided sacrificial victims. The pictograph for "shepherd" was a man with a knife severing his neck. 1 The dead
shepherd was also called the Son of God. In Samarkand during the 2nd
century B.C., "the Son of God died with the seventh moon ... all the
inhabitants, without distinction, appear dressed in robes of black wool.
They go barefooted, striking their breasts, uttering loud wails and weeping copious tears. Three hundred persons, both men and women,
go about the fields scattering grass, and looking for the remains of the Son of God." 2 Such was a Chinese traveler's impression of the rite
known in Greece as the anagnorisis, search and discovery (see
Drama). Israel's law called for a goat to bear away the sins of the community
to the god Azazel, whom the Syrians called Aziz, "the Lord's
Messenger." 3 Having selected the scape-goat, the priest would "confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their
transgressions in all their sins, putting them on the head of the goat"
(Leviticus 16:21). A first goat was driven away, a second one was killed, for no god would absolve sins without an offering of blood:
"Almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without
shedding of blood there is no remission" (Hebrews 9:22).
As development of the wool industry made it more profitable
to keep sheep alive for their fleeces than to kill them for their meat, the
goat became a more popular sacrificial victim. The animals were
sometimes skinned to produce copious shedding of blood for remission
75



Atonement of sins. An incantation from the Shurpu series gives a magic rationale
for flaying a scape-goat:
^^^^^^^^^^^^m As this goat skin is pulled offand thrown into the fire, and the burning Flame consumes it, and it does not return to its goat, and it is no longer
dyed (with blood), so the oath, the ban, the pain, the misery, the disease, the sickness, the trespass, the misdeed, the crime, the sin, the disease which dwells in my body, my flesh, and my joints, may they be pulled off like this goat skin, and may the ban depart and may I see the light.
4
Early Greek myths evoke primitive totemism with goat gods flayed in atonement for the sins of others. Athene flayed the goat god
Pallas, or Pan, and made her aegis from his skin. 5 Phrygians called
the same god the satyr Marsyas, nailed to a pine tree and flayed in
atonement for a crime against Apollo. In Rome, goats were flayed at
the purification festival of the Lupercalia, where the dying satyr-god Faunus was offered to the Sabine mother-goddess Ops. 6 The old Roman New Year was celebrated at the Ides of March
and called the Mamuralia, carrying another trace of scapegoatsacrifice. A man dressed in goatskins was led through the city in
procession, beaten with rods, and driven away into exile with the
formula, "Out with hunger, in with health and wealth." 7 Ovid said the
March scapegoat was a legendary smith named Mamurius, who forged coins representing each month of the year zodiacal sun
symbols.
Such practices make it clear that scapegoat-sacrifices were formerly human, and the animals replaced human victims. Liturgical formulae
nearly always sent human sins into oblivion along with the sacrificed
animal. Egyptians, killing the bull that represented Osiris, said the whole nation's sins were placed on his head. 8 Animal sacrifice took a
more humane form in Tibet: at the New Year ceremony, three
horses and three dogs were smeared with red paint instead of flayed,
then dedicated to the temple.9
Christian symbolism made Jesus the sacrificial Lamb of God slain
to atone for sin like the paschal lamb. Some early Christian writers
insisted that animal sacrifice came first, and human sacrifice was a later,
"higher" development: "God is a man-eater. For this reason men are
sacrificed to him." 10 Among medieval theologians there was a general
opinion that Jesus's sacrifice was not really effective; only "a few" were saved by the Savior's death. St. Thomas Aquinas and others
claimed the vast majority of people were still doomed to eternal
suffering in hell. 11 Thus the theory of atonement for all time or for all
humanity was actually denied by the same church that propounded it as a basis for worldly power.

Atropos
"Cutter," the third of the Greek trinity of Fates (Moerae). She was
the Destroyer whose function was to cut the thread of life that the first sister spun, and the second one wove. She was usually depicted as an
old woman carrying a pair of shears. Like Kali the Destroyer, she was also worshipped as a Goddess in her own right. In Parthia, the "Virgin-Land," she had her own holy city, Atropatene. Its modern
name is Azerbaijan. 1 l.Thc 173.
Atropos Attis
Attis
The cult of Attis strongly influenced early Christianity. Attis accompanied Cybele, the Great Mother of the Gods,
brought to Rome from Phrygia in 204 B.C. They were established in a
temple on the Vatican hill, where they remained for six centuries. 1 At
first Attis was separated from, and subordinated to, the Goddess,
whom the emperor Augustus regarded as the Supreme Mother of Rome. "The Romans tolerated Attis because, maintaining the tradi
tion of earlier days, they continued to regard Cybele as a national Goddess." 2
Attis was a son of the Goddess's earthly incarnation, the virgin Nana, who miraculously conceived him by eating an almond or a
pomegranate, yonic symbols both. Thus he was a typical "god without a father," the Virgin's son. He grew up to become a sacrificial victim
and Savior, slain to bring salvation to mankind. His body was eaten by
his worshippers in the form of bread. 3 He was resurrected as "The
Most High God, who holds the universe together." 4 His epiphany was
announced with the words, "Hail, Bridegroom, Hail, new Light." 5 Like his priests he was castrated, then crucified on a pine tree, whence
his holy blood poured down to redeem the earth.
Attis's passion was celebrated on the 25th of March, exactly nine
months before the solstitial festival of his birth, the 25th of Decem
ber. The time of his death was also the time of his conception, or
re-conception. To mark the event when Attis entered his mother to
beget his reincarnation, his tree-phallus was carried into her sacred cavern. Thus the virgin mother Nana was actually the Goddess herself: she who was called Inanna by the Sumerians, Mari-Anna by the
Canaanites, Anna Perenna by the Sabines, and Nanna, mother of the
dying god Balder, in northern Europe.6 Christians claimed the same dates for the conception and birth of
their savior. The usual quarrels ensued. The Christians resorted to
their favorite argument, that the devil had established pagan Mysteries
in imitation of Christianity before there was a Christianity. Tertullian

Attis said, "The devil by the mysteries of his idols, imitates even the main
parts of the divine mysteries." 7 ^^^^^^^^^^^ Followers of Attis eventually lost their sacrificial day to the Chris
tians. Justinian ruled that March 25 would be known as the day of
the Annunciation, or Lady Day. Naturally, the day of the Annunciation
was the day of Jesus's conception, so that he, like Attis, could be born nine months later at the winter solstice, as were all gods assimilated
to the sun and called Light of the World.8 March 25 was also the day when Blessed Virgin Juno miraculous
ly conceived her savior-son Mars by eating her own magic lily, which is why March was named after this god and why medieval France called
Lady Day Notre Dame de Mars. The date was officially Christianized by the tenth Council of Toledo in 656 a.d. as the Festival of the
Mother of God. But its symbol remained a pagan sign of the yoni.9
Mars had a Phrygian counterpart, the satyr Marsyas, likewise hung on a tree, and likewise a son of Cybele. It was said that he and Attis were
the same god. 10 The day of Attis's death was Black Friday, or the Day of Blood.
His image was carried to the temple and bound to the tree, escorted
by "reed-bearers" (cannophori) with the reed scepters representing re
generated phalli and new fertility.
11 During the ceremonies, initiates castrated themselves in imitation of the castrated god, and presented
their severed genitals to the Goddess along with those of the gelded bull sacrificed at the Taurobolium. 12 All these male remnants were
deposited in the sacred cave of the Great Mother. 15 The god died and was buried. He descended into the underworld.
On the third day he rose again from the dead. His worshippers were
told: "The god is saved; and for you also will come salvation from your
trials." 14 This day was the Carnival or Hilaria, also known as the Day
of Joy. People danced in the streets and went about in disguise,
indulging in horseplay and casual love affairs. 15 This was the Sun
day; the god arose in glory as the solar deity of a new season. Christians
ever afterward kept Easter Sunday with carnival processions derived
from the mysteries of Attis. Like Christ, Attis arose when "the sun
makes the day for the first time longer than the night." 16
Naassenes of the 3rd century a.d. worshipped Attis as a syncretic
mixture of deities. One of their hymns said, "Of Attis I will sing, of
Rhea's son, not sounding his praises with rolling drums, nor on the reed, nor with the roar of Ida's Curetes, but as the Muse of Phoebus on the
lyre I will blend the strains. Euhoi, Euhan, he is Pan, he is Bacchus, he
is the shepherd of the white constellations." 17
Inscriptions of the 4th century gave Attis the title of Menotyrannus, from Greek tyrannos, "lord," plus Men or Mennu, Osiris as the
resurrected, ithyphallic moon-bull, "the Lord Who Impregnates His Mother." 18
78



Pagans sometimes celebrated the Hilaria at the end of their Holy
Week, bringing it to April 1 and the carnival of the April Fool, or
Carnival King, or Prince of Love, all originally synonymous with Attis.
He was also identified with Green George of the old Roman Palilia,
honored on Easter Monday with sacrificial hanging of the god's effigy
on a sacred tree. People of the 18th century still said the 25th of
March used to be New Year's Day, while April 1 stood at the "octaves" terminating the sacred week. 19
Some Christians claimed Jesus's crucifixion took place on April 1, so the Fool of the April Fool's Day processions became Christ
carrying his cross and enduring the mockery of the mob. But the spring Holy Week was not really Christian. Its origin was a universal Indo
European tradition of extreme antiquity, probably traceable to the Holi
festivals of India which celebrated the rebirth of spring with joyous
orgies. 20

August
Green George Spirit of spring descended from the hero-sacrifice of the Roman Palilia. In Balkan countries
during the Middle Ages and later, he was represented by a youth dressed in green branches and symbolically "sacrificed."
August
Roman month of the oracular Juno Augusta. Oracles were augustae
in the semi-matriarchal "republican" period. The term was later applied
to male priests, then to emperors. An "august" man was one filled with the spirit of the Goddess. 1 Augur, the old name for a seer, meant
"increaser," once referring to the mother-priestess. 2 The first emperor Augustus took his title from the Great Mother of the Gods,
presumed incarnate in his wife Livia Augusta. Their house stood
opposite the temple of the Great Mother, whom Augustus honored as the national Goddess. 3
Among European pagans the month of August began with one of the Goddess's major festivals, Lammas Eve, from Hlaf-mass, "the Feast of Bread." The secret worship of Ops, Ceres, Demeter, or Juno Augusta continued throughout the Middle Ages in the rites addressed to the Lammas corn-mother who ruled the harvest-month.
"For a seventeenth-century Scot to say 'he (or she) was born in
August', was to imply high praise and recognition of a well-skilled
person'. August, the month of the Lammas towers, the month when the Irish dancers moved around the female effigy, was the right time for birth. Then the Lammas moon was at work, on behalf of new
children, and the new harvest." 4 Churchmen repeatedly tried to obliterate the Goddess's connec
tions with her harvest month. It was officially claimed that August

Aurora
"Dawn," a Roman name for Eos, or Mater Matuta, the morningmother of the sun. In the classic pattern, her child was also her consort,
a sacred king sometimes entitled Tithonius, "husband of the Queen
of Day." She made him immortal but forgot to give him eternal youth;
so he became gray and shrunken, finally becoming a cicada, the symbol of the sun's rebirth when cicadas hailed his growing warmth. 1

Sanskrit word for the same soul reincarnated in a new body; the

Axis Mundi
"Axle of the World." Ancient cosmologies pictured the earth as a
globe spinning on a shaft with the ends fastened at the celestial poles.
The axis mundi penetrated the earth at its center, hence it was
usually associated with the cosmic lingam or male principle. Each
nation placed this hub at the center of its own territory. See
Omphalos.
Azazel
"God's Messenger," the deity who received sacrificial goats on the Jewish Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur, New Year). Azazel was not
originally Hebraic, but Syrian. 1 Some rabbinical writings called him Azel,
80



a subversive angel who stole magic secrets from God and gave Azazel
them to Eve, thus bringing about the enlightenment of humanity at the cost of God's wrath. Moslems sometimes gave Azazel's name to the mmm^^^hh^hm
rebellious angel who opposed Allah, though this personage was often
called Iblis, or Shaytan (Satan). 2 During the Middle Ages, Azazel was adopted by Christian de
monologists and made one of the leaders in the pantheon of hell. His
name was often cited by exorcists as that of an active, lively possessor,
befitting his ancient function as a Hermetic-style "messenger."

Baal
Baalat
The serpent god Leviathan (or Levi), the
elephant god Behemoth, and the ass god Pales who gave his
name to Palestine, all emanated from the Far East, as did Abraham or "Father
Brahm," apparently based on Brahma. The Greeks' Adonis was the Semitic Adonai, "the Lord."
Baal
"The Lord" among ancient Semites; consort of Mother Astarte, whose favors he shared with Yamm, the Lord of Death (from Hindu
Yama). Every god was a Baal. The title was introduced into Ireland
via Phoenician colonies in Spain, and became the Irish Bel or Bial, Lord
ofBeltain. 1
Old Testament Jews worshipped many baalim as past or present consorts of the Goddess Zion (Hosea 2:2-8). Yahweh shared these other
gods' temples for a long time, until his priesthood managed to isolate his cult and suppress the others. 2 Some of the baalim revered in Israel
were: Sin, the moon god of Sinai; Molech (Melek), the "king" and sun
god of Tyre; Horus, the Egyptian Golden Calf whose image was made by Aaron; Baal-Peor, a phallic "Lord of the Cleft" (or yoni);
Nehushtan, the "fiery flying serpent" of lightning, made by Moses (2 Kings 18:4); Chemosh, the Babylonian sun god Shamash, incarnate in Samson (or Shams-on, the sun); Melchizedek, the god of Salem; Etana, or Ethan, the Canaanite Eytan who "went up to heaven"; Baal
Rimmon, the Lord of the Pomegranate impersonated by Solomon; Baal-Berith, the Canaanites' "God of the Covenant"; El, or Elias, the sun god Helios to whom Jesus called from the cross; Joseph, Jacob, and Israel, who were not men but tribal gods. 2
Since nearly all gods were sacrificial victims in their earthly
incarnations, Baal may have been derived from Sanskrit Bala or Bali,
a sacrificial offering. 5 The Semitic melek, "king," came from Phoeni
cian molk, a votive offering, because early kings were not only gods but also victims. 4 (See Kingship.)
Baal was often used as the title of a mortal king, especially one
whose reign might be terminated by a ritual sacrifice. In the time of Esarhaddon of Assyria, the king of Tyre was named Baal, or "God." In
the 10th century B.C., kings of Byblos bore names like Yehimilk
(God-king), Abibaal (Father-god), and Baalshamen (Heavenly Father). 5 Baal became a favorite Christian name for a devil, because biblical
writers denounced all the baalim indiscriminately as devils (2 Chroni
cles 1 1:15; 1 Corinthians 10:20; Revelation 9:20). Still, the northern
European cognate Bal, Bel, Bael, or Balder retained the affection of
commoners. 6 Baal was still the patron of the Beltain feast in 18th
century Scotland. To make the crops thrive, Scandinavians burned
his effigy at midsummer in "Balder's Balefires" throughout Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. 7

"Lady," the feminine equivalent of Baal; common Middle-Eastern
title of the Goddess. Also rendered Belit, Belit-ili, or Beltis.

Baal-Hamman
Baal-Berith Baal-Berith
"God of the Covenant," Canaanite lawgiving deity represented by two stone tablets in the temple at Shechem, later taken over by Hebraic * invaders and transferred to the cult of Yahweh. Commandments on
the tablets were based on the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi, received
by the Babylonian king from the god Shamash. 1 These, in turn, were based on the tablets of law given the first god by his Great Mother, Tiamat. 2
Though both tablets and title were claimed by the Judeo-Christian
God, the name of Baal-Berith was attached to a devil, often invoked
by medieval authors on magic, who were apparently unaware that they
called upon the God of the Covenant. Weyer placed Baal-Berith in a
position suiting his ancient function, however. In the royal hierarchy of hell he was Minister of Treaties. 3 Though churchmen had small use
for the heretic Weyer, yet they used this precedent to assign the demonic pact to Baal-Berith. In 1335a witch named Catherine Delort was burned for signing a pact with "the demon Berit." 4

Baal-Gad
Goat- Lord, a Semitic name of Pan, ancestor of the tribe of Gad; also
identified with Azazel, who received annual scapegoat-sacrifices. He was worshipped in a cave at the source of the Jordan. It was said he was fathered by Hermes, and after death he ascended to heaven to become
the constellation Capricorn, the Goat. 1

Canaanite Lord of the Hunt, slain by priestesses of Asherah, who buried him in a bog (earth-womb) and resurrected him after seven years,
the standard term of kingship in primitive Palestine. 1 He was mated to Asherah as Lady of the Pomegranate at Hadad-Rimmon, and his name was borne by two biblical kings, Ben-hadad and Hadad-ezer
(Zechariah 12:11).

Baal-Peor Baal-Zebub
late as 200 a.d. 1 In Elam, the god was Haman, slain as a surrogate for
Marduk (Jewish Mordecai). One version of his sacrificial dramas
appears in the Book of Esther, and eucharistic eating of his body is still
performed through the Purim cakes called hamantaschen.

Baal-Peor
"Lord of the Cleft," Phoenician phallic god coupled with Asherah's
yonic "cleft." Israelites adopted his cult and celebrated sexual rites in his
honor in the tabernacle, until Yahweh's reformers killed the cele
brants (Numbers 25). Baal-Peor's symbol was a palm tree between two
stones, a male-genital symbol recalling the phallic god of Egypt, OsirisMin, whose worshippers prayed to achieve erections "like a palm
tree." '

"Lord of Flies," a god of Ekron in Philistia, to whose oracle King
Ahaziah of Israel sent messengers in quest of healing magic (2 Kings 1:2). Like Hermes Psychopomp, his title meant the same as Lord of Death or Conductor of Souls, because flies were common forms taken
by souls in search of rebirth. Mothers of many mythic heroes
miraculously conceived them by swallowing their souls in fly shape. 1 Etain, legendary Irish queen married to Ochy Airem, and Cu Chulainn are examples from popular Celtic myth.
The Pharisees called Baal-Zebub a "prince of devils," apparently
because it was thought he could cure people possessed by lesser devils
(Matthew 12:24). One or two passing references to this "prince of devils" in the New Testament sufficed to establish Beelzebub as an
alternative name for Satan, and flies as diabolic manifestations in
medieval Christendom.
St. Bernard once exorcised a cloud of flies, which instantly dropped dead at the sound of his holy words and had to be shoveled
out of his church in heaps. 2
Fly-devils were still firmly believed in during the late 16th century. When a young Viennese girl suffered from cramps in 1 583, Jesuit
priests diagnosed her case as demonic possession. After eight weeks of exorcisms, they claimed to have expelled 12,652 demons from the girl.
Her 70-year-old grandmother was accused of harboring these demons as flies in glass jars. The old lady was dragged at a horse's tail to the
stake and burned alive. 3

Babel, Tower of
Ba-Bel, "God's Gate," was the Babylonian heaven-mountain or ziggurat where the god descended from the sky to the Holy of Holies, the genital locus of his mating with Mother Earth. 1 The biblical story of the Tower of Babel "reflects the attitude of
nomads entering the fertile plains of the Delta, beholding with
wonder and dread the soaring towers of Babylonian cities, and despising the multitudes speaking all the various tongues of the ancient Near
East." 2 To the ears of the strangers, diversity of languages was "babble," a word derived from Ba-Bel or its city of Bab-ilani, named after its own man-made Holy Mountain. 5
Babylon's famous Hanging Gardens occupied the seven stages of the ziggurat, to create a Paradise like that of Hindu gods: "Seven
divisions of the world ... on which the seven separate cities and palaces
of the gods are built, amid green woods and murmuring streams, in seven circles placed one above another." The ziggurat restored by
Nebuchadnezzar was a "temple of the seven spheres of the world." It
helped established universal belief in the seven heavens, corresponding
to the seven planetary spheres. Christians and Moslems also adopted this view of the cosmos. The Koran says Allah made seven heavens and
seven underground spheres, the seven hells.4
When ziggurats were abandoned and became ruinous, their mud
brick construction crumbling, later nomadic peoples assumed the
gods were angered by the pride of the elder races and broke down their
heaven-aspiring constructions. The Babel myth is found all over the
world, including India and Mexico. It was familiar in the Greek story of
the giants who piled up mountains to reach heaven. Hindus said it
was not a tower but a great tree that grew up to heaven, angering Brahma, who cut off its branches and threw them down. From each
branch grew a separate wata tree that gave humanity another separate
language. 5 Berossus said the Babylonian heaven-mountain was destroyed by
winds, which blew a diversity of tongues among men. The first part
of this premise was certainly not irrational, since drying and winderosion were major causes of the destruction of mud-brick structures.
Berossus's story surfaced many centuries later in the Armenian myth of
the holy mountain built by giants. It was blown down by winds, while "unknown words were at the same time blown about among men." 6 The same story was told in the western hemisphere. Choctaw
Indians said their own ancestors piled up stones to build a mountain
that would reach heaven, but it was blown down by winds, whereupon
people found themselves speaking different languages. 7 In Central
America the heaven-reaching pyramid of Cholula was built by giants un
der the leadership of Xelhua. The angry gods broke it down with light
ning and sent different, mutually incomprehensible languages to earth. 8

Bacchus
Balder
Bacchus
Roman name for the sacrificial god Dionysus; also known as Bac
chus Liber, or Father Liber, consort of the Goddess Libera. He was
worshipped as the orgiastic deity of wine and vintage-festivals wherever wine grapes were grown throughout the Roman empire. The town of Bacharach in the Rhineland was named for him. Even in the 20th
century, his influence was still supposed to ripen the grapes, and omens
were taken for the vintage from his ancient stone altar on a river
island. 1

Baetyl
Sacred stone containing a deity, the Greek baitulos, Hebrew beth-el, "house of the holy one." Two Goddess-wives of Jehovah in the 5th
century B.C. were called Ashima Baetyl and Anatha Baetyl. 1 The
Bible speaks of Anatha's baetyl as Beth-Anath (Joshua 19:38). Medieval
Cathari still held that God had two wives, named Collam and Colibam. 2

Dough victims The
usual substitute, everywhere in the world, for what used to be cannibalistic offerings in primitive times. Some
times the offerings were man-shaped cakes, supposed to resemble a real man in the eyes of the deity. Sometimes
they were ordinary cakes marked with a
symbol of the sacrifice, like the Christian
host (from Latin hostia, "victim").
Balder
Norwegian name for the god Bel, or Baal, sacrificed as a son of Father Odin. He descended into the womb of Mother Hel, the
Underworld. At doomsday, Ragnarok, he would return to earth in Second Coming. He would establish a new earth and a new heaven
after the passing of the old destructive gods and their world.
Balder's effigy is still burned at Beltain fires in Scotland and
Ireland. Scandinavians knew them as Balder's Balefires. His was the
spirit inhabiting the Beltain cake, an effigy of god-flesh like the Christian host, sometimes man-shaped like the symbolic dough "victims" of the Far East. 1 Such pagan hosts probably gave rise to the living
Gingerbread Man of the fairy tale. 2 Like Heracles, Siegfried, and other solar heros, Balder stood for
the idea of regeneration through cremation. His funeral was the
Viking's dissolution in both fire and water; he was sent to sea on a
burning ship. This was arranged by a Goddess called Hyrrokkin, "Fire-shrunk," one of the Elder Deities. She was a former giantess who
lost her stature by passing through a magic fire. 3

Balkis Balkis
The Queen of Sheba, according to the Koran. Solomon stole his Baphomet
throne from Queen Balkis, the Moslems said. 1 Her name was also ihhh^h^h
rendered Bilqis, or Balqama. The temple of the queens of Sheba at
Marib was Mahram Bilqis: Balkis the Moon-Mother. Solomon was crowned by Bath-sheba, called his "mother" in the Bible; but her name means Daughter of Sheba, so it's possible that Solomon did receive his throne from a Sheban queen. See Solomon and Sheba.
l.deGivry,98.
Banshee
From Gaelic bean-sidhe, "woman of the fairy-mounds." The Irish banshee was a ghostly White Lady whose cry brought death to her
hearers. 1 In Brittany she was the Bandrhude, or bane-druid, or dryad of death. 2 She was identified with Macha, Queen of Phantoms, third
person of the Morrigan's trinity. That is, she was the Crone form of the Goddess, who summoned her children to death. 3
Some said the shriek of the banshee was really the nocturnal call of
the loon, a bird sacred to the Moon-goddess Luna, as its name
suggests. Like the Vila or death-priestess of central Europe, and the Dakini of the Far East, the banshee could be as benevolent as the sacred
women who used to sing the dying gently to sleep. "When the banshee
loves those she calls, the song is a low, soft chant giving notice,
indeed, of the proximity of death but with a tenderness of tone that
reassures the one destined to die and comforts the survivors; rather a
welcome than a warning." 4 To others, she came like a bad death, full of
horror.

Baphomet
Bisexual idol or talking head allegedly worshipped by the Knights Templar when they were accused of heresy in the 14th century. Several derivations of the name Baphomet have been suggested. Some said it was Arabic abu-fihamat, "Father of Wisdom," the old title
of an oracular head. 1 Some said it was a corruption of Mohammed.
Some traced it to Baphe Meteos, "baptism of Metis," that is, of the Gnostic Goddess as Lady of Wisdom. It was a name well known
among Gnostic sects in the east. 2 Because Baphomet was supposed to
be the object of the Templars' "devil worship," it or he or she was

Baptism
In 418 a.d., a Catholic church council decided that every human
child is born demonic as a result of its sexual conception, thus automati
cally damned unless baptized. 1 During a Catholic baptismal ceremony the priest still addresses the baby, "I exorcise thee, thou
unclean spirit. . . . Hear thy doom, O Devil accursed, Satan accursed!" 2 The exorcism is euphemistically described as "a means to
remove impediments to grace resulting from the effects of original sin and the power of Satan over fallen nature." 3 But it is obvious from the
folk belief still widespread, that the church's teaching was that every
newborn infant before baptism belonged to the devil. 4 St. Augustine's doctrine of original sin laid the foundation for this idea, and Tertul
lian said every baby is born evil; its soul is "unclean" and "actively
sinful" before baptism. 5 Medieval theologians held that any infant still
in the womb is doomed to eternal damnation.6 The Oedipal jealousies
of men apparently developed these ideas, since few women would
have pictured babies screaming in an eternity of torture in hellfire, simply because no priest had sprinkled them with water before they
perished. Indeed, priests refused to baptize a child within forty days of its birth, for both mother and infant were considered impure (hence too
dangerous for priests to touch) during that period. "An unbaptized child, as well as a woman between childbirth and churching, was designated as heathen." 7 The real reason for this "heathenism" appears
in numerous folk beliefs: it was the birth magic of the ancient
Goddess that claimed both women and their infants in the performance
of her Mysteries. In the north it is still said that children dying
unbaptized go to Frau Holda, or Hel, or Perchta, the underground Mother. 8 In the Hebrides, the Goddess's protective ritual is still used
to preserve children during the perilous pre-baptismal period: a torch is daily carried around the cradle as in old pre-Christian custom.9 Some
traditional ballads deny the Catholic doctrine that women dying in
childbed or infants dying unbaptized must go to hell; they claim, rather, that such individuals pass into a pagan heaven. Mexican peasants
still say they go to "a place of delight in the temple of the sun." 10
Thus, paganism was kinder to infants and their mothers than
Christianity, so that theologians often felt called upon to explain
God's apparent cruelty in allowing infants to die unbaptized, so condemning them before they had a chance for salvation. In the 16th
and 17th centuries, churchmen insisted that God's cruelty was perfectly
just. Said Martin Del Rio, S.J.: "If, as is not uncommon, God permits
90



children to be killed before they have been baptized, it is to prevent their Barabbas
committing in later life those sins which would make their damnation Barbara, Saint more severe. In this, God is neither cruel nor unjust, since, by the mere ^^^^^^^^^^
fact of original sin, the children have already merited death." n
It was customary to refuse baptism altogether to those thought to have been conceived out of wedlock, or sinfully. American churchmen often refused to baptize children born on Sunday, because it was thought children were always born on the same day of the week as
their conception, and marital relations on Sunday were forbidden. 12
Modern theologians have trouble explaining why baptism should
be necessary. Few educated parents seriously believe their infants are doomed to eternal torture unless splashed with a little water in a church.
The biblical "fall" that provided the original rationale has long since
been relegated to the realm of myth. 13 The primitive notion of the
public name-giving ritual seems to be all that is left to justify the
formalities: no more than an excuse for people to dress up and get
together, to celebrate a new life in the clan. Perhaps it should be
remembered that this function was once the exclusive concern of mothers and Goddesses.

Barabbas
'Son of the Father," released from prison in Jesus's place, according to Luke 23:18. But Barabbas was another title of a sacred king, thus
some scholars believe it was applied to Jesus himself, when he was
"released" from the protection of Rome and handed over to Jewish
priests for their Passover sacrifice. See Jesus Christ.
Barbara, Saint
Sancta Barbara, "the Divine Barbarian," a loosely Christianized
pagan Goddess in her sacred mountain, either the Venusberg, the Horselberg, or the Round Mountain near Pozzuoli where she was
worshipped under this particular title. Within the mountain dwelt the heathen dead, "bewitched men and women" who spent their time in
dancing, lovemaking, and other pleasures until the day of doom. 1 In other words, St. Barbara was none other than the Fairy Queen. As a spurious martyr, Barbara followed the usual pattern: she was a
beautiful virgin, tortured by her evil pagan father to make her renounce Christianity. She remained steadfast, so her father killed her.
Then God struck the father dead with a lightning bolt, unfortunately
a few minutes too late to save Barbara. This was supposed to have taken

curious association, St. Barbara was invoked to provide protection from
lightning. 5

Bartholomew, Saint
Pseudo-saint based on a sacred king's title: Bar-Tholomeus, "son of
Ptolemy." He was inserted into the Gospels as an apostle, but hagiographers gave him a different origin. He was called a son of "Prince
Ptolomeus," crucified in Armenia, and flayed like the satyr Marsyas (see Mars). Icons showed him holding a moon-sickle, the sacrificial knife of the Middle East. 1
An alternative history made Bartholomew a missionary to India, where he overthrew the idols of the oddly non-Indian deities Astarte
and Baal-Berith. With many miracles, Bartholomew converted the
king of that country to Christianity, but the king's brother was
unaccountably permitted to crucify, flay, and behead the saint afterward. 2
Spurious relics of the saint were installed in the Roman healing
shrine of Asclepius, which was taken over by Christians and remained
the Hospital of San Bartolommeo up to the 20th century.*

Basilisk
"King Serpent," the mythical snake of the poisonous glance, listed as a real creature in European bestiaries up to the 1 8th century. Like the
Gorgon head, whose glance was equally poisonous, the basilisk was closely linked with women's menstrual blood. As the serpent-haired Gorgon head represented women's "wise blood" and guarded men
strual mysteries that men were forbidden to behold, so there was a
popular medieval belief that a hair taken from the head of a menstru
ating woman and buried in the earth would turn into a serpent or
basilisk. 1 Superstitious folk supposed that all the serpents on the Gorgon's head were basilisks, which derived their evil eyes from her
own deadly glance.

Bassareus
Lydian fox god, a totemic form of Orpheus or Dionysus, whose Maenads were sometimes called Bassarids because they wore fox
92



skins. 1 As a pagan deity, the fox became the popular trickster-hero of
medieval folklore, where he appeared as Reynard or Renaud. He was actually worshipped in Cologne cathedral and in Westphalia in the
9th century a.d. 2 See Dog.

Bast Beans
Bast
Egyptian cat goddess, mother of all cats, which were Egypt's most
sacred animals. Bast's holy city Bubastis was said to possess the land's greatest temple. Herodotus said that in Egypt, "All cats that die are
carried to certain sacred houses, where being first embalmed, they are
buried in the city of Bubastis." ' The Greeks identified Bast with Artemis or Diana, also called the mother of cats, and claimed the great
shrine of Bubastis was built in her honor. 2 The cat's legendary nine
lives stemmed from Artemis as the mother of the nine Muses, corre
sponding to the Egyptian Ennead of nine primordial deities. See Cat.

Beans
Like barley grains in Greece, beans were yonic symbols in Rome, as is still shown by the Italian slang term for female genitals, fava, "bean." *
Along with all other ancient female-genital symbols, beans were credited with magic power to impregnate, because they enclosed ancestral spirits, the manes, born in dim prehistory of the Moon-mother Mana.
The Pythagoreans placed a taboo on eating beans because of their
supposed possession of spirits. In Rome, each paterfamilias went through an annual ceremony of exorcising ancestral spirits by throwing beans behind him at midnight, nine times enjoining the manes to leave the house. 2
Another Roman ceremony on the twelfth day after the midwinter
solstice (Epiphany) recalled ancient customs of choosing a sacred
king. It was called the Festival of Kings Created or Elected by Beans,
the beans evidently representing women, the choosing carried out by drawing black or white beans. Later, dice were used, and a ceremonial
king-for-the-night called Basilicus was chosen by the "Venus" throw.
The ceremony persisted in medieval England, where the TwelfthNight plum cake contained one bean, and the man who received the bean was declared king of the festival. 3
Some overlapping esoteric meanings of beans may be found in the
Sanskrit word mudra, "kidney beans," also "woman," and a "magical gesture," the benevolent spell cast by a Shakti.4 The influx of Tantric
symbols into medieval Europe probably gave rise to Jack's beanstalk, resembling the Ladder of Heaven in that it was a soul-bridge: "the myth

Beata
"Holy woman," Spanish term for a white witch, often a hermitess
distinguished by her visions, trances, stigmata, miraculous cures, etc. The church didn't know what to do with such people. Sometimes, if they became famous enough, they were canonized as saints. Sometimes
they were persecuted for heresy and witchcraft.
Beelzebub
See Baal-zebub.
Behemoth
Biblical name of the Indian elephant god Ganesha, the "Lord of
Hosts." ' His title was adopted by the Jewish Jehovah, during the period when he was married to the Virgin Goddess Anath, or Neith, in the
temple of Elephantine in Egypt. Jewish mercenaries stationed there wor
shipped the elephant-headed, virgin-born Lord of Hosts as their own Yaho (or, Yahweh). 2 At the time, the Jewish God was a subordinate spouse of the Goddess who was hailed as "Queen of Heaven and
mistress of all the gods." 3
The same Virgin Goddess was the mother, as well as the bride, of
the elephant bull-god, according to the standard myth of divine incest created by identification of Father and Son. In India the mother of Ganesha was Parvati, virgin form of Kali. She made him from her
own "body-dew" (menstrual blood). A true archetypal son, he guarded her "gate" (yoni) against the entrance of All-father Shiva. For this
Oedipal offense he was slain, but resurrected. 4 Upon the same virgin mother under her other name of Maya (comparable to Mari, the other name of Anath), he begot the next incarnation of the Son of the
Lord of Hosts: Buddha, the Enlightened One.
The elephant-god was not forgotten by the Jews, but he was dissociated from the later concept of Yahweh, and diabolized. He became the demon Behemoth. In this guise he appeared in medieval
demonologies and grimoires, still wearing the elephant head of ShivaGanesha. 5
Yet traces of the earlier divine elephant could be found in Jewish
tradition. Rabbinical sources said the Passover feast commemorated more than one god. The lamb stood for the Firstborn. The fish
represented Leviathan, the original wise serpent-deity of Levites.

Benedict, Saint
An ancient shrine of the sun god Apollo on Monte Cassino was taken
over and converted into a Christian monastery. The "St. Benedict" to
whom it was dedicated was really Apollo Benedictus, the "Goodspeaker." ' Even Catholic scholars say there is no evidence that "St.
Benedict" was ever a Christian priest. However, his legend did assimilate him to the sun god. When Benedict prayed, "the whole world seemed to be gathered into one sunbeam and brought thus before his
eyes." 2

Berserker
A wearer of the "bear sark" or bearskin shirt; a Nordic warrior
dedicated to the Goddess Ursel, the She-Bear (see Ursula). Through
wearing the bear's skin, a warrior acquired the bear's fighting spirit and the grace of the ursine Goddess who was often a teacher of the
martial arts. "Berserk" came to mean one possessed by battle-frenzy,
careless of his own safety, unable to feel fear. Totemic descent from the She-Bear characterized several old
European clans. The Orsini or Ursini family were "bear's children,"
carrying a bear on their coat of arms. William of Auvergne, bishop of
Paris in the 16th century, solemnly explained the origin of the Orsinis by saying a bear's semen is very like a man's, therefore it was quite
possible for a bear to beget human children, presumably on a human
95



Bible mother. 1 The story reflects contemporary theological opinion that only a male can be a true parent. Nothing was said about a she-bear's
^^^^^^^^^^^m ovum being like a woman's, nor was there a human father who might
have begotten children on a bear mother.

Bible
This word for a holy book came from Byblos, the City of the Great
Mother, the oldest continuously occupied temple in the world. The Goddess called Astarte, Baalat, Hathor, etc. patronized learning, and her priestesses collected a library of papyrus scrolls. Therefore, Greeks called any papyrus byblos, which came to mean any holy book. Hence the "Bible." '
Scholars have found in the Bible's numerous layers of additions
and corrections a substrate of the former Semitic matriarchy, such as
the Book of Ruth with its matrilineal and matrilocal marriage customs,
and the Book of Judges with its feminine government of Israel
(Judges 4:4). In several books the word translated "God" is really a
feminine plural, "Goddesses," especially in reference to the matriar
chal functions of lawgiving, avenging crimes, and bestowing the
imperium of leadership. 2 Some of the miracles attributed to biblical heroes were copied from
older myths of the Goddess. Joshua's arrest of the sun was formerly
credited to priestesses of Isis, Hecate, and the Thessalian Great Mother,
who were said to stop heavenly bodies in their courses, and lengthen
night or day at will. 3 Moses's flowering rod, river of blood, and tablets of the law were all symbols of the ancient Goddess. His miracle of
drawing water from a rock was first performed by Mother Rhea after she
gave birth to Zeus, and by Atalanta with the help of Artemis. 4 His
miracle of drying up waters to travel dry-shod was earlier performed by
Isis, or Hathor, on her way to Byblos. 5 The greatest mistake of religious authorities in the western
world was their view of the Bible as intrinsically different from other
ancient scriptures, in that it was dictated word for word by God, not
collected slowly, rewritten and mis-written, revised and worked over by
human beings for a long time. The notion that the Bible did not
evolve haphazardly, like most other holy writings of the same period,
persisted almost up to the present day, even among people who should have known better.
According to the prevailing myth of biblical origins, the Old Testament was supposed to have been translated from Hebrew to
Greek by seventy-two translators sent to Ptolemy by Eleazar, a Jewish
high priest, in the 3rd century B.C., hence its name, Septuagint. Ptolemy locked the scholars in individual cells on the island Pharos,
where each one made his own Greek version in exactly seventy-two
96



days. Each translation agreed exactly, in every word, with the other seventy-one translations.
Of course this never happened. The Bible's real history was far less
tidy. A collection appeared in the first century b.c. and again in the
first century a.d. to be accepted by the Jews of the Diaspora as sacred,
and passed on to Christians. In both Jewish and Christian hands the
papyri underwent many changes. In the 4th century a.d., St. Jerome
collected some Hebrew manuscripts and edited them to produce the
Latin Vulgate, a Bible of considerable inaccuracy, differing markedly
from Jerome's stem texts.
The King James Bible relied mostly on a Greek text collected and edited by Erasmus in the 16th century, which in turn relied on a
Byzantine collection assembled gradually at Constantinople between
the 4th and 8th centuries. A few older texts have been discovered: the
Codex Sinaiticus, the Codex Vaticanus, the Codex Alexandrinus, and
the Chester Beatty papyri. All are fragmentary, all differ from one another and from the King James version. There are no known portions of the Bible older than the 4th century a.d. 6
The Revised Version of the New Testament published in 1881
tried to correct some of the more glaring errors. It erased the spurious
final twelve verses of Mark, which were late interpolations including the
words that caused centuries of suffering: "He that believeth not shall be damned." It eliminated the fraudulent translation "Joseph and his
mother," intended to preserve the dogma of the virgin birth, and restored the original "his father and his mother." It omitted the forged
interpolation intended to preserve the dogma of the trinity: "For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and
the Holy Ghost: and these three are one." These words appeared
nowhere before the 1 5th century a.d. However, the Catholic church
insisted on retaining the forgery. Churchmen's argument was: "How, if these verses were an interpolation, could the Holy Spirit, who guides and directs the Church, have allowed her to regard this lofty affirma
tion of the Trinity as authentic, and permitted its insertion in the official
edition of the sacred books?" In 1897 the Congregation of the Index,
with the approval of Pope Leo XIII, forbade any further research into
the origins of this text. 7
Traditionally, the church forbade not only research but even
reading of the Bible by laymen. Throughout the Middle Ages, possession of a Bible written in the vernacular was a crime punished by
burning at the stake. 8 With the Reformation came Bible-reading in
search of a new basis for faith; but in the process were found many new
grounds for skepticism. Richard Simon's 17th-century Critical History ofthe Old Testament exhibited the now well-known internal evidence that the books of Moses were not written by Moses but were compiled by many hands
at a much later date. Bishop Bossuet pronounced this work of
scholarship "a mass of impieties," drove its author out of the Oratory,

and ordered the entire first edition burned. Dr. Alexander Geddes, a
Catholic scholar, translated the Old Testament in 1792 with a critical volume proving that the Pentateuch could not have been written by Moses, nor at any time prior to the reign of David. He was denounced as "a would-be corrector of the Holy Ghost."9
As the years passed, it became increasingly clear that the Holy Ghost needed correcting. Seven clerical scholars published Essays and Reviews in 1860, defining the new science of Bible criticism. They
were denounced, and two were suspended from office; but they took their case to court, and won. In 1 869 Kuenen's The Religion ofIsrael
established Bible criticism as a valid field of investigation. He was
followed by many others in Holland, Germany, and France. In 1889
the book of biblical essays called Lux Mundi gave up all pretense of
the scriptures' historicity or divine inspiration, admitting that the Bible is a confused mass of myth, legend, and garbled history, often contra
dicting provable facts. 10 Naturally, there was constant opposition to the efforts of the
scholars. Many 19th-century churchmen insisted that the Bible's only author was God. Dean Burgon said, "The Bible is the very utterance of the Eternal; as much God's own word as if high heaven were open and we heard God speaking to us with human voice. Every book is in
spired alike, and is inspired entirely." Dr. Baylee said the Bible is "infallibly accurate; all its histories and narrations of every kind are
without any inaccuracy." Dr. Hodge declared that the books of the
Bible are "one and all, in thought and verbal expression, in substance, and in form, wholly the work of God, conveying with absolute
accuracy and divine authority all that God meant to convey without human additions and admixtures." 11 Apparently none of these gen
tlemen were familiar with the earlier contradictory texts; nor had they
read the Bible closely enough to see the many passages where God
contradicted himself.
The real point was that organized religions had an economic
interest in maintaining literal interpretation of biblical myths. Guignebert says, "The doctrine of the inerrancy of the Bible . . . necessarily
placed theology in an attitude of surly and sanguinary hostility toward the exact and experimental sciences, which it will not abandon save
most reluctantly and after as much delay as possible. . . . [Mjethods have changed, the illusions still current have decreased, but its spirit is
scarcely altered." 12
When the theologians began to give in, they complained that viewing the Bible as myth would destroy the whole structure that
their livelihood and self-respect depended on. After David Straus's
Lebenjesu disposed of the historicity of the Gospel stories, and Renan's Vie de Jesus showed that the Gospels cannot be taken as literal
truth but only as romantic symbolism, the Rev. Maurice Jones
exclaimed, "If the Christ-Myth theory is true, and if Jesus never lived,
98



the whole civilized world has for close upon two thousand years lain Bible
under the spell of a lie." 13 The Archbishop of Canterbury found it
impossible to deny the Bible's apparent lies, and began to backtrack _.
with his plaintive question, "May not the Holy Spirit make use of myth
and legend?" 14 Obviously the Bible was full of myths and legends, but most
orthodox theologians had no idea of their meaning. One reason was
that they didn't study the corresponding myths and legends of other cultures ancient paganism, modern mysticism, the non-Christian beliefs of people both civilized and uncivilized throughout the rest of
the world. Christian missionaries thought theirs was the only pipeline
to divinity, the deities of all other people throughout the world were devils, and the myths of the Bible were absolutely true whereas all
other myths were absolutely false.
Nowadays such crude beliefs seem no less superstitious than the primitive animisnvthat the missionaries sought to destroy. Yet an
even darker blot on the history of Christian missions was their arrogant
vandalism burning books and artworks, smashing images, forbidding the songs and poems of heathen tradition instead of listening and
recording them in order to understand the people, to display a decent
respect for what alien races held sacred, as the pagan Romans did in the
days of their empire. It may well have been that, had the missionaries
been willing to listen and learn, they would have discovered the
mythology of the Bible all over again in other offshoots from its
original sources; for all peoples, nearly everywhere in the world, shared
the same fables of the creation, the flood, the magic garden with its
tree of life and its primal couple, the wise serpent, the heaven-piercing tower, the divided waters, the chosen people, the virgin mothers, the saviors, and all the rest. It has been said both testaments of the Bible are
only recent and relatively corrupt derivations from a world-wide cycle
of archetypal myths. 15 Least of all were righteous Christians prepared to understand
that their awe of the Bible rested on a foundation of magical supersti
tion: it was, and is, a fetish. Legal oaths were taken in physical contact
with a Bible because of a very primitive belief in its destructive mana,
which would automatically punish perjurors. Both Jews and Christians used their Bible for divination, just as a witch might use a crystal
ball, an African might use a thunder-stone, or a Roman augur might use the sacred chickens. Bibliomancy (taking omens from the Bible) was sometimes deplored, but from the 4th to the 14th centuries was
"repeatedly practiced by Kings, Bishops, and Saints." 16 St. Augustine frankly recommended taking omens from the Bible "in all cases of
spiritual difficulty." 17 Even in this "enlightened" age, in both Europe and America, the Bible is still used to give omens. 18
A favorite biblical method for discovering a thief easily lent itself to conscious legerdemain. The name of the accused was written on a

piece of paper and inserted into the hollow end of a key, which was put
into the Bible's pages. The diviner recited Psalm 50:18: "When thou
sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker
with adulterers." The guilt of the accused was proven if the key was
found turned around afterward. 19
Despite the many discoveries and clarifications made by biblical
scholars in the last century or so, the average Christian's attitude
toward the Bible is still hardly more sophisticated than this simple
minded magic. Most churchmen see to it that their congregations are
not told the true origins of biblical myths. The most primitive or
unattractive of these are constantly re-interpreted as deep allegories or metaphorical fables, intended by their divine author to wait two
thousand years or more for a correct explanation. Yet the real
explanation of the sources of these stories, uncovered by the careful
researches of the higher critics, is seldom mentioned. Likewise
ignored are many of the truly awkward passages such as "Thou shalt not
suffer a witch to live," or God's frequent commands to wage merciless war, which no amount of exegesis can fit into a more tolerant
ethic. 20
Erroneous but traditional views of Bible origins and meanings are
doggedly preserved by male chauvinists in particular, since the canonical books were deliberately selected and edited to wipe out all
feminine images of divinity and sanction religious suppression of women. Robert Ingersoll pointed out that "As long as woman regards the Bible as the charter of her rights, she will be the slave of man." Jo
sephine Henry grumbled, "The Bible records that God created woman
by a method different from that employed in bringing into life any
other creature, then cursed her for seeking knowledge." Elizabeth
Stanton said there is no escape from the Bible's "degrading teaching" as to the position of women, and advised women to boycott churches. "It is not commendable for women to get up fairs and donation
parties for churches in which the gifted of their sex may neither pray,
preach, share in the offices and honors, nor have a voice in the
business affairs, creeds and discipline, and from whose altars come forth
Biblical interpretations in favor of woman's subjection." 21 One of the erroneous notions that still keep Christian women
shackled to their Bible-based "inferior" image is the notion that
Christianity was founded on the New Testament, when in fact the early churches had no Gospels but rather created and produced their
own. 22 Not only did churchmen falsely pretend an apostolic origin for their scriptures; they also weeded out all references to female author
ity or participation in Christian origins. 23 Only the forbidden Gnostic
Gospels retained hints that Jesus had 12 female disciples corresponding to the 12 male disciples, or that Mary Magdalene was the leader of
them all. Even women's scholarship was denied. St. Jerome openly admitted that his co-authors of the Vulgate were two learned women;

but later scholars erased the women's names and substituted the words "venerable brothers." 24

Birds
Birds
From very early times there was a universal Indo-European belief that souls could take the form of birds. Latin aves meant both "birds"
and "ancestral spirits," or ghosts, or angels. Roman emperors achieved godhood in the form of an eagle which was released above an
emperor's funeral pyre to carry his soul to heaven. 1
Similarly, an Egyptian pharaoh's spirit rode aloft, on, or in, the solar hawk of Horus released at his funeral. Like Phoenix, he passed through the Fire and
was reborn with wings. Based on such prototypes, the souls of Christian saints ascended to heaven in the form of white doves released at the canonization ceremony. 2
Becoming a bird in a visionary or trance state was a widespread symbol of initiatory death and rebirth. Shamans and prophets in the
South Pacific, Indonesia, Central Asia, and Siberia claimed to transform
themselves into birds. Buddhist yogis said ecstatic flight was the first
magical power to be developed by the practice of yoga. "Becoming a bird oneself or being accompanied by a bird indicates the capacity,
while still alive, to undertake the ecstatic journey to the sky and
beyond." 3 Celtic "fays" or "fairies" could change themselves into
birds, which is why they were depicted with wings like angels, and why witches "flew" to the Sabbat.4
The Chinese said women knew the secret of flying before men
did. The emperor Shun first learned it from two princesses. "Down
to a certain date the source of magical power lay in women ... an
indication of an ancient Chinese matriarchy." In northern Europe
also, the Goddess Freya owned all the magic feather garments that
enabled magicians to fly through the air like birds. 5 The elaborate
feather garments of Mayan and Aztec priesthoods probably had the
same original function, to facilitate their soul-flights. Because birds traveled freely between the earthly and heavenly
realms, they were everywhere regarded as angelic messengers, givers of omens, possessors of occult secrets, as well as soul-carriers. Carrion
crows and vultures took souls to heaven. Storks brought them back to
earth for rebirth. Wise owls told the secrets of the night; lustful doves
and nightingales told the secrets of love. Angelic eagles foretold the
future.

Birds
Philo Judaeus (ca. 30 B.c-40 a.d.) Alexandrian
Jewish philosopher, strongly influenced by Hellenistic Platonism,
Pythagoreanism, and Stoicism; author of biblical commentaries, tracts, and histories.
Myths repeatedly credit seers with power to understand the lan
guage of birds, usually because sacred serpents licked their ears to
"open" them, as in the case of the Trojan prophetess Cassandra.6 Siegfried likewise obtained the power to understand birds, via the
magic blood of the Great Serpent or dragon. A bird call, a magic formula, and singing were expressed by the same word in Germanic
languages. 7 The magpie was especially revered as an oracle. It was a picus
(pecker) sacred to the Goddess Mag, or Magog, eponymous ancestress of Scythian Magnetes, the Amazonian centaurs credited with
prophetic powers. 8 In Rome, the magpie or woodpecker was a totemic form of the god Mars, said to contain his soul between his
incarnations as Maris or Faunus.
In Egypt the hawk represented the soul of Horus and of the
pharaoh who embodied him. Hawks came to stand for that portion of
every soul called the ba, which could come and go at will after death,
flying freely in and out of the tomb. Narrow shafts were left open in pit
graves for the passage of the ba. Similar shafts in pyramids, sometimes
misconstrued as ventilation shafts, were originally intended to let the
bird-soul of the deceased fly in and out.9
The bird-soul born out of the cremated body entered Egyptian
mythology as the Phoenix, sometimes a man, sometimes a firebird.
The name was Greek, meaning "the Phoenician," a reference to
sacrificed sacred kings of Astarte at Byblos, where they were frequent
ly burned. 10 The cult moved to North Africa with Phoenician colonists,
and was carried on at Carthage where sacred kings perished in flames
to a very late date. 11 Their bird-souls, reborn from the flames and flying
to heaven, gave rise to the myth of the Egyptian Phoenix who
periodically cremated himself and rose again from his ashes. His
worshippers, identified with the god through his sacraments, partook
of the same power of heavenly flight. A common expression for death
was "flying away." Philo wrote of the sages' soul-flights: "They accompany in thought the Moon and Sun in their circuitings, the choirs of other planets and
fixed stars, attached below to the ground by their bodies, but giving
wings to their souls, so that, walking on the ether, they contemplate the powers they find there." Still known today as the yogic trance or out-of
body experience, the soul-flight was often described in medieval
books on Hermetic magic: "Nothing can obstruct, neither the Sun's fire nor the Ether nor the heaven's revolution nor the bodies of other
stars; but, cutting across all space, the soul will ascend in its flight up to
the furthest heavenly body." 12 Bird lore has always clearly expressed man's envy of the power of flight and his longing to know what the
world looks like from high in the sky.

Birth Control Birth Control
Transition from matriarchal to patriarchal societies usually destroyed
the natural mammalian system of birth control practiced by animals and ""^"^^^^"
primitive people: women used to refuse sexual relations during
pregnancy and lactation, a period lasting anywhere from two to six years
for each child. The system is still followed in some parts of the world.
Among the Hunza, pregnant or nursing women do not sleep with their husbands. The Semai of Malaya think it correct to forbid sex during
the long nursing period, as this allows parents to space their children and give adequate care to each one. 1 Even in an aggressive male
dominated society like the Yanomamo, men say they are afraid to have sexual intercourse with a nursing mother.
Sometimes modern people insult the animals by calling a human
rapist an "animal." Animals don't rape. Sexual intercourse takes place
only when the female is receptive. When she is preoccupied with caring for her young always her first priority the female shows no sexual
interest in the male. Should he be so ill-advised as to make sexual
displays to her, she drives him away with bared teeth.
There is among animals no question ofthe use offorce on the part
ofthe male; the conjunction of the sexes is dependent upon the willingness ofthe female. . . . And the female sexual instincts are subject
to frequent and prolonged natural suspensions which do not always correspond with the operation of those instincts in the male. Among all
herbivores the females, as soon as they are pregnant, retire from the
company ofthe males to seek either complete seclusion and solitude, or to collect in herds from which the males are excluded. Female elephants drive away all males from the herds ofcows and calves not only during the
long pregnancy ofnearly two years, but throughout the period of lactation. The behavior is typical ofanimal females. Had the primitive
human female admitted the male during menstruation, pregnancy, and
lactation she would have departed from all biological precedents; her behavior would have constituted an abnormality. 2
Many early records show that human females did not depart
from biological precedent. Hippocrates and Galen supported the ancient taboo on sex during pregnancy and lactation. There was a curious remnant of the taboo even in a popular marriage manual of the early 20th century, part of the vast body of sexual misinformation that
our grandparents struggled with. The author declared that marital
relations during pregnancy would make the child epileptic.
3
In most primitive societies it was unthinkable that male sexual
desires should take precedence over the needs of mothers and their
children. 4 Patriarchy everywhere sought to change this, through reli
gious sanction. Women were to serve men's sexual urges even when
preoccupied with motherhood. This was the meaning of God's an
nouncement to Eve: "I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire
shall be subject to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee"
103



Birth Control (Genesis 3:16). In this context, "sorrow" meant labor pangs, as well as
the harried life of a mother with children too close together, and the
^^^^^^^^^^^m illnesses and injuries caused by spreading a mother's care too thin.
The Christian canon omitted the First Book of Adam and Eve,
which contradicted the canonical scripture by stating that Eve stuck
to the old system of birth control after all. She gave birth to Cain
and his twin sister Luluwa, another incarnation of the lilu or "lily"
who was also Eve's predecessor Lilith. Then "when the days of
nursing the children were ended" but not until then "Eve again
conceived." She produced Abel and his twin sister. After Abel was
killed at the age of 15 years, Eve produced Seth to replace him.
"After the birth of these, Eve ceased from childbearing." 5 Thus the entire human race descended from these four: Cain, Seth, and their
sisters. According to this version of the story, Eve was not particu
larly troubled by God's curse.
However, later Judeo-Christian culture insisted on men's con
trol of women's bodies. Wives were not to initiate sexual relations, but
they were never to deny their husbands. The Catholic church laid down the law that no wife could accuse her husband of rape even if he
forced her with accompanying brutality. Sexual "release" was his
conjugal right (but not hers). The church interpreted the fable of Genesis as God's mandate to
compel women to bear as many children as possible, even at the cost
of the children's or the mothers' physical health and welfare. 6 Men
refused to deal with the problem of over-production, and women were forbidden to do so, by the church's tradition. In pagan times,
women used some fairly effective birth-control devices, ranging from
vaginal sponges to abortifacient drugs. Many churchmen believed the
witches inherited secret knowledge of such things, which contributed
to the vigor of witch- and midwife-persecutions. Father Dominic Pruemmer recently wrote in American Freedom and Catholic Power: "Birth control is nothing else than mutual
masturbation or unnatural lust." 7 It is not usual to view the "lust"
of marital partners for each other as unnatural. Nor did the church ever
object to sex as masturbation when it was for a husband's benefit
only that is, not mutually satisfying. In fact church-sanctioned litera
ture of the 1 7th century said the only purpose of marital sex must be
conception, and if a woman receives too much pleasure she cannot conceive. 8
The church further taught women that their children belonged
more to God than to themselves, thus eroding the instinctive mater
nal possessiveness that fosters the best of child care. Not illogically,
mothers often left their unwanted children for God to care for. In the
1 8th century, the hospital of St. Vincent de Paul in Paris reported
as many as 5000 infants annually deposited on God's doorstep.9 Infant corpses were rather commonly found among the rubbish of western
cities. Foundling hospitals were so busy that they set revolving boxes in
104



their walls, so infants could be passed through. Yet foundling hospi- Birth Control tals seldom saved the children they were given. In practice, they solved
the problem of excess births by killing babies by the thousands, under ^^^^^^^^^
the sanction of male-dominated officialdom. 10
London's first foundling hospital admitted 1 5,000 infants in the four years between 1756 and 1760. Of these, fewer than a third
survived to adolescence. On the continent, the death rate for children in
foundling institutions ran between 80 and 90 percent during the first year of life. Parish officers entrusted the care of newborns to women
nicknamed "killing nurses," because they were expected to do the state's dirty work, and see to it that the unwanted children did not long
survive. 11
In effect, the patriarchal society having outlawed birth control and abortion could find nothing better to do with the overflow than
destroy it after all. Apparently this was all right, as long as the decision to give life or withhold it was not being made by the mothers them
selves. Vetter found this kind of morality puzzling:
Is there any evidence that religion has provided a superior brand of
wisdom for the guidance ofsecular affairs, or in the burning social
issues ofthe day? With the population of the earth growing by geometric leaps from unchecked fertility but with epidemics and diseases well
under control, what religious leaders spoke up for the necessity ofplanned parenthood? Not one! But many did hound Margaret Sanger to prison for her constructive work in that direction. IZ
An Englishwoman gave the following picture of conventional
morality in regard to reproduction, indicating that religious leaders care for their own mythology and ceremonial well ahead of the future
welfare of the race:
In a village that I know well a woman, legally married, bore five idiot children one after the other; her husband was a confirmed drinker and
a mental degenerate. One of the children fortunately died. The text that was chosen for his funeral card was "Ofsuch is the kingdom of heaven. "About the same time in the same village a girl gave birth to an il
legitimate child. She was a beautiful girl; the father, who did not live in the village, was strong and young; probably the child would have been healthy. But the girl was sent from her situation and, later, was driven from her home by her father. At the last she sought refuge in a disused quarry, and was there for two days without food. When we found her,
her child had been born and was dead. Afterwards the girl went mad. n
Margaret Sanger gave her life to the effort to prevent such tragedies, both within and without marriage. She believed that "excess
people, not acts of God, created poverty, famine, and war All
society would gain . . . if birth control were allowed to shut off the spigot
that floods the world with weaklings. When sick and unfit mothers were not forced to breed, there would be an end to unwanted children
who grow up to fill our prisons and asylums." 14
But churches still doggedly opposed the right of women to
105



Birth-Giving, Male determine when, where, and how much they shall breed, largely because of the deep-seated male desire to control the life-giving miracle
^^^^^^^^^^m in which men play only a negligible part biologically. It can hardly be
denied that male-dominated religions were everywhere devoted to this
end from their earliest inception. As a result, overpopulation threatens
the world with virtually unthinkable ecological and sociological disasters. 15 Even now, in the face of such disasters, religious leaders tend
to the view that the faithful should multiply forever.

Birth-Giving, Male
Since birth-giving was the only true mark of divinity in primitive belief, the first gods to claim any sort of supremacy had to claim also the
ability to give birth. In fact, usurpation of the feminine power of birth-giving seems to have been the distinguishing mark of the earliest
gods. Lacking vaginas, many gods gave birth from their mouths. Priests
of Ra claimed their god gave birth to the first couple from his mouth.
The Satapatha Brahmana said the god Prajapati learned to give birth to creatures from his mouth; but before he could manage it, he had to
make sacrifices to an older, higher power: the Goddess Svaha, Lady of
Sacrifices. According to the Padma Purana, a god named Sukra
(Seed) was born from Shiva's penis, after living in Shiva's belly for a
hundred years. However, this was not a proper maternal-type birth. Sukra existed beforehand, and Shiva had to make himself pregnant by
swallowing him. 1 The Rig Veda spoke of a male creator who gave birth to the
Mother of Creation, then impregnated her, so she brought forth the rest of the universe. Brahmans tried to claim the Mother of All Gods was born from Brahma's body, even though she was the mother of
Brahma too. 2 Brahma was known as Lotus-Born, meaning he sprang from the primal Yoni, the Goddess Padma ("Lotus"). His first Lotus Throne was located in her lap. The Rig Veda also called her Vac,
the Great Womb, the Queen, the First, the Greatest of All Deities.
She said: "I begot the All-Father on high. I dwell in the waters, the
deep, and thence extend through all creatures, and touch the heavens
with my crown. Like unto the wind I blow, encompassing all creatures; above the heavens and above the earth." 3 Hellenic Greeks pretended their new Father Zeus gave birth to the much older Goddess Athene from his head. But before he could
give birth to Athene, he had to swallow her real mother, Metis
(Wisdom), who was pregnant with her at the time. 4 The Hellenes
also claimed Zeus gave birth to Dionysus from his thigh; but again, the
106



real mother was the Moon-goddess Selene, whom Zeus killed during Birth-Giving, Male
her pregnancy. As Conductor of Souls, Hermes took the six-month
fetus from Selene's womb and sewed him up in Zeus's thigh to
continue his gestation. ^^^^^^^^ 11
A Greek carving showed the god Apollo sitting on a pile of eggs,
trying to copy the life-giving magic of his mother Leto, or Leda, or
Latona, who gave birth to the World Egg and hatched it. 5 This World Egg was an old Oriental idea. The Satapatha Brahmana said it
contained "the continents, the oceans, the mountains, the planets and
the divisions of the universe, the gods, the demons, and humanity." 6
Thus, birth laying the egg was the image of cosmic creation, and creator-gods needed to copy it. In Egypt, the mother of the World
Egg was Hathor in the guise of the Nile Goose, later mythologized as
the Goose who laid the Golden Egg. (See Goose.)
Atum, the local god of Heliopolis, the biblical "City of On,"
claimed to give birth to a primal couple from his penis by masturbating. Pyramid Texts of 2000 B.C. said "Atum created in Heliopolis by an
act of masturbation. He took his phallus in his fist, to excite desire
thereby. And the twins were born, Shu and Tefnut." 7 However, priests of Khepera insisted that their god produced Shu and Tefnut by masturbation and self-fertilization through his mouth. Yet the oldest
traditions said Shu and Tefnut ("Dryness" and "Moisture") were
born of the primal Mother, Iusaset. Like the biblical God who copied
her many centuries later, she not only created the first couple, but
also brought forth light as her first act of creation.8
Before begetting was understood, archaic myth-makers tried all sorts of ideas for making a male body produce offspring. A Chinese ancestor-god, Kun, suffered a crude Caesarian section. He was slain and
cut open so Yu, founder of the Hsia dynasty, could emerge from his stomach.9 Norsemen said a first male-and-female couple were born
from the sweaty armpit of the giant Ymir, who imitated Mother
Earth in that his flesh became the soil, his blood the sea, his bones the
mountains. 10 Ymir's skull became the dome of the heavens, support
ed at four corners by four dwarves, Austri, Vestri, Nordri, and Sudri
(East, West, North, and South), northern copies of the Sons of Horus. ' ' Similar cardinal-direction gods became identified with the four
angels of the Apocalypse and four evangelists, whose totems were the same. 12 Totem Symbol or
The god Loki gave birth to Odin's horse, after making himself embodiment of an
pregnant by eating a woman's heart. 15 The usual mythic symbol of a rationahSrif
31 ' ^
woman's heart, from Egypt to northern Europe, was an apple. Thus it
frequently in animal
might be assumed that in some prototypical versions of the Eden form; a divine or story, Adam ate the apple before, not after, he gave birth to Eve. semi-divine mascot Adam's birth-giving was a syncretic product of numerous local supposed to have
notions of the male mother. A Hittite god, Kumarbi, managed to esce" e r man
_ r , animal ancestor,
become pregnant by eating his rival s penis. His offspring retused to
come out through his mouth or ears, and having no vagina he was
107



Birth-Giving, Male unable to deliver them. Finally the sea god Ea took them out through his side, as Adam's God did later. The idea for Adam's magic birth
^^^^^^^^^^^^ giving rib came from a Sumerian childbirth-goddess, Nin-ti, "Lady of the
Rib." Since ti meant both "rib" and "life," she was also a Lady of Life. She made infants' bones in utero from their mothers' ribs, which is
why biblical writers thought ribs possessed the magic of maternity. 14 An odd male-birth myth came from Persia's intensely patriarchal
Zoroastrian cult, suggesting a combination of homosexuality and bestiality. The primal being, the Sole-Created Bull, was castrated and slain. Its semen went to the moon to be purified; then from this purified seed two new bulls were formed. From these, "all animals
descended." The hidden feminine element in this phallic fantasy was
the moon, of course; but the two bulls must have procreated homosex
ually. This idea was not unknown even in Christian Europe.
"Authorities" like Paracelsus taught that a monster may be born of a
man as a result of oral or anal intercourse with another man. 15 No
matter how impossible it seemed, men apparently wished to preserve at any price the notion that a male could give birth. Christianity demoted the Goddess to mortal status in both Eve and
Mary, whom mystics regarded as two incarnations of the same person. In both incarnations she was a Mother of her Father. Gnostic
Gospels said Adam came into being from the virgin Earth, who was none other than Eve. 16 The story of her birth from Adam was a late,
distorted version of the myth.
Unless the male spirit is able as in mathematics to construct a purely
abstract world, it must make use of the nature symbols originating in the unconscious. But this brings it into contradiction with the natural
character of the symbols, which it distorts and perverts. Unnatural
symbols and hostility to the nature symbol e.g. Eve taken out of Adam are characteristic of the patriarchal spirit. But even this attempt
at revaluation usually fails, as an analysis ofthis symbolism might show, because the matriarchal character ofthe nature symbol asserts itself
again and again. ' 7
Throughout the world, men's initiatory dramas enacted birth
giving to represent even the attainment of man's estate. Apparently men
could think of no better way to adopt new members into their
fraternities than to make the novices symbolically dead and reborn, often from a male mother. In New Guinea, initiates into the men's group crawled out from between the legs of men costumed as the birth
spirit.
18 Australian men opened their veins to bathe a young initiate
into their blood, magically imitating the blood of the womb. 19 Baptismal rebirth from male blood was an idea shared by all
mystery cults of the early Christian era. In the Mithraic Mysteries, an
initiate was showered with the blood of the sacrificial bull and pro
nounced "reborn for eternity." 20 Afterward he was fed on milk, like
an infant. 21 From primitive times to the present, men's groups devised
theatrical imitations of birth, often claiming the rites were stolen from
108



women or that women were murdered for them and have sought to Bitch
protect these masquerades with all the taboos their priesthoods could
invent.22 In Malekula, men even applied the name of mara to the place ^^^^__^_
where male initiations were held; it meant the women's obstetrical ^^^^^^
enclosure or birth-temple. 23
In its determined exclusion of women, early Christianity evolved
some "birth rites" of a somewhat homosexual cast. Some writers
claimed Christian men could "impregnate" each other, in the spiritual
sense, by kissing: "For it is by a kiss that the perfect conceive and give
birth." 24 But it was hard for men to see themselves as perfect, when
they conspicuously lacked the ability to bring forth and nurture new members of their race. Thus their endless quest for superiority nearly
always required some travesty of motherhood.
Symbolic motherhood represented authority in the medieval Russian Orthodox wedding ceremony. The bridegroom threw the
lap of his gown over his bride, signifying adoption by the ancient rite of
mock birth. The wearer of the gown was "mother"; the one emerg
ing from under it was "child." The Christian idea was to show that a
husband exercised over his wife the authority of a mother over her
child. It is strange that, when fatherhood meant authority in practice,
men still thought it necessary to clothe that authority in the symbols of motherhood.

Bitch
This became a naughty word in Christian Europe because it was one of
the most sacred titles of the Goddess, Artemis-Diana, leader of the
Scythian alanioi "hunting dogs." The Bitch-goddess of antiquity was
known in all Indo-European cultures, beginning with the Great Bitch Sarama who led the Vedic dogs of death. The Old English word for
a hunting dog, bawd, also became a naughty word because it applied to the divine Huntress's promiscuous priestesses as well as her dogs. 1
Harlots and "bitches" were identified in the ancient Roman cult of
the Goddess Lupa, the Wolf Bitch, whose priestesses the lupae gave
their name to prostitutes in general. 2 Earthly representatives of the Wolf Bitch ruled the Roman town of Ira Flavia in Spain, as a queen or
series of queens named Lupa. 3 In Christian terms, "son of a bitch" was considered insulting not
because it meant a dog, but because it meant a devil that is, a
spiritual son of the pagan Goddess.

Blessing
From Old English bletsain, earlier bleodswean, "to sanctify with shedding of blood." l It was the custom to consecrate altars by sprinkling
them with blood, and to "bless" individuals by marking them with blood, as is still the custom of foxhunters who "blood" new members of
the club after a kill. According to Tacitus, the Celts "deemed it
indeed a duty to cover their altars with the blood of captives." 2 The
Romans did the same in essence, though their altars were "blessed" with
the blood of sacrificial animals.
Catholics now bless altars by sprinkling them with salt, an ancient custom of the Jews, based on the primitive idea that blood and salt
were magical equivalents because they tasted alike. Egyptian altars were
dedicated with salt. In Egypt, dedi was the magic salt that made Nile
water become "as human blood." 3 (See Menstrual Blood; Salt.) Blessing a person by drawing a cross on his head and breast
originated with the Mithraic rite of the Taurobolium, when the cross
(an emblem of Mithra) was marked thus on participants with the bull's blood, so they became official witnesses of the ceremony of rebirth.
110



To be blessed meant to be saved, through the magic of blood, as the Christian Gospels also admitted: "Almost all things are by the law
purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission" (Hebrews 9:22).

Blodeuwedd Boadicea
Blodeuwedd
Welsh Virgin Goddess of spring, all made of flower-buds, her beauty
disguising a personification of the blood-hungry soil waiting to be fructified with the lifeblood of the sacred king. She also personified
the "blood wedding" whereby Llew Llaw GyfFes became her doomed
bridegroom and died from a spear-thrust in the side, according to the
classic pattern seen in Balder, Jesus, Krishna, and many others. His soul
became an eagle; but he rose again in human form to challenge his
slayer, Gronw, to another bout the following year. Like Gawain and the
Green Knight, or Frey and Njord in Scandinavia, the two "blood
gods" (blotgodar) alternately sacrificed each other in seasonal cycles. 1
The reincarnated Llew Llaw killed Gronw with a spear-thrust
through a sacred holed stone.
Blodeuwedd's totemic form was an owl, the same bird of wisdom
and lunar mysteries that accompanied or represented ancient Goddesses like Athene and Lilith. Owls were almost invariably associated with witches in medieval folklore. She was also the Ninefold Goddess
of the western isles of paradise, otherwise known as Morgan, the Virgin
blending into the Crone of death. She said: "Nine powers in me
combined, Nine buds of plant and tree. / Long and white are my fingers, As the ninth wave of the sea." 2

Boar Boar
Sacrificial boar-gods common to both Scandinavian and Middle
Eastern traditions began with the Indian cult of Vishnu, who claimed to
create the world by virtue of his self-sacrifice in boar shape. Vishnu
said the blood of his boar incarnation had the creative power that only
the Mother's blood formerly had: "Gods and creatures arise out of
the sacrifice, for the sacrifice is their appointed food. Everything will
always arise from the sacrifice; this whole universe is made of the sacrifice." Vishnu dared to copulate with the Earth Goddess while she
was menstruating, and begot three boar-sons who were also sacrificed
by "gods saying Om," the Word of creation. 1
Vishnu the Boar represented an early attempt to re-assign to a male the holy creative blood of life, the Goddess's menstruum. As the
phallic god who gave his life for humanity, he was worshipped in conjunction with the Goddess by Germanic Aryans who, Tacitus
said, "worship the mother of the gods, and wear as a religious symbol the device of a wild boar." 2 This Germanic boar-god became the doomsday-averting Savior and Lord of Death, in both human and porcine form, "born in the
days of old . . . of the race of gods." He was identified with Heimdall,
born of the Earth-and-Sea mother, fathered by boar blood. "He was made strong with the force of the earth, with the cold sea and the blood
of the sacrificial boar." 3 That is, like most gods, in dying he begot
himself again.
The boar-god was sacrificed especially at Yul (Yule), with an apple
in his mouth, symbolizing his regenerated heart-soul, according to the Scandinavian belief that apples were resurrection charms. 4 Hence
the traditional Yule pig roasted with an apple in its mouth. There was
a mystical meaning behind the pork-eating ritual. "Valhalla's boar" was
cooked in a cauldron, the regenerative womb-symbol, and the skalds said of it, "It's prime of pork, but few men know on what Valhalla's
champions feed." 5 If one may hazard a guess, Valhalla's champions used to feed on human flesh, for which the boar was substituted.
Swedish priests in boar masks were regarded as incarnations of Frey,
and husbands of Freya, indicating an identification with the sacrificial god who once wedded the Mother and died as both a boar and a man. 6 The Jews' taboo on pig's flesh was nothing so hygienic or rational
as fear of trichinosis, as some modern apologists have tried to suggest,
showing gross misunderstanding of the biblical mentality. Reinach said, "In the whole of the Bible there is not a single instance of an epi
demic or a malady attributed to the eating of unclean meats. ... To the
Biblical writers, as to contemporary savages, illness is supernatural; it is an effect of the wrath of spirits. The pious Jew abstains from pork
because his remote ancestors, five or six thousand years before our
era, had the wild boar as their totem." 7
Like their neighbors, the Jews worshipped sacrificial boar-gods:
112



Syrian Adonis, for one. Boars were offered to Astarte in Syria, and to Bogey
her counterpart Demeter in Greece. Demeter's Eleusinian Mysteries
mythologized the boar sacrifice as "pigs falling into a crevice in the ^^^^^^^^^
earth" at the moment when Pluto, Lord of Death, seized his virgin
bride Kore. 8 The custom of driving sacrificial pigs into pits, as in the
rites of Demeter and Astarte, appeared in Christian Gospels as the miracle-tale of the Gadarene swine, whose sacrificial death impelled
by "demons" was re-assigned to the intervention of Jesus (Mark
5:11-13). Myths of dying gods like Tammuz, Attis, and Adonis featured the boar, or boarskin-clad priest, who sacrificed the god in swine form.
Such gods were "gored in the groin" by the boar, an allegory of ritual
castration. 9 As lovers of the Goddess, they were chosen from mem
bers of her priesthood. The sacrificer of Adonis was another of the
Goddess's lovers, Ares, wearer of the boarskin. The sacrificer and
castrater of Attis was his divine alter ego, a boar sent by Zeus, or by the
king of Phrygia these presumed simultaneously incarnate in the same body. 10 Like Christ, Attis was the dying Son later resurrected as the Father who decreed his death in the first place. Similarly, Vishnu
the Boar decreed death for his boar-sons. 11 Some myths said Attis died
in the same way as Adonis, being gored by a boar. Others said Attis himself was the boar, a totemic sign of his kingship. 12
Malekula presents an original primitive view of the sacrificial
animal as savior or surrogate for men. Mother Death guards the gates
of the after-world. A man must pass these gates by distracting her
attention with his sacrificial pig. While she devours the pig, he slips
by her. 13 After sacrificing and eating on earth the savior-pig who
becomes part of himself, the man says, "It is no longer I who live, but
my sacrifice who lives in me." H Christians similarly ate their god in
communion, and were taught to recite at the gate of heaven, "No more I, but Christ."
The old cults of the boar were not altogether forgotten. Medieval
fairy tales abound in magic boars, often figuring as sacrificial animals.
The first French book printed on the subject of witchcraft, de Spina's Fortress of the Faith, declared that French witches assembled at a
certain sacred rock to worship the devil in the shape of a boar. 15

Bogey
The Bogey-man was a devil derived from Slavic bog, "god." English
cognates were bugabow, bugaboo, bugbear, and boggle-bo, which used to signify a pagan image carried in procession to the games of May Day. 1 "Humbug" came from Norse hum, "night," plus bog or bogey,
113

Bones applied to insects because of the old belief that insects were souls in
^^^^^^^^^^^^ search of rebirth. 3 A mantis was the soul of a seer or wizard. A
butterfly was Psyche, the Female Soul.
Other derivations of bog were Scottish bogle, Yorkshire boggart,
English Pug, Pouke, and Puck; Icelandic Puki; the Puk of Friesland; the German Putz or Butz; Irish Pooka and Welsh Pwcca; Danish
Spoge and Swedish Spoka with their English offshoot, "spook." 4 Old English puca, a fairy, was applied to the old gods of Beltain. 5 Thus Puck was the same as the witches' god, Robin.

Bogomils
"God-lovers," Gnostic Christian heretics in the Balkans, 12th to 14th
centuries a.d. Allied with the basically Manichean heresies of the
Paulicians of Armenia and the Patarenes of Bosnia, the Bogomils arose
in Bulgaria in revolt against the abuses of the Roman church, rejecting
baptism, the Eucharist, the cross, miracles, church buildings, and the whole organization of orthodoxy. Like other Manicheans, they held that the God who created this world of matter was a demon. 1
The Bogomils were highly puritanical but less sexist than the Roman church. They admitted women to religious offices on an equal basis with men. The Catholic writer Cosmas condemned as "deviltry" their custom of appointing women to hear confessions and
give absolution to men. 2 Up to the late 14th century, Bogomilism was
"the most powerful sectarian movement in the history of the Balkans," but Catholic crusades drove many members of the sect into the
arms of Islam, and the movement was crushed. See Bugger.
1. Encyc. Brit, "Bogomils." 2. Spinka, p. 66.
Bones
Many religions tabooed breaking the bones of a sacrificial animal, on
the theory that the gods needed a complete skeleton to resurrect it
anew. 1 On one occasion, the god Thor killed and resurrected two
goats, but the thighbone of one had been damaged, so the new goat was lame. 2
The same belief is evident in the Bible. Concerning the paschal
lamb, God ordered: "Neither shall ye break a bone thereof" (Exodus
12:46); "They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break
any bone of it" (Numbers 9:12); "He keepeth all his bones; not one of
them is broken" (Psalms 34:20). To fulfill all these alleged prophecies, Jesus's bones were left intact to identify him with the Lamb: "That
114



the scripture should be fulfilled, a bone of him shall not be broken"
(John 19:36).
Several saints' legends also made use of regenerative bones.
St. Germain resurrected a calf, on whose flesh he had just feasted, by
laying the bones on the hide and praying over them. 3 A derivative'
medieval belief was that every body contains an incorruptible seed-bone,
"out of which, as they say, as a plant out of the seed, our animal bodies shall in the resurrection of the dead spring up."4

Brahma
Brahma
India's patriarchal god, whose priests tried to establish wholly maledominated society and eliminate the Mother Goddess who,
nevertheless, remained the parent of Brahma as she was of the other
gods. Though some of Brahma's scriptures tried to dissociate him from
the Mother by calling him "the Birthless," yet the same scriptures incongruously referred to him as the Goddess's "Firstborn." 1
The older dharma (holy law) said the worst of crimes was killing a
woman or female child, because it meant killing unborn generations. 2
However, like most patriarchal systems, Brahmanism lifted the taboo on
male aggression against females, and claimed that it was better to kill women than to insult Brahmans: "To revile and calumniate a worship
per of the Supreme Brahman is a sin ten million times worse than that of killing a woman." 3
Like the medieval Christian church, Brahman priests made rules
for rigid control of wives, and made their deity say any other kind of marriage was a sin that made the wife a whore and the children
illegitimate, disqualified for religious observances.4 Brahman marriage reversed the old system of matrilineal inheri
tance, insisting that property must pass from father to son. A widow
without male children was entitled to inherit only if she "lives under the
control of the relations of her husband, and in their absence under
the control of her father's relations" that is, male relations "then
only is she entitled to inherit. The woman who is even likely to go
astray is not entitled to inherit the husband's property." 5 In practice of
course, any or all of these male groups could easily declare the widow
unfit to inherit and divide the property among themselves.
Brahmanism was essentially paternal ancestor-worship, possibly the root of similar paternal ancestor-worship instituted in Israel by the
legendary Abraham, whose name meant "Father Brahm." There was the same obsession with record-keeping. At every Brahman wedding,
long lists of paternal ancestors were recited, like the biblical lists of
"begats." Brahman sons were taught to recite: "My father is my highest Dharma My father is my Heaven. On my father being
115



Brigit, Saint satisfied, the whole Universe is satisfied." Brahma also displayed the
patriarchal god's usual insistence on exclusivity: "Those who are averse
to My doctrine are unbelievers and sinners, as great as those who slay a Brahman." 6
It is clear that Jewish patriarchy owed a debt to Brahman prece
dent. From the Far East came the legend of the Golden Age of
righteousness, when men were free from sin, had great longevity, and
grew to gigantic size. 7 Comparable were the long-lived biblical patriarchs of the antediluvian age when there were "giants in the earth" (Genesis 6:4). The story of Cain and Abel was Indo-Iranian. Vedic
poets used to beg their god to accept their sacrifices, and reject those of
other arya (men). 8 The legend of Jonah was prefigured by the Indian tale of Candra
gomin, who endangered the ship he sailed on because a rival magician caused a storm and took the form of a sea beast to swallow
him. 9 Talmudic tradition adopted the typical Oriental belief in transmi
gration of souls; Adam's soul passed by transmigration into David, than into the Messiah. 10 Brahmanic revelation seemed to be part of the
Messianic promise also. The Katha Upanishad said Brahma is realized
in one's own soul dimly, as if seen in a mirror; but in the heaven of
Brahma he is realized clearly, "as one distinguishes light from darkness." 11 The New Testament repeats the same message copied al
most word for word: "For now we see through a glass (i.e., mirror) darkly, but then face to face" (1 Corinthians 13:12). The Brahman
doctrine that a thousand years is one Day of Brahma is repeated in Psalms 90:4, and again in the First Book ofAdam and Eve, where God
explains that "five days and a half for him means 5,500 years for men. 12 Brahma is no longer popular in his native land. He is described as a
"theologian's god, whose worship never struck vital roots in the
popular folk soil." He was used mainly to support the caste system.
"Today Brahma is so relatively unimportant that only one or two temples in all India are reserved for his exclusive worship." 13

Cormac's Glossary Compendium of old
Irish terms and legends, attributed to
Archbishop Cormac Mac Cullenan (d. 908
a.d.), king of Munster. However, some scholars believe the
Glossary was compiled later than his lifetime.
Brigit, Saint
Triple Goddess of the great Celtic empire of Brigantia, which included parts of Spain, France, and the British Isles. Before she was a
saint, she was a typical feminine trinity. Brigit ruled; her two sisters governed the arts of healing and smithcraft. Cormac's Glossary called
her "Brigit the female sage Brigit the goddess, whom poets adored, because her protecting care over them was very great and very famous." 1
116



Dr. MacCulloch said Brigit "originated in a period when the Celts worshipped goddesses rather than gods, and when knowledge
leechcraft, agriculture, inspiration were [sic] women's rather than men's. She had a female priesthood and men were perhaps excluded
from her cult, as the tabooed shrine at Kildare suggests." 2
Brigit's priestesses at Kildare kept an ever-burning sacred fire like that of the temple of Vesta in Rome. They called the three personae of Brigit the
"Three Blessed Ladies of Britain" or the "Three Mothers," and
always identified them with the moon. 3
The number of Brigit's priestesses at Kildare was 19, representing
the 19-year cycle of the Celtic "Great Year." Greeks said the sun god
of the north, whom they called Hyperborean Apollo, visited the north
ern "temple of the moon goddess" once every 19 years, a mythic expression of the coincidence of solar and lunar calendars. 4 In reality the period of coincidence was 18.61 years, which meant the smallest
regular unit to give a"mating" of sun and moon was 56 years, two cycles of 19 and one of 18. This astronomical data was well known to
the builders of Stonehenge, who marked the span of Great Years with posts around their circle. 5
Brigit was older than Celtic Ireland, having come with Gaelic Celts from their original home in Galatia. One of her earliest shrines
was Brigeto in Illyricum.6 Long before the Christian era, the Goddess of the Brigantes was said to be the same as Juno Regina, Queen of Heaven, and Tanit, the Dea Celestis (Heavenly Goddess). 7
Finding the cult of Brigit impossible to eradicate, the Catholic church rather unwisely canonized her as a saint, calling her Bridget or Bride. Hagiographers declared she was a nun who founded a convent at Kildare. But the convent was noted for its heathenish miracles and
evidences of fertility magic. Cows never went dry; flowers and sham
rocks sprang up in Brigit's footprints; eternal spring reigned in her bower. Irish writers refused to reduce their Goddess to mere sainthood,
and insisted that she was Queen of Heaven, which meant identifying
her with Mary. She was called "Mother of my Sovereign, Mary of the
Goidels, Queen of the South, Prophetess of Christ, Mother of
Jesus." 8 An Irish charm against the evil eye suggested collusion between
the pagan and Christian heavenly-mother figures; it was "the Spell the great white Mary sent to Bride the lovely fair." 9 She was also the
mystic mother-bride of St. Patrick, supposed to have died as one of her sacrificial victims, and entered the underworld via her sacred grove at Deny Down. An old distich said, "On the hill of Down, buried in
one tomb, were Bridget and Patricius." 10 Since Patrick's name meant
"father," and he was as apocryphal as other Irish saints, he may have been a new name for Brigit's old consort the Dagda or "father."
Three churches of "St. Brigit" occupied her Triple-Goddess territory of Hy Many, formerly Emania or Emain Macha, country of the Moon. Baptismal fees of those churches belonged to the O'Kelly tribes, descended from the Goddess's kelles or sacred harlots. Her

Brimstone original female trinity was semi-Christianized as a "Wonder-working Triad" consisting of Brigit, Patrick, and Columba: the Mother, the
Father, and the Holy Dove. St. Brigit's feast day was the first of
February, the first day of spring according to the pagan calendar. It was called Oimelc, Imolg, or Imbulc, the day of union between God and Goddess. 11
The same day was celebrated in Rome as the Lupercalia, sacred to Venus and to women generally. With unconscious irony, the church
transformed it into the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin, also called
Candlemas, which kept much of its pagan symbolism and was
regarded as a major festival of witches. 12
Like other versions of the Celtic Goddess, Brigit was a teacher of
the martial arts, and a patron of warfare or briga. Her soldiers were
brigands, or as Christians called them, outlaws. 15 Robin Hood's merry
men were outlaws of the same kind; so were Kali's Thugs and the
"Assassins" who worshipped the Arabian Moon-goddess. Brigit was canonized more than once. Besides the Irish Brigit there
was a St. Bridget of Sweden, foundress and supreme ruler of a double
monastery of both sexes, the Order of Brigantines. (See Convent.) A branch of the ancient "colleges" of Brigit was a Brigantine House of Sion established in 1420 on the bank of the Thames, where it flourished
until 1589 as a center of education for ladies of noble birth. 14

Brimstone
Old name for sulfur, derived from Brimo, a title of Athene, Hecate,
and Demeter. 1 It meant "raging one," the Goddess's Destroyer aspect. 2
The alchemical symbol for sulfur was the same as the symbol of
Athene, a triangle surmounting a cross: female genital sign over the male, like the symbol of Venus. 3
Even the raging Brimo appeared as the Virgin Mother, in feasts of purification at Eleusis, where the advent of the Divine Child was announced with a cry, "Holy Brimo has borne the Holy Child
Brimus." 4 Because of her magical ability to cleanse and purify, Brimo's stone
was supposed to be proof against disease. Burning sulfur was used even in medieval times to fumigate sickrooms and avert the plague. The
use of brimstone as an agent of purification accounts for its appearance in the cauldron of Purgatory with its "fire and brimstone" to burn
away sins.
Alchemists tried to "marry Hermes and Athene" by combining
mercury with brimstone, which they thought might create gold. They never succeeded.

Goddess, whose physical being was all existence: underworld, earth, and heaven. Ishtar too wore the rainbow necklace, which the Persians
converted into the razor-edged bridge to the Mount of Paradise. See Diakosmos; Ishtar; Rainbow. Odin stole Freya's necklace and hung it on his own image; but she retrieved it.
Britomartis
"Sweet Virgin," a title of Rhea, the Great Goddess of Bronze Age Crete and the Aegean islands. 1 The same name was given to an early
ruler of Gaul, who was probably a queen embodying the Goddess's
spirit.
2 Olympian mythology said the mother of Britomartis was the
Cretan virgin Carme, another form of Car, Car-Dia, Carmenta, Carna, etc. They were really different names for the same deity. The
titles by which she was addressed in prayers and hymns were later mis
understood as the names of different deities, which is why the Goddess became "goddesses" in the west, or the Thousand-Named
One in the east.

Broceliande
The fairy wood in Brittany where Nimue, or Vivien, or Morgan enchanted Merlin into his magic sleep within a crystal cave or, some said, within the trunk of a venerable oak tree. This was one of the
nimidae or moon-groves still used for worship of woodland deities up
to the time of the Renaissance. 1 See Grove, Sacred.

Bron
Companion of Joseph of Arimathea, keeper of the Christianized version of the Holy Grail. Bron was really the Celtic god Bran, keeper
of the Cauldron of Regeneration; a popular deity with numerous
shrines, patron of "healing and resurrection." '

Broomstick
Broomsticks were long associated with witches because they figured
in pagan rituals of marriage and birth, the Mysteries of Women. In
Rome the broom was a symbol of Hecate's priestess-midwife, who
119



Broomstick swept the threshold of a house after each birth to remove evil spirits that
might harm the child. 1
^^^^^^^^^^^ As Hecate was also the Triple Goddess presiding over marriage,
her broomstick signified sexual union. Old wedding customs included
jumping over a broomstick, possibly to represent impregnation. Gypsy
weddings always included the same ritual, though gypsies now say they don't know what it means. 2 Oddly enough, the same broom-jumping ritual marked the churchless weddings of black slaves in nineteenth
century America.
Medieval peasant weddings in Europe were also churchless, as a rule, coming under the jurisdiction of common law rather than canon law, and using the rites of the old religions rather than the new. The
broom was so closely identified with non-ecclesiastical marriages that
by Renaissance times, when the church began to take over the nuptial
rites, unions "by the broom" were declared illegitimate. English rustics still say "if a girl strides over a broom-handle, she will be a mother
before she is a wife." A girl who gives birth to a bastard child is said to
have "jumped over the besom." ?
As a horse for witches to ride, the broomstick apparently signified Tantric-type sexual unions which were primary attractions of the
female-oriented witch cults. Plants genet, the broom plant, was sacred
to witches. This may explain why the ruling family of Anjou in the
12th century was named Plantagenet. Henry II, first Plantagenet king of England, inherited his throne by matrilineal succession through his mother Matilda, or Maud names commonly associated with witch
craft the countess of Anjou. Genet also meant a horse or steed, the
"royal horse" of paganism. This meaning is preserved in the word jennet, a small horse or the female donkey, and in the names fre
quently taken by witches: Jenet, Janet, Jeannette, Jean, or Joan. Such names suggested a witch-child born of a sacred marriage with
a phallic god represented by the broom. A Janet or Jenny was a Daughter of the Horse, and old gods like Volos, Volsi, Waelsi, or Odin were called "Horse's Penis." 4 Riding the broomstick seems to have
denoted the kind of sexual position viewed as a perversion by the church, woman above, man below acting as her "horse." This sexual implication is confirmed by the old witch-rhyme, "Ride a cock-horse to
Banbury Cross (i.e., crossroads), to see a fine lady on a white horse." The fine lady was Godiva, "the Goddess." Her white cock-horse
signifed her consort. 5 Children rode the cock-horse as a broomstick with a horse's head,
copied from Sufi mystics who entered Spain in the early Middle
Ages. Besides their organization in groups of thirteen, like covens, and their worship of the Rabba or "Lord," later transformed into the witches' god Robin, Sufi sages rode horse-headed canes called zamal
zain, "gala limping horse." The dervish's stick-horse stood for the
Pegasus-like fairy steed that carried him to heaven and back.6 Such
customs became prevalent among the Basques, who were frequently accused en masse of witchcraft.
120



At times a witch's broomstick seems to have been nothing more
than a dildo, anointed with the famous "flying ointment" and used
lor genital stimulation. 7 French witches "flew" this way: "With an
lintment which the Devil had delivered to them they anointed a
Ivooden rod which was but small, and their palms and their whole hands
likewise; and so, putting this small rod between their legs, straightway
Ihey flew there where they wished to be . . . and the Devil guided
Ihem." 8 Certainly churchmen were prone to describe any kind
If masturbation as guided by the devil women's masturbation most
larticularly so, for nothing was more abhorrent to the patriarchal
Inind than the thought that women could experience sexual pleasure
wathout men.
Witches' ointments often incorporated such drugs as aconite, leadily absorbable in an oil-based liniment through skin or mucus
Inembrane, producing symptoms like giddiness, confusion, lethargy, lingling sensations followed by numbness, and quite possibly the Illusion of flying. Thus Oldham wrote:
So witches some enchanted wand bestride,
And think they through the airy regions ride. 9
Because of their ancient association with pagan midwives and
jheir Christian counterparts the witches, broomsticks took on an accreion of similar superstitions. Witches' familiar spirits were said to be
inable to cross running water; hence, it became "bad luck" to move a room across running water. It was also "bad luck" to burn a broom,
ince it was certainly bad luck for the witch. 10

"he Greek word for brother was adelphos, "one from the same
'omb," derived from the matrilineal family when only maternal parent
ood was recognized. English "brother" stemmed from Sanskrit
hratr, "support." In pre-Vedic India it was the duty of a brother, not a usband, to help support a woman and her children. Husbands came
nd went, but the matrilineal clan remained stable. As an old proverb of irab women said: "A husband can be found, a son can be born, but a rother cannot be replaced." '
A preference for brothers over husbands may be found in many
re-patriarchal cultures. Pagan Slavic women considered "by my
rother" their most binding oath. In pre-Christian Norway, rune stones n women's graves were raised by their brothers, not their husbands. 2
indent systems of clan loyalty were similar to that of the Nairs, of horn it was said that no man knew his father, but "every man looks
n his sister's children as his heirs. A man's mother manages his
Brother
121



Buana family; and after her death his eldest sister assumes the direction."
Names and property were bequeathed in the female line. 3
The uterine-sibling bond was so much stronger than the marriage bond in ancient societies that the ultimate endearment of lovers or
spouses was to call each other "brother" and "sister." 4 King Solomon
called his bride "my sister, my spouse" (Song of Solomon 4:10) with
"sister" in the place of honor. An Egyptian wife affectionately addresse
her husband as "brother, husband, friend," in that order. 5
Weddings sometimes meant making bride and groom pseudo
siblings in some magical way. Polynesian couples were not considered truly married until their two mothers mingled their blood,
signifying that the married pair were born of a double, or merged, womb. 6 Often, the bride and groom mingled their own blood; this was
the common rite of gypsy weddings. 7 Brother-sister incest was customary in ancient ruling families,
when it was felt that a king and queen should be offspring of the same
mother, so the true line of succession would not be weakened. Egyptiai
pharaohs married their sisters as a matter of course because their
thrones were inherited through the female line. 8 One pharaoh with onl
one son and one daughter suggested to his wife that the children
might marry outside the family. The queen angrily rejected the idea: "Dost thou wrangle with me? Even if I have no children after those
two children, is it not the law to marry them one to the other?" 9
Brother-sister incest was everywhere the practice of the elder gods
and goddesses, many of whom were twins who copulated even in
their mother's womb. Examples are Isis and Osiris, Artemis and Apollo Fauna and Faunus, Diana and Dianus, Zeus and Hera, Yama and
Yami, Freya and Frey. According to Norse skalds, brother-sister incest was the accepted custom of the Vanir or elder deities. 10
Mythological evidence tends to destroy the modern conception oi Stone Age man protecting "his" cave with "his" mate and "their"
children. If the home was a cave or anything else, it was probably selected, furnished, and owned by the female. If there was a male protecting it, he was more likely to have been a sibling than a mate. In
fact there were no monogamous families but only family groups, centering on the women and children with impregnating males a loose
changeable periphery.

Buddhism Buddhism
Established 500 years before Christianity and widely publicized
throughout the Middle East, Buddhism exerted more influence on early ^m^bmi^^m Christianity than church fathers liked to admit, since they viewed
Oriental religions in general as devil worship. Legends and sayings derived from Buddhism appear in the Gos
pels, disguised as "typically Christian" precepts, including the
Golden Rule. The Amogha school of Buddhism practiced a severe
morality, a life of poverty and chastity in retirement from secular
concerns, and the expectation of a Savior coming to earth in the near
future. 1 Buddhist sages provided prototypes of Christian miracles.
They were said to walk on water, to speak in tongues, and to ascend to heaven in the flesh. 2 Jains regarded the true Buddhist "hero" (vira) as
"not he who is of great physical strength and prowess, the great eater and drinker, or man of powerful sexual energy, but he who has
controlled his senses, is a truth-seeker, ever engaged in worship, and who has sacrificed lust and all other passions." 3
Buddha is more properly the Buddha, since Buddha was not a
name but a title, the "Enlightened or Blessed One," comparable to Christos, "the Anointed One." Buddha had many other names because
he had already lived through many incarnations on earth. Even the
Buddha supposed to have appeared in the 5 th century B.C. had several
names: Gautama, Sakyamuni, Siddhartha the last, again, not a name but a title, "Rich in Yogic Power." Buddha was miraculously begotten by the Lord of Hosts and born of the Virgin Maya, the
same Great Goddess worshipped throughout Asia and having the alternative Near-Eastern names of Maia, Marah, Mari, or Maria.4 Many Buddhas who had already come and gone were bodhisattvas
or saints, sometimes simply known as Buddhas. Any sage might
become a bodhisattva through devotion to the holy life. But one true Buddha remained to come again to earth. He was Maitreya, the
Master, or the Future Buddha, similar to the being known as Kalki, the
last avatar of the god Vishnu who would appear with the approach of
doomsday. The final coming of the Savior would signal the end of the
present world. He would judge the righteous, and annihilate the wicked, and make everything ready for the ultimate creation of a new heaven and a new earth. 5
These were basic ideas of Christianity as well as Buddhism: simple,
easy to understand, dramatic, and appropriately aligned with archetypal hopes and fears. The more subtle teachings of Buddhism, like
those of Christianity, apparently developed out of group thinking of subsequent sectaries, especially the more ascetic sort. Yet again, as in
Christianity the ascetics were unable to blot out the rich, colorful
sensuality of "pagan" Hinduism. Although they claimed Buddha said the true sage must never see or speak to a woman, must avoid feminine creatures like the plague, yet within a few centuries the
worship of the Goddess reasserted itself and all the bodhisattvas were provided with Shaktis who would welcome them to eternal sexual bliss
123



Buddhism in heaven. "Tantric" Buddhism re-assimilated the feminine principle.
Until the advent of Islam, the original Buddhist asceticism was largely
^^^^^^^^^^^^ forgotten except for a few eremitic groups. A well-known aphorism
said: Buddhatvam yosidyonisamsritam, "Buddhahood resides in the
vulva (yoni)." 6 Buddhist legends reveal the constant tension between ascetic and sensual elements. It was said Buddha wanted his brother Nanda to
become a monk, but Nanda was too much in love with his beautiful mistress. So Buddha played a trick on him. He took Nanda to heaven
and showed him the celestial nymphs, who were so desirable that Nanda
instantly forgot the mortal woman he had loved. Buddha then told
him these nymphs could be won only by a life of rigorous self-denial
and meditation. Nanda agreed to join the monkish order. The ascetic
life soon purged him of all desires, and he became as celibate as Buddha
had wished but only because of his overwhelming lust for a tran
scendent sexual experience! 7
Like their western counterparts in later centuries, Buddhist monks
self-consciously threatened the Goddess with destruction, even though her virgin form had given birth to their Savior. A Buddhist
hymn said, "This time I shall devour thee utterly, Mother Kali; for I was born under an evil star and one so born becomes, they say, the eater of his mother." 8 Stories of the Buddha and his many incarnations circulated inces
santly throughout the ancient world, especially since Buddhist monks traveled to Egypt, Greece, and Asia Minor four centuries before Christ,
to spread their doctrines.9 Ascetics like the Essenes were certainly
influenced by them. Christians continued to hear tales of Buddhist
origin, and to relate them rather naively to their own beliefs. Buddha
himself entered the Christian canon as a saint St. Josaphat, a corrup
tion of Bodhisat when John of Damascus wrote down his life story
in the 8th century a.d. 10 Buddha the Christian saint was supplied with
a companion called Barlaam, who converted the Indian prince to a
Christian asceticism despite his royal father's efforts to thwart this
purpose. 11 Many scholars have pointed out that the basic tenets of Christian
ity were basic tenets of Buddhism first; but it is also true that the
ceremonies and trappings of both religions were more similar than
either has wanted to acknowledge.
Buddhism has much in common with Roman Catholic Christianity,
having its purgatory, its Goddess ofMercy, and its elaborate machinery for delivering the dead from pain and misery through the good offices of the priests. Among other similarities may be mentioned celibacy,
fasting, use ofcandles and flowers on the altar, incense, holy water,
rosaries, priestly garments, worship ofrelics, canonization ofsaints, use ofa dead language for the liturgy and ceremonials generally. The trinity of
Buddhas, past, present, and future, is compared by some to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. The immaculate mother ofShakyamuni, whose name Maya is strikingly similar to that ofMary, the mother ofJesus, is
124

also to be noticed, while Buddha's temptation on Vulture Peak by Mara
the Evil One, may also be contrasted with the similar temptation of
Our Lord. . . . The worship ofancestors is in some measure akin to the
saying ofmasses for the dead, and at one time the Jesuits considered it a ^^^^^^""
harmless observance and tolerated it in their converts. Finally the Dalai
Lama is a spiritual sovereign closely resembling the Pope. '2

Bugger
From "Bulgar," French Bougre. The modern meaning stemmed
from the Roman church's charge that medieval Bulgarians practiced
sexual perversions in their churches. Bulgarian Paulicians were
anathematized for disobeying the Roman pope, setting up their own churches independent of Rome, and admitting women to clerical office on an equal basis with men. 1
Bosnian Patarenes were also called buggers, since they modeled
their national church on that of Bulgaria. About 1200 a.d. the papacy launched "a cruel war against the Bosnian Patarenes, which lasted two
and a half centuries, and finally culminated in the acceptance, on
their part, of the Mohammedan faith and in becoming Turks, rather
than submit to the Roman See." 2
Religious wars led the Balkans into social chaos. Heretics were
hunted down like animals, and tortured. Lands belonging to the
heretic magnates (nobles) were seized and handed over to their Catholic
enemies. The heretics for their part continued to regard themselves as the only true Christian nations. Under the anti-Roman Code of
Stephen, Catholic priests who tried to convert Balkan Christians back
to "the Latin faith" were declared criminals. 3 Quarrels and conflicts
persisted up to the present century.

Bull
The biblical title translated "God" is El, originally the title of the
Phoenician bull-god called Father of Men. As the "supreme god of the
Semitic pantheon, El was worshipped throughout Syria alongside the
local gods, or Ba'als, one of his titles, indeed, being 'the Bull.' " ' Like Zeus the Bull, consort of Hera-Europa-Io the white Moon-Cow, El married Asherah, the Semitic sacred Cow. He was identified with Elias
or Helios, the sun. He was still the Semitic Father of Men in the time
of Jesus, who cried to him from the cross, calling him Father (Mark
15:34). Nearly every god of the ancient world was incarnate sooner or later in a bull. The Cretan moon-king called Minos inhabited a succession of
Minotaurs (moon-bulls), who were sacrificed as the king's surrogates.
125



Bull Yama, the Hindu Lord of Death, wore a bull's head and became the underworld judge, like Minos. 2 Shiva was incarnate in the white bull
^^^^^^^^^^^ Nandi. 3 The real reason King Nebuchadnezzar "ate grass" probably
was that his soul temporarily entered into the body of the divine
sacrificial bull (Daniel 4:33). Court prophets of the kings of Israel put
on bull masks to represent the king while casting spells for his victory over his enemies (1 Kings 22:1 1). 4
Bull worship was a large part of Mithraism. The bull's blood was
credited with power to produce all creatures on earth without the aid of
the cow, though her power was implicit in that the bull's blood was
taken up and magically treated by the Moon. The bull was consecrated
to Anahita, a Persian name of the Moon-goddess whom the Greeks
called Artemis Tauropolos, "Bull-Slayer," of whom the bull-slaying savior Mithra was a late, masculinized form. 5 Like most patriarchal
symbols, those of the Mithraic cult were copied from myths of the Asian Goddess. A statue of Kali in the Ellora caves shows her in the
pose typical of Mithra, holding up the nose of the sacrificial bull and
preparing to slaughter it.6 The bull was killed for a baptism of blood at the Roman Taurobo
lium in honor of Attis, Cybele, or Mithra. "A trench was dug over
which was erected a platform of planks with perforations and gaps. Upon the platform the sacrificial bull was slaughtered, whose blood
dripped through upon the initiate in the trench ... he turned round and
held up his neck that the blood might trickle upon his lips, ears, eyes, and nostrils; he moistened his tongue with the blood, which he than drank as a sacramental act. Greeted by the spectators, he came
forth from this bloody baptism believing that he was purified from his
sins and 'born again for eternity.'
" 7 The participant in the Taurobo
lium acted out literally what Christians called washing in the blood of
the lamb.
Egypt's savior Osiris was worshipped in bull form as Apis-Osiris, the Moon-bull of Egypt, annually slain in atonement for the sins of the
realm. 8 In the ceremony of his rebirth, he appeared as the Golden Calf, Horus, born of Isis whose image was a golden cow. The same Golden
Calf was adored by the Israelites under Aaron (Exodus 32:4).
The Orphic god Dionysus also took the form of a bull; one of his
earlier incarnations was the Cretan bull-god Zagreus, "the Goodly Bull," a son and reincarnation of Zeus, and another version of the
Minotaur. The god was a bull on earth, and a serpent in his subterra
nean, regenerating phase. The Orphic formula ran: "The bull is the father of the serpent, and the serpent is the father of the bull." 9 Dionysus was reincarnated over and over, and there were some who
identified him with the Persian Messiah. In the Book of Enoch,
the Messiah is represented as a white bull. 10 Athenian legends of the Moerae or Fates compared all men to the sacrificial bull sentenced to death at the hands of Fate sooner or
later. Medieval superstition called the Fate-goddess Mora, a nocturnal spirit who roams the world seizing men and crushing them until they
126



"roar like bulls." She was also Christianized as St. Maura, on whose Buto
sacred day women were forbidden to sew, lest they "cut the thread of Byelobog
life" after the manner of the Moerae. 11 ^^^^-^_^^_^
In medieval England, Twelfth Night games featured remnants of
bull worship. A large cake with a hole in the center was thrown over the
bull's horn, to form a lingam-yoni. The bull was then tickled, "to make him toss his head." If he threw the cake behind him, it belonged to the
mistress; if in front, it belonged to the bailiff. 12 This ceremony probably derived from an ancient custom of divination. Like all sacrificial victims
already dedicated to the supernatural realm, the bull was believed to
have prophetic powers.

they were twin spirits of birth and death. See Serpent.

Byblos
Oldest, most famous seat of the Semitic Great Goddess, variously
known as Mari, Astarte, Asherah, Ashtoreth, Ishtar, Isis, or Hathor. "Bibles" were named after her city because the earliest libraries were
attached to her temple. (See Bible.) Kings of Byblos received their mandate from the Goddess before they could rule. King Yehawmilk
for instance said she placed him and his predecessors on the throne.
When invoked as Mistress, "she heard my voice and treated me
kindly." The king begged her to bless him and prolong his years in
Byblos. Recently it has been found that earlier archeological scholars
misread the words "Lady of Byblos" in Aramaic texts referring to the
Goddess, and translated these words "Lord of Byblos" instead. 1 In
reality there was never any god in Byblos whose power equalled that
of the many-named Lady.

Slavic "White God," a heavenly deity opposed to the Black God, Chernobog. Both were variants of the ancient Persian adversaries in

Cabala
Cabiria
var. Kabbalah
Giovanni Pico della Mirandola(1463
1494). Italian
nobleman, philosopher and scholar, declared a heretic for his
attempts to unite Christian theology with Cabalistic doctrine.
Cabala
Medieval Jewish mystical system obviously influenced by Tantrism and Sufism, like the Christian courtly-love movement of the same
period. The Cabala's basic premise was that all the world's ills stemmed from God's loss of contact with his female counterpart, the
Shekina, a Hebraic version of Shakti. God is fragmented, and only the Shekina has power to "put God back together." ' Universal harmony must be restored by making God and his Goddess once more "one." 2
Sexual union of mortals was thought to create its like on the plane
of the divine. Therefore sexual intercourse was a sacramental act
helpful to God and the Shekina. "The efflorescence of such beliefs into
orgiastic rites suggests itself too readily not to be attempted, and indeed, in the further development of Kabbalistic doctrine, such attempts were made." 5 Generally, however, the cabalist confined his erotic
experiments to his legal wife. The first step in his ascent of the
Sephiroth or Tree of Knowledge was the female sexual power,
Shekina-Malkuth, Queen and Bride, represented by the moon and the spouse. 4 Further steps made use of elaborate systems of numerology,
magic, and scriptural allegory, yielding successive revelations of the divine nature.
The major cabalistic work was the Sefer ha-Zohar, "Book of
Splendor," composed in the late 1 3th century by Moses de Leon of Guadalajara, who claimed its real author was the legendary 2nd-century mystic Simeon ben Yohai. He pretended to have the ancient original of the book in his possession, but it was never produced. Scholars have concluded that it never existed, and de Leon wrote the Sefer ha
Zohar himself. 5
Despite its Jewish orientation, the Cabala exerted a strong appeal for contemporary Christian mystics. It has been much in the favor of
occultists ever since. Pico della Mirandola even professed to find in the
Cabala what the Jews themselves denied: the incarnation of full
godhood in Jesus. He wrote: "No science offers greater assurance of
Christ's divinity than magic and the Cabala." 6 See Hexagram; Shekina.

Cabiria
Title of Demeter as the Goddess of the Cabirian Mysteries in Phrygia
Samothrace, and other areas, second only to the Eleusinian Mysteries in importance. Her consort was the Young God, variously known as Dionysus, Ganymede, or Cabirius. In Thebes the Great Goddess
130



was called Demeter Cabiria, sometimes a trinity of "three Cabirian Caduceus
nymphs." Her sexual union with the god was represented by the Caillech same symbol as in India and Egypt: water poured from a male vessel ^^^^^^^^^-i
into a female one. 1 (See Jar-bearer.) Because of its ancient erotic connotations, Cabiria became a common witch-name in medieval times.
1. Neumann, G.M., 324-25.
Caduceus
Some Gnostic Christians worshipped the serpent hung on a cross,
rod, or Tree of Life, calling it Christ the Savior, also a title of Hermes
the Wise Serpent represented by his own holy caduceus, the scepter of two serpents. This was one of the oldest and most revered holy
symbols. "The usual mythological association of the serpent is not, as
in the Bible, with corruption, but with physical and spiritual health, as in the Greek caduceus." To Sumerians it was an emblem of life,
appearing on art works like the Libation Cup of Gudea, ca. 2000 b.c. In
pre-Hellenic Greece the caduceus was displayed on healing temples like those of Asclepius, Hygeia, and Panacea, which is why it is still an
international symbol of the medical profession. The caduceus is found also in Aztec sacred art, enthroned like a serpent-deity on an altar. North American Indians knew it too. A Navaho medicine man
said his people's sacred cave once featured "a stone carving of two
snakes intertwined, the heads facing east and west." '
Hindu symbolism equated the caduceus with the central spirit of
the human body, the spinal column, with two mystic serpents twined around it like the genetic double helix: ida-nadiio the left, pingala-nadi
to the right. 2 Moses's brazen serpent on a pole, the mere sight of which cured
the Israelites, was probably a prophylactic caduceus (Numbers 21:9). It was named Nehushtan, and worshipped in the tabernacle up to the reign of Hezekiah (2 Kings 18:4). See Hermes.

Caillech
Old Celtic name for Kali-the-Crone, the Great Goddess in her
Destroyer aspect. Like Kali, the Caillech was a black Mother who founded many races of people and outlived many husbands. She was
also a creatress. She made the world, building mountain ranges of stones
that dropped from her apron. 1 Scotland was once called Caledonia: the land given by Kali, or
131



Cain Cale, or the Caillech. "Scotland" came from Scotia, the same Goddess, known to Romans as a "dark Aphrodite"; to Celts as Scatha or ^^^^^^^^^^^m Scyth; and to Scandinavians as Skadi.2
Like the Hindus' destroying Kalika, the Caillech was known as a
spirit of disease. One manifestation of her was a famous idol of carved
and painted wood, kept by an old family in County Cork, and described as the Goddess of Smallpox. As diseased persons in India sacrificed to
the appropriate incarnation of the Kalika, so in Ireland those afflicted by
smallpox sacrificed sheep to this image. 3 It can hardly be doubted that
Kalika and Caillech were the same word.
According to various interpretations, caillech meant either an old
woman, or a hag, or a nun, or a 'Veiled one." 4 This last apparently
referred to the Goddess's most mysterious manifestation as the future, Fate, and Death ever veiled from the sight of men, since no man
could know the manner of his own death.
In medieval legend the Caillech became the Black Queen who
ruled a western paradise in the Indies, where men were used in
Amazonian fashion for breeding purposes only, then slain. Spaniards called her Califia, whose territory was rich in gold, silver, and gems.
Spanish explorers later gave her name to their newly discovered paradise on the Pacific shore of North America, which is how the state of
California came to be named after Kali.
In the present century, Irish and Scottish descendants of the Celtic
"creatress" still use the word caillech as a synonym for "old woman." 5

Cain
"Smith," Mother Eve's firstborn, begotten by the serpent and not by Adam, according to rabbinical tradition. The Bible says Cain's murder
of his brother Abel was caused by jealousy, after God accepted Abel's
blood sacrifice but rejected Cain's offering of vegetable firstfruits.
Fearing to depart from this precedent, the Jews offered blood sacrifices to Yahweh up to the early Christian era. The Bible story was a Hebraic repetition of the Persian myth of
Ahriman and Ahura Mazda, who offered sacrifices to an elder deity,
Vayu. Ahriman was declared a traitor and devil when his offering was
refused. 1 Indo-Iranian priests used to pray the gods to accept their
own sacrifices, and refuse those of other arya (men). 2 Ahriman was the
ancestor of those other arya, since his original Hindu name was
Aryaman, father of men.
The myth of Cain was based on primitive sacrificial magic, as
shown by certain internal inconsistencies. God placed a curse on
132



Cain, at the same time protecting him with a mark of immunity. Hooke
explains part of the ritual fertility sacrifice:
The sacrificer is defiled by his act. ...It is this which explains why the
slayer enjoys ritual protection . . . the most likely explanation of the
mark is that it represents a tattoo mark or other indication that the fugitive
belonged to a sacred class. We have evidence from Hebrew sources that the prophets bore such marks. . . . Tammuz, who bears the title of
"the Shepherd, "
dies, or is ritually slain, during the period ofsummer drought . . . and his official slayer was obliged to flee in order to remove the ceremonial guilt ofthe slaying from the community. 3
Such comparisons are needed to solve the dilemma of those
theologians who, through the centuries, have been helpless to explain God's apparent blunder in protecting Cain from nonexistent enemies, when there were as yet no people in the world but Cain and his
parents. Actually, the sacred caste of Cainite smiths worshipped the Goddess and dedicated sacrifices of the Good Shepherd to her as the
Earth, who "opened her mouth" for Abel's blood (Genesis 4:1 1).
Cain's myth reflects the patriarchs' hostility toward this caste. 4 Eventual
ly, they drove all the smiths out of their country, and had to send their
tools to the Philistines for repair because "there was no smith found
throughout all the land of Israel" (1 Samuel 13:19). Before the ban
on smithcraft, however, they had the famous Tubal-cain, "instructor of
every artificer in brass and iron" (Genesis 4:22). The fraternity of smiths was of Midianite origin, and may have inflicted a certain leg
injury upon initiates, which could have been the mark of Cain. The
Hebrew word for Passover, Pesach, meant "to dance with a limp." 5
The festival of Pesach was associated with the Midianites or Kenites
(Cainites, "children of Cain"), who were famed as miners and smiths,
and worshipped the Great Mother in the copper mines of Sinai.
According to the Sinai tablets, Semitic metalworkers called their
deity Elath-Yahu, a combination of Yahweh and El-Lat or Allatu, Lady
of the Underworld; but she was also identified with celestial Hathor.6
The Cainites migrated from northern Syria, where their smith god
formerly occupied the volcanic mountain Jebel-Al-Aqra, a seat of Baal in the Ras Shamra texts. 7 The Mosaic Yahweh was a volcano-god
like this Midianite Baal, or like limping Hephaestus and Latin Vulcanus,
gods represented by "a pillar of cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by
night" (Exodus 13:21-22). Exodus 2:16 says Moses was adopted by the Midianite smiths
through his marriage to their priestess, one of the usual sacred number of seven sisters. Prominent in the clan were such artisans as
Bezaleel, maker of the ark of the covenant, who was filled "with the
spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship; and to devise curious works, to work in
gold, and in silver, and in brass" (Exodus 35:31-32). The word here
Cain
133



Callisto translated "God"apparently meant the spirit of Elath-Yahu. But
Candlemas Moses quarreled with his Midianite wife, apparently over his attempt to ^^^^^^^^^^^ institute the Egyptian custom of circumcision (Exodus 4:25) and
they were divorced (Exodus 18:2). Subsequently, smithcraft disappeared from Israel after a long-remembered feud that imputed the crime of fratricide to Moses's followers, though their priestly tradition was to lay it on Cain. The account in Exodus 32 shows that the
victims were not shepherds, but Cainites:
Moses stood in the gate ofthe camp, and said, Who is on the Lord's side? let him come unto me. And all the sons ofLevi gathered themselves together unto him. And he said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of
Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate
to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor. And the children of Levi did according to the word ofMoses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. (Exodus 32:26-28)
In later ages, Cain became a demi-devil, in the view of religious
authorities who failed to notice that the true brother-slayers were Moses's
followers. Or, if they did notice, they regarded the killing of three thousand as less important than the killing of one. In folklore, Cain remained attached to the diabolized matriarchal tradition: he was the
man in the moon. 8 A German tale said the man in the moon refused to
keep God's sabbath, the Sun-day. Therefore he was sent to the moon, and a saint informed him: "As you value not Sunday on earth, yours
shall be a perpetual Moon-day in heaven." 9

Callisto
"Fairest One," a title of Artemis as totemic She-Bear and mother
of Areas, the Little Bear. Calliste was an old name for Artemis's sacred
island Thera (She-Beast). Hellenic writers said the Attic rites of
Artemis involved young girls dressed as the She-bear, which gave rise to
the myth of Callisto, a nymph who lost her virginity to Zeus and gave birth to the bear-child. They were placed in heaven as Ursa Major and
Ursa Minor. 1 Of course the nymph was the virgin aspect of the
Goddess herself.
1. Graves, G.M. 1, 86; W.G, 185.
Candlemas
Because it fell forty days after Christmas, Candlemas became the
Festival of the Purification of the Virgin according to the Judeo
Christian rule that women must be "purified" forty days after
134



childbirth, an event which the patriarchs claimed rendered a mother Cannibalism
ritually unclean. The Bible specifies forty days of impurity following
the birth of a son, and eighty days following the birth of a daughter, ^^^^^^^^^
since females were supposed to be twice as unclean as males
(Leviticus 12:2-5). The Christian God also considered new mothers unclean, and would not allow a woman to enter a church until the
proper time had elapsed after her delivery. Her ritual purification was
known as "churching." The Council of Trullus once tried to abolish the festival of
Candlemas, on the ground that in giving birth to Christ, the Virgin "suffered no pollution, and therefore needed no purification."
But Candlemas was not originally a Christian festival. To Roman
pagans, it was the day honoring Juno Februata as the virgin mother of Mars. Like the Lupercalia two weeks later, the day commemorated
the Goddess who engendered the "fever" (febris) of love. 1 Christian
authorities said the pagan people went about Rome with "candles
burning in worship of this woman Februa." Pope Sergius renamed the holy day "to undo this foul use and custom, and turn it onto God's
worship and our Lady's ... so that now this feast is solemnly hallowed through all Christendom." 2
Still, Candlemas was properly considered sacred to women and to the Goddess of Love. 5 Among
Celtic pagans it was the Feast of Imbolg, which stood opposite the great
festival of Lammas in the old sacred year. Omens were taken on Candlemas Day for the new growing season, especially its weather. Therefore animals were said to come
out of hibernation to provide helpful predictions for the end of winter; which is why it is now Groundhog Day. An old rhyme said, "If Candlemas Day be fair and bright, Winter will have another flight; If Candlemas Day be shower and rain, Winter is gone and will not
come again." 4

Cannibalism
The most consistently observed taboo in civilized society is the taboo
against eating human flesh, though there is no comparable taboo against killing, which is done regularly, sometimes in enormous volume, as in
the case of war. Upon finding human sacrifice but not cannibalism among the
Polynesians, Captain Cook called it a shocking waste of the human race, and wrote: "It were much to be wished, that this deluded people
may learn to entertain the same horror of murdering their fellow
creatures ... as they now have of feeding, corporeally, on human flesh
themselves." 1 Of course the good captain failed to notice that the
same delusion dwelt among his own countrymen. Eventually the
135



Cannibalism
Methodius 9th-cen
tury Greek missionary to the Slavs, canonized soon after his death
by the Greek church, and a thousand years later by the Roman.
Christians taught the Polynesians not to murder their fellow-creatures
any more, by the simple expedient of murdering large numbers of Polynesians until they gave up.
Western morality has always allowed and encouraged mass killing, provided the dead never became meals for the living. It has been
noted that the decline of human sacrifice and cannibalism in antiquity
was not accompanied by a decline in human slaughter generally. On the contrary, the scale of warfare steadily increased with the growth of
civilization, up to the point where the highly technical civilizations of
today stand ready to exterminate an entire world. Moreover the highest
casualty lists have been accumulated in precisely the same nations
that call themselves Christian. 2
Churches, declaring themselves officially opposed to killing, have
always managed to justify it nonetheless, when it seemed expedient. Even more curious a contradiction may be found on the matter of
cannibalism, which Christian authorities regarded with the utmost horror. Witches were accused of this crime more than any other, since it
seemed dreadful enough to deserve the merciless punishment its
alleged practitioners received. Yet at the very core of Christian faith lay
the sacrament upon which salvation, redemption, eternal life and all
the rest depended completely: a sacrament of cannibalism, not "sym
bolic" but according to its theological rationale, absolutely real. God-eating was a universal custom descended from the earliest
beginnings of civilization, when it was usually a genuine cannibal feast. As the incarnate god, "the victim is not only slain, but the
worshippers partake of the body and blood of the victim, so that his life passes into their life, and knits them to the deity in living communion." 3
The object was to become flesh of the god's flesh by eating him, so
as to share in the resurrection of the divine flesh. There is no use
pretending that this "Christian" ceremony did not originate in ceremo
nies of real cannibalism as primitive sympathetic magic. All the
mystery-religions of the early Christian era centered on a pseudocannibalistic sacrament believed to identify the worshipper with the
worshipped. "That there was a firm belief in the earlier stages of
religion, of such participation in the god by eating him in a sacramen
tal meal cannot be questioned. In the Thracian-Dionysiac Mysteries, e.g., the celebrants by such a meal obtain a share in the divine life of
the god, and so are called by his name." 4
The same idea underlay Christian sacraments as well as those of
the other Mysteries. Cyril of Jerusalem talked of "partaking of the body and blood of Christ, that you may become con-corporate and con
sanguineous with Him; for thus we become Christophori, his body and his blood entering into our members." Methodius taught that
"every believer must through participation in Christ be born a Christ. ... He was made man that we might be made God." The same
sacrament in other religions, however, was a diabolic rite: "Evil spirits
136



gain power by means of the food consecrated to them, and are
introduced by your own hands into your own bodies; there they hide themselves for a long time and unite with the soul." 5
True cannibalism was still overtly associated with Tibetan sacrifices
up to the 7th century a.d., after which the sacred mystery play
provided symbolic substitutes. A victim made of dough was torn apart, his "entrails" distributed and devoured. Sometimes, real flesh from
the corpse of an executed criminal was inserted into the dough image.
At the atonement festival, a bull-masked priest called the Holy King
of Religion stabbed the sacrificial figure, cut off its limbs, opened the
breast and extracted artificial lungs, heart, and intestines. The remains were scattered by animal-masked dancers, as the remains of Osiris
and other savior-gods of antiquity were scattered over the earth.6 Such dancers recall the Sabeans (Shebans) of Ezekiel 24, called
"women that shed blood," who dressed in golden crowns and bracelets to make mourning for the dead, and "ate the bread of men." Similar
funerary dancers were the Egyptian muu or "mothers," who wore vulture feathers to impersonate the Goddess Mut, or Nekhbet, eater of the dead.
Recently in parts of France it was a custom to make a dough man of the last sheaves of the harvest to represent the human sacrifice. He
was broken in pieces by the make (an old title of a clan mother) and
given to the people to eat. Similarly in Mexico, after human sacrifices
were discontinued, a flint-tipped dart was hurled into the breast of a
dough man. This was known as "killing the god so that his body
might be eaten." In a ceremony called torqualo, "God is eaten," the image was divided into small pieces and distributed among the
people. 7 This was an obvious survival of Aztec religious ideas. The victim
impersonating the god received worship, healed the sick, and blessed
the people, always attended by his keeper-apostles. Then he was killed and butchered in special houses called calpulli, which distributed him.
Nursing mothers would smear their nipples with a victim's holy blood so
even their infants could partake of it. The Greek omophagia was originally a cannibal orgy that even dispensed with cooking. Victims were torn apart with the teeth and
bare hands of the participants and eaten raw. Greek classical writers
preferred to forget the omophagia. They looked down on barbarian
tribes for sexual promiscuity and cannibalizing their family members. 10 What was the relationship between eating sacred kings and saviors and eating family members? The answers have been given by cannibals themselves: women eat the flesh of dead men and bring them back
to life as new children. Primitive people reasoned that, in order to be
born again, one must get inside a woman's body. The simplest way to
accomplish this was to be eaten by her. This was the original root of
the world-wide doctrine of reincarnation: literally, re-clothing in flesh.
Before discovery of the mechanism of conception, a dying man
Cannibalism
The original "barbecue" was a cannibal feast. The word
came from barbricot,
the grill of green boughs on which Carib Indians used to roast human flesh.8 Ancient writings often speak of the cannibalistic habits of elder races. The Norse el
der gods or giants were jotunn, from an Indo-European root word meaning "eaters." They were believed to eat men,
like jack's giant who drank the blood of
Englishmen and made
bread of their bones.9

Cannibalism looked forward to rebirth from one of the tribal mothers who would
convert his flesh and blood into a new baby. Thus the Massagetae _______________ considered being eaten by clan mothers the only honorable death. A man could become flesh of their flesh, and live again. 11 Resurrection
was brought about by the mysterious magic of women who, like the earth, gave life over and over.
Australian native women have been known to eat their infants who
die, then to paint the bones red and hang them about their bodies:
crude magic aimed at returning the child to the matrix and re-coating its
bones with life-giving maternal blood. Women of the Bibinga tribe
stated quite plainly that they ate the dead to give them reincarnation. 12 In New Guinea, a newborn child would receive the soul-name of a
man who was killed and his flesh given to the mother to eat. 13
In 1852, Dr. Hubsch wrote of the African tribe called Niam
Niam: "As soon as one of the tribe dies, his relations, instead of
burying him, cut him up and regale themselves upon his remains;
consequently there are no cemeteries in this land." H Baganda tribesmen said their women sometimes became so hungry that they bit
off their babies' ears probably a euphemistic way of saying they ate the whole baby, confident of their ability to give it another birth. 15
The notion that pregnancy is the result of eating is still widespread
among savages. Words for consuming and conceiving are often the
same. There was an ancient Babylonian proverb: "Who grows pregnant
without having conceived? Who grows fat without having eaten?" 16
According to Horace, the real primal scene was not the sexual drama
postulated by Freud, but "A child, by a fell witch devoured, dragged from her entrails, and to life restored." 17 The Bible's term for birth is
"coming forth from the bowels" (Genesis 1 5:4), for, like children, the ancients were not altogether certain of the distinction between repro
ductive and digestive systems. The Sanhedrin said a woman may
conceive by drinking or bathing in water used to wash a corpse, an
obvious survival of the primitive idea of a dead soul entering a new mother. 18
The Chinese in the Shang period thought birth and rebirth were
the same thing. The pictogram kuei, meaning both "soul" and "rebirth," was a fetus. 19
The Yanomamo say they used to practice cannibalism, because their mother goddess Mamokoriyoma allowed them to eat dead
parents and children. But they ceased to worship her, and declared cannibalism a sin. Cremation of the dead was instituted. Yet they still
eat the ashes of the dead, mixed with food. Sharing the ashes of
important ancestors is a sacred ceremony thought to strengthen kinship bonds. 20
In southeastern Africa, when a woman marries into another
kinship group, she must eat kernels of grain raised on the skull of a
dead ancestor. When she gives birth, elders watch for signs of similarity between the deceased and the new baby. Kernels of grain were
similarly grown on the mummy of Osiris and the body of Adonis, who
138



was born in Bethlehem, the "House of Bread." The grain was eaten
in solemn communion by the god's worshippers, who took it to mean they were like him, and would be reborn like him. Hawaiians had a
god like Osiris, who was dismembered and buried in many earth
wombs. Foodstuffs grew from the parts of his body. 21
Nearly all religions incorporate hidden hints of cannibalism. Apart
from the sacrament of god-devouring that Christianity shared with paganism, the primitive church was accused of real cannibalism. Romans claimed the Christians sacrificed and ate children, and dipped
their host in children's blood. Orthodox authorities didn't deny these
charges, but insisted only the Gnostic sects were to blame. Justin
Martyr said the Marcionites practiced incest and cannibalism. Eusebius
of Caesarea said the Carpocratians did it. Epiphanius said the
Montanists and Ophites did it. Clement of Alexandria, Irenaeus, and the 5th-century Presbyter Salvian all blamed heretic Christians for
holding anthropophagus rites that brought disgrace on the church. 22 Despite powerful taboos, cannibalism was not unknown in medi
eval Europe. In periods of famine or plague, when many starved to death in the streets of European towns, bodies sometimes simply
disappeared. In 1435 the Sawney Beane family of Galloway was accused of having lived on a diet of human flesh for generations; but
they were tortured to death by the court at Edinburgh, which may
render their confessions suspect. 23 In 1661, four Scottish "witches"
were tortured into confessing that they ate an unbaptized child dug up
from the Forfar churchyard. 24 This seems improbable, since the
unbaptized were not buried in churchyards. Next to witches, those most frequently accused of cannibalism were the Jews. See Jews, Persecution of.

Carpet, Magic
Eastern tales of the magic flying carpet evolved from shamanic
initiations in which the adept learned to "fly" via the spirit-journey.
Novices undergoing initiation in central Asia were carried on a felt
carpet by four priests called "sons" of the chief shaman, comparable to the four Sons of Horus carrying the dead man in ancient Egypt. 1
Flying to heaven in trance on the carpet was an integral part of death
and-resurrection ceremonies necessary to the would-be shaman's
enlightenment.

meant she not only foresaw it but actually invoked it on him with her
magic words. Soon after, Agamemnon was slain by his wife Clytemnes

tra and her new lover. The ritualistic manner of his death showed that
it was not a simple murder but a replacement of sacred kings according
to the ancient law of queen's right. See Furies; Kingship.
Caste
Caste
Inventors of the caste system were Indo-European patrilineal tribes
whose early migrations destroyed many centers of Neolithic matriarchy; yet they had to attribute their social hierarchy to the authority of
Mother Earth, the Goddess of final authority. Their eastern offshoots,
calling themselves Aryans, conquered northwestern India and
brought a Dark Age to a formerly flourishing civilization, about the middle of the 2nd millenium B.C. Like the priests of western Europe
in a later Dark Age, the Aryan priests devised the caste system to
relegate native peoples to a lower status, and to preserve this order with a claim of divine ordinance.
This doctrine taught that all those born into low rank were living
out a necessary punishment for sin in a previous existence, even though they may not remember it. Their duty was to accept their lot
without complaint, work hard, and obey their superiors, so as to win a
promotion in the next life. It was perhaps the most effective method of
preserving a hierarchy that human ingenuity has ever produced. 1 Under the rule of the warlike Aryan Aesir, who conquered
Scandinavia's earlier matriarchal tribes, "the castes and professions
are regarded as reflections in the human sphere of the laws of the
natural order." 2 The father of Teutonic castes was Rig-Heimdall, "King of the Sea-Home." Their mother was the Triple Goddess Earth
in all three of her forms.
Rig-Heimdall lay with Edda the Great-Grandmother, oldest of Goddesses, and begot a son named Thrall, "Slave." Then he lay with Amma, the Grandmother, and begot a son named Karl, "Freeman."
They he lay with Modir, the Mother, and begot a son named Jarl, "Earl, prince." These three were ancestors of the castes. The same Rig-Heimdall was named Ram, the phallus. He was sacrificed as a Horned God. Like Scyld, Arthur, and other pagan heroes he was born of the ninth wave of the sea. His Magic Song said
he was born of nine maidens, daughters of the Elder Race, another
multiplication of the same Triple Goddess, everywhere the MotherBride. The Nine made him strong with the sea's cold strength and
with sacrificial blood. 3
Rig-Heimdall resembled the Vedic fire god Agni, Son of the
Waters, who returned to the waters at his death. Some say Agni is periodically reincarnated in the Dalai Lama, another "Son of the Sea." The Rig Veda said of Agni, "He with clear flames unfed with wood, shines in the waters."4 This was not marine luminescence, but an
allegory of the ancient idea that blood was sea water infused with fire,
the element of living heat (see Elements). As the god in dying fertilized Mother Earth with blood, so fire dying in water turned the cold brine
141



Castration into warm red blood of life. This was the primitive theory behind the "mating of fire and water" in both Norse and Vedic myth.
hp^B^BH Apart from the castes in both eastern and western Aryan societies
were the outcastes: India's Untouchables, or pariahs. Their duties
were "carrying water and chopping firewood." Their virtue consisted of
accepting these chores and attending to them faithfully. 5 It is no coincid
ence, but a tradition of genuine Indo-European origin, that the Bible speaks of outcasts who could not be touched, but were allowed to live as "hewers of wood and drawers of water" (Joshua 9:21). Yahweh's
scribes pretended the idea came from their ancestors, but obviously it was borrowed from Far-Eastern concepts of the caste system.

Castration
All mythologies suggest that, before men understood their reproductive role, they tried to "make women" of themselves in the hope of achieving womanlike fertility. Methods included couvade or imitation
childbirth; mock death and rebirth through artificial male mothers; ceremonial use of red substances to imitate menstrual blood; and
transvestism. Another method was ceremonial castration. Its primitive
object was to turn a male body into a female one, replacing dangling
genitals with a bleeding hole. (See Birth-giving, Male.) Many gods became pseudo-mothers by this means. Egypt's solar
god Ra castrated himself to bring forth a race called the Ammiu out
of his blood. 1 The phallus of the Hindu "Great God," Mahadeva, was
removed and chopped to pieces by priestesses of the Goddess. The pieces entered the earth and gave birth to a new race of men, the
Lingajas (Men of the lingam, or phallus). 2 In a Chukchi variant, the Great God Raven acquired feminine secrets of magic for men by
pounding his own penis to a pudding and feeding it to the Goddess Miti (Mother). 3 In Mexico, the savior Quetzalcoatl made new humans
to repopulate the earth after the Flood by cutting his penis and giving blood to the Lady of the Serpent Skirt the Goddess with many shorn
phalli dangling about her waist, a figure also known in the Middle
East, e.g. as Anath.4 Several forms of the Heavenly Father became creators by a rite of
castration. The god Bel cut his "head" (of the penis) and mixed his
blood with clay to make men and animals, copying the magic of Mother Ninhursag. 5 Shamin, the Phoenicians' Father Heaven, was castrated
by his son El and made the world's rivers from his blood, imitating the
Goddess's menstrual magic. Arabs called this god Shams-on, the sun.
The Bible called him Samson, whose blindness and hair-cutting were
both mythic metaphors of castration.
Shearing the sun god's "hair" (rays) meant emasculating him. His
severed penis represented the son/supplanter; and a penis was often called "the little blind one," or "the one-eyed god." Greeks' personifica
142



tion of the phallus, Priapus, was the son of Aphrodite and her
castrated consort Adonis. Their Roman counterparts Vesta and Vulcan
produced a phallic god Caeculus, "the little blind one." 6 Uranus, "Father Heaven," was castrated by his son Cronus. Uranus's severed genitals entered the sea-womb and fertilized it to
produce a new incarnation of the Virgin Aphrodite Urania, "Celestial
Aphrodite." It was she who ruled the earlier cults of castrated gods,
such as Anchises and Adonis. She was the same as the Canaanites' Lady
of the Serpent Skirt: her priests castrated gods in her honor.
So did the priests of Aphrodite's Nordic counterpart, Freya-Skadi.
The Nordic Father Heaven was Odin, whose twelfth holy name was
Jalkr, "Eunuch." 7 As a castrated god, Odin was the son-phallus of an
older Eunuch personifying both father and son; for Odin was also the
One-Eyed God, or Volsi, a "stallion penis." 8 (See Horse.) Like the
stallion of the Vedic horse sacrifice, he was castrated. A late myth tried
to account for Odin's crude phallic title by saying he could not drink of the cosmic feminine fountain of wisdom until he had given up one of
his eyes.9 Here one might recall the alternating seasonal castrations
of Set and Horus in Egypt, their severed phalli mythologically described
Castration
as "eyes.' 10 Biblical writers called the penis a "sinew that shrank," lying "upon the hollow of the thigh." This was the sinew that Jacob lost in his
duel with "a man who was a god." Jacob, "the Supplanter," was
another name for Seth, or Set, who was likewise symbolized by the
Ladder of Souls and likewise engaged in a contest with his rival, ending
in his castration. 11 When Set was castrated, his blood was spread over
the fields in the annual ceremony of sowing so as to fertilize the crops. 12
The Book of Genesis confuses the two aspects of the god-king,
who as Jacob won his battle with the incumbent king and supplanted
him, then as Israel lost his battle with the next supplanter, and was
castrated. Is-Ra-El may have been a corruption of Isis-Ra-El, the god
enthroned as the consort of his goddess, awaiting the next challenger. 13
The syllable El meant his deification.
The garbled story of Jacob and the god-man was inserted chiefly to
support the Jews' taboo on eating a penis (Genesis 32:32), formerly a habit of sacred kings upon their accession to the throne. The genitals of
the defeated antagonist were eaten by the victor, to pass the phallic
spirit from one "god" to the next. A king's virtu, "manliness," or heill, "holiness," dwelt in his genitals because that was his point of contact
with the Goddess-queen. Innumerable myths of father-castrating, moth
er-marrying god-kings arose, not so much from inner Oedipal jealousies as from actual customs of royal succession in antiquity. See
Kingship; Oedipus. The Greek King Aegeus died at the very moment when his "son,"
Theseus, arrived from Crete to claim his throne. The key to this
myth is that Aegeus was "rendered sterile" by a curse, the same ritual
curse laid on all kings of outworn usefulness, followed very shortly
by castration and death. 14
143



Castration In the sacred dramas of Canaan, the reed scepter of the dying god
Mot was broken, to signify his castration. 15 His name, meaning "steril
^^mmmm^^^^^ ity" or "death," was a title of the fertility god Aleyin (Baal) as he
entered his declining phase, when his rival assumed the sacred throne, and he became Lord of Death. 16 The custom of eating the defeated
king's genitals appears in a number of Middle-Eastern myths, e.g., that of the Hittite god Kumarbi, one of a line of father-castrating kings of
heaven. 17 Kumarbi's assumption of the fertility-spirit was expressed by the story that he "became pregnant." Mythic fathers and sons demonstrated remarkable hostility toward
each other's genitals. Scholars tend to regard this as an expression of
Oedipal aggressions, originating in the jealousy of elder males toward younger, more virile ones. Though men eventually gave up the hopeless idea of making one of their number pregnant by redesigning his body in a feminine style, customs of castration and crypto
castration persisted because they offered an outlet for this male jealousy.
Among savages, men's puberty ceremonies generally provided an excuse for elder men's attacks on the bodies of youths. Modified
castrations may be inflicted in the form of circumcision, subincision, and
other genital wounds; also a variety of torments such as scarifying
flesh, knocking out teeth, beatings, torture, and homosexual rape. 18 "The dramatized anger of both the father and the circumciser and the
myths of the original initiation in which all the boys were killed,
certainly show the Oedipal aggression of the elder generation as the basic drive behind initiation." 19
The more patriarchal the society, the more brutal its attacks on
male youth, as a general rule. Notable for brutality was the Moslems' Es
selkh or scarification ceremony, a complete flaying of skin from a
boy's scrotum, penis, and groin. After enduring this, the victim was further tormented by application of salt and hot sand, and buried up
to the waist in a dunghill, making subsequent infection almost inevita
ble. Burton commented, "This ordeal was sometimes fatal." 20
Legman pointed out that both Islam and Judaism "share in the surgical
intimidation of the son by the father, just at the threshold of puberty,
either in the psychological castration of circumcision at puberty (Mo
hammedanism), or this same operation effected at the earlier age of
eight days (Judaism), or in a reminiscence of this operation." 21 Subincision provides an example of transition from a female
imitative rationale to a male sado-masochistic ritual. As practiced by
the Arunta, it began with a long sliver of bone inserted into the urethra.
The youth's penis was then sawed open with a sharp flint, down to the level of the bone. Blood flowing from the wound was directed onto
a sacred fire, like the menstrual blood of girls at menarche. The operation was termed "man's menstruation." 22 The wound was called a
"vagina." 23 The obvious purpose of this unpleasantness was to transform a
male into a pseudo-female. The mutilated youth was even obliged to
urinate by squatting, like a woman. Sometimes, men renewed the
144



damage several times over, repeating the litany: "We are not separat- Castration
ed from the mother; for we two are one."' 24 Natives said the custom
was begun by an ancestral spirit, Mulkari or Mu-Kari, perhaps a _^^__^^^
corrupt form of Mother Kali (Ma-Kali), who was known as Kari in ^""^^^^
Malaysia. 25
Far from supporting the Freudian doctrine of penis envy, primitive
customs seem to suggest vulva envy as the original motive behind ritual castrations. It might be found even in civilized society. Bettelheim remarked on the desire of some young men to be circumcised, or
otherwise subjected to bloodletting, when their girl friends were starting
to menstruate. 26 Circumcision was surely a modified form of earlier, female-imitative castrations.
The institution of circumcision was attributed to the same gods,
such as El, who castrated their fathers. Its object was to feminize. In
India, boys were dressed as girls, nose ring and all, on the eve of the circumcision ceremony. In ancient Egypt also, boys on their way to
circumcision wore girls' clothing, and were followed by a woman
sprinkling salt, a common Egyptian symbol of life-giving menstrual blood. 27
Circumcision took place at the age of thirteen, the number of months in a year according to ancient menstrual calendars, and the traditional age of menarche. After copying circumcision from the
Egyptians, Jews transferred it to the period of infancy, leaving the
pubertal ceremony, now called bar mitzvah, awkwardly placed at a point in a boy's life when nothing really happens, in contrast to the sudden onset of menarche in a girl.
Infant circumcision was attributed to Moses, who insisted on it
against the will of his Midianite wife Zipporah, who apparently
objected to mutilation of her infant. After performing the operation, she
flung the foreskin at Moses's feet, calling him a bloody husband
(Exodus 4:25). Other biblical passages show that foreskins were considered appro
priate offerings to Yahweh. David bought his wife Michal from
Yahweh's representative the king, with 200 Philistine foreskins (1
Samuel 18:27). Other Heavenly Fathers made similar demands for
genital gifts. Male animals sacrificed to Rome's Heavenly Father Jupiter
were gelded. 28 The bull representing the castrated savior Attis was
also castrated. 29 His blood conferred spiritual rebirth on those who
bathed in it, like the blood of the Christian "Lamb," as if it were the
secret blood of the womb, the real source of life according to the oldest
beliefs. 30
Castration as a means of acquiring feminine powers was still evi
dent among priesthoods of the Great Mother, along with other female-imitative devices such as transvestism. Self-emasculated priests in female clothing served the Indian Goddess under her name of
Hudigamma. 31 Similar eunuch priests tended Middle-Eastern temples like those of the Dea Syria at Hierapolis, Artemis-Diana in Anatolia, and the Magna Mater in Phrygia and Rome. 32 The famous seer of
145



Castration Thebes, Teiresias, got his powers of second sight and prophecy by becoming a woman, possibly by castration, and living as a temple harlot ^^^^^^^^^^^m for seven years.
Perhaps the best-known self-emasculators in the ancient world
were priests of Attis and Cybele, the Great Mother. As Attis was
castrated and poured out his lifeblood to fructify her, so his priests in
imitation of his sacrifice cut off their genitals and gave them to the
Goddess's image. 53 Sometimes, the men's severed members were
thrown into houses, as a special blessing. In return, householders gave the new eunuchs feminine garments to wear. Sometimes, the severed
genitalia were carried in baskets or cistae to the Mother's innermost
shrine, where they were anointed, even gilded, and solemnly buried in the Bridal Chamber. 34 The phallus of the god himself was carried
into the sacred cavern in the form of a large pine log, which was also, like the phallic cross of Middle-Eastern saviors, the instrument on
which he died. 35 His priests, having copied his self-sacrifice, were
distinguished by the androgynous title bestowed on the earliest forms
of Shiva; they were "lords who were half woman." 36
Tertullian admitted that the "divine mysteries" of Christianity
were virtually the same as the "devilish mysteries" of pagan saviors
like Attis. 37 Popularity of Attis's cult in Rome led to Christian adoption
of some of the older god's ways. One of the best-kept secrets of early Christianity was its preaching of castration for the special inner circle of
initiates, who won extra grace with this demonstration of chastity. They taught, following the Wisdom of Solomon, "Blessed is the
eunuch, which with his hands hath wrought no iniquity." 38 Jesus himself advocated castration: "There be eunuchs, which have made
themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able
to receive it, let him receive it" (Matthew 19:12).
Several early fathers of the church did receive it. Origen was highly
praised for having castrated himself. 39 Justin's Apologia said proudly that Roman surgeons were besieged by faithful Christian men requesting the operation. Tertullian declared, "The kingdom of heaven is thrown open to eunuchs." 40 Justin advised that Christian boys be
emasculated before puberty, so their virtue was permanently protected.41 Three Christians who tried to burn Diocletian's palace were
described as eunuchs.42 Throughout the middle ages, cathedral choirs included castrati,
emasculated before puberty to preserve their virtue and their soprano voices, which were considered more pleasing to God than the "impure" female soprano. Women were not allowed to sing in church choirs,
anyway. Castration was advocated also for monks who could not fend off
the demons of sexual desire. It was forcibly imposed on the monk Abelard, whose love affair with his pupil Heloise caused a scandal in the
church. But there were others who seem to have accepted surgical
chastity on a voluntary basis. Such men assumed the title of Hesychasti,
"permanently chaste ones," or "those who are at peace." The title
146



was associated particularly with the monks of Mount Athos, so carefully
ascetic that even to the present day no female creature is allowed on
the holy mountain hens, cows, sows, nanny goats, and women all
equally forbidden. 43
It is likely that Mount Athos was named after Attis, and may have
been a shrine served by his eunuch priests in pre-Christian times, situated close to his Phrygian home. There was a Magna Mater figure
connected with Mount Athos up to the early 14th century. The
monks were labeled heretics for being too deeply involved with the
teachings of a certain so-called nun named Irene "Peace," the
third persona of Triple Aphrodite embodied in her priestess-Horae. Irene, as Crone, would have been the priestess of castrations hinted in the myths of such lovers of the Goddess as Anchises and Adonis.44
When the church purged Mount Athos of the influence of Irene, the
abbot Lazarus was expelled. With a companion named Barefooted
Cyril, Lazarus wandered through Bulgaria preaching the redeeming virtues of nakedness and self-emasculation.45
It seems the cult of Attis and Cybele continued to influence
Christianity in the Balkans for many centuries. Balkan monastic
communities were organized in groups of fifty, like older "colleges" of the Great Mother's castrated priests. In Thrace, the Great Mother had the name of Cottyto, mother of the hundred-handed giant Cottus,
an allegorical figure representing her fifty spiritual sons with two
hands each. 46 Her worship persisted underground, long enough for the church to define it as witchcraft, and to label Cottyto a demon. In
1619 a booklet published in Paris suggested the same Balkan tradition of
the priest who dedicated himself to God in a manner that was then
considered heretical: "the devil cut off his privy parts." 47
Ritual castration was again revived by 1 8th-century Russian secta
ries calling themselves Skoptsi, "castrated ones." 48 They also called
themselves People of God, insisting that removal of their genitals
brought them profound spiritual powers. Russia's "mad monk" Rasputin was a member of this sect. 49 Since Rasputin was famed for his
affairs with women, few of his contemporaries would Jiave believed
him a eunuch; but they had forgotten what eastern harem-keepers knew
well enough: that eunuchs are quite capable of providing women with sexual pleasure. Rasputin's hold over his female devotees was in
any case a curious combination of spiritual and sensual obsession.

Castration

Cat Cat
Along with the owl, the bat, and the wolf, the animal most commonly
^^^mmmmt^mmm^ associated with witches was the cat. Like everything else associated with
witchcraft, this idea dated back to ancient Goddess-worship. The Teutonic Mother Freya rode in a chariot drawn by cats. 1
Artemis-Diana often appeared in cat form, and was identified with
the Egyptian cat-goddess Bast. The willow sacred to Hecate became a
pussy-willow that bore "catkins" in the spring. 2
Cat worship began in Egypt, where the first domesticated cats
descended from a wild ancestor, felis hbyca? Plutarch said the cat was
carved on Isis's holy sistrum and represented the moon, "[i]ts activity in the night, and the peculiar circumstances which attend its fecundity
making it a proper emblem of that body. For it is reported of this
creature, that it at first brings forth one, then two, afterwards three,
and so goes on adding one to each former birth till it comes to seven; so
that she brings forth twenty-eight in all, corresponding as it were to the several degrees of light, which appear during the moon's revolutions." 4
The Egyptian word for cat was Mau, both an imitation of the cat's
cry, and a mother-syllable. Cats were so sacred in Egypt that any man
who killed one was condemned to death. Diodorus, a first-century B.C.
Greek historian, told of a foolish Roman who killed a cat in Egypt and
was slain in his own house by an infuriated mob. 5
Bast, the Cat-mother of the city of Bubastis, was the benevolent
aspect of Hathor, the Lioness. Festivals of Bast were joyful with music,
dancing, jokes, and sexual rites.6 Her dark side was Hathor as the
leonine Sphinx, Sekhmet (Greek Sakhmis), tearer and devourer of
men. 7 "By my life, when I slay men my heart rejoices," she said. Her feast day commemorated a massacre once perpetrated by Sekhmet the
Great Cat. The Egyptian calendar of lucky and unlucky days noted for
this one, with inadvertent humor: "Hostile, hostile, hostile is the 12th
Tybi. Avoid seeing a mouse on this day." 8 Medieval belief in the cat's nine lives probably stemmed from the
Egyptian Ennead, via the mythic figure of the Ninefold Goddess. It was
often said any witch could assume a cat's shape nine times in her life. 9 She could also assume the shape of a hare. 10 Frazer observed: "Cats are
precisely the animals into which, with the possible exception of hares,
witches were most usually supposed to transform themselves." n Brought to England, cats were confused with hares as the Moon
goddess's totems. The root language of Sanskrit called the moon cacin, "that marked with the Hare," but some said the lunar animal might be a
cat. 12 Queen Boadicea's banners bore the device of the moon-hare, which was also dedicated to the Saxon Goddess Eostre (Easter) at her
rites of spring: hence the Easter Bunny. Irish peasants still observe the
matriarchal taboo on hare meat, saying to eat a hare is to eat one's
grandmother. 13 Both hares and cats had obviously yonic nicknames:
cunny, pussy. A rabbit warren is still called a cunnary. 14
148



To the Scots, the Goddess of Witches was Mither o' the Mawkins. Catherine, Saint
"Mawkin" or "malkm" was either a hare or a cat. 15 When the cat
became the primary lunar animal, the traditional witch's familiar was ^____
Greymalkin or Grimalkin, a "gray cat." Gray malkins were also the ^^^^^ "pussies" or "catkins" on the pussy willow, sacred to witches and heralding the pagan games of May.
Inquisitor Nicholas Remy said all cats were demons. In 1387,
Lombard witches were said to worship the devil as a cat. 16 Christians
sometimes exposed cats to torture and fire along with witches. At certain
festivals, such as Midsummer, Easter, and Shrove Tuesday, it was customary to burn cats in wicker cages. "The cat, which represented the
devil, could never suffer enough." 17 According to Jewish belief, cats were not made by God. The first pair of male and female cats were "snorted forth" from the nostrils of a lion on board Noah's ark. 18

Catherine, Saint
One of the most popular saints of all time despite the fact that she
never existed. In the hearts of many people she was second only to the
virgin Mary. 1 Yet even Catholic scholars admit her legend is
"preposterous." 2 The key to the secret of St. Catherine is her so-called Catherine Wheel, the wheel of fire on which she was said to have been
martyred. At Sinai, the original center of Catherine's cult, the Asiatic Goddess was once portrayed as the Dancer on the Fiery Wheel at
the hub of the universe. A Greek convent of priestess-nuns at Sinai in
the 8th century a.d. called themselves kathari, "pure ones," a word
akin to the Kathakali temple-dancers of India, who performed the Dance of Time in honor of Kali, Goddess of the karmic wheel. 5
The symbol of the wheel figured prominently in beliefs of medieval Gnostics who called themselves Cathari, and revered St.
Catherine almost as a female counterpart of God. Perhaps for this
reason, in the 1 5 th and 16th centuries, after the Cathari were
exterminated, Catholic prelates made efforts to have St. Catherine eliminated from the canon. 4
Her Christian myth made her the standard young beauty dedicated
to virginity, and so wise she could demolish the arguments of fifty
philosophers at once. She refused the hand of the emperor in marriage,
whereupon he following the hagiographers' usual curious pattern essayed to win her love by having her imprisoned and tortured.
Her captors tried to break her on the fiery wheel, but the wheel was
149



Cauldron shattered by a sudden bolt of lightning and she was saved. In the end, she had to be beheaded. Milk flowed from her veins instead of blood.
Angels carried her body from Alexandria to Sinai, where her relics were "discovered" 500 years later. 5 Her divine bones constantly exuded a
healing unguent, which was bottled and sold at great profit to the convent. 6

The Bible called
lapis lazuli sappur or "holy blood." It was the substance of God's
throne (Ezekiel 1:26). The Authorized
Version inaccurately translates sappur as
"sapphire." 8
Cauldron
The symbol commonly opposed to the cross, as the witches' object of worship; in pagan tradition, the Great Mother's cosmic womb. As the
"pot of blood in the hand of Kali," the cauldron signified cyclic
recurrence, as opposed to the patriarchal view of linear time.
Shakespeare followed the traditional pattern in associating the cauldron with three witches, since, from its earliest appearances in
Bronze Age and Iron Age cultures, the cauldron stood for the Triple Goddess of fate, or wyrd in Old English: the three Weird Sisters. 1
The Egyptian hieroglyphic sign of the threefold Creatress, mother
of the sun, the universe, and all the gods, was a design of three
cauldrons. 2 The Norse god Odin stole his divine power from three cauldrons of Wise Blood in the cave-womb of the earth, where he
entered in the shape of a phallic serpent and beguiled the earth-giantess by making love to her. 3 Then he drank the magic blood from the
cauldrons and became a shape-shifter, turning himself into a bird to carry the precious blood back to other gods. This myth was based on
that of the Aryan sky-god Indra, who also drank the Goddess's ambrosia
from three cauldrons, the three wombs of Kali's trinity. 4 Indra stole
the elixir by allowing himself to be swallowed by a vast serpent
representing female sexuality (Kundalini). He too turned into a bird to carry the elixir to other gods.
In nearly all mythologies there is a miraculous vessel. Sometimes it
dispenses youth and life, at other times it possesses the power of healing, and occasionally, as with the mead cauldron ofthe Nordic Ymir, inspiring strength and wisdom are to be found in it. Often . . . it effects
transformations. s
The cauldron that effected transformations was the same as the
womb that churned out rebirths, changing shapes each time. In Babylon it was under the control of the Fate-goddess Siris, mother of stars. Her
cauldron was the blue heaven, where she stirred the mead of
regeneration. "Siris, the wise woman, the mother, who had done what was necessary. Her cauldron is of shining lapis lazuli. Her tub is of
pure silver and gold. In mead stands jubilation, in mead sits rejoicing." 6
Lapis lazuli was the blue heaven stone prized for its power to cause
rebirth. The Papyrus of Nekhtu-Amen said an amulet of lapis lazuli
150



stood for the heart (ab), source of mother-blood; therefore the amulet was inserted into a mummy to generate a new heart for the deceased. 7
Chaldean cosmology saw the sky as a nesting of seven vessels, the planetary spheres, like inverted bowls or cauldrons. Beneath the earth lay the mirror image of this celestial realm, seven more spheres some
times described as cauldrons. A Hittite myth called them the vessels
of Mother Death, dark twin sister of the heavenly Mother Siris: "The
doorkeeper has opened the seven doors, has unlocked the seven bolts. Down in the dark earth there stand seven cauldrons, their lids oiabaru
metal, their handles of iron. Whatever goes in there comes not out
again." 9 Egyptians sometimes saw the seven-circled nether womb as a
regenerative cauldron called the Lake of Fire. 10 The corresponding
celestial vessels were "above heaven." n But the divine cauldron also
appeared right on earth, within the sacred precincts of the temple. King Aeson was resurrected after being boiled in the cauldron of
Medea, "Mead of Wisdom," eponymous mother goddess of the Medes. King Minos too was boiled in the Goddess's cauldron and
deified in Tartarus, where he became a judge and a Lord of Death.
Under the name of Demeter, the Goddess restored Pelops to life in her
cauldron. 15 According to his inscription at Mount Hermon, the Roman emperor Elagabalus was likewise "deified in the cauldron." 16
St. John the Evangelist was oddly assimilated to the pagan myth of the regenerative cauldron. He was boiled in it and came forth livelier
than before. His symbols were a bleeding heart and a boiling cauldron. 17
The syncretism of the "Feast of St. John at the Latin Gate"
eventually became too embarrassing, and the festival was expunged from the Christian calendar in I960. 18 The apocryphal St. George,
however, continued to enter the cauldron as one of his alleged tortures.
By making the sign of the cross, he rendered it lukewarm and
harmless, an example of a matriarchal symbol made subordinate to a
patriarchal one. 19 Among the Celts of Gaul and Britain, the Cauldron of Regen
eration was the central religious mystery: reincarnation within the womb
of the Goddess. The Irish who worshipped the threefold Morrigan
called the second person of her trinity Badb, "Boiling," the producer of
life, wisdom, inspiration, and enlightenment. 20 To Welsh bards she was the Goddess Branwen, "one of the three Matriarchs of the Island," owner of the Cauldron of Regeneration in
which dead men could be resuscitated overnight. 21 As "a powerful fairy queen," the Lady of the Lake of the Basin, she dwelt in a sacred lake from which her brother Bran the Blessed raised the cauldron later known as the Holy Grail. 22 This pagan god was Christianized as
Bron, alleged brother-in-law of Joseph of Arimathea who was supposed
to have brought the Grail to Britain. Actually, the Grail was well
established in British paganism long before its legend was assimilated to
Cauldron
Large cauldrons in
Egyptian temples were called shi, the prototype of the brass "sea" in Solomon's temple, which was certainly a Cauldron of Regeneration. 12 Babylonian temples had the same vessel, called apsu or
"abyss," for baptism, ceremonial lavage, and rebirth rituals." Such a "sea" was also called "the Deep," tehom in Hebrew.' * Like the Christian
baptismal font descended from these
forerunners, the cauldron or "sea" was a
womb symbol. Solomon's "sea"
represented his Goddess, Ashtoreth
(Astarte). It was decorated with her
yonic lilies: "The brim thereof was
wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies"
(1 Kings 7:26).
151



Cauldron that of Christ. 23 Branwen, Goddess of the Cauldron, had yet another incarnation in medieval romance as Brangwain, the wise-woman who
^^^^^^^^^^^m gave Tristan and Iseult their fatal love potion. 24
The Goddess had earthly incarnations too. Childeric, son of Merovech or Merovig, founder of the first dynasty of French kings, married a druidess named Basina (Cauldron), who foretold the future of
his dynasty. 25 Like the "seas" in ancient temples, the Cauldron of Regeneration
also had its counterparts on earth. Each Celtic temple had its sacred
cauldron. Aubrey's A Natural History ofSurrey mentioned a pagan
cauldron still preserved in Frensham Church, "an extraordinary great
kettle or cauldron" brought by the fairies, according to local legend. 26
An 8th-century Salic Law against priestesses or, as the church called them, witches prohibited the pagan practice of "bearing the cauldron" in procession to "the places where they cook." 27 The Welsh bard Taliesin claimed to have received the mead of wisdom from his mother, the Goddess Cerridwen, "the Celtic Great Mother, the Demeter." 28
She resolved, according to the arts ofthe books ofFferyllt (Fairy-wisdom)., to boil a Cauldron ofInspiration and Science for her son . . . which
from the beginning ofits boiling might not cease to boil for a year and a day, until three blessed drops were obtained ofthe Grace of
Inspiration. 29
Taliesin's poetry contained oblique allusions to the magic caul
dron, couched in the semi-opaque terms that concealed mystical secrets from the uninitiated. His "year and a day" was a reference to the
lunar calender of the pagans, a year of thirteen 28-day lunar months, 364 days, with one more day to make 365. The same "year and a
day" occurred in many fairy tales. (See Menstrual Calendar.) Talie
sin's Preiddeu Annwn (Harrowings of Hell) spoke of the Nine
Maidens, priestesses of the perpetual fire that boiled the symbolic world
cauldron; and of the yonic shrine, Hel's gate, to which the king's
sword (or phallus) was lifted:
In Caer Pedryvan (four times revolving) The Word from the cauldron it would be spoken By the breath ofnine maidens it would be kindled, The head ofHades 's cauldron what is it like?
A rim it has, with pearls round its border; It boils not a cowards food: it would not be perjured. The sword ofLlwch Lleawc would be lifted to it. And in the hand ofLleminawc was it left. And before the door ofHell's gate lamps were burning,
And when we accompanied Arthur, a brilliant effort, Seven alone did we return from Caer Veddwit. i0
Nine sisters were the same as the nine Goddesses of the
Fortunate Isles ruled by Morgan le Fay, and the nine Muses of Greek
myth, and the pre-Hellenic ninefold Goddess Nonacris, queen of the
152



Stygian birth-gate. 51 She, or they, came from Oriental traditions almost as old as civilization. During their Bronze Age Shang period, the
Chinese represented the Great Goddess of birth by nine tripod cauldrons like the mixing-vessels of the Muses. 32
The primitive cult of the cauldron obviously discouraged "cow
ards" because it was cult of martyrdom. Like Christian martyrs, the
cauldron's victims were promised immediate resurrection into a life of
glory. Strabo spoke of Cimbrian priestesses who sacrificed men,
making them divine heroes, and caught their blood in magic cauldrons and read omens in their entrails. 33
Some myths hint at cannibal cauldrons large enough to boil a
human body, and beliefs that death in the cauldron was not really
death. A gypsy legend spoke of a hero forced by a mystic Lady to milk dangerous mares, then bathe in a boiling cauldron of their milk. A
god in the form of a royal horse promised to breathe frost on the cauldron and render it comfortably lukewarm. 34 The story recalls the
Corinthians' "man-eating mares," or horse-masked priestesses, who caused Bellerophon to mount to heaven on the royal horse Pegasus,
symbol of apotheosis after death. 35 Horseback riding is a sign of deification on the famous silver
sacrificial cauldron recovered from a Gundestrup peat bog. Manufac
tured about 100 B.C., the vessel showed a ceremony of sacrifice. Victims
appear to be identified with the Horned God, Cernunnos, seated in a
yogi's lotus position holding male and female symbols, the serpent and tore. 36 On foot, a row of victims approach the sacred cauldron which
is shield-shaped and double-lobed, resembling a yoni. A priest or priestess is shown plunging one victim headfirst into the vessel. 37
Above, the heroes depart glorified, on horseback, riding literally into the sunset, which represented heaven. Cernunnos himself was dismembered and cooked in a cauldron to rise again, which made him the
obvious god for such rites. 38
A scene similar to that of the Gundestrup Cauldron occurs on a
sacred cista from Palestrina-Praeneste. Rome's Mother of Time,
Anna Perenna, appears to the dying god Mars in the guise of his virgin bride, Minerva. She stands over her naked lover and pushes his head
down into a boiling cauldron, while the dog of the underworld gate
looks on, as also on the Gundestrup example. 39 Some pagan Mysteries employed visions of the Cauldron as symbolic death and rebirth. Before a Siberian shaman could practice,
he was required to undergo hallucinatory experiences of being chopped to pieces and boiled in a cauldron, sometimes for a period as long as
three years. Yakut, Buryat, and other tribes say the shaman must be
killed by the spirits of ancestors, cooked in their magic cauldron, then
given new flesh. "Shaman" comes from Tungusic saman, "one who died," a man assimilated to the Lord of Death called Samana in
Sanskrit. Tibetan shamans made the soul-journey to the "Great Hell"
pictured as an iron cauldron, called House of Iron or Iron Mountain.

Cimbri Germanic tribes from Jutland, which Romans called the Cimbrian peninsula. In the 2nd century B.C., a Cimbrian army marched against Rome and caused great consternation in the
city.

Cave There the aspirant was dismembered by rakshasas obsolete ancestral
deities and boiled, not in punishment for sin but as an initiatory
procedure. 40 Skald-shamans of Scandinavia made the same soul-journey to
Hvergelmir, the Mighty Roaring Cauldron, source of life-giving waters at the foundations of the earth. This was another version of the
triple cauldron in the earth-womb, from which Odin received inspira
tion and power. Hvergelmir was triple too, accompanied by the fount of wisdom and memory called Mimir (an archaic "mother"), and the
fount of ongoing life called Urdarbrunner, the stream of Mother Earth. Founts and cauldrons in the earth were tended by the three Fates
(Norns), of whom the first was Mother Earth herself.41 Even when the Cauldron of Regeneration entered Christian
tradition as the Holy Grail, supposedly the chalice of Christ's last
supper, it was referred to as an escuele or "cauldron." 42 Arthur's knights
originally sought the Grail in the underworld of Annwn, receiving their divine vision of it in the castle of Elaine, or Elen, the virgin aspect
of the triple Moon-goddess. It appeared in her hands, heralded by her yonic dove. It meant death for her chosen one, Galahad, who reigned as
a sacred king, then died at the altar as he saw his vision of the Grail.43
The Cistercian Estoire del Saint Graal said "two heathen rulers," Mordrain and Nascien (Death and Rebirth) were blinded by the vision of the Grail, but healed by the touch of the lance that pierced
Christ, both of these objects being kept in the same sanctuary.44 The motive seems to have been to belittle the female symbol (grail) in favor
of the male symbol (lance).

Cave
Porphyry said before there were temples, all religious rites took place
in caves. 1 The cave was universally identified with the womb of Mother
Earth, the logical place for symbolic birth and regeneration. Etruscan and Roman temples featured a subterranean mundus, meaning both "earth" and "womb." 2 Similarly, the Sanskrit word for a sanctuary, garbha-grha, meant "womb." 3 Holy places of Hinduism were caves representing the Great
154
X



Mother's yoni. Many gompas (holy hermitages) were first established Cave
in caves. Like the^mountain of paradise, home of the gods, the Four
Great Caves of Sikkim were distinguished according to the four ^^^^^___^_
cardinal points. North is the cave of the god's hill; west, the cave of great
happiness; south, the cave of occult fairies; east, the secret cave, from which the sun is born. 4
Among the oldest forms of the Hindu Goddess was Kurukulla, a" matrikadevi colored red like the womb, and called Mother of Cav
erns. 5 As an emanation of Kali she was worshipped in cave-temple
complexes like Ellora, Ajanta, Elephanta. Her western counterpart was Phrygian Cybele, "Cavern-dweller," the Great Mother of the Gods. A Latin form of her name was Sybil, the prophetic spirit in the
cavern-dwelling Cumaean sybils, by whose order the Great Mother of the Gods was brought to Rome in 204 b.c.
Cybele's castrated priests claimed none of their brotherhood ever
died. Instead, they went "down into the cavern" to be united with
their Goddess. Cybele's cavern-shrines were also called marriage cham
bers, like the pastos of Eleusis. The Alexandrian poet Nicander called them "marriage bowers of Rhea Lobrine." 6 They were also the "sacred
subterranean places" where those who had emasculated themselves
in honor of Attis and Cybele used to come to deposit the offering of
their genitals. 7 Rhea was the Cretan name of the same Goddess, during the long period when fatherhood was unknown or negligible in Cretan soci
ety. 8 All life was supposed to have arisen from her uterine cave on
Mount Dicte, whence came the e-dicts of her holy law; hence her
title of Dictynna, Lawgiver. She was also called Britomartis the "sweet
virgin," the mother without a spouse.9 From the same uterine cave
she gave birth to Zeus, who later claimed to be Father of Gods.
Cave-temples of Rhea Dictynna evolved into dicteria, which the
Laws of Solon designated public brothels. In the era of the promiscu
ous priestesses, words for cave, temple, and brothel were often
interchangeable. 10 To visit the cave and lie with the holy harlot was
an act of worship. During the early Christian era, most pagan mystery cults celebrated their most sacred rites in caves or underground
chambers. Followers of Mithra considered the cave so essential to proper
worship that, if the site of a temple had no natural cave, an artificial
one was dug. The cave on the Vatican belonged to Mithra until 376
a.d., when a city prefect suppressed the cult of the rival Savior and seized the shrine in the name of Christ, on the very birthday of the
pagan god, December 25. 11 Despite the church's efforts at suppression, the old deities contin
ued to be worshipped in sacred caves for many centuries. So many
"grottoes" contained pagan idols that decorative ideas for cathedral
sculptures were copied from them: hence the grotesques or "grottocreatures" swarming in Gothic art. As late as the 1 5th century, Pope
155



Cave Calixtus II tried to forbid religious ceremonies in sacred caves. 12 As
entrances to the underworld, caves were still associated with the Great
^^^^^^^^^^^^ Mother's yonic gate. A long-revered gate to the womb of the world
was a sea-cave on the southern Peloponnese near the shrine of Marmari Mother Mari, the Sea-goddess whose other names were
Aphrodite Marina, Marah, and Mary. 13 Up to the 1 8th century, a cave called Tangrogo in Denbighshire was kept by "three fairy sisters" the three Fates whose footprints
were often seen around the edge of its magic pool. The cave was said to
contain "hidden treasures," a term that often meant paraphernalia of
the Old Religion. 14 Spenser said the hidden treasures of the Faery Queen's Bower of
Bliss were the same as those of the virgin Mary's secret "enclosed
garden": a magic pool of regeneration, a Tree of Life, singing birds, apples, and roses, including the central Rose of Love. Andreas
Capellanus said the grotto of the pagan Goddess was a Palace of Love in the center of the earth (in medio mundi), with the male and
female symbols of a Tree of Life and a sacred spring. 15
Sacred caves were still used as "marriage bowers" long after
paganism had been forced underground literally. Bards who adored the heretical Goddess of Love (Minne) mentioned certain Grottoes of
Love, hewn by heathen giants in the wild mountains, where people could hide when "they wished privacy to make love." Gottfried von
Strassburg said whenever such a cave was found, it was sealed with a
bronze door inscribed La fossiure a le gent amant, the Grotto for People
in Love. "Above, the vault was finely joined, and on the keystone there was a crown, embellished beautifully by the goldsmith's art with an incrustation of gems. The pavement below was of a smooth,
shining and rich marble, green as grass. In the center stood a bed, handsome and cleanly hewn of crystal, high and wide, well raised from the ground, and engraved round about with letters which
according to the legend proclaimed its dedication to the goddess Love." 16
The healing waters of all the sacred springs in Europe acquired new myths ascribing their virtues to saints or to the Virgin, but their
real traditions sprang from the regenerative caves of the pagan Goddess.
Up to the 19th century a sacred cave near Dunskey, Scotland, was
used for the curative magic of its spring. The sick were brought from
great distances to be bathed in the waters, always "at the change of
the moon," showing that the place was a matriarchal shrine. Its magic
baptisms were believed especially beneficial to weak or undernour
ished children. 17

Cecilia, Saint - ...
' Cealia, Saint Mythical saint whose legend was built on some bones discovered by Centaurs
Pope Paschal I in a Roman catacomb bearing the name Calliste __
probably Artemis Calliste as the Muse of music, which became the
special province of "St. Cecilia."' Fired by the current mania for relic
hunting (9th century a.d.), the pope immediately declared that
Cecilia was a virgin martyr of the second or maybe the third century,
and that she was tortured to death for rejecting her pagan bridegroom
on the very day of their wedding. He ordered her canonized at once. 2
The name Cecilia meant Lily of Heaven, another ancient title of the Goddess. 3

Cemetery
Greek koimeteria was a Place of the Mother, where the dead could
rest as close as possible to the Goddess's temples. The custom was
continued in Christian Europe. The church-yard, home of the dead, derived from Germanic gard ox garth, meaning "earth" or "world," i.e., the world of the dead under the soil.
Tantric dakinis celebrated the rites of the dead in cremation
grounds, "where ordinary people feared to go," because they were
death-priestesses intimately acquainted with necropoli. 1 Their Goddess,
Kali Ma the Destroyer, was the same queen of tombs called Kalma in
Finno-Ugric myth. 2 Dakinis became European vilas, valas, or wilis,
women associated with the dead, later called witches. The traditional
legend of witches celebrating their sabbats in cemeteries may have had a real basis in ancient matriarchy.

Centaurs
Greek horse-spirits derived from Hindu asvins and the man-horse
wizards of central Asia. Centaurs were magic shape-shifters, and teachers of the Hellenic gods. 1 Their most familiar appearance was with
the head and shoulders of a man and the body and legs of a horse. Their other name was Magnetes, "great ones." 2 They have been connect
ed with Latin centuria, a company of 100 soldiers. 5 Perpetual rivals of
the Centaurs were the Lapiths, "men-who-use-stone-weapons," a hint of their extreme antiquity. See Horse.

Ceraunos, Saint Cernunnos
Ceraunos, Saint
Canonized form of one of the phallic lightning-gods who descended into Earth's womb, like Lucifer, to become a lord of the underworld.
Pagans sometimes called the lightning Gemma Cerauniae, the Jewel of Ceraunos "jewel" in the same sense as the Tantric (male) Jewel in the (female) Lotus. 1 The Greeks thought when Ceraunos descended
into the underworld, he became Charon, the ferryman of the Styx. 2 As a saint, he had little purpose other than to attract to Christianity those
who had formerly worshipped him as a psychopomp.

Sign of Ceres
Ceres
Latin form of the Great Goddess, cognate with Greek Kore or Core,
identified with Demeter as Mother Earth. As the earth-ruling aspect of
the Goddess's trinity, Ceres combined with Juno as queen of heaven, and Proserpine as queen of the underworld. She was called Ceres
Legifera, "Ceres the Lawgiver." Her priestesses were considered the foundresses of the Roman legal system. 1
Ceres ruled Rome through her sacred matronae, during that lost period of four centuries before 200 B.C., a period whose written
records were destroyed by later patriarchal historians, leaving only a residue of myths and religious customs that were only vaguely explained. 2 Farmers viewed her as the source of all food and kept her
rites faithfully, for fear of crop failure.
This was true not only of Roman farmers but even of Christian
farmers. Ceres's greatest annual festival, the Cerealia, was celebrated
in the British Isles almost to the present day. An account of the Shire of
Murray in the late 19th century said, "In the middle of June, farmers
go round their corn with burning torches, in memory of the Cerealia." 3

strapped to his head, seated in lotus position like a yogi.
1 This contem
plative pose was typical of Gallo-Roman deities in the first millenium
B.C. 2 Cernunnos was a consort of the Moon-goddess, whose Roman
name Diana may have been related to Sanskrit dhyana, "yogic contemplation." 5 Medieval romances spoke of pagan heroes who ac
quired godlike powers by falling into a trance of "contemplation" of the Goddess as lady-love.4

Cerridwen Cerridwen
Celtic name for the Triple Goddess, especially as the fearsome death- Chakra
totem, a white, corpse-eating Sow representing the moon. She was the ^^^^^m
same as Syrian Astarte or Greek Demeter, both of whom appeared as
sows. So did Freya, one of whose titles was a cognate of Cerridwen that
is Syr, "the Sow." 1 var. Cerdo
^
Cerdo is the Spanish word for pig. Harvest dances in the Spanish
Pyrenees were cerdana, "pig-dances," celebrated in honor of the Goddess who both gave and took away, and harvested souls in her character as "the source of life, and the receptacle of the dead." 2 A
rich wheat-growing region in the Pyrenees was dominated by her sacred town, Puigcerda, or Cerdo's Hill. 3 Her cult probably went back to the prehistoric temples of Malta, which had images of the Goddess in the shape of a sow.
Welsh bards who composed funerary elegies called themselves cerddorion, sons of Cerridwen or Cerdo. Their greatest hero, Taliesin, a founder of their craft, was said to have been born of Cerridwen
and specially treated by her to a few precious drops of magical inspiration from her Cauldron.

Chad, Saint
Legendary bishop of Mercia, said to be a follower of the canonized
princess Wereburg (see Convent). He was probably never a real person. His "brother" St. Cedd was called bishop of London, but both Chad and Cedd were variants of the pagan god Ceadda, who was
associated with magic healing springs. In the runic calendar, the emblem of St. Chad was a palm branch, or Tree of Life. 1
A pagan deity named Chaddi is still worshipped by the Samoyeds,
who practice a nominal Christianity as long as all goes well, but in time of trouble return to their own Chaddi. "Heathen services are
conducted by night within old stone-circles, and all images of Chaddi
are carefully screened from view. . . . [Wjithin these cromlechs were
formerly offered up those human sacrifices with which the natives used to propitiate Chaddi." 2

Chakra
Tantric term for the magic circle of worshippers, alternating men and
women after the manner of the egg-and-dart frieze; also, one of the
"rings" or stages of enlightenment, visualized as steps ascending the spinal column, as the inner serpent goddess Kundalini uncoils from the
159



Chaldean pelvis upward to the head. This ascent of the chakras was likened to
Chaos different stages of initiatory teaching, each taking place in a magic circle ^HH^^^^HBB^H whose members cooperated in the effort of comprehension.
The chakra was essentially the same as the Sufic halka, "magic circle," called the heart and basic unit of Sufism. 1 The purpose of a
properly conducted chakra was to make each participant feel "as if the Shakti was their own Mother who had borne them." 2 She was a
mother-bride, compounded of the felt presence of both Goddess and woman. In the classic chakra, each man had his wife or shakti to his
left, while the Lord of the Chakra with his shakti occupied the center of
the circle. 3 European pagan religions maintained the same arrangement, which eventually became the pattern of the circular folk dance.

Chaldean
"Moon worshipper," a common name for Mesopotamian astrologers who studied the movements of the moon in relation to the stars. 1
Because the magic powers of the Chaldeans commanded respect
nearly everywhere in the ancient world, biblical writers made Abraham
a Chaldean (Genesis 1 1:28). The same name was still being applied
to astrologers and wizards in the 1 5 th century a.d. 2

Chinese Moon-goddess, sole keeper of the ambrosia of immortality (menstrual blood). Her husband, the Excellent Archer, became in

forever, dispensing her precious elixir to women only. 1

Chaos
Greek word for the undifferentiated mixture of raw elements sup
posed to occupy the World-Goddess's womb before creation and after
destruction of each recurrent universe. It meant the Goddess herself
in her state of "eternal flux," when the fluid of her womb was not yet
clotted into the formative state of a solid world. Chaos is expressed in
the Bible as the condition of the earth before creation, "without form"
and "void" (Genesis 1:2). See Doomsday; Tiamat; Tohu Bohu.

^harites C_.hantes
"Graces," heavenly dispensers of charts (Latin caritas), the grace of Charlemagne
Mother Aphrodite, which the Bible translates either "love" or "charity" .^^^^
(1 Corinthians 13). The Charites were ancient manifestations of the
Triple Goddess. Pausanias said they were worshipped at Orchomenos
as three standing stones. 1 The classic myth of their nymph-hood
hardly described them; nor did their Christian form, the mythical St. Charity. See Grace; Sophia, Saint. 1. Dumezil, 166.
Charlemagne
Frankish emperor, whose reign (768-814) was the second great
turning-point in the history of the Holy Roman Empire. He was the
second Constantine. He found it useful to be a Christian, since the
church condoned his wars of acquisition as pagan tribal religions
would not and took its share of the spoils, eventually rewarding
Charlemagne with the crown of the Empire. He was also allowed a
special status of matrimony, not granted to other men. He had four wives and innumerable concubines, which the church tolerantly described as "marriages of the second rank." '
Charlemagne's reign was a painful history of aggression against the matriarchal religions of his ancestors. In 772 he massacred more than
4000 Saxons and destroyed their shrine at Heresburg, an omphalos of the earth-mother Hera. He cut down the phallic tree trunk Irminsul,
"Column of the World," the same axis mundi that Greeks called the
Great Herm, Norwegians called Yggdrasil, and Christians called the
cross. 2
After destroying shrines to demoralize the pagan clans, Charle
magne imposed vassalage on them and converted them to Christianity by the simple offer of a choice between Christ and
immediate death. All who rejected baptism were to be slain at once.
In 33 years of constant war, Charlemagne built the Holy Roman
Empire, at the cost of so many lives that historians have not even
tried to estimate the extent of the slaughter. 3
Charlemagne's policy of conversion by the sword succeeded so
well that the church backed Christian rulers in this kind of military
activity ever since. As the Song of Roland put it: "The bishops bless the
waters and convert the heathen. If any man protests, he is burned or
put to the sword." 4 Sometimes the blessed waters themselves served to execute the
unregenerate heathen. It was said that converts made under the rule
of St. Goar were held under water until they either accepted Christ, or drowned. 5

Charm Charm
as ' ' e Old English cyrm, a hymn or choral song, came from Latin carmen,
^^^^^^^^^^" a sacred incantation to the Goddess Carmenta, inventor of alphabets and "words of power." ' A "charm" reflected men's ancient belief
that women exerted power over male bodies and souls through their
mastery of sung 01 spoken spells invoking the help of the Goddess. The belief was not wholly illogical; the Goddess was Nature, and
Nature caused the signs of sexual attraction, including lovesick
behavior and penile erection, that made a man feel helplessly subject to unknown forces.
Therefore everything that made a man feel attracted to a woman
came to be synonymous with witchcraft: charm, enchantment, be
witchment, spellbinding, witchery, moon-madness, or glamor in the old sense of a spell cast by Morgan of "Glamorgan." The British Parliament passed an odd law in 1 770 that hinted at the same archetypal
fears, making it illegal for a woman to "betray" any man into
matrimony with such artificialities as false hair, iron stays, high-heeled shoes, or perfume. If a husband demonstrated that his wife had used
such devices, the marriage would be annulled, and the woman would "incur the penalty of the law now enforced against witchcraft." 2
Women's singing was also highly suspect, as this was the classic
method of casting spells. "Enchant" came from incantare, "to sing over" which also meant incantation. 3

Charon
Classic ferryman of the Styx; like Hermes, conductor of souls to the underworld. The dead were buried with coins in the mouth or on the
eyelids to pay Charon's ferry. The Chinese also used to put money in
graves, for crossing the river of death. In the Balkans, it was said a
woman could make her husband "blind as a corpse" to her adultery, if she gave him water that had washed the coins from a corpse's eyes. 1
Charon's fee was Christianized as Peter's Penny: St. Peter's bribe for
opening the heavenly gates. 2 In Greece, Charon found a new Christian
identity as St. Charus, escort and guardian of souls in the "lower
world," or common home of the dead. 3

Chastity Belt
Medieval device for locking a woman's potential lovers out of her
body, while her husband was away from home at wars, pilgrimages, or
crusades. The pelvic fetter had small spiked holes through which
urine, feces, and menstrual effluents might pass in theory. In practice;
162



it would have been impossible to keep clean. Vaginal infections, skin Chemosh
eruptions, and ulcers would have been inevitable after wearing such a Cherry
device for only a short time, let alone months or years. _^
In 1 889 the skeleton of a woman was found in a 1 5th-century ^^^^^
Austrian graveyard, still wearing the chastity belt that probably caused
her death. 1

Chemosh
Hebrew form of Shamash, the sun god of Sippar and Moab, worshipped in the temple of Solomon (I Kings 1 1:7). Because Che
mosh was one of Yahweh's rivals, called an "abomination" by later
priests attempting to suppress all cults but their own, he was adopted
into the still later Christian pantheon of hell as a demon. He was a fa
vorite of exorcists, who commonly claimed to have purged the possessed
of the demon Chemosh.
Chernobog
"Black God" of the Slavs, adversary of the White God, Byelobog;
another version of Ahriman opposed to Ahura Mazda, or the Black
Sun beneath the earth opposed to the White Sun in heaven. Like other versions of the chthonian deity, Chernobog was a Lord of Death, often invoked for curses. The Ukrainians still say, "May the Black
God exterminate you!" l In the same manner, ancient Persians invoked Ahriman, Chaldeans invoked Aciel, Romans invoked Saturn, and Christians invoked the devil.
1. Lamusse, 283.
Cherry
Like many slang expressions, the use of "cherry" for "virginity" may be traced to a mythic past. Like other red fruits, such as the apple and
pomegranate, the cherry symbolized the Virgin Goddess: bearing her sacred blood color and bearing its seed within, like a womb.
Maya, the virgin mother of Buddha, embraced the cherry tree Sala
while giving birth to her divine child. 1 Some said the tree recognized
her divinity and bent its branches down to offer its fruit. The story was
carried to Europe and spawned the medieval Cherry Tree Carol, in which Maya became Mary.
Gypsies applied the love-magic of the cherry to many magic charms, especially those associated with virginity. When a gypsy girl desired to attract a lover, she drilled holes through fourteen cherry
stones on the fourteen nights of the waxing moon, and wore them on
163



Cherub a cord around her left thigh (the "female" side). 2 The obvious elements
Chimalman of this magic were penetration of the cherry, and building up to the ^^mmmm^m^mmmm full moon, indicating growth or pregnancy.
French traditions of courtly love perhaps made "cherry" (cerise) synonymous with "beloved" (cherie). Cherry-red was often considered the color of love.
1. Larousse, 348. 2. Bowness, 22.
Cherub
Hebrew kerubh, the Babylonian totemic animal deities combining
eagle wings, lion feet, bull heads, and serpent tails animal symbols of the four seasons, cardinal directions, and elements. The cherubim
who guarded the gates of Eden and the throne of God were quite unlike
the naked winged babies that romantic and baroque art later called cherubs. As animal-masked and costumed priests, the cherubim proba
bly descended from Sheban mu-karribim, "close kindred," guardians of the shrine of the Moon-goddess at Marib.
Chicomecoatl
Mexican Goddess similar to Demeter, called Heart of the Earth, and
ancestress of all peoples. No god could equal her in power. She was
usually accompanied by a young savior son, a fertility-sacrifice. Her
angelic messengers were seven serpents. 1 1. Neumann, G.M., 182.
Chidambaram
Tantric Buddhist concept of the Center of the Universe, where Shiva does his eternal dance of life. The same Center was a mythic model of
the heart as the center of the body, and the heartbeat as the dance; for
Chidambaram existed "within the heart." ' The heart of the whole
cosmos was the same as the Cave of the Heart, "where the true self
resides." 2 This was another expression of Oriental belief in the identity
of self and deity. See Antinomianism; Heart.

Chimalman
Virgin mother of the Aztec savior Quetzalcoatl; one of "three
divine sisters." She was the same Triple Goddess worshipped around
the world in Virgin, Mother, and Crone aspects. See Trinity.

Chionia Chionia
"Snow Queen," a Greek title of one of the Horae; an untouchable Christina, Saint
virgin Goddess of the high mountains, prototype of the medieval fairy, MttMBMaMai Virginal the Ice Queen. She was also canonized as a Christian
"virgin martyr."
Chomo-Lung-Ma
"Goddess Mother of the Universe," the real name of the world's
highest mountain, which westerners renamed Everest after a man. This masculine name was bestowed on the Goddess Mother in 1863 by
foreign invaders who preferred to attach patriarchal surnames to
everything. 1
1. Encyc. Brit, "Everest, Sir George."
Christina, Saint
Another apocryphal "virgin martyr," whose legend was constructed on no basis whatever, except the name, meaning "a female Christian." Her story was one of those sadistic wonder-tales in which Christian
writers delighted, piling torture upon torture in fantasies that quite lost
sight of the natural limitations of human flesh.
For refusing to burn incense to the pagan gods, Christina was
locked up in a tower by her father. She was stripped and beaten with
rods, then torn apart by hooks, and her limbs were broken. Nothing daunted, she took up pieces of her own flesh and threw them in her
father's face, saying, "Take, tyrant, and eat the flesh thou hast begotten!" So her father then had her sprinkled with oil and roasted on a
fire-wheel. Then she was thrown into the sea with a stone around her
neck. Angels saved her, and she returned to her father, who dropped
dead of frustration.
Christina's torments were continued by a judge named Elius, who
had her rocked in a red-hot iron cradle. Her next judge, Julian, threw her into a burning furnace, where she walked about unbumed for five
days. Then, poisonous snakes were hung about her neck. Then, her breasts were cut off, and her tongue cut out. She took a piece of her
tongue and threw it at Julian, striking him in the eye and blinding him. Finally, Julian killed her by shooting three arrows into her. 1 This
can only have been a magic form of destruction, for Christina had by
this time amply demonstrated her invulnerability to every ordinary method of execution.
It de Voragine, 366-68.

Christmas Christmas
For its first three centuries, the Christian church knew no birthday
mttmmmmmmKmmm for its savior. During the 4th century there was much argument about
adoption of a date. Some favored the popular date of the Koreion,
when the divine Virgin gave birth to the new Aeon in Alexandria. 1 Now
called Twelfth Night or Epiphany, this date is still the official nativity in Armenian churches, and celebrated with more pomp than Christmas
by the Greek Orthodox. 2 Roman churchmen tended to favor the Mithraic winter-solstice
festival called Dies Natalis Solis Invictus, Birthday of the Uncon
quered Sun. 3 blended with the Greek sun-festival of the Helia by the
emperor Aurelian, this December 25 nativity also honored such gods
as Attis, Dionysus, Osiris, Syrian Baal, and other versions of the solar Son of Man who bore such titles as Light of the World, Sun of
Righteousness, and Savior. 4 Most pagan Mysteries celebrated the birth of the Divine Child at the winter solstice. Norsemen celebrated the
birthday of their Lord, Frey, at the nadir oi the sun in the darkest days of
winter, known to them as Yule. The night of birth, Christmas Eve, was called Modranect, Latin matrum noctem, the Night of the Moth
er originally a greater festival than Christmas Day. 5
Early in the 4th century the Roman church adopted December 25
because the people were used to calling it a god's birthday. But eastern churches refused to honor it until 375 a.d. 6 The fiction that
some record existed in the land of Jesus's alleged birth certainly could
not be upheld, for the church of Jerusalem continued to ignore the
official date until the 7th century. 7
Trappings such as Yule logs, gifts, lights, mistletoe, holly, carols,
feasts, and processions were altogether pagan. They were drawn from worship of the Goddess as mother of the Divine Child. Christmas trees
evolved from the pinea silva, pine groves attached to temples of the Great Mother. On the night before a holy day, Roman priests called dendrophori or "tree-bearers" cut one of the sacred pines, decorated
it, and carried it into the temple to receive the effigy of Attis. 8 Figures
and fetishes attached to such trees in later centuries seem to have
represented a whole pantheon of pagan deities on the World Tree.
Christmas celebrations remained so obviously pagan over the years that many churchmen bitterly denounced their "carnal pomp and
jollity." Polydor Virgil said: "Dancing, masques, mummeries, stageplays, and other such Christmas disorders now in use with Christians, were derived from these Roman Saturnalian and Bacchanalian festivals;
which should cause all pious Christians eternally to abominate them." 9 Puritans in 17th-century Massachusetts tried to ban Christmas
altogether because of its overt heathenism. 10 Inevitably, the attempt
failed.
A curious mistake in the Christmas mystery play of the Towneley cycle shows a Great Mother image not fully assimilated to that of
Mary. Before their attention was arrested by the annunciatory angel,
166



idly chatting shepherds complained of their cruel overlords, and Christos
prayed "Our Lady" to curse them. 11 Considering that they were not
acquainted with the Mother of Christ, a rather different "Lady" must ^^^^_^_^^
have been intended.
Among many other superstitions connected with Christmas were
some that were typical of pagan holy days, such as the belief that
animals could speak human words at midnight on Christmas Eve, or
that divinatory voices could be heard at crossroads at the same time. 12
Also at midnight on Christmas Eve, water in wells and springs was
supposed to turn into blood, or its sacramental equivalent, wine. The
miracle was not to be verified, however; for all who witnessed it would die within the year. 13

Christos
"Anointed One," a title of many Middle-Eastern sacrificial gods
Attis, Adonis, Tammuz, Osiris derived from Oriental cults of the
sacred marriage. In the east, the god's lingam or the erect penis of his
statue was anointed with holy oil (Greek chrism) for easier penetration
of his bride, the Goddess, impersonated by one of the temple virgins.
1
Before anointing with oil, the god's phallus was often reddened to the
color of life with pigment, wine, or blood specifically, the menstru
al blood of his bride. 2 Because kingship once depended on the sacred
marriage, anointing became the official rite of investiture for surro
gate kings as well as real kings. It carried a promise of godhood. The words of the psalmist, "Thou anointest my head with oil,"
evolved from the ancient custom of anointing the god-king's penis,
for which "head" was a common euphemism. At royal weddings the king's head was crowned with a wreath of flowers, as in the Hindu
svayamara ceremony and flowers, in biblical language, symbolized menstrual blood (Leviticus 15:24). Among the pagans, the temple
virgin deflowering herself on the god's carved phallus would place a wreath of flowers on his head at the same time. 3 Eventually the
anointing of the phallus was displaced to the head because the marriage rite was omitted from public sacrifices of the Savior, Redeemer, Son of God, etc. Like the New Testament Christ, he was "anointed" only
for his burying: the marriage with the earth (John 12:7). Jesus became a Christos when he was christ-ened for burial by Mary, the
magdalene or temple maiden (Matthew 26:12), who also announced
his resurrection (Mark 1 5:47).
Among the Essenes, a Christos was a priest, specifically designated
Sin Bearer or Redeemer: one who atoned for others' sins. 4 Among
the Slavs, Christos or Krstnik meant a sacrificial hero and also an
167



Chthonia "accursed one," due to the ancient practice of laying a formal curse
Circe on the Sin Bearer before he was sacrified. 5 See Firstborn; Kingship.

Chthonia
"Subterranean," an epithet of Black Demeter, Cybele, and other underground forms of the Goddess; also applied to gods in their nether, dark, Lord-of-Death aspect, e.g. Zeus Chthonios, or Chthonian
Apollo.
Cinderella
The fairy tale of the cinder-maid originated as an anti-ecclesiastical
allegory repeated by real "fairies" that is, pagans. Ella was Hel, or
Helle, daughter of Mother Earth, the Goddess with her regenerative fires reduced to cinders. Her ugly stepmother was the new church. Her
ugly stepsisters were the church's darlings, the military aristocracy and
the clergy. An early German version of the story said Cinderella's real mother
the Earth, though dead, sent from her grave a fairy tree in answer to
her daughter's prayer. This tree produced golden apples, fine clothes, and other gifts. Thus the "fairy godmother" of later versions seems to
have been a ghost of the mother, the dispossessed Great Goddess in
retirement underground. 1 Beautified with her new riches, Cinderella won the "prince"
(mankind), ever easily impressed by the display of finery. Their union was symbolized by fitting her foot into a shoe, a common sexual
allegory. The Eleusinian Mysteries signified sacred marriage by
working a phallic object in a woman's shoe. 2 The glass slipper perhaps stood for the Crystal Cave by which pagan heroes entered the uterine
underworld. Like other secret medieval prophecies of the overthrow of the rich,
powerful theocracy, the downfall of Cinderella's ugly stepmother and stepsisters may have been intended as a prophecy. 3

Circe
Homeric "witch" able to transform men into sacrificial swine: a
mythic picture of the transition from human to porcine sacrifices during
the Hellenic period. Circe's isle of Aeaea was a funerary shrine. Its name meant "Wailing." Circe herself was the death-bird kirkos, falcon. From the same root came the Latin circus, originally an enclosure for
funerary games. 1

As the circle, or cirque, Circe was identical with Omphale of Lydia Circumcision
with her cosmic spinning wheel: a fate-spinner, weaver of the Cleopatra VII
destinies of men. 2 Homer called her Circe of the Braided Tresses, ^^__
hinting that, like Oriental goddesses, she manipulated forces of creation and destruction by the knots and braids in her hair. She ruled
all the stars that determined men's fates. Pliny said Circe was a
Goddess who "commanded all the lights of heaven." 3

Circumcision
Symbolic version of the sacrifice of virility to a deity, as practiced in Egypt, Persia, and the Middle East. Originally an imitation of menstrua
tion, performed at puberty on boys who were dressed up as girls for the occasion. 1 Circumcision came to be regarded as a sacrifice pleasing
to a male deity, when it was viewed as a substitute for castration.

Clare, Saint var. Saint Claire
Mythical saint constructed from the title of the Celtic Goddess,

Cleopatra VII
One of the last Goddess-queens of Egypt, Cleopatra followed the precedent of Egyptian rulers in general and turned herself into a
divinity. At an Alexandrian festival she "assumed the robe of Isis and
was addressed as the New Isis." '
Though she was not a native Egyptian, but one of the Macedo
nian family of Ptolemies, Cleopatra exercised the ancient
prerogatives of Egyptian queens. Julius Caesar became her lover because it was the only way he could annex Egypt to the Roman provinces. By time-honored law, no man could exercise political power
in Egypt unless he loved its queen.
Some of Cleopatra's less eminent lovers lasted only one night and
paid with their lives for a single taste of her love. 2 The custom seems
to have been adopted by later male rulers of Arabia, to judge by the
gynocidal sultan of the Arabian Nights. The thinking behind this custom remains mysterious. It may be that men who lay with the queen
(and therefore with the Goddess herself) were believed to gain
immortality thereby, for any man who coupled with a Goddess would become a God. Sacred marriage, followed by death and deification,
formed the basic pattern of many ancient Mysteries.
169



Clitoris When her son Caesarion was born, Cleopatra built herself a
mammisi or "birth temple" for the worship of her own maternity. In the shrine she was pictured in the act of giving birth, assisted by the
Seven Hathors. 3 Cleopatra's mammisi stood until the 19th century
a.d., when it was described by travelers, but it disappeared in the past
century. 4 She also gave birth to the sun and moon, in the form of twins named Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene Alexander-Sun and
Cleopatra-Moon. 5 Perhaps these children represented her own mating with the solar god of Alexandria.

Pausanias Creek traveler and geographer of the 2nd century a.d. Living in a time of
declining culture, he was inspired by a desire to describe the ancient sacred sites for
posterity.
Clitoris
From Greek kleitoris, "divine, famous, goddess-like." l Greek myth personified the phallus as Priapus and the clitoris as an Amazon queen named Kleite, ancestral mother of the Kleitae, a tribe of warrior
women who founded a city in Italy. 2 In Corinth, Kleite was a princess "whom Artemis made grow tall and strong," an allegory of her erection. 3 Or, again, she was a nymph who loved the phallus of the sun god and always followed his motion with her "head" a transparently
sexual metaphor. 4 In a bowdlerized version of the story she was
transformed into a sunflower, turning to follow the motion of the sun
across the sky.
Pausanias said the Arcadian city of Clitor was sacred to Artemis, or
to Demeter, and stood at the genital shrine of the earth, the
headwaters of the Styx (or Alph). 5 The meaning of this geographical myth is made clear by the primitive belief that the Styx represented Mother Earth's menstrual blood, source and solvent of all things. In
this place, too, the orgiastic priestesses of Artemis were "soothed" out
of their frenzies; therefore the local omphalos must have signified the
Goddess's clitoris instead of her navel.
Later patriarchal society managed to ignore the clitoris. Since the Christian church taught that women should not experience sexual pleasure but should only endure intercourse for the sake of procreation,
growing girls and boys alike were kept ignorant of female sexuality, insofar as possible.6 Even physicians came to believe that no clitoris would be found on a virtuous woman. From medieval times onward, virtuous women rarely showed
themselves naked to any man, even a husband; so it was perhaps not surprising that men should remain ignorant of the female anatomy they clumsily fumbled with in the dark. Pious married couples wore the chemise cagoule, a voluminous nightgown with a small hole in front, to allow impregnation with a minimum of body contact. 7
170



At a witch trial in 1 593, the investigating gaoler (a married man) Clitoris apparently discovered a clitoris for the first time, and identified it as a devil's teat, sure proof of the witch's guilt. It was "a little lump of flesh, ^^^^^^^^^
in manner sticking out as if it had been a teat, to the length of half an
inch," which the gaoler, "perceiving at the first sight thereof, meant not to disclose, because it was adjoining to so secret a place which was not
decent to be seen; yet in the end, not willing to conceal so strange a
matter," he showed it to various bystanders. 8 The bystanders had never seen anything like it either. The witch was convicted.
European society certainly knew all about the penis, and never ceased to worship it, evert in Christian times (see Phallus Worship).
Yet the clitoris was forgotten:
Almost from the very beginning ofour lives, we are all taught that the
primary male sex organ is the penis, and the primary female sex organ is the vagina. These organs are supposed to define the sexes, to be the difference between boys and girls .... This is a lie ... . Woman 's
sexual pleasure is often left out ofthese definitions. Ifpeople considered
that the purpose ofthe female sex organs is to bring pleasure to women, then female sex would be defined by, and focused on, a different
organ. Everyone would be taught from infancy that, as the primary male sex organ is the penis, so the primary female sex organ is the clitoris. 9
Medical authorities in the 19th century seemed anxious to
prevent women from discovering their own sexuality. Girls who learned
to develop orgasmic capacity by masturbation, just as boys learned it, were regarded as medical problems. Often they were "treated" or
"corrected" by amputation or cautery of the clitoris, or "miniature
chastity belts, sewing the vaginal lips together to put the clitoris out of reach, and even castration by surgical removal of the ovaries. But
there are no references in the medical literature to surgical removal of
testicles or amputation of the penis to stop masturbation (in boys)." 10
In the United States, the last recorded clitoridectomy for curing
masturbation was performed in 1948 on a five-year-old girl.
11
The Catholic church's definition of masturbation as "a grave
moral disorder" in 1976 may have incorporated fears of the effect of
masturbation on female orgasmic capacity, now well known to evolve
through masturbatory experience the same as that of a male. 12 Less than a century ago, in the Victorian era, priests and doctors realized that
"the total repression of woman's sexuality was crucial to ensure her
subjugation." Leading authorities like Dr. Isaac Brown Baker per
formed many clitoridectomies to cure women's nervousness, hysteria,
catalepsy, insanity, female dementia, and other catchwords for symp
toms of sexual frustration. 13

Col urn ba, Saint "The Spinner," first of the Greek Moerae or Fates; She Who Spins

Clytemnestra
"Divine Wooing," or Sacred Marriage; the last matriarchal queen of
Mycenae, slain by her son Orestes, a worshipper of the patriarchal god
Apollo. Clytemnestra claimed a queen's traditional right to choose her consort, and have each new one slay the old one. Thus she arrangec
to have her husband Agamemnon slain by her latest lover, Aegisthus, whose name means Strong Goat. 1
Aegisthus had the right mythic prerequisites for a sacred king. He was born of an incestuous union. His mother Pelopia was a Goddess
of Clytemnestra's clan, the Pelopids. In infancy he was abandoned to the wild, was rescued, and, like Zeus himself, was nourished by a she
goat. 2 He was prepared to be a god on earth.
Orestes spoiled it by killing his mother and her lover, calling down on himself the inexpiable curse of miasma for his matricide. The
Furies pursued him, but the god Apollo defended him, on the ground that motherhood was not real parenthood. "The mother is no parent
of that which is called her child, but only nurse of the new-planted seed
that grows. The parent is he who mounts." 3 This Apollonian view of
parenthood was also the Christian view, even subsequent to 1827 a.d.
when Karl von Baer first discovered the human ovum, gigantic in
size and complexity as compared to a spermatozoon.

Conscience
"Knowing-together," a word coined by Stoic philosophers who said deity is found only within the human mind. Socrates's famous dictum
"Know thyself" was a Stoic aphorism for knowing God. Fusing
divinity with self produced "conscience." Thus the philosophers said
any dictate of one's own conscience was inevitably holy and right.

The concept grew from Oriental teachings about the identity of man
with God, woman with Goddess. See Antinomianism.

Constantine I
The "first Christian emperor" (288?-337), honored for establishing
Christianity as the official religion of the Roman empire. Actually, Constantine didn't do this in his own lifetime; his bishops did it
afterward. Constantine was not so much a worshipper of Christ as he
was a worshipper of himself.
Constantine considered himself the incarnation of "the supreme
god," a combination of Apollo, Mithra, Jupiter, the sun, and Christ. He called himself "the instrument of the Deity." He said, "I banished
and utterly abolished every form of evil then prevailing, in the hope
that the human race, enlightened through me, might be called to a proper observance of God's holy laws." He designated for his tomb a
spot in the center of the cruciform Church of the Holy Apostles, saying
he would lie forever with six apostles at his left hand and six at his
right. A contemporary historian said Constantine was "more greedy for
praise than it is possible to tell." '
He supported freedom of worship in his empire for the wrong reason: so that no god would be offended enough to take revenge on
him personally. He issued edicts of toleration for all religions, so that
"we should give to Christians and to everyone else the right freely to
follow whatever religion they chose, so that, whatever divinity is enthroned in heaven may be well-disposed and propitious towards
me." He tried to restrain Christian fanatics from persecuting pagans,
Jews, and heretics, writing in an encyclical letter to Bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia that these others must be "assured of the same degree of
peace and tranquility" as orthodox Christians. 2 The orthodox Chris
tians did not agree, and soon after Constantine's death they instituted
extensive persecutions and crusades extending over the next three
centuries.
173



Constantine I Constantine did his best for the church. In one year he obtained
twelve thousand converts by the simple offer of a new garment and
^
mm^^^^^^m twenty gold pieces to each person who embraced the faith. 3 But he did
as much for other cults too. He didn't become a Christian himself
until the final weeks of his life, when he accepted baptism on his
deathbed, as insurance for his after-life.
Constantine's life was hardly a model of piety. He murdered his
eldest son, his second wife, his father-in-law, his brother-in-law, and
"many others," a chronicler said. His first wife, Minervina evidently a
priestess of the Moon-goddess Minerva mysteriously disappeared. No one knows what became of her. His second wife Fausta was his
stepping-stone to the throne, according to the ancient rule of the
hieros gamos. Eulogists at the wedding said, "The title of sovereignty
has now accrued to thee, O Constantine, through thy father-in
law." 4 There being no law of primogeniture, the throne still passed
through the female line.
To eliminate a potential rival, Constantine killed his eldest son Crispus, born of the vanished Minervina. Afterward he accused
Fausta of having had a love affair with her now-deceased stepson, along
with other adulterous affairs, and killed her; it seems that any lover
the empress took was still a threat to the emperor's political position. 5 The murdered Crispus might have played the role of savior and
sacred king, for after his death he was virtually canonized as a
"blessed martyr." Churches in Greece were dedicated to him for over a
millenium. "During the period of the Turkish occupation of Greece, over a thousand years later, he was still remembered as the Caesar, the
hero-prince, the Christian Theseus, as it were, founder of the modern Greek nation." 6 Yet Crispus was neither a Caesar nor a
Christian.
Christian bishops eventually convinced Constantine that their God would forgive his crimes and enthrone him in heaven. When he felt
death approaching, he said to them: "The salvation which I have
earnestly desired of God these many years I do now expect. It is time therefore that we should be sealed and signed in the badge of immortality." 7 So he was baptized, and died in the confident expectation of a
glorious resurrection.
His literary whitewashing began at once. Despite his two wives and numerous concubines, Christian panegyrists said he was "wedded to
chastity." 8 Eusebius elevated all the emperor's doings into acts of piety,
and invented the legend that Christ had converted him with a holy
vision at the Milvian bridge. Later Christian legend claimed Constan
tine saw the sign of the cross in the sky, with the words in hoc signo
vinces (in this sign conquer). However, the holy sign that Constantine placed on his battle flags was not the cross. It was the labarum, a
monogram of Mithra and a sign of the sun, already in use by several
pagan emperors before Constantine.9
As an example of Constantine's Christian mercy, Cedrenus re
174



corded that once when he was ill, he collected a number of children Convent
to kill them and bathe in their blood as a healing charm. However,
moved by their mothers' tears, the emperor spared the children's lives ^^^^^__^^_
after all, and "the saints" restored his health as a reward for this act of
mercy. 10 No one seemed inclined to criticize him for contemplating the massacre in the first place.
Constantine's luminous example showed that Christian magic
could prevent port-mortem punishment for a ruthless life. "Future
tyrants were encouraged to believe," says Gibbon, "that the innocent blood which they might shed in a long reign would instantly be washed away in the waters of regeneration; and the abuse of religion
dangerously undermined the foundations of moral virtue." n
Christianity served all the emperors after him, with the sole
exception of Julian "the Apostate," much vilified by the church for
suspending the persecutions of pagans and trying to restore the culture of classical Rome. But Julian died young; some said he was assassinat
ed by a Christian. 12 The war against paganism proceeded. Beginning about 330 a.d., pagan shrines were looted and stripped of their gold,
silver, and bronze treasures, many of which were carried off to decorate
Constantine's greatest monument to himself, the city of Constantino

harbored were put to flight." H
Constantine's edicts of toleration were rescinded after his death.
The new imperial religion attacked its rivals in a show of intolerance
on a grander scale than had ever been seen before. It was a great
success. "Forty years after the death of Constantine, the church had
already acquired a tenth of the whole of the landed property in Rome's
western empire, a figure that in western Europe rose to a third during the middle ages. . . . The church since the time of Constantine affords
proof that it is not spiritual truth that has triumphed with the spread of
Christianity but human power." 15

Convent
Medieval institution evolved from the pagan "college" of priestesses
or virgines that is, unmarried women (not necessarily physical virgins)
dedicated to divine service. Early convents were double: a community of male monks united
with female priestesses under the rule of an abbess, usually a landowning noblewoman. 1 "Priests and monks together with the nuns took vows of obedience to the abbess in imitation of the obedience of
Jesus to his mother." A 10th-century Saxon chronicle speaks of double
175



Convent convents inhabited by "priests of both sexes," although in a transla
tion it was revised to read, "priests of both orders." 2
m^^^^^^^^^^m As Christian laws encroached on women's property rights, many
women of noble rank took vows to remain single, so as to protect
their wealth from the claims of husbands. Thus originated the so-called
convent of noble ladies, an independent mini-queendom. For example, the Saxon convent of Gandersheim in the 9th century held overlordship directly from the king. The abbess conducted her own
courts of law, kept her own seat in the imperial parliament, and maintained her own standing army. 3 Culture and learning were
pursued. This convent trained the poetess Hrotswitha of Gandersheim,
called "a Sappho, deserving to rank with the fabled Veleda and
Aurinia, ancient German poet-priestesses." 4 In the 7th century, a papal bull confirmed the rights of freedom
from taxation and from episcopal jurisdiction of the Parthenon of Beatae Mariae et Sanctae Columbae et Agathae (Virgin-house of Blessed Marys and Holy Doves and Kindly Ones). Abbesses of Las
Huelgas ruled sixty towns, had the right to license bishops and priests within their dioceses, to confer benefices on clergy of their own
choice, to nominate ecclesiastical judges, to hear criminal cases among
their subjects, and to establish new parishes. Bishops and apostolic delegates were forbidden to visit churches, parishes, clergy, or beneficiaries in the abbess's territory. The nuns remained exempt from
episcopal jurisdiction all the way up to 1874. 5 Ancient goddess-queens were described as "abbesses" in Christian
histories, to disguise the real nature of the pagan matriarchate that
backed them. Such a one was St. Odilia or Ottilia, called the abbess of
Odilienberg (Hohenburg), a pilgrimage shrine of Alsace that was her own Holy Mountain. 6 Her legend had no documentary basis. 7 She was
fraudulently canonized, only to attract her votaries to Christianity. Many abbesses retained their pagan title of High Priestess
Sacerdos Maxima especially in the German convents. At Quedlin
burg the abbess was "in control of the whole town, its people, churches,
hospitals, clergy, canons and canonesses, and all religious orders." She was not only High Priestess, but also Superior Canoness of the
Cathedral, Metropolitana (mayor), and Matricia (matriarch). At St. Mary's Uberwasser in Munster, the abbess's title was Prima domna et matre nostra spirituale, "Mistress-Leader and Our Spiritual Mother." Cistercian monks at Las Huelgas swore obedience to the abbess as "the
Illustrious Lady ... my Prelate, and my Lady, Superior, Mother and
legitimate administrator in spiritual and temporal affairs of the Royal
Monastery and its Hospital." 8 Some centuries earlier, the Latin title of Sacerdos Maxima meant a
high priestess of the Great Mother of the Gods. She was assisted by
lesser priestesses known as ministra, "ministers." The word "sodality"
came from Latin sodales, a college of dancing priestesses trained in the Great Mother's temple. 9

That women in convents long retained the sexual freedom of the Convent
ancient priestesses is shown by interchangeable use of the words "convent" and "brothel" in medieval times. Nicholas Clemangis said ^^^^^^-^^
the monasteries were not so much sanctuaries of God as they were
"abodes of Venus." 10
The word nun originally meant a nurse, that is, a priestess of a healing shrine, like the "nymphs" in colleges of Hygeia and Panacea in pagan Greece. That the convents continued to function as hospitals
is suggested by medieval romances: wounded, sick, or dying folk were
usually cared for by "nuns." n The word also meant a virgin mother in
Germanic paganism. A cognate was Nana, virgin mother of the god Balder.
Sometimes, pagan queens established convents in order to have themselves canonized, just as Roman emperors were made gods by
virtue of their religious leadership. The canon of saints includes several pagan queens whose only claim to beatitude was wealth, which
bought the jurisdiction of an abbey and its subject lands. Some of the
queen-saints were even distinctly hostile to churchmen, like Queen Bathild, foundress of a druidic convent at Chelles in the 7th century.
She was the real ruler of the western Franks, having placed her son
Chlotar on the throne. Certain bishops who tried to interfere with her
were assassinated. In the end she was "unceremoniously" removed
from power by Christian nobles, and apparently murdered as a heretic, though her subjects maintained her cult and called her Saint
Bathild. 12
In Bede's time, Queen Ethelreda was ordained High Priestess of
Ely, and was succeeded by other supreme abbesses governing the
monastery's beatarum regimine feminarum (holy order of women) up to the Danish invasion in 866. The abbey of Wherwell was founded
by Queen Elfrida in 986; it was exempt from earthly services, and held many territories and churches. 13
Another pagan princess who founded a convent in the 7th century
and was canonized, was St. Wereburg of the royal house of Mercia, ruler of the city of Chester. Her establishment was specifically for
"noble women" refusing to give up their property to husbands. St. Wereburg was canonized centuries later, on the strength of a legend
that her holy bones had extinguished the fires set in the city of Chester by marauding Danes. 14
St. Hild, or Hilda, of the royal house of Northumberland, established one of the most famous double monasteries of Anglo-Saxon
times at Hartlepool, the "Isle of Stags." Her influence extended over all
England. She created bishops and abbots, favoring especially the poet-missionaries of Celtic background. Bede said "all who knew her called her Mother." 15 Since she bore the name of the pagan Great Mother Hild, or Hel, one might wonder about the real basis of her
authority, in a century when a majority of people had not yet heard of
Christianity. 16
177



Convent Even when convents became Christianized, abbesses were still
ordained like bishops, and in some areas held more secular power than
^^^^Bi^^^^M bishops, though church histories have tried to conceal this, sometimes
through deliberate falsification of the records. For instance, a papal bull
said the abbess of the Cassian foundation in Marseilles was "or
dained"; a later editor changed the word to "blessed." At Jouarre,
Quedlinburg, Conversano, and other places, an abbess held supreme
jurisdiction over both clergy and laity in her territory. According to the
Rule of St. Donatus, abbesses functioning as Matris Spirituale (Spiritual Mother) regularly heard confessions. French ecclesiastical records
say abbesses gave absolution by imposition of their hands on the heads of men. 17 The church began to encroach on the rights of convents in the
12th and 13th centuries, devising ways to appropriate the nuns'
property and make them subject to male clergy. At Fontevrault, canonesses preceded the monks in processions, carried the pastoral cross, preached, read the Gospel, and heard confessions. Pope Innocent
III deprived them of these privileges. Disagreements arose between male and female clergy. Monks insisted they would no longer genuflect
every time they passed the abbess. Nuns reacted by refusing to kneel
in the confessional before their brothers. Innocent III also commanded
the abbess of Jouarre, her clergy, and her layfolk to subject themselves to the authority of the bishop of Meaux. When the abbess asked
for time to prove her right to independence, she and all her community were excommunicated. Decrees of the Council of Trent changed church laws to say women's orders must be taken over and
supervised by men's orders. 18
Considerable bitterness accompanied sexual segregation of the double convents, judging from the letter of Abbot Conrad of March
tal, on barring women from his order:
We and our whole community ofcanons, recognizing that the wickedness ofwomen is greater than all other wickedness ofthe world, and there is
no anger like that of women, and that the poison ofasps and dragons is more curable and less dangerous for men than the familiarity of women, have unanimously decreed for the safety ofour souls, no less than for that ofour bodies and goods, that we will on no account receive any more sisters to the increase ofour perdition, but will avoid them like
poisonous animals. ,9
Convents had been centers of higher learning for women in an age when women were forbidden access to schools and universities.
Earlier in the medieval period, girls as well as boys attended ecclesias
tical schools in Ireland and learned to read and write; but this practice
was later forbidden, the schools being kept only for males. 20 Premonstratensian and Cistercian orders were famed as educators of women, until the Council of Trent ruled that women's orders must be taken over by men's orders. 21 Then Cistercian nuns were forbidden to
establish any more teaching convents. 22 Nuns were further commanded not to teach or discuss theological
178



matters. This was used as a device for outlawing their orders and Convent
confiscating their property. It served as an excuse for the Council of
Vienne to deprive the teaching nuns called Beguines of their lands
and houses, in 1 3 1 2 when monks of the Inquisition demanded them:
We have been told that certain women commonly called Beguines,
afflicted by a kind ofmadness, discuss the Holy Trinity and the divine essence, and express opinions on matters offaith and sacraments. Since these women promise no obedience to anyone and do not
renounce their property or profess an approved Rule . . . fw]e have therefore decided and declared with the approval ofthe Council that their
way oflife is to be permanently forbidden and altogether excluded from
the Church of God. 2*
The Beguines were forced to integrate into orders approved by the pope, where they would receive no education. Their properties
were taken over by the Inquisition to provide dwellings and prisons for the inquisitors' use. 24
From the 1 2th century on, there was increasing pressure on convents to adopt rules of close confinement, to keep nuns segregated from the outside world. The canonesses of St. Mary's Uberwasser
rebelled three times against the imposition of the Benedictine Rule, which would force them into seclusion. 25 Many convents were threat
ened with excommunication, dissolution, or even prosecution by the Inquisition to force them to accept strict seclusion and to cease develop
ing the sisters' minds.
Early in the 17th century, teacher Mary Ward tried to found a Catholic order of teaching nuns known as the English Ladies, to
provide education for girls. She and her sisters refused to submit to the
cloister, so Mary was arrested and accused of heresy. Her order was suppressed in 1629. Pope Urban VIII rebuked them: "Certain women,
taking the name of Jesuitesses, assembled and living together, built
colleges, and appointed superiors and a General, assumed a peculiar habit without the approbation of the Holy See . . . carried out works
by no means suiting the weakness of their sex, womanly modesty,
virginal purity." 26 With typically patriarchal reasoning, the English Ladies were punished for doing what women were supposed to be unable to do.
A few convents managed to hold on to their pre-patriarchal
independence. The clergy failed to turn out the canonesses of St.
Waudru, at Mons. Monks of Fontevrault likewise failed to take over the main church or the nuns' house, and were obliged to continue to vow obedience to the abbesses, up to the French Revolution. 27

Cow
Perhaps the most common manifestation of the Great Mother as
Preserver was the white, horned, milk-giving Moon-cow, still sacred in India as a symbol of Kali. Egypt revered Mother Hathor as the
heavenly cow whose udder produced the Milky Way, whose body was
180



the firmament, and who daily gave birth to the sun, Horus-Ra, her
Golden Calf, the same deity worshipped by Aaron and the Israelites:
"These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt" (Exodus 32:4). The name of Italy meant "calf-land." ! This country too was the
gift of the Milk-giver, whom Etruscans called Lat, Arabs called AlLat, Greeks called Latona, Lada, Leto, or Leda. She ruled Latium, and gave her milk (Jatte) to the world.
All Europe was named after the Goddess as a white Moon-cow,
whom the Greeks mated to the white bull incarnation of Zeus. Her alternative name was Io, "Moon." Under this name she was presented
in classic mythology as a rival of Hera, but patriarchal writers were always setting different manifestations of the same Goddess at odds with
one another, possibly on the principle of divide and conquer. Hera herself was named Io, ancestress of the Ionians. In her temple on the
site of Byzantium she appeared as the same lunar cow, the Horned One, wearing the same crescent headdress as the Egyptian Cow
goddess. 2
The Cow as creatress was equally prominent in myths of northern Europe, where she was named Audumla; she was also Freya, or a
Valkyrie taking the form of a "fierce cow." 6 A semi-patriarchal Norse myth tried to attribute the creation of the world to the giant Ymir,
whose body and blood made the universe. But he was not the first of
creatures. The Cow preceded him, for he lived on her milk. 7
Earlier myths showed the universe being "curdled" into shape
from the Cow's milk. In India, many still believe literally the creation
myth known as Churning of the Sea of Milk. 8 The Japanese version
said the primordial deep went "curdlecurdle" (koworokoworo) when stirred by the first deities, to make clumps of land.9 The ancient Near East thought human bodies too were curdled from the Goddess's
milk. One of her liturgies was copied into the Bible: "Has thou not
poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?" (Job 10:10).
The root of "cow" was Sanskrit Gau, Egyptian kau or kau-t.
Goddess-names like Gauri and Kauri also designated the yonic
cowrie shell. 10 Brahman rebirth ceremonies used either a huge golden yoni or an image of the Cow-mother. "When a man has for grave
cause been expelled from his caste, he may be restored to it after passing
several times under the belly of a cow." u The Egyptian Goddess as
birth-giver typically wore a cow's head or horns, as she offered her breasts with both hands. 12 As the nursing mother who gave each
Egyptian his secret soul-name (re/7), she was entitled Renenet, the Lady of the Double Granary, a reference to her inexhaustible breasts. 13
The bovine enzyme rennet, used even in antiquity to curdle milk, was
also sacred to her. A favorite Roman emblem of the Goddess was the Cornucopia,
Horn of Plenty: a cow's horn pouring forth all the fruits of the earth.
The cow was honored as the wetnurse of humanity, and her image is
Cow
Herodotus said the
milk-giving Mother Hera-Io-Latona was the same as Egypt's Buto, "an archaic queen of the Lower Kingdom." 5 The holy city of Buto, Egypt's oldest oracular shrine, was known to the Greeks
as Latopolis, "city of Lat." 4 Of course
Buto, or Lat, was only another name for Hathor, or Isis, or Mut, or Neith; all represented "the great cow which gave birth to Ra, the great goddess, the mother of all the gods ... the
Cow, the great lady, lady of the south, the great one who gave birth to the sun, who made the germ of gods and men, the mother of Ra, who raised up Tern in
primeval time, who existed when nothing else had being, and who created that which exists." 5

Cowrie
Its name derived from Kauri, who was the same as Kali-Cunti, Yoni
of the Universe, the cowrie shell everywhere represented the divine vulva and usually conveyed the idea of rebirth. Skeletons from the
Solutrean period, ca. 20,000 B.C., have been found "lavishly decorated
with cowrie shells." l Egyptians decorated sarcophagi with cowrie shells as a rebirth
charm. Cowries are still prized throughout the east for their supposed healing and regenerative powers. Cowrie necklaces are valued in India
as amulets against the evil eye. 2 Moslem women believe cowries
should be worn on the body during pregnancy. The Japanese keep cowries in wardrobe cabinets "for luck"; if no cowries are available,
pornographic pictures of female genitals serve as a substitute. 5 Gypsies valued a cowrie above all other kinds of protective amulets. 4 Chris
tianized natives of the Sudan consider a strip of leather stamped with the
sign of the cross a valuable amulet; but it is not "strong magic" unless
nine cowrie shells are attached to it. 5
Romans called the cowrie shell matriculus, "little matrix," symbol
of an Alma Mater (soul-mother) or teaching priestess, which is why a student still "matriculates" into instruction. The Roman Alma Mater
taught the philosophy of love as well as the love of philosophy. Unlike
Christians, the pagans believed the capacity for heterosexual love
required careful nurture and training. Sometimes the Romans called a cowrie porcelk, "little sow," because it stood for the Goddess who was the Great Sow, like
Demeter, Astarte, Ceres, Freya, Cerridwen, etc. From porcelk came "porcelain," so called because of its resemblance to the white glazed surface of the shell.6 A Greek word for the cowrie was kteis, which also
meant a scallop, a comb, and a vulva. 7 The extreme antiquity of cowrie symbolism in the Middle East is
shown by the ancestor-skulls preserved by the people of Jericho in the 7th millenium b.c. These forerunners of the Jewish teraphim were
severed from the body, provided with features of painted plaster, and made to "see" with the eyes of cowrie shells. 8 Speaking of the Melanesians' and Polynesians' reverence for
cowries, a missionary, Rev. George Brown, wrote, "There is some sacredness about them, but what it is, is not at all clear. The natives will
not talk about them at all." 9 It seems likely that the natives he

the center of the earth; comparable to Yggdrasil, the Stone of Fal, Irminsul, the axis mundi, and many other versions of the cosmic

Creation
Myths of creation generally present a symbolic view of birth. Conditions before creation suggest the uterine environment: darkness, liquid,
stirring or churning movement, the "eternal flux" associated with the
blood of the Mother (Kali's Ocean of Blood, for example). Often there
is a suggestion of one entity inside another. "When there was neither
the creation, nor the sun, the moon, the planets, and the earth, and when darkness was enveloped in Darkness, then the Mother, the
Formless One, Maha-Kali, the Great Power, was one with Maha-Kala, the Absolute." x
The Bible's highly derivative version says "the earth was without
form, and void: and darkness was upon the face of the Deep" (Genesis 1:2). The Deep was the Mother's womb, tehom, derived from
Tiamat, the Babylonian name of the primordial Goddess. In Egypt, she was Temu, mother of the abyssal elements: Water, Darkness,
Night, and Eternity. 2 Most creation myths speak of a splitting or opening in the dark, formless Mother. The beginning of the existing world is signaled by

Jean Astruc 1 8th
century French Catholic physician and scholar.
the coming of light. Romans made the connection with birth quite
clear: Juno Lucina was not only a creatress, but also the Mother who
brought "light" to the eyes of the newborn. 3 The biblical God who said
"Let there be light" (Fiat lux) copied the word of the Goddess.
The prominence given everywhere to that moment of light sug
gests archetypal memories of the first impact of light on newborn eyes which have never seen light before. Like dreams of the individual
unconscious, myths of the collective unconscious reveal hidden
memories of the birth trauma. "Locked up in the depths of our
unconscious mind is the terrific impact of birth, the violent adventure
that uprooted our pre-natal world." 4 It is also locked up in the symbol
ism of myths, projected onto a cosmic scale.
Creation/birth was inseparable from the figure of the Mother. The oldest myths made her the divider of waters, maker of heaven and
earth. When a god came into the picture, he was at first only her subordinate consort, one of the beings she had created: sometimes a
disembodied phallus, in the form of a serpent. Late Egyptian gods who claimed to be creators never succeeded in ridding themselves of
feminine imagery. For instance, Khepera insisted that he created the universe alone, "there was no other being who worked with me." Yet he had to say, "I laid a foundation in Maa," meaning the Great Womb, the Goddess Maat. 5 Often it is said when the god was allowed to create, he became
puffed up with pride, and began to ignore his Mother and claim sole
authorship of the universe. This angered the Goddess. She punished him, bruised his head with her heel, and sent him down to the
underworld.6 (See Eve.) Sumerian creation myths said when the
Goddess's son-spouse began to show signs of hubris she laid the curse of exile on him, saying, "Henceforth thou shalt dwell neither in heaven
nor on earth." 7 This raises all kinds of questions about Middle
Eastern sacrificial gods who died in expiation of a primal sin, hung on trees or crosses "between heaven and earth."
Gnostic creation myths of the early Christian era were still telling
versions in which the female principle was pre-eminent, which is why
they were declared uncanonical. "In his madness," Jehovah claimed to
be the only God, because he had forgotten the Mother who brought him into being, according to one source. The Mother of Gods was
angry that he had impiously sinned against her, and against her other children, the male and female Immortal Ones. These were the elohim
of the Book of Genesis. God grouped himself with them, calling the group "us" (Genesis 3:22). But Bible revisions tended to erase earlier
deities, especially female ones. After the centuries of choosing and
revising canonical books, nearly every trace of female divinity had been eliminated from Christian literature. 8 As long ago as 1753, Astruc recognized that the Book of Genesis
184



contains at least two mutually contradictory versions of the creation Creation
nyth. One version the scholars call E, for it speaks of plural creators,
lohim, male and female deities. Another version is J, for Jehovah _^____^^^_
tlohim, the God of gods. The two versions disagree in many points:
*^^^^^^^^
E: birds and beasts created before man. J: man created before birds and beasts.
E: birds made of water, along with fishes.
J: birds made of earth, along with beasts.
E: man given dominion over the whole earth.
J: man placed only in the garden, "to dress it and keep it," like the
men created to be farmer-slaves in the Sumerian original.
E: man and woman created together, after the beasts: "male and
emale created he (they) them, and God (elohim, the deities) blessed hem."
J: man created alone, before beasts and birds; woman made from
us rib.
E: creation took place in six days.
J: creation took place in one day.
E: nothing was said about the Fall, which appeared only in the narrative.
The Fall was all-important. If it never took place, there was no
mginal sin, no necessity for redemption, no Savior. Dean Burgon of hichester said to deny the literal truth of the Genesis story was to
'cause the entire scheme of man's salvation to collapse." Calvin stood
iquarely behind what he thought the Bible said, and insisted that all
pecies of animals were created at once, in a period of six normal days,
ach with a morning and evening, as stated. Those who disagree with
lim, he said, "basely insult the Creator," and will meet after death "a
udge who will annihilate them." 9
The clergy's notion of investigating the origins of man consisted )f studying the Bible to add up the given ages of patriarchs since Adam.
This had been done in the 7th century by Isidore of Seville, who
:ame up with a strange Bible-based view of history: "Joseph lived 105
/ears. Greece began to cultivate grain. The Jews were in slavery in
Egypt 144 years. Atlas discovered astrology. Joshua ruled for 27 years.
Erichthonius yoked horses together. Othniel, 40 years. Cadmus ntroduced letters into Greece. Deborah, 40 years. Apollo discovered
he art of medicine and invented the cithara. Gideon, 40 years. Mercury
nvented the lyre and gave it to Orpheus." Reasoning on this level ind never noticing anything odd about the many consecutive reigns of K) years Archbishop Usher in 1650 placed the date of creation in

was created by the Trinity on the twenty-third of October, 4004 B.C., a nine o'clock in the morning." 10
The absurdity of such reasoning began to be exposed in 1830 when Sir Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology investigated the earth's
long-term changes, showing that creation could not have taken place ii
six days, nor in six years, nor even six thousand years. Geologists were
finding fossils of animals that lived millions of years ago. Bones of
extinct species were found in caves, mingled with human bones.
Archeologists found high civilization flourishing in Egypt in 6000 B.C., with evidence of vastly older savage periods. Cuneiform writings
showed that the people of Mesopotamia were telling the same story of creation that the Bible told and telling it thousands of years earlier.
Christian scholars tried hard to refute the new findings. Gosse's
Omphalos claimed all fossils, marks of retreating glaciers, lava flows,
sedimentary rock strata, etc., were created instantaneously by God witl
an appearance of pre-existence. Chateaubriand said God deliberately fooled men with the false appearance of pre-existence in order to test
their faith. Others tried to explain fossils by calling them God's
deceptions, formed of "lapidific juice" or "seminal air." u Naturally these crude views had to be abandoned in the end.
Upholders of the Bible then tried to call the Genesis creation myth
allegorical, with each "day" corresponding to a large span of prehistori time. This didn't work either. The Bible brought plants into being
before the sun, on which plant life depends; made fish and birds befon
"creeping things" on land which was hardly the case; and produced "light" before the only sources of light, sun and moon. However absurd, these myths still maintain a hold on vast numb(
of people deliberately kept in ignorance by an obsolete fundamentalisr Even educated adults sometimes insist that an omniscient god created the world for a purpose of his own. 12 Malebranche came up with an
original notion, which may have helped the public image of his churcl but made his God look rather less than grand. He said God "can love
only Himself and therefore act only with the ultimate purpose of
increasing His glory Thus the sole purpose of the creation was the
incarnation and the formation of the Church." n

Crispin, Saint Crispin, Saint
Roman tutelary god of shoemakers, transformed into a saint by a Cronus
"very late and quite worthless" legend. > October 2 5 , the day of the ^^^aiHHi
shoemakers' feast among the pagans, was adopted as St. Crispin's
Day. 2 He is still the patron of shoemakers, and his symbol is a shoe.

Crone
General designation of the third of the Triple Goddess's three
aspects, exemplified by such figures as Kali the Destroyer, Cerridwen
the death-dealing Sow, Atropos the Cutter, Macha, Hecate, Hel, Eresh-Kigal, Morgan, Queen of the Ghostworld, Queen of the Underworld, Queen of the Shades, Persephone "the Destroyer," etc. All
such forms represented old age or death, winter, doomsday, the waning
moon, and other symbols of the inevitable destruction or dissolution
that must precede regeneration. The "Crone" may have descended from Rhea Kronia as Mother
of Time, though the title has been linked with Coronis, the carrion crow, since crows and other black creatures were sacred to the Death
goddess. Her fearsome character often had a "virgin mother" side as
well, because her trinity of appearances was cyclic. It was said in the East that true lovers of the Goddess must love her ugly "destroyer"
images as well as her beautiful ones. The Crone also represented the
third (post-menopausal) phase of women's lives, and her shrines were
served by priestesses in this stage of life. Because it was believed that
women became very wise when they no longer shed the lunar "wise blood" but kept it within, the Crone was usually a Goddess of Wisdom.
Minerva, Athene, Metis, Sophia, and Medusa provide typical
examples.
Cronus
Titan god who castrated his father Uranus (Heaven) and was in turn
deposed by his own son Zeus. Knowing the danger his children posed,
Cronus tried to prevent it by swallowing them all an early version of the Slaughter of the Innocents but Zeus escaped. Cronus was confused with Chronos, "Time," because Time swallows up every
thing it brings forth actually a characteristic of Cronus's mother-mate,
Rhea Kronia, the Goddess personifying time and fate. She was really
Mother Earth, who gave birth to Cronus; and Rhea, who married him; and Hera, who married his son Zeus; the three of them comparable
to the Mother, Grandmother, and Great-grandmother Goddesses in northern Europe. 1 See Caste.

Cross Cross
The "Latin" or "Passion" cross, now the primary symbol of Chris
^^^^^^^^^ tianity, was not shown in Christian art until six centuries after Christ. 1
But long before the Christian era it was a pagan religious symbol
throughout Europe and western Asia. 2 Early Christians even repudiatec the cross because it was pagan. A church father of the 3rd century,
+
Minucius Felix, indignantly denied that Christians worshipped the
cross: "You it is, ye Pagans, who are the most likely people to adore
wooden crosses ... for what else are your ensigns, flags, and standards,
but crosses gilt and beautiful. Your victorious trophies not only
represent a simple cross, but a cross with a man on it." ? From very ancient times, an effigy of a man hanging on a cross Latin Cross was set up in fields to protect the crops. The modern scarecrow is a
survival of this sacrificial magic, representing the sacred king whose
blood was supposed to fertilize the earth. He was never abandoned, even though every farmer knew that no scarecrow ever really scared a
crow. 4
The cross was also a male symbol of the phallic Tree of Life;
therefore it often appeared in conjunction with the female-genital circle or oval, to signify the sacred marriage. Male cross and female orb
composed the Egyptian "amulet Nefer," or amulet of blessedness, a charm of sexual harmony. 5
The so-called Celtic cross, with the crossing of the arms encircled
by a ring, was another lingam-yoni sign of sexual union, known to the
Hindus as Kiakra. 6 Some old Celtic crosses still in existence show
Celtic Cross obvious phallic elements, even to a realistic meatus at the cross's tip.
7
Crosses signified a god's love-death even in pre-Columbian art of the western hemisphere, which showed the Savior carrying his cross, an
image very similar to the Christian one. 8
No one knows exactly when the cross became associated with
Christianity. Early images of Jesus represented him not on a cross, but in the guise of the Osirian or Hermetic "Good Shepherd," carrying
+
a lamb. Later, many different kinds of crosses were used as Christian
symbols. They included the Greek cross of equal arms, the X-shaped St Andrew's cross, the swastika, the Gnostic Maltese cross, the solar
cross or Cross of Wotan, and the ansated cross, a development of the Egyptian ankh, also found as the Cross of Venus. 9 Greeks said this cross was "common to the worship of Christ and Greek Cross Sarapis." 10 The Goddess Isis is shown on the Isiac Table with the
cross in one hand, a lotus seed-vessel in the other, signifying male and
female genitalia. 11 As her consort, the god Sarapis was incarnate in Ptolemy. The words "Ptolemy the Savior" were followed by a cross on
the Damietta Stone. Pious Christian scholars once tried to pretend
that this phrase was really a prophecy of the future Christ. 12
For a few centuries the emblem of Christ was a headless T-shaped
Tau cross rather than a Latin cross. This may have been copied from
pagan druids, who made Tau crosses of oak trees stripped of their
188



T
branches, with two large limbs fastened at the top to represent a Cross
man's arms. This was the Thau, or god. 13
A Tau cross was the sign of the holy day aptly named the ^^^^^^^^
Invention of the Cross, purporting to commemorate the discovery of
the True Cross by the empress Helena, mother of Constantine, in a
crypt under the temple of Aphrodite in Jerusalem. 14 After it was generally replaced by the Latin cross, the Tau cross was reassigned to
St. Philip, supposedly crucified on a Tau cross in Phrygia, where he
was trying to exorcise the god Mars in the form of a dragon. 15 This
means the Tau cross was the sign of May Day, which the church adopted as St. Philip's day; and the druidic Thau was confused with the Maypole. The Invention of the Cross was first heard of long after the lifetime Tau Cross
of the empress Helena. The date assigned to her "discovery" was
328 a.d., though no contemporary chronicler thought fit to mention such a momentous event. The legend said Helena found three
crosses under Aphrodite's temple, but couldn't decide which belonged
to Christ, which to the two thieves. She had a corpse brought, and
laid on each cross in turn. When laid on the right one, the dead man
sprang up alive. According to an alternative story, the True Cross instantly restored the health of "a noble lady who was near to death." 16 Christian authorities also claimed the empress found the Holy
Nails and the INRI scroll, but the latter somehow disappeared and was lost for over a thousand years. In 1492 it was miraculously
rediscovered in the Church of the Holy Cross in Rome, where it
seemed to have been all the time. Pope Alexander III published a bull
infallibly attesting to its authenticity. 17 The Invention of the Cross proved enormously useful in the
Middle Ages, to account for the veritable forest of splinters of the
True Cross revered in Europe's churches. There was so much miracle
working wood of the True Cross that Calvin said it would make "a
full load for a good ship." 18 The church claimed the True Cross was made of the same wood
that grew as the Tree of Life in the garden of Eden. It was carried out
by Adam, and preserved by all the patriarchs in turn (even riding the Flood in Noah's ark), for the sole purpose of crucifying the Savior
when he appeared. Gnostic sources added an Oedipal twist: Jesus's cross
was put together by his father, Joseph the carpenter. Moreover, the cross was planted on the very spot where the Tree of Life once grew. The church said it became "the Tree of the Cross, so that whence
came death, thence also life might rise again." These absurdities were
implicitly believed through the Middle Ages. 19 Male genitals are still called "the tree of life" by the Arabs, and a
cross was one of the oldest diagrammatic images of male genitals.
Among Christians there was at least some recognition of the cross's
phallic significance. An ancient crucifix at Sancreed in Cornwall was
a spear set upright in a holy vase (the uterine vessel) with two testicle
189



Crossroads like scrolls appended to its shaft. 20 The cross entering the labyrinth
was one of the oldest symbols of the lingam-yoni in the west, dating ^^^^^^^^^^^_ back to early Neolithic times. Spiral "feminine" labyrinths penetrated
by a cross occur in prehistoric rock carvings from Crete, at Tintagel in Cornwall, Wier Island in Finland, and Chartres Cathedral. 21 Conscious or not, the phallic connotations of the cross appear even
in the present century. In the 1950's a poem in the magazine Wake
said: "Christ, I have walked around your erection, The Cross, that
begot, upon a sky of prayer, a billion men, devoted in humility." 22 During the so-called Age of Faith, the peasants were perhaps not so devoted in humility to the cross as churchmen wanted. Certain
brotherhoods of "accursed huntsmen" or "archer wizards" constantly
defaced roadside crosses, believing they could acquire magic skill with the bow by shooting three arrows in succession at a crucifix. 2 * Thus they
opposed the phallic trident of the ancient Lord of the Hunt to
Christ's symbol. (See Trident.) Today, the cross is often an article of
jewelry, attesting an amuletic function virtually indistinguishable
from its magical prophylactic use in antiquity.

Crossroads
In the Greco-Roman world, crossroads were sacred to the elder
Diana under the name of Hecate Trevia (Hecate of the Three Ways), mother of the Lares compitales, "spirits of the crossroads." Travelers made offerings to the Goddess's three-faced images, and regular festivals
called Compitalia were celebrated at her roadside shrines. 1 Four-way crossroads were sometimes dedicated to Hermes, whose
ithyphallic herms stood beside them until replaced by Christians'
roadside crosses. However, the Christian sign of the cross was copied from Hermes's cult and traced his sacred numeral 4 on the worshipper's head and breast. Hermetic crosses were left at the crossroads of
10th-century Ireland and simply re-interpreted as Christian symbols,
though they plainly displayed the twin serpents of the pagan caduceus, another sign of the older deity. 2
Cross, herm, and caduceus merged in northern symbolism with the gallows tree of Odin/Wotan, "God of the Hanged," which led to
the Christian custom of erecting a gallows at crossroads as well as a
crucifix. The god on the gallows once played the same role as Jesus on the cross: a dying-god image rendered the crossroad numinous. Pre
Christian Europeans held waymeets, or moots, at crossroads to
invoke their deities' attention to the proceedings; hence a moot point
190



used to be one to be decided at a meet. The Goddess as Mother
Earth, dispenser of "natural law" and creatress of birth-and-death
cycles, was always present where the dying god died as the women
long remembered. The English monk Aelfric complained of female customs dedicating newborn infants to the ancient Mother. Women
would "go to the crossways and drag their children over the earth, and thereby give both themselves and their children to the Devil." 3 As the crossroad ceremonies and their deities became diabolized,
the Goddess of the waymeet became the queen of witches, who still
worked magic there. The Key ofSolomon said crossroads were the best
of all places for magical procedures "during the depth and silence of the night." 4 Ghosts of the hanged, of the heathen, and of ancient aracles still haunted crossroads. Bernard Ragner said a spirit voice
would foretell the future to anyone who went to a crossroad at the last
hour of Christmas Eve. As late as the 1920's, English farmers still
relieved witches' sabbats were held at crossroads. Necromantic supersti
:ions were encouraged by the custom of burying criminals and
suicides in unhallowed ground at crossroads; clergymen said anyone so
juried would walk as a ghost. Sometimes, such corpses were pinned down with a stake: "A stake was driven through them when deposited at
:he cross-roads in order to keep the ghost from wandering abroad." 5
Presumably, the ghost could be consulted in situ, just as spirits could be aised from their graves in the churchyard by any necromancer. Thus Hermes and Hecate, who led the souls of the dead in
antiquity, became dread spirits of "witchcraft" in the same places that
hey once benevolently ruled.

Crow
\long with the vulture and raven, the carrion-eating crow was
borthern Europe's common symbol of the Death-goddess. Valkyries, pometimes described as man-eating women, often took totemic form
as ravens or crows. 1
Anglo-Danish myths spoke of a witch named Krake (Crow),
daughter of the Valkyrie Brunnhilde. Krake was a shape-shifter: at :imes a beautiful virgin, at other times a hag, monster, or crow. She
named the Danish king Ragnar Lodbrok (Leather-Breeches), and jave birth to the hero Sigurd. 2 Sigurd was the same as Siegfried, whose
nystic lady-love was the Valkyrie Brunnhilde; thus appeared the ame convoluted incestuous relationships found in the oldest myths of acred kingship. Again, the Triple Goddess returned as the three
irophetic daughters of Ragnar and Krake, Fate-weavers who created he magic banner called Raven (Hraefn). 3 There was a mythological Kraken associated with the sea, pictured
is a serpent or water-monster; but this was only another form of the

Crusades same Death-goddess. The Three Ravens (Kraken) in old ballads were birds of doom perching over the slain hero. Sometimes there were
^^^^^^^^^^m only two of them, as in the ballad of the Twa Corbies (Two Crows),
who proposed to pluck out the bonny blue eyes of the slain knight. 4 Such manifestations of the Goddess as a crow might be linked wit
Coronis, "Crow," a death aspect of the pre-Hellenic earth mother Rhea. Classical mythographers tended to ignore Coronis, rememberinj her only as the virgin mother of the healing god Asclepius; but she seems to have been another of the Virgin-Crone combinations: Rhea Kronia as Mother Time who brings death to all things. 5

Crusades
"Holy wars" designed to wrest property away from the heathen or
heretic enemies of orthodox Christianity. Crusades were usually fough
by vassals of Christian overlords, including the wealthy clergy. Warriors were promised not only the standard soldiers' spoils, but also
indulgences, like instant remission of sins and admission to heaven
guaranteed no matter what crimes the crusader may have committed.
From the 8th to 10th centuries, the Holy Roman Empire was harassed by Norsemen, who owned many northern trading centers
and dominated the seas. They also opened negotiations with foreign powers in North Africa and the Middle East. In 834, Arabian legates
visited Denmark to contract military and trade alliances. 1 The Holy Roman Empire saw itself trapped between two anti-Christian forces: the pagan Normans in the northwest, and the Moslem Saracens in the
southeast. Norsemen controlled trade routes through the Danube
and Black Sea to the Turks, and were acquiring hoards of Arabic silver
gold, and gems. They also sailed the Atlantic coasts down to Gibral
tar, and founded colonies in Libya. The Kingdom of God was nearly
encircled.
Pope Urban II tried to solve the problem by initiating crusades in
the east, on the pretext of converting the Saracens' possessions in the "Holy Land" into Christian fiefs. In 1095 he instigated the People's
Crusade as a combination of penitential pilgrimage and a war of
conquest. It was advertised throughout Europe. All who participated
were placed above restrictions of law, and promised forgiveness of
sins and eternal bliss in heaven without any time spent in purgatory.
A rabble of some 1 50,000 to 300,000 persons, mostly the dregs c society mixed with military mercenaries, set out across southern
Europe, killing, torturing, and looting as they went. One division slaughtered 10,000 Jews in the Rhineland, then forgot about the Holy Land and dispersed. Two other divisions did so much harm in
Hungary that native soldiers rose up against them and destroyed
them all. Multitudes died along the way, of sickness, hunger, or injurie
192



brought on by their violence. A remnant survived to plunder the too- Crusades
hospitable Greeks, then to enter Constantinople. There, stronger
crusaders sold off the weaker ones as slaves, to finance their own ^^^^^_^_^_
provisions. Finally, a remaining 7,000 or so crossed the Bosporus and
were attacked by the Turks, who soon killed them all. 2
One might think the fate of Pope Urban's crusade would have
discouraged future experiments of this kind. Not so. It seems to have been an idea whose time had come.
Later crusades were better organized, with more experienced
soldiers and fewer penitential pilgrims. Their primary motive was loot. For the next 400 years, Christian knights went forth to astonish the Saracens with their intellectual naYvete and their military sophistica
tion, developed in a feudal society based on warfare.
The Crusaders in general, in spite oftheir sacred cause, behaved like highway robbers. The first host which set out in 1095, and was
annihilated by the Turks at Nicaea, killed, burned and pillaged all they encountered. The army commanded by Godfrey de Bouillon massa
cred the entire population ofJerusalem (1098). The astuteness of Venice turned aside the fourth Crusade upon Constantinople, and the sack of this city is a dark blot on the history of Western Christendom (1204). It
was abominably ravaged, and the very church ofSt. Sophia was the
scene ofbloody and sacrilegious orgies. *
A contemporary chronicler said Jerusalem withstood a month's
siege. Upon its fall, crusaders rode into the city with their horses wading
"knee-deep in the blood of disbelievers." Jews were herded into their
synagogues and burned alive. On the next day, the knights slaughtered "a great multitude of people of every age, old men and women, maidens, children and mothers with infants, by way of a solemn
sacrifice" to Jesus. 4 At the battle of Acre, Richard Coeur de Lion
violated his pledge of truce, and had his hostages slaughtered and flayed. "His conduct stands in strong contrast with the dignity and forbear
ance of Saladin, before whose eyes the outrage was committed, and who
would not stoop to retaliate on his dastardly opponent." 5
Once the crusading system was established, it was turned on other enemies of the church closer to home and became the standard
method for dealing with European heathens and heretics. Between
1236 and 1283 a crusade of extermination was preached against the
pagan Prussians by Pope Honorius, and carried out by the Teutonic
Knights. The Christian Brethren of the Sword similarly converted Livonia and Courland. Armies of the Christian Dukes of Poland forced
the Wends to accept Christian baptism and vassalage. The Lithua
nians stubbornly clung to their paganism to the end of the 14th century,
but eventually they too were Christianized by the sword. 6
It was noticed in the 1 3th century that the semi-barbarous Ste
dingers of the lower Weser river maintained their ancient tribal
system, paid no attention to the church, and contributed no tithes. Pope
Gregory IX sent bulls to the bishops of Minden, Lubeck, and
193



Crusades Verden, ordering crusades against these recalcitrant peasants, whom he
described as heretics because they consulted wise-women, made
^^^^^^^^^^^^ waxen images, and worshipped "demons." Crusaders were promised
blanket pardon for their sins. However, the Stedingers fought back stubbornly, and several campaigns against them failed. At last in 1234 a
huge army marched into their land, ravaged every home with fire and sword, and wiped them out. Their property was divided between the
church and the barons. 7
It has been estimated that Europe was Christianized at a cost of
about 8 million to 10 million lives. 8 Even after nominal conversion,
there was much residual resistance to the new cult, which was alien and
unappealing to the people it was imposed on. The clergy claimed authority from an unfamiliar eastern savior and his God, defaming all
the pagans' local, ancestral deities many worshipped since the Neolithic age as demons. Moreover, familiar laws and lifestyle were
declared wholly sinful. It's hardly surprising that there arose heresy
after heresy to confront the conquering church, which became increas
ingly fanatical in its dictatorial policies, yet in the end failed to
overcome the people's need to assert their own religious heterodoxy. 9 Many refused to give up their pagan Goddess, or their notion that sexuality contained an element of the divine. Many remembered a time,
not so long before, when "holy communion" was a taste of divine
bliss through sensual pleasures: an idea that was especially prevalent in the south of France. Crusades against the Catharan or Albigensian heretics of southern
France were particularly virulent, since these people were prosperous
enough to attract plunderers, and bitterly opposed to the Roman church, which they called the Synagogue of Satan. They condemned
its worship of holy images as idolatry, denied the power of its sacraments, scoffed at the Trinity, insisted on reading the Bible for
themselves, and revived the old Gnostic belief that the Jehovah worshipped by the Roman church was a demonic demiurge who created
the world of matter to entrap souls in wickedness. Pope Alexander III
anathematized the Catharan communities and sent ecclesiastical
judges to investigate their offenses in 1 163. Of these judges, the word
"inquisitor" was used for the first time. 10
In 1209 Pope Innocent II preached a great crusade against the
French rebels. This has gone down in history as the Albigensian
crusade, one of the bloodiest chapters in Christianity's past. 11 Half of France was exterminated. When the papal legate was asked how
heretics were to be distinguished from the faithful, he replied, "Kill them all; God will know his own." 12 Soon the legate was able to report that in Beziers alone, "nearly twenty thousand human beings perished by the sword. And after the massacre the town was plundered and burnt, and the revenge of God seemed to rage over it in a wonderful manner." The killing of
heretics went on continually for twenty years, and it has been estimated
that more than a million were slaughtered. 13
194



This was more than a police action against heresy. It was the Cu Chulainn destruction of a whole civilization that had the misfortune to be more advanced than the rest of Europe.
In the twelfth century, the south ofFrance had been the most civilized land in Europe. There commerce, industry, art, science, had been far in advance of the age. The cities had won virtual self-government, were
proud of their wealth and strength, jealous oftheir liberties, and self
sacrificing in their patriotism. The nobles, for the most part, were cultivated men, poets themselves or patrons ofpoetry, who had learned that their prosperity depended on the prosperity oftheir subjects, and that municipal liberties were a safeguard rather than a menace to the wise ruler. The Crusaders came, and their unfinished work was taken up and executed to the bitter end by the Inquisition. It left a ruined and
impoverished country, with shattered industries and a failing commerce. The native nobles were broken by confiscation and replaced by
strangers A people ofrare gifts had been tortured, decimated, humiliated, despoiled. . . . The precocious civilization which had promised to lead Europe in the path ofculture was gone, and to Italy was transmitted
the honour of the Renaissance. H
Catholic writers made many efforts to justify the destruction.
Apologists like Pierre des Vaux-de-Cernay used vituperation, calling the Catharan opinions "this detestable pest ... the poison of superstitious
infidelity." He said Toulouse was "marvelously and miserably infected with this plague . . . almost all the barons of Provence had become
harborers and defenders of heretics." In the 19th century, Abbe
Vacandard said, "The Church, after all, was only defending herself.
The Cathari sought to wound her mortally by attacking her doctrine, her hierarchy and her apostolicity. She would have been ruined if
their perfidious insinuations, which brought violent disturbance into men's minds, had prevailed in the end." 15 It has ever been the
church's habit to regard any skepticism concerning its pronouncements
as "violent disturbance"; but of course, all the bloodletting was in
vain. Skepticism did prevail in the end.

Cu Chulainn
Celtic dying god, a son of God, born of a virgin, reincarnated as both Father and Son. It was said of him that he was "begotten by a man that
was not a man; his father was reared by his mother as a child, a child
which died and did not die." J In other words, he was a pre-Christian
Christ figure, God-begotten on the "Mother of God," of one substance with his own Father. Cu Chulainn received the death-curse of the Goddess Macha, and
died bound to a sacred pillar, pierced by arrows, his blood fertilizing
195



Cuckold the earth. Other Celtic heroes died the same way. Their idols were
sometimes interpreted as images of St. Sebastian, now officially ^^^^^^^^^^^_ viewed as an over-hasty canonization of a Gaulish heathen savior. 2
Cu Chulainn received his education in battle skills from Skadi, or
Scatha, the same northern death-goddess as the Queen of Skye. His
destiny or "weird" was to kill his rival on the "precursor day of spring," so the shedding of blood would "allow spring to enter." 3 The same
idea of bloodshed to facilitate the return of spring is found in Teutonic
myths of Skadi. 4
Cu means "dog," a common title of Celtic chieftains (as in
Cunobelin) identified with the underworld Lord of Death. Like
Egypt's Anubis, the dead hero might become the canine gatekeeper charged with admitting souls to paradise, as shown on the Gundes
trup Cauldron. 5 The dog represented reincarnation. So did Cu Chulainn, who was promised that "his rebirth would be of himself."
He was sent to Emania, the realm of the dead in the moon. 6 He may
have been the original of the British legend that the man in the moon
is really a dog, who acts as a messenger of death. 7 The virgin mother of Cu Chulainn conceived him by eating his
soul in the form of a fly. This Celtic soul-symbol originated in the Middle East, where the Lord of Death was Baal-Zebub (Beelzebub), Lord of Flies. Like most pagan gods, Cu Chulainn was a shape
shifter. He could be an insect, animal, or man at different stages in his life cycle. Such changes from one shape to another were based on the
ancient Indo-European idea of metempsychosis. The Protean hero even adapted his shape to Christianity; the medieval Irish insisted that
he was an avatar of Christ. 8
Later Irish writers pretended that Cu Chulainn was not ignomini
ously trussed up to his pillar as a sacrifice, in the manner of the old
gods. They thought it important to prove that he fell in battle. Therefore they invented the legend that, wounded and knowing himself doomed, Cu Chulainn tied himself to the sacred pillar so he couldn't

Cuckold
Derived from "cuckoo," the bird of May, anciently sacred to the
promiscuous May-games that medieval Europe inherited from paganism. 1 The man who became a cuckoo, or cuckold, was one who didn't care whether his wife was faithful or not, for both of them
attended the Maytime festivities when ritual promiscuity was the
rule or fertility charm as late as the 16th century. 2 The season of
"wearing of the green" in honor of the reborn vegetation was
196



announced by the cuckoo's singing "from every holt and heath," as Cunt
Chaucer put it; and marriage bonds were temporarily in abeyance.
The cuckold's horns descended from another pagan sign, that of ^_^^^^^^^_
the Horned God, sacrificed as a stag, goat, or ram at the spring feasts. Pagan priests used to wear the horns of the sacrificed animal on their heads; and horned masks or headdresses were commonly worn by
participants in the rite, in the god's honor. A 16th-century writer therefore described the cuckold as "cornute," that is, "as soundly
armed for the head, as either Capricorn, or the stoutest horned sign in the Zodiac." 3 See Horns.

Cunt
Derivative of the Oriental Great Goddess as Cunti, or Kunda, the
Yoni of the Uni-verse. 1 From the same root came county, kin, and kind
(Old English cyn, Gothic kuni). Related forms were Latin cunnus, Middle English cunte, Old Norse and Frisian kunta, Basque cuna.
Other cognates are "cunabula," a cradle, or earliest abode; "Cunina," a Roman Goddess who protected children in the cradle;
"cunctipotent," all-powerful (i.e., having cunt-magic); "cunicle," a
hole or passage; "cuniculate," penetrated by a passage; "cundy," a
coverted culvert; also cunning, kenning, and ken: knowledge, learn
ing, insight, remembrance, wisdom. Cunt is "not slang, dialect or any marginal form, but a true language word, and of the oldest stock." 2
"Kin" meant not only matrilineal blood relations, but also a cleft or
crevice, the Goddess's genital opening. A Saharan tribe called Kuntahs traced their descent from this holy place. 3 Indian "kundas" were
their mothers' natural children, begotten out of wedlock as gifts of the Goddess Kunda.4 Of old the name applied to girls, as in China where
girls were once considered children of their mothers only, having no
natural connection with fathers. 5
In ancient writings, the word for "cunt" was synonymous with
"woman," though not in the insulting modern sense. An Egyptologist was shocked to find the maxims of Ptah-Hotep "used for 'woman' a
term that was more than blunt," though its indelicacy was not in the
eye of the ancient beholder, only in that of the modern scholar. 6
Medieval clergymen similarly perceived obscenity in female-geni
tal shrines of the pagans: holy caves, wells, groves. Any such place was called cunnus diaboli, "devilish cunt." Witches who worshipped there sometimes assumed the name of the place, like the male witch Johannes Cuntius mentioned by Thomas More. 7 "Under painful circumstances" this witch died at the hands of witch hunters, but it was said he was resurrected, and came back to earth as a lecherous incubus. 8
Sacred places identified with the world-cunt sometimes embar
rassed Victorian scholars who failed to understand their earlier
197



Cupid meaning. A.H. Clough became a laughing-stock among Gaelic-speakCurse, Mother's ing students when he published a poem called Toper-na-Fuosich, ^^^^^^^^^^^m literally "bearded well," a Gaelic place-name for a cunt-shrine. The synonym "twat" was ignorantly used by another Victorian poet,
Robert Browning, in the closing lines of his Pippa Passes:
Then, owls and bats, Cowls and twats, Monks and nuns, in a cloisters moods,
Adjourn to the oak-stump pantry!
Editors of the Oxford English Dictionary hesitantly asked Browning where he learned the word. He said it came from a bawdy
broadside poem of 1659: "They talked of his having a Cardinal's Hat; They'd send him as soon an Old Nun's Twat." Browning thought the
word meant a wimple, or other headgear corresponding to "hat." 9

Cupid
Roman name for the god of erotic love, Greek Eros, Hindu Kama.
Cupid was the son of Venus and Mercury (Aphrodite and Hermes), and was therefore a "Herm-Aphrodite," signifying sexual union. In Christian usage, the ancient significance of sexual desire was
confused with desire for money, hence the modern "cupidity," which used to mean "lust" but now means greed. In the same way, Latin
caritas was altered from sensual or sexual giving to the modern
"charity," giving of money. Renaissance art made emanations of Cupid into amoretti, "little
loves," shown as winged babies. But ancient talismans of Cupid were
not babies; they were winged phalli of bronze, ivory, or wood, which gave rise to an Italian slang term for the penis, uccello, "little bird." '

Curse, Mother's
In ancient Asiatic belief, a mother's curse meant certain death. All
death was brought about by the Goddess's word of destruction, as all birth was brought about by her word of creation. By virtue of
motherhood, any woman could tap the verbal power of the Goddess. The Markandaya Purana says, "for all curses there is some remedy;
but there is nothing anywhere that can dispel the curse of those who
have been cursed by a mother." J Similarly, the biblical Hannah
rejoiced when she became a mother, saying, "My mouth is enlarged over mine enemies" (1 Samuel 2:1) because maternity gave her
curses an irresistible power.
198



Homer tells the story of Meleager, cursed by his mother for
murdering her brothers. Falling on her knees, she knocked the earth with her fists and called upon the underground Goddess. "And the Fury that walks in the dark and has inexorable thoughts heard her
from Erebus." 2 The Fury told Meleager's mother to burn his soul in the form of a wand, so he was stricken with a fever, and soon died. 3
Witchcraft of this sort was not even necessary the curse alone
could kill. The Greek word for the effect of a mother's curse was
miasma, a kind of spiritual pollution bringing slow but sure destruction. Miasma could pursue members of a clan for many generations. The
tragic family history of Orestes might be traced to a curse laid by the Goddess Artemis herself on his ancestor Atreus, who dared to
withhold the golden fleece of a sacrificial lamb she had sent, using it to
confirm his right to rule. 4
Gods launched curses too, and some of them were spectacular, like those with which Yahweh threatened all who disobeyed him: a
combination of pestilence, fever, consumption, inflammation, blasting, mildew, extreme burning, emerods (hemorrhoids), the scab, the itch,
the botch of Egypt, madness, blindness, slavery, great plagues of long continuance, and barrenness of the land (Deuteronomy 28). However, the gods' curses seemed not to arouse as much terror as those of Goddess or Mother.
The terrible vehicle of the feminine curse was menstrual blood, still called The Curse. To "damn" has been linked with the Hebrew
dam, "blood," specifically mother-blood, the fluid of the womb, an
ciently thought to create one's very soul and destroy it. Dam was also synonymous with "mother" (ma-dam, my mother). Elder women past menopause were thought to be the most efficient cursers, on the
ancient theory that their "wise blood" was retained in their bodies, giving them numinous power to make their words come true. 5 This
was why medieval Europe believed any destructive charm having
menstrual blood as one of its ingredients must be irresistible, and why
elder women were viewed as prototypical witches, their words or even
their glances heavy with dread. Fathers of the church even wooed converts with the assurance that
the Christian faith was strong enough to overcome a mother's curse,
the most powerful curse known to man. St. Augustine claimed that some children cursed by their mother were afflicted by constant
weakness and tremors, but St. Stephen converted them to Christianity, and they were completely cured of the effects of the curse. 6 Eastern sages believed the feminine power of the curse must be
allayed not so much by opposing it with a patriarchal religion, as by treating women well, so they would not be inclined to use their
destructive power. The Laws of Manu said:
Women must be honored and adorned by their fathers, brothers, husbands, and brothers-in-law, who desire their own welfare. Where women are honored, there the gods are pleased, but where they are not

Cut hbert , Saint honored, no sacred rite yields rewards. Where the female relations live
in grief, the family soon wholly perishes; but that family where they are ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ not unhappy ever prospers. The houses on which female relations, not
being duly honored, pronounce a curse, perish completely, as ifdestroyed by magic. 7
This advice came from the place northern Aryans called Mutspellheim, the Home of the Mother's Curse, in "the hot lands of the
south." According to the Scandinavian prophecy of doomsday, the
Mutspell would fall upon the violent patriarchal gods who ignored ancient tribal bonds and rules of morality, and instituted cruel warfare. The result of the Mother's Curse would be the death of all
gods, their Gotterdammerung or Going-Into-the-Shadow; thus it seemed the Mother's word of destruction meant the end of the world. 8
Christian Gnostic writings reveal the same belief in a world
destroying curse from a Great Mother disgusted with the cruel behavior of the gods she created. In her anger, the Goddess would send a great power from the place "where the firmament of woman is
situated," the Gnostic equivalent of Mutspellheim. "Then she will drive out the gods of Chaos whom she had created together with the first
Father. She will cast them down to the abyss. They will be wiped out by
their own injustice." 9 Myths in general suggest that a mother's curse was the necessary instrument of destruction for any god, even a Savior-son, most of whom were solemnly cursed before immolation. 10 Since a mother's
curse was immutable, no guilt accrued to the executioners who
carried out sacrificial killings in ancient dramas of death and resurrec
tion. Mythology bears out the archetypal idea that one who gives
birth has unlimited power over the life so given, and may retain control
of that life's duration.
As a rule therefore, death curses usually employed female symbolism. Typical was the curse of the "black fast," utilizing a black hen,
once sacred to the Queen of the Shades as destructive twin of the
Mother of the World Egg. The curse was accomplished by the
operator and the black hen fasting together, every Friday for nine weeks (the Goddess's day and number). After this, an accursed one was sure
to die. 11

Cuthbert, Saint
Once a pagan Lord of the Hunt with a pilgrimage center at Durham, formerly Duirholm, "Meadow of the Deer." In 1 104, Durham Cathedral was erected over the god's old shrine.
It housed the undecaying corpse of Cuthbert, whose sainthood was
200



proven by his incorruptibility. He was periodically displayed, and always pronounced remarkably fresh. His remains were last viewed in 1827 and found to be as plump and rosy as ever almost as if he were a
waxwork, if it were possible to suspect the church of perpetrating
such a hoax.
Oddly enough, while his incorruptible body lay in Durham Cathedral, St. Cuthbert also lived on at the bottom of the sea, as a marine
smith-god who forged beads for rosaries in his ocean cave. Crinoid shells washed up on Northumbrian beaches after storms were known as St. Cuthbert's Beads. 1
There was also a St. Cuthbert's Well, located near the famous
Eden Hall, whose "luck" talisman was a sacred chalice inherited from
the fairies. 2 The waters of St. Cuthbert's Well were credited with the
usual miraculous powers of healing and preserving health.

Cybele
Cybele
Great Mother of the Gods from Ida Magna Mater Deum Idea
brought to Rome from Phrygia in 204 B.C. Her triumphal procession was "later glorified by marvelous legends, and the poets told of
edifying miracles that had occurred during Cybele's voyage." l Her holy aniconic image was carried to Rome by order of the
Cumaean Sybil, a personification of the same cave-dwelling Goddess herself. As the Great Mother of all Asia Minor, she was worshipped
especially on Mt. Ida, Mt. Sipylus, Cyzicus, Sardis, and Pessinus in Galatia. 2
Her festivals were called ludi, "games." 3 A highlight of her
worship was the Taurobolium, baptism in the blood of a sacred bull,
who represented her dying-god consort, Attis. Her temple stood on the Vatican, where St. Peter's basilica stands today, up to the 4th century
a.d. when Christians took it over. 4 She was one of the leading deities of
Rome in the heyday of the mystery cults, along with Hecate and Demeter of Eleusis. 5
Other names for Cybele assimilated her to every significant form of the Great Goddess. She was the Berecynthian Mother (genetrix Berecynthia). She was Rhea Lobrine, Goddess of sacred caves, known as her "marriage bowers." 7 She was called Augusta, the Great One;
Alma, the Nourishing One; Sanctissima, the Most Holy One. Roman
emperors like Augustus, Claudius, and Antoninus Pius regarded her
as the supreme deity of the empire. Augustus established his home
facing her temple, and looked upon his wife, the empress Livia Augusta, as an earthly incarnation of her. 8 The emperor Julian wrote an
impassioned address to her:
Who is then the Mother ofthe Gods? She is the source ofthe intellectual
and creative gods, who in their turn guide the visible gods; she is both
Variations of
Cybele's name Kubaba, Kuba, Kube have been linked with the Ka'aba stone at Mecca, a meteoric "cube" that bore the Goddess's symbol and was once known as the Old Woman. 6

Cyboread the mother and the spouse ofmighty Zeus; she came into being next to
Cynosure and together with the great creator; she is in control ofevery form of
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ life, and the cause ofall generation; she easily brings to perfection all
things that are; she is the motherless maiden, enthroned at the side of Zeus, and in very truth is the Mother ofall the Gods. 9
Fathers of the Christian church vehemently disagreed. St. Augus
tine called Cybele a harlot mother, "the mother, not of the gods, but of the demons." 10 One of her names, Antaea, made her the mythical mother of the
earth-giant Antaeus, who was invincible as long as his feet remained
in contact with his Mother's body, the earth. Heracles conquered him
by holding him up in the air. Churchmen believed the powers of witches came from the same sort of contact with Mother Earth.
Arresting officers often carried witches to prison in a large basket, so
their feet would not touch the ground. 11
There was a Christian sect founded in the 2nd century a.d. by
Montanus (Mountain man), a priest of Cybele, who identified Attis with Christ. Montanus maintained that women were agents of the
Goddess, and could preach and prophesy as well as men. This contradicted the orthodox Pauline sect, which followed St. Paul's rule
that women must never speak publicly on holy subjects. 12 During the 4th century, Montanist Christianity was declared a heresy, and many of its adherents were slain. Some Montanists in Asia Minor were locked
in their churches and burned alive. 13

tions as "God" today.
Dagon
Philistine sea god, one of Yahweh's leading enemies (Judges 16:23).
He appeared as a merman, fish-man, or serpent-man. He was mated to Atargatis, the Philistine form of Astarte. Since she was a Mistress of
Earth and Sea like her Mycenaean twin Demeter, her consort also
patronized both farming and fishing. In Canaan, he was the "grain god" Dagan, father of Baal, mated to Anath, the Canaanite version of the same Great Mother. On account of the bad publicity given him
in the Bible, he naturally became a leading demon of the Christian hell.
Dakhma
Iranian topless "tower of silence," once used to dispose of dead

off gobbets of meat, may have descended from a legendary sage's sojourn in a dakhma as a ceremonial death-and-rebirth.
Dakini
"Skywalker," a Tantric priestess, embodying the spirit of Kali Ma as an angel of death. 1 Dakinis were usually elder women, but sometimes
young women impersonating the divine Shakti who took the last
breath of the enlightened sage with a kiss of peace. Dakinis attended the
dying, embracing and comforting them in their last moments. But
there were also "fierce dakinis," representing violent or painful forms of
death. 2
Like western witches, dakinis held their meetings in cemeteries or
cremation grounds, having charge of funeral rites and the preparation of dead bodies. See Death.

var. Danu, Danuna, Dana Danae
Eponymous Great Mother of the Danes and many other peoples,
such as the Danaans, the Danaids, the biblical Danites, and the Irish Tuatha De Danann, "people of the Goddess Dana." l The Russians



called her Dennitsa, "Greatest of all Goddesses." A medieval Russian
exorcism said: "In the morning let us rise and pray to God and
Dennitsa." 4
As Danu-Ana, or Anu, she led the Irish trinity of Fates, collectivethe Morrigan. Mountains in Kerry are still named after her breasts,
the Paps of Anu. 5 Under the name of Don she was masculinized as a
"king" of Dublin in late Irish legend; but the same "king" was also
called Mother of the Gods. 6 Sometimes the Irish called her Domnu, a
mother Goddess personifying the Deep. 7
Classical Greek mythology humanized the Goddess Danae, in
much the same way as the Bible humanized Earth Mother Eve; the
two were the same deity, fructified by the Heaven-father's seminal rain.
The Hellenic Danae was a virgin princess impregnated by Zeus's shower of golden rain that is, urine, to which primitives sometimes attributed the same reproductive power as semen. As result of this beneficial moistening, Danae bore the hero Perseus, who annoyed fathers of the Christian church by being as verifiably god-begotten
and virgin-born and their own savior.9 But Danae, like Eve, was really another name for the universal Triple Goddess, also called Dam-kina
by the Sumerians, Dinah by the Hebrews, and Danu or Dunnu in Babylon. The Greeks knew of three Danaids, known as Telchines or "Enchanters," who founded the three chief cities of Rhodes. 10 Writers of the Old Testament disliked the Danites, whom they
called serpents (Genesis 49:17). Nevertheless, they adopted Dan-El or Daniel, a Phoenician god of divination, and transformed him into a
Hebrew prophet. His magic powers like those of the Danites emanated from the Goddess Dana and her sacred serpents. He served as court
astrologer and dream-interpreter for both the Persian king Cyrus, and
the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel 1:21, 2:1), indicating that "Daniel" was not a personal name but a title, like the Celtic one: "a person of the Goddess Dana."

Daphne
Pre-Hellenic Aegean tribes called her Danuna, Universal Mother. 2 The rivers of
Amazon country were named after her Danube, Don, Dnieper because she
represented "Waters." To the Hindus she was "Waters of Heaven," mother of the Vedic
gods. 3
In Saxon myth, Danu-Ana became Black Annis, or Anna of the Angles, or the Blue Hag, or
Angurboda, mother of Hel. An ancient cave-shrine at Dane's Hill in Leicestershire
was her dwelling place, known as Black Annis's Bower.8
Daphne
"Laurel," the plant of prophecy chewed by the Goddess's priestesses in the vale of Tempe, until Apollo's cult replaced hers, and restricted
laurel-chewing to the Delphic Pythoness. 1 The Goddess's original name was Daphoene, "Bloody One," in early times when her Maenads
were still performing blood sacrifices.
Orgiastic Daphne entered classical mythology as a purified virgin who was saved from rape by Apollo through a transformation into a
laurel tree in the nick of time. The myth seems to have been suggested
by an icon showing the Goddess's face looking down from the branches of a laurel tree upon the sacred king immolated at her feet.

Dark Age Laurel remained the plant of inspiration and poetic frenzy. Laurel crowns were given to the best poets, who were then called "laureate"

Dark Age
Western histories have put forth many theories about the fall of
Rome and attributed the onset of the Dark Age to a wide variety of
causes, except the one cause that may have had more to do with it
than any other: Christianity. 1 By denying women's spiritual significance and forbidding Goddess worship, the church alienated both sexes from their pagan sense of unity with the divine through each other.
Christians said one of the diabolic symptoms of the oncoming end of the world was "the spread of knowledge," which they endeavored to check with wholesale book-burnings, destruction of libraries and
schools, and opposition to education for laymen. 2 By the end of the
5th century, Christian rulers forcibly abolished the study of philosophy,
mathematics, medicine, and geography. Lactantius said no Christian should study astronomy. Pope Gregory the Great denounced all secular education as folly and wickedness, and forbade Christian laymen to read even the Bible. He burned the library of the Palatine Apollo, "lest
its secular literature distract the faithful from the contemplation of
heaven." 3
In the church's view, every opinion except its own was heretical
and devilish, likely to raise doubts in the minds of believers. There
fore, pagan intellectuals and teachers were persecuted and schools were
closed. Christian emperors commanded the burning of all books of the philosophers, as Theodosius said, "for we would not suffer any of those things so much as to come to men's ears, which would tend to
provoke God to wrath and offend the minds of the pious." After years of
vandalism and destruction, St. John Chrysostom proudly boasted, "Every trace of the old philosophy and literature of the ancient world
has vanished from the face of the earth." 4
It was almost true. Christian persecutions left "but few fragments
of a vast liturgy and religious literature of paganism which would have
cast many a ray of light on the origins of our own faith; and demolished
holy places and beautiful temples such as the world shall never rear again." 5 After temples were destroyed, monks and hermits were settled
in the ruins to defile the site with their excrement, and to prevent
reconstruction. 6
Rulers melted down bronze, gold, and silver artworks for money.
Peasants broke up marble gods and goddesses and fed their pieces
into limekilns for mortar. 7 It is recorded that 4th-century Rome had 424
temples, 304 shrines, 80 statues of deities in precious metal, 64
statues of ivory, 3,700 statues in bronze, and thousands in marble. By
208



the next century, nearly all of them were gone. The historian
Eunapius, a hierophant of the Eleusinian Mysteries, watched the destruction and wrote that the empire was being overwhelmed by a
"fabulous and formless darkness mastering the loveliness of the world." 8
Roman society was losing its cohesiveness and discipline, with the
usual symptoms of social decline: runaway inflation, shortages, crime,
apathy, and a discouraged middle class taxed to the breaking point to
support a top-heavy, stagnant bureaucracy.9 Most Christians came not from that middle class, but from the lower elements of society,
taking advantage of lawless times to grab what they could. Celsus said the Christians invited into their ranks "whosoever is a sinner or
unintelligent, or a fool, in a word, whosoever is god-forsaken, him the
kingdom of God will receive. Now whom do you mean by the sinner
but the wicked: thief, housebreaker, poisoner, temple robber, grave
robber?. . . Jesus, they say, was sent to save sinners; was he not sent to help those who have kept themselves free from sin? They pretend
that God will save the unjust man if he repents and humbles himself.
The just man who has held steadily from the cradle in the ways of virtue he will not look upon." 10
Bertrand Russell described the philosophical outlook of St. Jerome:
"He thinks the preservation of virginity more important than victory over the Huns and Vandals and Goths. Never once do his thoughts turn
to any possible measure of practical statesmanship; never once does he point out the evils of the fiscal system, or of reliance on an army
composed of barbarians. The same is true of Ambrose and Augus
tine. ... It is no wonder that the Empire fell into ruin." n
Conventional histories presented a picture of early Christians as
peaceable souls, unjustly persecuted. This picture could only have arisen because historical writing was monopolized by the church for
many centuries, and there was no compunction about changing or
falsifying records. Pagan Rome didn't persecute religious minorities. "It never disputed the existence or reality of other deities, and the addition of a new member to the Pantheon was a matter of indiffer
ence. . . . [A]U deities of all peoples were regarded as but manifestations
of the one supreme deity." Dionysus, Venus, and Priapus were honored co-residents of the temple of Isis in Pompeii. Italian and Greek
deities mixed together in the temple of Mithra at Ostia. 12 All deities
were willing to co-exist except the Christian one. The Christian church
alone "has always held the toleration of others to be the persecution
of itself." 1J As early as 382 a.d., the church officially declared that any
opposition to its own creed in favor of others must be punished by the
death penalty. 14 Contrary to the conventional mythology, Christians were not
prosecuted under Roman law for being Christians but for committing
civil crimes. 15 They caused riots, "often tumultuously interrupted the
public worship, and continually railed against the national religion." 16
They seem to have been guilty of vandalism and arson. The Great Fire
Dark Age
209



Daik Age in 64 a.d. was set by Christians who were "anxiously waiting for the
world to end by fire and who did at times start fires in order to prompt
^^^^^^^^^^^ God." 17 Crying that the world would end at any moment, Christian
fanatics sometimes developed the notion that starting the fires of the
final holocaust would redound to their credit in heaven. 18 At least one
saint was canonized for no particular reason other than having been an
arsonist: St. Theodore, whose sole claim to fame was burning down
the temple of the Mother of the Gods. 19 The decline of Roman civilization and the onset of the Dark Age
was the period Gilbert Murray characterized as the western world's
failure of nerve. It marked the transition of the west from a position of
cultural leadership to one of regressed barbarism, and transformed
Europe into what is now known as an "undeveloped area." 20 Intellect,
taste, and imagination disappeared from art and literature. Rather
than broadening the western mind, its church crippled that mind by
allowing childish superstitions to flourish in an atmosphere of ignorance and unreason. 21 Suppression of the teaching priestess or alma materled to an eclipse of education in general.
Many scholars fled from Christian persecutions eastward to Iran, where the Sassanid king helped them found a school of medicine and
science. This was the world's intellectual capital for two centuries. 22
Already in 529, when Justinian closed the Athenian schools, Helle
nistic learning had been dispersed to Sassanian Persia, Gupta India, ant
Celtic Ireland. 23 Church historians have claimed nothing of real value was lost in
the destruction of pagan culture. Modern scholars disagree. The
havoc that afflicted art, science, literature, philosophy, engineering, architecture, and all other fields of achievement has been likened to
the havoc of the Gigantomachia as if the crude giants overthrew the
intelligent gods. The widespread literacy of the classical period
disappeared. Aqueducts, harbors, buildings, even the splendid Roman roads fell into ruin. It has been pointed out that centuries of
devastating war could hardly have shattered Roman civilization as
effectively as did its new obsession with an ascetic monotheism. 24
Books and artworks were destroyed because they expressed un
christian ideas and images. 25 The study of medicine was forbidden, on the ground that all diseases were caused by demons and could be
cured only by exorcism. This theory was still extant in the time of
Pope Alexander III, who forbade monks to study any techniques of healing other than verbal charms. 26 Under the Christian emperors,
educated citizens were persecuted by the illiterate who claimed their
books were witchcraft texts. Often, "magical" writings were planted by Christian magistrates for the sake of the financial rewards they
received when they caught and executed heretics a system the
Inquisition also used to advantage in later centuries. Priestesses were
especially persecuted, because they were female, wealthy, and laid
claim to spiritual authority. 27 Fathers of the church seemed cynically aware that public igno
210



ranee worked in their favor. Gregory of Nazianzus wrote to St. Jerome:
"A little jargon is all that is necessary to impose upon the people. The
less they comprehend, the more they admire. Our forefathers and
doctors have often said, not what they thought, but what circumstances
and necessity dictated." 28
Lactantius declared that pagan temples should be torn down because, in them, "The demons are attempting to destroy the
kingdom of God, and by means of false miracles and lying oracles are assuming the appearance of real gods." 29 It was dangerous to leave
the temples intact, even when they were converted into Christian churches. The temple of the Mother of Heaven at Carthage was
made over into a church, but in 440 a.d. the bishop discovered that the
Carthaginians were actually making their devotions to the old God
dess, and ordered the entire temple area leveled to the ground. 30
Ignorance was helpful to the spread of the faith; so ignorance
was fostered. Knight says, "Men are superstitious in proportion as they
are ignorant, and . . . those who know least of the principles of
religion are the most earnest and fervent." 31 In keeping western Europe
as ignorant as possible, however, the church lost much of its history.
Even contemporary events went inaccurately reported, or altogether unnoted. Events of the past were absurdly garbled. All the public
knew of history was provided by bards, who tried to maintain the druidic
tradition of rote-learning, with indifferent success. They taught, for example, that Alexander the Great made an expedition to the Garden
of Eden, where he was instructed by the poet-magician Virgil, by "Monsignor St. Paul," and by "Tholomeus" (Ptolemy), king of Egypt. They taught that Julius Caesar was a king of Hungary and Austria,
and a prince of Constantinople; his mother was the Valkyrie Brunn
hilde, a daughter of Judas Maccabeus; he married Morgana, the Fairy Queen, and became the father of Oberon and St. George. 32
The field of natural science was in even worse disorder. Learned
books taught that mice do not reproduce like other mammals but are
generated spontaneously and asexually from "the putrefaction of the earth"; that wasps produce themselves out of a dead horse and bees out of a dead calf; that a crab deprived of its legs and buried will turn
into a scorpion; that some mammals, such as hares, can change from one sex to the other; that a duck dried into powder and placed in water
will generate frogs; that a duck baked and buried will generate toads;
that asparagus is produced from buried shavings of ram's horn; that
scorpions can be created from garden basil rubbed between two
stones; that rain and lightning can be raised by burning a chameleon's liver on a rooftop; that no fleas can breed where a man scatters dust
dug up from his right footprint in the place where he heard the first
springtime call of a cuckoo. 33 Because the very idea of experimenta
tion to test hypotheses had been replaced by credulous reliance on
theological authority, even notions that would have been simple to
test remained untested.
As for more complex hypotheses, they were beyond the ken of
Dark Age
211



David, Saint theologians. Pagan thinkers long ago understood the shape of the
earth, and even calculated its approximate circumference with only a
^
^^m small error. But Lactantius and other learned churchmen called this
field of endeavor "bad and senseless," and proved by quoting the Bible
that the earth was flat. 34 The most thoroughly Christianized nations hardly began to recov
er from the church's eclipse of learning until the present century. In
Spain for example, the tradition of book-burning became an integral part of the auto-da-fe in 1 502. It was against the law for any layman
to read any book not approved by the bishops. 35 To own vernacular
copies of either Testament of the Bible was punishable by burning at
the stake. 36 Reading declined to almost nothing. What few grammar
schools existed were only "superficial preparation for the priesthood." Still, many priests were illiterate. General education was attempted only after the revolutions of 1834 and 1855, when the monasteries were suppressed. Yet in 18%, more than two-thirds of the population were
still unable to read or write. 37
Spanish suspicion of books carried over into the New World, and
deprived anthropologists and archeologists of literary treasures that might have shed much light on pre-Columbian civilizations. Spanish friars "converted" the Maya of Yucatan in 1 562, by their usual
forceful methods, such as torture and burning. They fed the fires with
hundreds of Maya sacred books which, had they survived, would have greatly assisted modern scholars to unravel the mysteries of Mayan
script. The friars said the natives were "greatly afflicted" by the loss of
their scriptures; but as far as the friars could see, these books "contained
nothing in which there was not to be seen superstition and lies of the devil, so we burned them all." 58

David, Saint
Patron saint of Wales, actually a pagan god Christianized in the 1 1th
century a.d. He was the Welsh sea god worshipped as Dewi, from the
Aryan devior deva, "deity." Though he was called a 6th-century bishop, nothing was written of him until 1090, more than 500 years
later. His wholly unreliable biography was composed chiefly to
support the Welsh bishops' independence at the time. 1
212



The city now called St. David's used to be Menevia, "Way of the Death
Moon," the same as Danish Manavegr and Irish E-Mania, the lunar
paradise.2 ^^^^^^^^^^^_
Symbol of David-Dewi was the Great Red Serpent, now the red dragon, Wales's national emblem. Like the phallic god Python or
Oceanus encircling the World Egg, he may have been reddened by his
union with the Moon-goddess Mab, who gave sovereignty to all her
kings by staining them red. 3 David's title, the Waterman, was explained by Christian scholars to
mean he was a teetotaler. 4 Welsh sailors knew better; their traditions
placed him in the depths of the sea. They called him Davy Jones, who like the sea god Mananann kept the souls of drowned seamen in his
"locker." 5
Waterman was a popular title for several ancient gods of waters
besides Dewi: notably Ceadda, a Mercian god of medicinal springs, who was canonized twice (see Chad).
Even in Christian disguise, David retained the sacred skills of a
bard. It was claimed that his miraculous talent for harping and singing
came from his lineal descent from the virgin Mary, of the ancient house
of King David the Harpist, in the eighteenth generation. Mary was also identified with the Welsh sea-goddess Marian, Dewi's bride,
receiver of the souls of the dead. Welsh bards called their death songs
marwysgafen, the "giving to Mary," sung to send the funeral boat to the
Isles of the Dead. 6 Sometimes David was confused with Merlin, who allegedly harped
and sang the stones of Stonehenge into their places. Some legends made David a bishop of Merlin's town, Caerleon. 7 Some said David
was King Arthur's uncle. Like many mythical saints, he was given a long lifetime to demonstrate the health-giving virtues of Christian faith; he lived to the age of 140 years. 8 His mother was the same virgin
temple-maiden who gave birth to nearly every ancient god; here she was St. Non (Holy Nun). 9 Two cities claimed his shrine, located not only
at St. David's but also in the city of Chester, which used to be named Deva or Dewi. 10

Ith
been said that Death came into existence only with the rise of
man's consciousness, a roundabout way of saying death is more real for humans than for any other animal, because only humans foresee it. 1
Religions owe their existence to the unique ability of the human animal
to understand that it must die.
Against this realization the forces of imagination are mustered to
deny it. It's hard for any perceiving mind to perceive its own
213



Death notbeing, with cessation of all perception. Worshippers of Kali managed to view the beyond-death state as Dreamless Sleep. 2 But most ancient
^^^^^^^^^^^ people couldn't formulate an idea of non-perception.
Even when the land of the dead was minimally stimulating, as in
the Babylonian concept, it was perceptible to the senses. It was the
House of Dust, and the end of the Road of No Return. The dead
were clothed in feathers, like birds. "Dust is their food and clay their
meat . . . , they see no light, they sit in darkness." Yet in the same
House of Dust there were priests and kings ruling, and servants to carry the baked meats and pour water from water skins. 3
Babylonian literature reveals a hope that eventually the right ritual
cure for death will be discovered, rather as modern people hope for a cure for cancer. The recommended avenue of investigation was necromantic consultation with the dead themselves. "The quest for
immortality was essentially the search for the right ritual, the knowledge of what to do in order to secure a continued existence of the body
after death. This knowledge is possessed by the ancestors, and can only be obtained from them." 4 Men have usually believed that knowledge of death can only come
from those who have experienced it. Hence the initiatory procedures involving mock death, as among Siberian shamans, who experience in trances being torn apart and reduced to bare bones. "By thus seeing
himself naked, altogether freed from the perishable and transient flesh
and blood, he consecrates himself, in the sacred tongue of the
shamans, to his great task, through that part of his body which will longest withstand the action of the sun, wind and weather, after he is
dead. . . . [I]n certain Central Asian meditations that are Buddhistic and
tantric in origin or at least in structure, reduction to the skeleton
condition has . . . an ascetic and metaphysical value anticipating the
work of time, reducing life by thought to what it really is, an ephemeral illusion in perpetual transformation." 5
So vivid were the fantasies of the death-world that some Oriental
sages prayed for sufficient conscious sense to realize that they were
nothing more than inventions of the mind: "May I recognize whatever
visions appear, as the reflections of my own consciousness. May I
know them to be of the nature of apparitions in the intermediate State.
May I not fear the troops of my own thought forms, the Peaceful Deities and the Wrathful May it come that all the Sounds will be
known as one's own sounds; may it come that all the Radiances will . 1
be known as one's own radiances." 6 Tantric Buddhism proposed that the death world or Intermediate
State could be controlled if one were prepared through carefully
guided fantasy in life to retain memory, consciousness, and the goal of choosing for one's self the right "womb-door" for a better reincarna
tion. 7 Living and dying were only complementary aspects of the same cycle, both requiring proper education. "Material life moves between
two poles," Bachofen says. "Its realm is not that of being but that of
214



becoming and passing away, the eternal alternation of two colors, the Lvhite of life and the black of death. Only through the equal mixture of
!he two is the survival of the material world assured. Without death
ho rejuvenation is possible ... the positive power cannot for one mohtient exist without the negative power. Death, then, is not the
bpposite but the helper of life." 8
The Great Goddess was intimately involved in every manifestation pf death as she was in those of life, which is why she had an
['emanation" for each fatal disease, such as Mari-Amma, Ankamma,
Mutteyalamma, etc. Her priestesses supported and taught the dying. 'As among the gods, so among the mortals was death everywhere
voman's business. A woman is said to have invented the wailing for
he dead. . . . Women cradle the infant and the corpse, each to its
^articular new life." 9
Romans thought death should be kept in mind at all times,
specially when life at its peak might make one forget the other,
qually necessary part of the cycle. When a military hero entered Rome
n triumphal procession, riding in a golden chariot, hailed as a god in
he ancient equivalent of a ticker-tape parade, a person wearing the nask and costume of Death stood at his shoulder, preserving him
rom the sin of hubris by saying each moment in his ear, "Man,
emember you will die." 10
Paganism fostered the Tantric idea of growth and decline in
ecurrent cycles. "The old fertility gods did not shrink from the fact
>f death; they sought no infantile evasion, but promised rebirth and
enewal." u Christianity on the other hand denied that members of
ts sect could die. Early Christians who died were said to have "fallen
sleep," soon to wake up again with the second coming of Christ. A
norbid anxiety often accompanied ritual denial. Kermode says, "Chris
ianity of all the great religions is the most anxious, is the one which
aid the most emphasis on the terror of death." 12
Sometimes fear became obsession, in a love-hate relationship with
eath. In the Secret Book ofJames, Jesus recommended suicide,
marking that the kingdom of death could only belong to those who
>ut themselves to death, and no one who avoided this duty could be
aved. 13
Obsession flowered into a thousand elaborate death customs and
ituals aimed at encapsulating the phenomenon, separating it from
rdinary life experience so its inevitability need not be fully understood, n Frazer's opinion such customs and rituals have been the most
wasteful ever seen in any society:
No beliefhas done so much to retard the economic and thereby the social
progress ofmankind as has the beliefin the immortality ofthe soul; for
this beliefhas led race after race, generation after generation, to sacrifice the real wants ofthe living to the imaginary wants ofthe dead. The waste and destruction oflife and property which this faith has entailed are
enormous and incalculable. ' 4

apostle James.

Death Pagan philosophers' acceptance of death may have been more practical than the elaborate denials that arose later. With a somber but
^________ _ courageous serenity, Euripides stated the pagan idea that opinions on death are not possible:
But ifany far-offstate there be
Dearer to life than mortality The hand ofthe Dark hath hold thereof, And mist is under the mist above; So we are sick for life, and cling On earth to this nameless and shining thing, For other life is a fountain sealed,
And the deeps below are unrevealed, And we drift on legends for ever. IS
Because they were westerners, the Greek philosophers have been given more credit for originality than they deserved. Actually, their
opinions of death and its implications for the living were largely taken from Oriental sages who evolved them first. Greek notions of the
Dreamless Sleep, of reincarnation, of the four ages of man including the primordial Age of Giants, all were derived from Oriental sources.
Tantric sages spoke of the faraway Golden Age when all men were
giants and lived lifetimes of about a thousand years each, because they
were nearer in time to the world's creation, when the Goddess's
nourishing birth blood was more abundant and the knowledge of her
was more intimate among her children. As the Bible said, there were
giants in the earth in those days (Genesis 6:4). 16 The same long-lived giants were identified with their own ances
tors by the authors of Genesis. The Hindu concept of human
longevity in the Golden Age was copied into the Bible as a quality of the
early patriarchs not quite a thousand years apiece, but at least more than nine centuries. Adam lived to be 930 years old; Seth 912 years;
Enos 905 years; and so on, the champion being Methusaleh at 969
years (Genesis 5). However long delayed, though, death must come, and that was the
thought that patriarchal thinkers found unacceptable. The older matriarchal religions were more realistic in their acceptance of death,
making it the sage's duty to realize the ugliness, corruption, and decay in nature as fully as he might realize its beauty: to accord death
the same value as birth. The two were of equal importance, as two
passages through the same Door: one coming out, the other going in. Different forms of the Goddess represented the idea. On the one
hand she was the beautiful nubile Virgin or the tender nurturing
Mother; on the other hand she was a hideous ghoul, herself corpselike and a devourer of corpses and these two forms of her were to be
adored equally. Avalon justly remarked that in the west, "the terrible
beauty of such forms is not understood"; missionaries could only
describe the Death-goddess as a she-devil. 17 Yet, for the enlightened,
216



"This fanged and bloody Goddess is the same as the other, the beautiful Deborah ) mother and lover. To be able to superimpose and adore both images Delilah ! in one is perhaps the solidest beginning on the road of sadhana." 18 ^^^^^^^^^^^
Some individuals in western culture arrived more or less indepen
jdently at the vision of this archetypal female death spirit. Wherever
there was a concept of Mother Nature, it could hardly fail to be noticed
that it was natural to die, and the roots of every flower lay in organic
rot. Coleridge spoke of the "Night-mare LIFE-IN-DEATH" as a (woman. Keats described himself as "half in love with easeful Death."
iLike the Oriental sages, Alfred de Vigny perceived Death as a maternal
[Goddess: "O Death divine, at whose recall / Returneth all / To fade
in thy embrace, / Gather thy children to thy bosom starred, / Free us from time, from number, and from space, / And give us back the rest that life hath marred." 19

Deborah
Queen Bee," a ruler of Israel in the matriarchal period, bearing the
same name as the Goddess incarnate in early Mycenaean and Anatolian ulers as "the Pure Mother Bee." ! Deborah lived under a sacred
Dalm tree that also bore her name, and was identified with the maternal
Tree of Life, like Xikum, the Tree of Ishtar. The Bible called her a
'prophetess" or "judge" to disguise the fact that she was one of the
governing matriarchs of a former age (Judges 4:4). One of Deborah's alternate names was Jael, "the Goddess Jah,"
wssibly the same one patriarchal Persians called Jahi the Whore, an arlier feminine form of Yahweh. 2

Delilah
'She Who Makes Weak," a name compounded of De (daleth), the
'onic Door, and lilu, the lotus, another yonic symbol. She was the Goddess who "weakened" the sun god every day and sent him to his leath on the wheel that turned him under the earth. In the case of >amson who was the sun god Shams-On, or Shamash it was the nill wheel. In the case of Heracles, another name for the same solar
leity, it was Omphale's wheel: the omphalos often represented by the
osmic yoni.

Delphi Delphi
Demeter "Womb"; Greece's oldest, most famous oracle, where Mother Earth
was worshipped under the name of Delphyne, the Womb of Creation, along with her serpent-son and consort Python. 1 At various times the
oracle was said to belong to the Sea-goddess, or the Moon-goddess, various designations of the same primal Mother, whose priestess
daughters, the Pythonesses, controlled the rites. Eventually the
patriarchal god Apollo took it over, retaining the Pythonesses, but claiming to have placed the Serpent in his underground uterine cave, whence came the oracle's inspiration. Apollo murdered the priestess
Delphyne, and held the oracle until it was closed by the Christian
emperor Theodosius. After him, Arcadius had the temple entirely
destroyed.
1. Graves, CM. 1,80.
Demeter
Greek meter is "mother." De is the delta, or triangle, a female
genital sign known as "the letter of the vulva" in the Greek sacred
alphabet, as in India it was the Yoni Yantra, or yantra of the vulva. 1
Corresponding letters Sanskrit dwr, Celtic duir, Hebrew daleth
meant the Door of birth, death, or the sexual paradise. 2 Thus, Demeter was what Asia called "the Doorway of the Mysterious Femi
nine ... the root from which Heaven and Earth sprang." ? In
Mycenae, one of Demeter's earliest cult centers, tholos tombs with their
triangular doorways, short vaginal passages and round domes, represented the womb of the Goddess from which rebirth might come. Doorways generally were sacred to women. In Sumeria they were
painted red, representing the female "blood of life." 4 In Egypt, door
ways were smeared with real blood for religious ceremonies, a custom
copied by the Jews for their Passover rites.
The triangle-door-yoni symbolized Demeter's trinity. Like all the oldest forms of the basic Asiatic Goddess she appeared as Virgin,
Mother, and Crone, or Creator, Preserver, Destroyer, like Kali-Cunti who was the same yoni-mother. Demeter's Virgin form was Kore,
the Maiden, sometimes called her "daughter," as in the classical myth of the abduction of Kore, which divided the two aspects of the Goddess into two separate individuals. Demeter's Mother form had
many names and titles, such as Despoena, "the Mistress"; Daeira, "the Goddess"; the Barley-Mother; the Wise One of Earth and Sea; or Pluto, "Abundance." This last name was transferred to the male underworld god said to have taken the Maiden into the earth-womb
during the dark season when fields lay fallow. But this was a late,
artificial myth. The original Pluto was female, and her "riches" were poured out on the world from her breasts. 5
The Crone phase of Demeter, Persephone-the-Destroyer, was
218



identified with the Virgin in late myth, so the Maiden abducted into the underworld was sometimes Kore, sometimes Persephone. Some of
the Destroyer's other, earlier names were Melaina, the Black One; Demeter Chthonia, the Subterranean One; or The Avenger (Erinys). Her black-robed, mare-headed idol, her mane entwined with Gorgon
snakes, appeared in one of her oldest cave-shrines, Mavrospelya, the Black Cave, in Phigalia (southwest Arcadia). She carried a dolphin
I and a dove, symbols of womb and yoni. Like the devouring death
goddess everywhere, she was once a cannibal. She ate the flesh of Pelops, then restored him to life in her cauldron. 6 She was as fearsome
as every other version of the Crone. The legendary medieval Night
Mare an equine Fury who tormented sinners in their sleep was based on ancient images of Mare-headed Demeter.
Her cult was already well established at Mycenae in the 1 3th
century B.C. and continued throughout Greece well into the Chris
tian era, a length of time almost equal to the lifespan of Christianity
itself. 7 Her temple at Eleusis, one of the greatest shrines in Greece,
became the center of an elaborate mystery-religion. Sophocles wrote, "Thrice happy they of men who looked upon these rites ere they go
to Hades's house; for they alone there have true life." Aristides said,
"The benefit of the festival is not merely the cheerfulness of the
moment and the freedom and respite from all previous troubles, but also
the possession of happier hopes concerning the end, hopes that our life hereafter will be the better, and that we shall not lie in darkness and
filth the fate that is believed to await the uninitiated." Isocrates said:
"Demeter . . . being graciously minded towards our forefathers because
of their services to her, services of which none but the initiated may
hear, gave us the greatest of all gifts, first, those fruits of the earth which
saved us from living the life of beasts, and secondly, that rite which
makes happier the hopes of those that participate therein concerning both the end of life and their whole existence." 8
Eleusis meant "advent." Its principal rites brought about the
advent of the Divine Child or Savior, variously named Brimus,
Dionysus, Triptolemus, Iasion, or Eleuthereos, the Liberator. Like the corn, he was born of Demeter-the-earth and laid in a manger or
winnowing basket.9 His flesh was eaten by communicants in the form of
bread, made from the first or last sheaves. His blood was drunk in the
form of wine. Like Jesus, he entered the Earth and rose again.
Communicants were supposed to partake of his immortality, and after death they were known as Demetreioi, blessed ones belonging to Demeter. 10
Revelations were imparted to the initiate through secret "things
heard, things tasted, and things seen." " This formula immediately
calls to mind the three admonitory monkeys covering ears, mouth, and
eyes, supposed to illustrate the maxim, "Hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil." Was the "evil" a secret descended from Eleusinian religion? Demeter was worshipped as "the Goddess" by Greek
Demeter
219



Demetra, Saint peasants all the way through the Middle Ages, even up to the 19th century at Eleusis where she was entitled "Mistress of Earth and ^^^^^^^^^^^ Sea." In 1801 two Englishmen named Clarke and Cripps caused a riot
among the peasants by taking the Goddess's image away to a museum in Cambridge. 12 Early Christians were much opposed to the Eleusinian rites
because of their overt sexuality, even though their goal was "regener
ation and forgiveness of sins." 13 Asterius said, "Is not Eleusis the scene
of descent into the darkness, and of the solemn acts of intercourse
between the hierophant and the priestess, alone together? Are not the torches extinguished, and does not the large, the numberless assem
bly of common people believe that their salvation lies in that which is
being done by the two in the darkness?" H Fanatic monks destroyed
the temple of these sexual mysteries in 396 a.d., but the site remained
holy to the Goddess's votaries, and the ceremonies were carried on
there and elsewhere. 15 Rustics never ceased believing that Demeter's spirit was manifest
in the final sheaf of the harvest, often called the Demeter, the Corn
Mother, the Old Woman, etc. At harvest festivals it was often dressed in
woman's clothing and laid in a manger to make the cattle thrive. 16
Secret anti-Christian doctrines of medieval Freemasonry also drew some symbolism from the cults of the ancient Mistress of Earth and
Sea, particularly the masonic sacred image of Plenty: "an ear of corn
near a fall of water." 17 The ultimate Mystery was revealed at Eleusis
in "an ear of corn reaped in silence" a sacred fetish that the Jews
called shibboleth. 18

Demetra, Saint
As was the rule with other manifestations of the Great Goddess, there
was an attempt to Christianize Demeter by making a saint of her.
Though the church refused to canonize "St. Demetra" officially, yet
she remained a great favorite of the people, who told miracle-tales about
her and prayed to her as fervently as if she were a certified member of the canon.
The classic myth of Kore-Persephone and Demeter was retold as a
popular fairy tale centering on St. Demetra. The saint's daughter (Kore) was kidnapped by "a wicked Turkish wizard" (Hades) and
locked up in a tower. A young hero rescued her, but perished
miserably, chopped in pieces by the wizard and hung from the tower's walls "between heaven and earth." Guided by a stork (her ancient
totemic bird of birth), St. Demetra arrived on the scene, reassembled
220



the hero, and brought him back to life. Several elements of this story Demon
were repeated in the Germanic fairy tale of Rapunzel.
A masculinized version of Demeter or perhaps one of her
Demetreioi was accepted into the canon as a "St. Demetrius," of
no known date, and no real biography. His legend, established in the late Middle Ages, made him a warrior saint like the equally mythical
St. George. The basic story was invented to publicize his healing relics preserved at Salonika. 2

Demon
From Greek daimon, a personal familiar spirit or guardian angel, like the Roman genius, roughly synonymous with "soul." The daimon of a
hero could undergo apotheosis, become a god, and rise to heaven to
dwell among the stars.
The medieval concept of the demon evolved from Christians' blanket condemnation of all pagan daimones, though they continued
to believe implicitly in their existence. 1 Demons were usually consid
ered messengers and assistants of a single Devil, in the same
relationship to him as angels to God. Yet they were also called "devils" and their master could be "the Demon." The terms were never
clearly distinguished. Animals and people could be "demons," or could harbor demons
within their bodies or minds. Sometimes, any alien group of people
could be called demons. Europeans often visualized demons as black,
like Negroes. 2 On the other hand, dark-skinned people like the Singhalese maintained that demons were white and hairy.*
According to St. Thomas Aquinas, all bad weather and natural
catastrophes were brought about by demons. He said, "It is a dogma of faith that demons can produce wind, storms, and rain of fire from
heaven." Pope Eugene IV issued a bull against human "agents of Satan" who controlled weather-demons. Pope John XXII complained
of wizards who tried to kill him through the agency of demons they
sent into mirrors and rings. 4
The church had several mutually contradictory theories about the
origin of demons. One theory said they were the rebellious angels
who fell with Lucifer, before the creation of Adam and Eve, so the
principle of evil was ready in the garden of Eden to play the tempter's
role. A second, incompatible theory said demons were created after
human beings. They were begotten by the angels on the daughters of
men (Genesis 6:4). "The majority opinion about the fall of the angels,
held by St. Augustine and therefore accepted in the Middle Ages, was that it had occurred before the creation of Adam, but some of the
old notion that the angels had fallen through lust for the daughters of
men persisted to reinforce antifeminine prejudices." 5

Demon Some authorities, familiar with the pagans' animal masks and animal-headed idols, said demons were an animal-like race created
^^^^^^^^^^^ separately by God, ahd readily incarnate in animal form. Black goats,
bulls, cats, or dogs could be demons. The Gaelic uile-bheist (Yule
beast, moon-calf) was called a demonic animal. St. Ambrose told of a
certain priest who exorcised the frogs in a certain marsh to stop them
from croaking during mass. A thirteenth-century bishop of Lausanne exorcised all the eels in Lake Leman. 6 St. Augustine confidently
asserted that demons help sorcerers to perform their magic, and have
the power to assume many animal shapes. 7 At Basel in 1474, a rooster committed the unnatural crime of
laying an egg. It was decided that the bird possessed a demon, but exorcism failed to remove it. So the unfortunate rooster was solemnly sentenced to death by church authorities, and burned at the stake. 8
Greeks still believe in the half-horse demons, kallikantzari, de
scended from ancient centaurs and the shape-shifting horse-wizards
of India, the kinnaras, "canterers" who used to live on the holy moilntain of Mandara. 9 Their descendants perhaps founded the city
of Kallipolis (Gallipoli). Their chief is still called the Lame Devil,
recalling lame Amazonian smith-gods like Hephaestus. Until recently it was thought any child born on Christmas Day would become a
kalhkantzaros. w A cruel custom arose from this belief. Children born
on Christmas Day were carried to the market square, where their feet
were thrust into a fire until the toenails were singed. 11 The magical
purpose of this may have been to destroy the horse-demons' "hoofs."
Records of witch trials show that almost any kind of animal could be perceived as a demon. Witches were executed because a neigh
bor's child was frightened by "the devil in the shape of a dog"; or because a man saw "a Thing like unto a rat" run out of a woman's
house; or because a woman kept "two devils in the form of colts"; or be
cause a neighbor saw "the devil in the form of a toad" in a woman's
garden; or because a traveler saw "a Thing like a black cow" near the
house of the accused; or because children heard a woman "talk to the devil in the form of a frog." One woman was condemned because
neighbors heard near her house at night a "foul yelling, like a number
of cats." No one seems to have suggested that the yelling was in fact done by cats, not demons. Ursula Kemp was hanged in 1 581 on the evidence of her own 8
year-old son, who testified that she kept four demons: two cats, a toad, and a black lamb. 12 Not once in the recorded trials did authorities
question witnesses' ability to distinguish these demons from ordinary animals. It was taken for granted that anyone, even a small child, could
recognize His Satanic Majesty no matter how cleverly he disguised himself as an apparently normal beast.
Several popes were believed to have familiar demons of their own,
particularly the famous Honorius, long remembered as a magician. During the controversy between Pope Boniface VIII and Philip IV of
222



France, the king held an assembly that formally deposed the pope Demon and presented evidence to prove that he was a sorcerer with a familiar
spirit.
13 ^^_ ^_^____
Sometimes, in the description of demons, imagination failed and had to fall back on popular make-believe. One poor wretch named
Margot de la Barre was burned at Paris in 1 391 for calling up a demon
"in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit." Pressed
to describe the demon under the stimulus of torture she could think
of nothing better to say than that he had "the shape that demons take
in Passion plays." 14
It was often assumed that demons congregated especially in and
around churches, for some inexplicable reason. Churches had to be
exorcised at their dedication. Crosses were painted on the walls "to terrify the demons." 1S
Houses were similarly protected by many crosses and crucifixes
but, nevertheless, harbored many demons, a belief that betrayed little trust in the alleged powers of the crucifix. The custom of ringing church
bells at the time of a death was supposed to drive away demons "who
stood at the bed's foot, and about the house, ready to seize their prey, or
at least to molest and terrify the soul in its passage, but by the ringing
of that bell (for Durandus informs us evil spirits are much afraid of
bells), they were kept aloof: and the soul, like a hunted hare, gained
the start." Tolling the church's largest bell commanded a higher price,
"for that, being louder, the evil spirits must go farther off, to be clear
of its sound, by which the poor Soul got so much more the start of them." 16
Before the witchcraft mania set in about the 12th and 1 3th
centuries, there was a general understanding that demons were nothing more than the old gods and goddesses, all of whom had animal
incarnations of some kind. Christian fathers insisted that the pagan
deities were not figments of imagination, but real, living demons. Learned men even in the 19th century still believed this. Rawlinson,
the translator of Herodotus, was sure the oracle at Delphi was an evil
spirit.
17 An early medieval baptismal formula demanded renunciation
of "relations with the demon," defining the old religion as "works of the
demon, and all his words, and Thor, and Odin, and Saxnot, and all evil beings that are like them." 18 Such formalities were largely ignored.
Centuries later, holiday dancers included personifications of the Horned God and the Scandinavian Julebuk (Yule Buck), which churchmen denounced as "the devil himself." 19 Monastic writers of the
1 1th century spoke of many demons who constantly tempted people
away from the church, showing them "delights and secrets, such as how they might become immortal." 20 It was clear that they spoke of a
rival religion. A Spanish Dominican, Raymond of Tarrega, said demons were useful for punishing sinners in hell; like angels, demons performed God's will. It was permissible to adore demons "so long as we adore, not
223



Denis, Saint their evil, but their existence, which was given them by God. It is not
Devi desirable to sacrifice to demons, but to do so is no more serious than
^^^^^^^^^^^ adoring an image of Christ or of the saints." 21 Later this opinion was
rejected, and the Inquisition burned Raymond's book.

Denis, Saint
Christianized form of the god Dionysus in Paris. Like Orphic shrines of Dionysus, the shrine of St. Denis featured an oracular head. It was
claimed that, having been beheaded at Montmartre (Martyr's
Mount), Denis then carried his own head to his abbey. 1 Some churchmen said Denis-Dionysus died in 250 a.d.; others assigned him to the 1st century; still others confused him with the
equally mythical Dionysius the Areopagite. His two "companions in martyrdom" Rusticus and Eleutherius were only alternate epithets of
the god Dionysus. 2

Derceto
"Whale of Der," a title of the Babylonian Fish-goddess, said to be the mother of Babylon's foundress, Queen Semiramis (Sammuramat). 1 Derceto was the prototype of Jonah's whale, being the Great Fish who swallowed and gave rebirth to the solar god Oannes, or Joannes
(Jonah). See Fish.

Devi
"Goddess," the Sanskrit root word for many Indo-European names for the Great Mother. The teachings of Krishna or Shiva were ad
dressed to the Devi as interrogator of the catechism; she was also
addressed as Dearly Beloved, the Shakti, a convention copied by the New Testament. Krishna's virgin mother was her "maiden" form,
Devaki. The Goddess's title as "the Way leading to the Gods" was Devayani, the Divine Yoni. As the virgin mother of Mahavira she was Devananda, "Blessed Goddess." ' A Czech name for the Moon
goddess, Devana, came from the same root, as also the Latin Diana,

Devil
Devil
The words "devil" and "divinity" grew from the same root, Indo
European devi (Goddess) or deva (God), which became daeva (devil) in Persian. 1 Old English divell (devil) can be traced to the Roman
derivative divus, divi: gods. 2 Thus it seems that, from the beginning, gods and devils were often confused with one another.
Divine and devilish were relative terms, as the primary sense of
Hebrew words for "good" and "evil" really meant "beneficial" and
"hurtful." 3 Gods did "evil" things if angered; devils could do "good"
things if they were pleased. One man's god was his enemy's devil. Armenians used to sacrifice one sheep to Christ at Easter time and thirty
sheep to the devil, on the theory that the devil's influence in the here and now was greater. 4 Such thinking was not unusual. Devils were often credited with
beneficent magic. There was a devil who "maketh men witty, turneth
all metals into the coin of the dominion, turneth water into wine, and
wine into water, and blood into wine, and wine into blood, and a fool into a wise man and he leads 33 legions of demons." Another
devil "perfectly teaches the virtues of the stars, he transformeth men,
he giveth dignities, prelacies, and confirmations." Another devil "talketh
of divine virtue, he giveth true answers of things present, past, and to come, and of the divinity, and of the creation, he deceiveth none, nor
suffereth any to be tempted; he giveth dignities and prelacies." 5 Even early Christians admitted that the "devils" worshipped in
pagan temples were known to restore the sick to health. 6 Tertullian
said, Diabolus simia Dei, the Devil imitates God; but in point of chronology there was some doubt about who was imitating whom. 7
Judeo-Christian tradition attributed many "diabolic" acts to God.
He was the sender of pestilence and famine. He created a terrible
hell, and its demons, who tortured human souls on his orders. He
caused violent storms, which were (and still are) called "acts of God."
From the 1 5 th century on, the church sold waxen cakes, the Agnus
Dei, stamped with a cross and advertised as sure protection against storms and other "acts of God"; thus God was incongruously invoked to
combat himself. 8
God even killed himself in the person of Christ, according to the pieological dogma that they were one and the same. On the other
Biand, some claimed Christ was killed by "devilish" Jews. Though Jews
(were carrying out God's ordained scheme of salvation, and doing

Devil God's will by executing Jesus, nevertheless theology exonerated God and blamed them. Though the Old Testament God did much "evil,"
^^^^^^^^^^ even destroying many thousands of his own helpless worshippers for
trivial offenses (1 Samuel 6:19), yet churchmen seldom dared to
accept the Bible's own presentation of God as the maker of evil: "I form
the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil; I the
Lord do all these things" (Isaiah 45:7). On the basis of this scripture, some advanced the theory that God had deliberately created the devil
before the beginning of the world, because a pre-existing evil principle was necessary to "test the faith" of the future human race.9 Yet
somehow, to make a devil was not evil if God did it.
The Persians believed God and the devil were twin brothers, born
simultaneously from the womb of the dualistic mother of Infinite
Time, Zurvan. The devil (Ahriman) was cast down from heaven to the
underworld only because his sacrifice, like Cain's, was not acceptable
to the older deity. The heavenly god (Ahura Mazda) continued to reign in the heights because he knew how to make the right sacrifices.
But the devil, not the god, was the true creator of the earth and all
creatures in the mundane world of matter. Thus the Magi prayed to
him for assistance in all worldly endeavors, and revered him as the
source of their magic powers. Ahriman was worshipped in Roman
times throughout northern Europe, identified with all chthonian gods
like Pluto, Saturn, or Dis Pater. 10 In early Christian mystery-plays he
appeared as a wonder-working spirit, one Saint Mahown. 11 The Christian devil became a composite of ancient deities in a single Protean form. He had the goat-horns and hoofs of satyr-gods
like Pan, Marsyas, and Dionysus; the trident of Neptune, Hades, or Shiva; the reptilian form of Leviathan, Python, or Ouroborus; the
fiery form of Agni or Helios; the female breasts of Astarte-Ishtar; the
wolf face of Dis, Feronius, or Fenrir; the quadruple wings of Babylonian cherubim; the bird claws of ancestral spirits, the aves; and all
the god-names Christians had ever heard, including many secret names of their own God: Jupiter, Mercury, Minerva, Venus, Hades,
Pluto, Baal-Zebub, Lucifer, Zeus Chthonios, Sabazius, Belial, Adonis, Sabaoth, Iao, Soter, Emmanuel, Sammael. 12 The devil could take any shape, even a human one: Pope Gregory IX described him as "a
pale, black-eyed youth with a melancholy aspect." 1? At other times he was an animal composite, as on the Amulet of Bes:
Naked genius with the head ofBes, flanked by seven heads ofanimals among whom are bull, lion, and ibis, and surmounted by atef crown
with several horns; four wings; falcon-tail and crocodile-tail; four arms two arms stretched out along the wings hold lances and serpents, while
the third on the left seizes a lion, the fourth on the right holds sceptre and I whip. The erect penis ends in a lionhead; there are lionmasks on the
knees, the feet are given the form ofjackal-heads with pointed ears and prolonged as coiled snakes. Bes stands on an ouroboros (cosmic
serpent) which contains various animals: scorpion, crocodile, tortoise. M I

The devil's popular nickname Old Scratch came from a Germanic Devil
wood-spirit called a Scrat or Waldscrat, sometimes a protector of households known as Schraetlin or "little Scrat." The spirit inhabited
a phallic amulet based on the bisexual lingam-yoni, as suggested by
Anglo-Saxon scritta, Old English scrat, a hermaphrodite. Another nickname of the devil, Deuce, came from Gaulish gods called Dusii, a
variation oldeus, "god." Again there was a hermaphroditic connotation, since "deuce" also meant "two." 15
Some demonologists postulated seven devils, one for each of the seven deadly sins: Lucifer (pride), Mammon (avarice), Asmodeus
(lechery), Satan (anger), Beelzebub (gluttony), Leviathan (envy) and
Belphegor (sloth). Belial, a slightly less prestigious spirit, governed such "vessels of iniquity" as playing cards and dice. 16
"Devils" and "the devil" were interchangeable. The devil was
one, and also many: a monotheistic transformation of a polytheistic
concept. Christian nations asserted that all other nations worshipped
"devils" or "the devil" under many names. A 16th-century list of
devil-worshipping countries included: Tartary, China, Lapland, Fin
land, the Northern Islands, the East Indies, Persia, Arabia, Anatolia,
Egypt, Ethiopia, Turkey, Russia, and Norway. 17 According to the 18thcentury German theologian Johann Beaumont, any person anywhere in the world who "confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh"
belongs to the devils. 18
As God incarnated himself in earthly flesh, so the devil was
supposed to incarnate himself in earthly flesh shortly before the
coming of doomsday. This demonic being was usually called Antichrist.
He would be known by his Christlike ability to perform healing
miracles, such as restoring sight to the blind. 19 It was never explained how these demonic miracles were to be distinguished from holy ones.
The coming of Antichrist was constantly announced, dozens of times in
j each century. Canon Moreau and contemporary churchmen reported that Antichrist was born in 1 599 at Babylon, where the Jews acclaimed him as their Messiah. 20 Apparently he was identified with
the Messianic Elijah for whom the Jews looked each year at Passover.
If there were any devilish attributes on which most myths agreed,
they were the rather godlike qualities of (1) superhuman intelligence, and (2) superhuman sexuality. Inquisitor Jean Bodin wrote, "It is
certain that the devils have a profound knowledge of all things. No
theologian can interpret the Holy Scriptures better than they can; no lawyer has more detailed knowledge of testaments, contracts and actions; no physician or philosopher can better understand the composition of the human body, and the virtues of the heavens, the stars,
birds and fishes, trees and herbs, metals and stones." Inquisitor Nicholas
Remy said the devil had complete knowledge of everything human beings could not explain. "Everything which is unknown lies ... in the cursed domain of demonology; for there are no unexplained facts. Whatever is not normal is due to the Devil." 21
227



Devil No Christian was permitted to disbelieve in the devil. His credibility
rested on the same foundation as that of God. Indeed, the very
^^^^^^^^^^^m concept of salvation depended on the devil. If there had been no
Tempter, there was no original sin, no fall, no hell, no need of a redeemer or a church. De Givry correctly said, "If the Satanic concept is tampered with, the whole edifice laboriously erected by the Fathers
of the Church crumbles to the ground." 22
The devil was essential to the dualistic theology that Christianity copied from Persia. If the world was divided between the forces of
good and evil, an evil deity was necessary, otherwise evil would have to be blamed on God. Logically, a god couldn't be both all-good and allpowerful. If God could make a world without evil, and would not, he
couldn't be all-good. If God wanted to make a world without evil,
and could not, he couldn't be all-powerful. The only solution not a
good one, but the only possible one was to supply God with an
evenly matched adversary, to be responsible for evil. Thus theologians
thought it the worst heresy, "contrary to the true faith," to suggest that devils existed only in the ignorant imagination. 23 The devil was so real to Martin Luther that he accosted him one evening and threw an
inkpot at him. 24
It was a severe theological problem to account for God's apparent
helplessness to halt the devil's activity. Though Lucifer or Satan was
supposed to have been utterly defeated and immobilized during the famous War in Heaven, yet he was so lively that the War seemed to have caused him nothing more than a momentary inconvenience.
Theologians could only propose that God "permitted" the devil's freedom of action. They said, "It is not the witch's ointment nor her
incantation that makes her forked stick fly through the air, but the
power of the devil, allowed by God." 25 They never explained why the church punished what God allowed.
Much semantic hairsplitting went into defining relationships between the devil, God, and humanity, such as the distinction between
sorcery and witchcraft. Sorcery was evoking spirits to "carry out those powers which God permitted the Devil." Witchcraft was evoking
spirits to "commit acts against His ruling." In practice, a man who asked the devil to help him seduce a woman was not guilty of any crime, because sex was under the devil's jurisdiction, by God's order. Devils
who killed children did nothing sinful, for God permitted them to kill
children "in order to punish their parents." 26 On the other hand, a woman who tried to save her dying child with witch-herbs was
mortally guilty and deserved the death penalty. 27 Theologians argued that all works of witches were brought about
by the devil with God's permission. Even a witch who did only good
works, like healing the sick, must suffer the same death as a witch whose
acts were harmful. 28 Thus witches were placed in a no-win situation.
Once a man beat a witch for casting a spell on his son, and forced her to remove the spell. Pope Benedict XIV ruled that the witch committed
228



a double sin by using the devil's power twice, even though she did it under coercion the second time. Benedict carefully stipulated that the man who beat her was entirely innocent of wrongdoing. 29 The church created the idea that witches were the devil's helpers,
involved in a vast plot to undermine Christian society. This theory was the real root of the witch mania. The people were generally
indifferent to the priests' witch-hunting until this theory was forced
on them by propaganda from the pulpit, which deliberately played on their fear of the devil after stimulating it in the first place. 50
It sometimes happened that churchmen themselves consulted the
devil, without paying the same penalties they inflicted on lay persons. Some miracle-working heretics were convicted by the bishop of Besancon in 1 1 70, on the evidence of none other than Satan, interviewed
by the bishop with the help of a priest skilled in necromancy. Satan assured the bishop that the accused were indeed his servants, so they
were sent to the stake. 31
The devil was useful to clergymen or anyone else seeking an excuse for lecherous behavior. According to one story:
The devil transformed himselfinto the appearance ofSt. Silvanus, Bishop
ofNazareth, a friend ofSt. Jerome. And this devil approached a noble woman by night in her bed and began first to provoke and entice her with lewd words, and then invited her to perform the sinful act. And when
she called out, the devil in the form of the saintly Bishop hid under the
woman 's bed, and being sought for and found there, he in lickerish language declared lyingly that he was Bishop Silvanus. On the morrow therefore, when the devil had disappeared, the holy man was scandalously defamed. 32
Some sly fellows used the devil to defraud. There was a
Cornishman who convinced his neighbors that he had sold his soul to
the devil. Taking a few coins to the tavern each night, he pretended
to receive money from the devil to pay for his drink. He would thrust his
hat up the chimney, calling on his diabolic friend; and the coins
appeared in his hat. The superstitious innkeeper wouldn't touch the devil's money, so the Cornishman drank all evening for free. 35
The devilish pact was not a joke, however; it was an essential
ingredient of the devil-mythology that killed millions during six centuries of witch-hunting. Yet it was logically absurd. If the devil
received the soul of every sinner, as the church taught, he had no
need to secure it with a "pact"; it would be his anyway. As for the
sinners themselves, they seemed to derive little benefit from their side
of the contract, as Scot pointed out: any woman in her right mind would
reject the devil's bargain, saying, "Why should I hearken to you, when you will deceive me? Did you not promise my neighbor Mother Dutton to save and rescue her; and yet lo she is hanged?" 34
Early in the Christian era there were no very severe punishments
for making a pact with the devil. The Golden Legend tells of a young man who signed over his soul to the devil to win the love of a certain
Devil
229



Devil lady. Later, St. Basil prayed over the young man and retrieved his
contract, a piece of paper which dropped from an upper balcony of the ^^^^^^^^^^_ church, "fluttered down through the air and fell into his hands, in the
sight of all." The paper was torn up and the youth set free. 55
Several popes were said to have made a diabolic pact, including
one who may have ideological roots in a genuine pagan tradition:
Silvester II. His real name was Gerbert de Aurillac. He grew up in a
France still permeated by Dianic and druidic fairy-religion, where
Aphrodite was worshipped at Rouen up to the 12th century, and the Moon-goddess's groves attracted pilgrims up to the 14th. Silvester chose a papal name meaning "spirit of the grove," and it was said he
had a fairy mistress named Meridiana (Mary-Diana), who taught him the secrets of magic. 36 According to Cardinal Benno and William of
Malmesbury, Silvester signed a pact with the devil to achieve the
papal throne, and the devil gave it to him. 37 The truth about Pope Silvester was that he had unusually intellec
tual tastes for his time. He remarked that, for the frustrations and
difficulties of his life, "philosophy was the only cure." 38 In his time,
"philosophy" didn't mean Christian theology. It meant pagan litera
ture, natural science, and Hermetism.
The list ofgreat wen in those centuries charged with magic . . . is
astounding; it includes every man ofreal mark, and in the midst of
them stands one ofthe most thoughtful popes, Silvester II (Gerbert), and the foremost ofmedieval thinkers on natural science, Albert the Great. It came to be the accepted idea that, as soon as a man conceived a wish to
study the works ofGod, his first step must be a league with the devil. 39
Another "devilish" philosopher was Heinrich Cornelius Agrip
pa von Nettesheim, historiographer to Emperor Charles V, author of
the famous treatise on Hermetism, De occulta philosophia. The church execrated his works and severely reprimanded him for trying to
defend accused witches, but his wealthy patrons protected him from
arrest: only once he was imprisoned for debt, not heresy. 40 He called
magic the perfect science, and implied as the Gnostic heretics did
that knowledge came to man not as a gift of God but as a gift of the
devil.
Agrippa's life story contributed to the legend of Faust, around
which centered many thrilling tales of the devil's pact. The real Faust was not impressive. As an obscure schoolmaster in Kreuznach, he was
dismissed from his post in 1 507 on a charge of sodomy.41 Six years
later he reappeared as an astrologer and soothsayer calling himself the Demigod of Heidelberg. Later, citizens of Munster knew him as "the
famous necromancer, Dr. Faustus." Ultimately, his fame rested not on
any of his doings but on the so-called Faustian books, Hb'llenzwange, "Harrowings of Hell," which he didn't write. These anonymous works
grew into a large body of literature professing to tell the reader how to
make a pact with the devil, work magic, find buried treasure, win love and fortune, and finally renounce the pact in time to save one's soul.
230



Predictably, such books were enormously popular. Two books really written by Agrippa von Nettesheim to win the favor of Margaret of
Austria, The Superiority of Women and The Nobility ofthe Female Sex, were declared heretical and forbidden publication by the clergy.42
Magic books nearly always gave formulae for negotiating with the devil. Le Dragon Rouge told the aspiring wizard to address "Emper
or Lucifer, master of all the rebellious spirits," and his ministers
Lucifuge Rofocale, Prince Beelzebub, and Count Ashtoreth.4B Magic Papyri that had been early models for these books often confused the
names and attributes of Jehovah and Lucifer, speaking of "God the
light-bringer (Lucifer), invincible, who knoweth what is in the heart of all life, who of the dust hath formed the race of men." 44 We have
seen the same kind of confusion in Christian theology itself. Yet in
14th-century Toulouse, witches were burned for saying what was actually a tenet of the church's dualism: that "God and the Devil were
completely equal, the former reigning over the sky and the latter the
earth; all souls which the Devil managed to seduce were lost to the
Most High God and lived perpetually on earth or in the air." 45
Even up to the 20th century, churchmen insisted on the devilish
pact. Father Thurston wrote: "In the face of Holy Scripture and the
teaching of the Fathers and theologians the abstract possibility of a pact with the Devil and of a diabolical interference in human affairs can
hardly be denied." 46 But the Fathers and theologians never explained
how the devil could profit from the pact, other than to receive a
"soul" that was his anyway. As Samuel Butler said, no one heard the
devil's side of any story, because God wrote all the books. 47
One might think an "enlightened" modern society would have given up the idea of the devil. But a poll taken in 1978 showed "two
out of five Americans believe in devils." 48 The strange viability of devils
may arise from their usefulness in assuaging the guilt of God and man. "Both Judaism and Christianity have maintained that God must
be given the credit for all the goodness in human history, and that
men must take the blame for all the evil." 49 Thus, the real purpose of
the devil was to take some of this heavy responsibility off frail human
shoulders. In short: the devil, not Christ, was the true scapegoat who assumed the burden of men's sins.

Diabokis Diabolus
Diamond Latin name of the devil, "Serpent of the Goddess." Legend said the Great Mother made her serpent consort from a bolus of clay, rolled between her hands until it stretched into a snake form. Then she
brought it to life. 1 Egyptians said Isis made a clay serpent in this way, and also a new clay phallus for Osiris. With this phallus that she made, she conceived Osiris's reincarnated persona, the infant Horus.
The same bolus gave rise to the papal "bull," through the
derivative bulla, a coiled clay seal on a document, usually stamped
with magical signs to discourage tampering. The bulla was also a protective amulet worn by a Roman child before coming of age. 2
1. Graves, CM. 1,27. 2.Gifford,71.
Diakosmos
"Goddess-Universe," a Pythagorean and Stoic term for the "order" imposed on the elements in Primal Chaos, to bring about the creation
of the world. Like the name of the abyssal Mother, Themis, Kosmos meant "correct order" and was used by Homer to mean an arrangement of woman's ornaments. 1 The philosophers' idea was that the
Goddess created manifest forms for her own adornment, giving rise to
all the material world, the beauty of which was her outer garment and
jewels. Her true spirit moved within and behind these things, unseen.
Through the life of the universe she constantly arranged and re
arranged the outward manifestations of her "order" to make infinite
numbers of different living forms. At doomsday she destroyed them all, to begin over with the next creation. See Tohu Bohu.
1. Lindsay, O.A., 75, 120.
Diamond
Literally, "World-Goddess." The ancients used to believe gem stones were solidified drops of the divine essence, embedded in rocks when the world was created. Diamonds were sacred to the Mother of
the gods because they "ruled" all other stones by their superior
hardness. In Tantric Tibet, the divine essence of the Earth-goddess Tara is still assumed to inhabit her human incarnation, the Diamond
Sow, traditional consort or feminine counterpart of the Dalai Lama.
Because diamonds were sacred to the supreme Goddess, they were taken over by the cult of the Virgin; and because of this association
with virginity they came to be considered appropriate betrothal gifts. In the transition from Tarot cards to modern playing cards, diamonds
replaced the ancient suit of pentacles, which were symbols of Mother Earth (Tara) and of the feminine earth element.

i
Diana
"Queen of Heaven," Roman name for the Triple Goddess as (1)
Lunar Virgin, (2) Mother of Creatures, and (3) the Huntress (Destroy
er). Her Greek name was Artemis. Her major pilgrimage centers were Ephesus and Nemi, the Sacred Grove. She was Dione, Diana Nemorensis, or Nemetona, Goddess of the Moon-grove. In her
sanctuaries, sacred kings periodically engaged in combat, the loser dying as the god Hippolytus, the winner invested as the Goddess's new
favorite, Virbius. See Hippolytus, Saint.
As Diana Egeria, patroness of childbirth, nursing, and healing, the Goddess made Nemi's holy spring the Lourdes of pagan Rome. 1 The
legendary King Numa was said to have derived all his wisdom from a
sacred marriage with her.
Diana's cult was so widespread in the pagan world that early Christians viewed her as their major rival, which is why she later became "Queen of Witches." The Gospels commanded total destruc
tion of all temples of Diana, the Great Goddess worshipped by "Asia
and all the world" (Acts 19:27).
Roman towns all over Europe habitually called the local mother goddess Diana, as later Christian towns were to call her Madonna. Fortunatus said Diana was the Goddess worshipped at Vernemeton,
"which in the Gaulish language means the Great Shrine." In the 5th
century a.d., the Gauls regarded her as their supreme deity. Christians
spoke slightingly of their pagan custom of adoring the spirit of Diana in a cut branch or a log of wood. 2 Gozbert, a 7th-century Frankish
chieftain, doubted the claims of a Christian missionary on the ground that the Christian God was "no better than our own Diana." 3
At Ephesus, the Goddess was called Mother of Animals, Lady of
Wild Creatures, and Many-Breasted Artemis, shown with her entire torso covered with breasts to nourish the world's creatures. 4 In the 4th
century a.d., the church took over this shrine and re-dedicated it to
the virgin Mary. 5 One of the earliest churches devoted to "Our Lady"
existed at Ephesus in 43 1 ; but most of the people believed the Lady
was Diana, not Mary. In 432 the Council of Ephesus tried to eliminate
worship of the pagan Goddess, but the bishops were besieged by crowds demanding, "Give us our Diana of the Ephesians!"6
An excuse for converting Diana's temples into Mary's churches
was provided by a made-to-order legend that Mary lived at Ephesus in her old age. Her tomb was located there, and some Christians even pointed out the house in which she had lived. 7 But sometimes she
was identified with the sinister Widow of Ephesus, a Crone aspect of
the Goddess showing some primitive features. Petronius's version of the myth said the Widow hung her husband's dead body on one of the three crosses in front of Diana's
temple, replacing the body of a previously crucified thief. Then she lay
with her new lover at the foot of the cross. 8 The parallel between this
image and that of the triple Mary at the foot of Jesus's cross was too

century poet, bishop of Poitiers, still venerated as a saint in France.

Diana close for comfort, especially since Diana herself was assimilated to the
Christian myth as Mary's mother, or elder self, the "Grandmother of ^^^^^^^^^^^ God" under the name of either Anna (Hannah) or Di-anna
(Dinah).9 Gnostic Christians called their Wisdom-goddess Sophia the same Grandmother of God, and frequently identified her with Diana of
Ephesus. When Diana's temple was finally pulled down, as the Gospels
ordered, its magnificent porphyry pillars were carried to Constantinople and built into the church of Holy Sophia. 10 The magic of Ephesus was remembered through the Middle Ages. A writer said in 1725: "It is recorded in divers authors that in the
image of Diana, which was worshipped at Ephesus, there were certain obscure words or sentences . . . written upon the feet, girdle and crown of the said Diana: the which, if a man did use, having written them out, and carrying them about him, he should have good luck in
all his businesses." 11 Some Christians even remembered that Diana was once the triple
deity who ruled the world. A 14th-century poem attributed to the
Bishop of Meaux said Diana was an old name for the Trinity. 12
Officers of the Inquisition however regarded Diana as the "Goddess of the heathen" with whom witches made their aerial night
journeys or thought they did. 13 The worship of Diana was denounced wherever it was found, even when the worshippers were members of
the clergy. In the 14th century, a bishop found the monks of Frithel
stock Priory worshipping a statue of "the unchaste Diana" at an altar
in the woods, and made them destroy it. 14 The notorious inquisitor
Torquemada declared bluntly that Diana is the devil. 15
Devil or not, Diana ruled the wild forests of Europe through the medieval period. As patron of the forest of Ardennes she was Dea
Arduenna; as patron of the Black Forest she was Dea Abnoba. 16 Serbians, Czechs, and Poles knew her as the woodland Moongoddess Diiwica, Devana, or Dziewona. 17 She remained the Goddess
of wild woodlands and hunting, all the way up to the 18th century in
England. Dianic rites were celebrated even in church, despite objections
from the clergy. A minister wrote against the traditional parade of a
stag's head into St. Paul's Cathedral in London: "bringing in procession
into the church the head of a deer, fixed on the top of a long spear or pole, with the whole company blowing Hunters Horns in a sort of
hideous manner; and with this rude pomp they go up to the High Altar, and offer it there. You would think them all the mad Votaries of
Diana." 18

Priestess-queen and foundress of Carthage, identified with Cyprian Aphrodite and the Goddess Tanit. As Dido-Anna she was the consort

sacred king and was going to sacrifice him, but he escaped and fled,
leaving her to perish in his place. He survived to become the founder of Rome. Another of Dido's names was Elissa, "the Goddess."

Alternative spelling of the Greek Fate-goddess Tyche, whom the Orphics called Eurydice, "Universal Dike." To her were dedicated the

Diogenes
Cynic philosopher who lived in an earthen pot at the door of the Great Mother's temple and constantly looked for one honest man. 1
Cynics were "dogs" or "watchdogs" of the Goddess, as their name

Sin
it.
This matched the Oriental concept of the Kali Yuga, last age of
I the world, when men become callous, violent, disorderly, and dishonorable. 2 When these conditions were completely fulfilled, doomsday was imminent.

whose existence still prevented the earth's destruction. See Dog.

Dionysius Dionysius the Areopagite
One of the most influential Christian writers of the Middle Ages,
^^^^^^^^ revered for his mystical insights, knowledge of heavenly matters, and holy life. His only fault was that he never existed.
Dionysius's works were forged about the 6th century a.d. and
palmed off as the work of one Dionysius the first bishop of Athens,
supposedly converted to Christianity by St. Paul personally, during the
latter's spirit-visit to Greece as a ghost, after having been "caught up to the third heaven." Paul told pseudo-Dionysius about heaven, and
pseudo-Dionysius wrote it down and preached it from the Athenian
Hill of Ares; hence his title, Areopagite. The medieval church based its organization of three sacraments, three holy orders, and three lower orders on the spurious revelations
of Dionysius, in imitation of the heavenly hierarchy he described, consisting of (1) Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones; (2) Dominions,
Virtues, and Powers; (3) Principalities, Archangels, and Angels. The spirits of heaven remained thus organized all the way up to the 18th
century. Churchmen reluctantly abandoned their belief in the authenticity
of Dionysius's writings when it was pointed out that, despite earlier
scholars' unquestioning acceptance, they failed the simplest of chrono
logical tests, constantly referring to events and institutions of much later date than the time of the alleged Dionysius. 1 At first the pious tried
to pretend these references were miraculous prophecies of the future,
but this defense proved untenable.
1. White 2, 315-16.
Dionysus
Identified with many other savior-gods, Dionysus was also called
Bacchus, Zagreus, Sabazius, Adonis, Antheus, Zalmoxis, Pentheus, Pan, Liber Pater, or "the Liberator." l His totem was a panther (Pan
thereos, the Beast of Pan). His emblem was the thyrsus, a phallic scepter tipped with a pine cone. His priestesses were the Maenads, or Bacchantes, who celebrated his orgies with drunkenness, nakedness, and sacramental feasting.
Dionysus is often presented as a rustic wine-god, inventor of viniculture. He was more than that. He was a prototype of Christ,
with a cult center at Jerusalem as well as nearly every other major city in
the middle east. Plutarch said the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was
celebrated in his honor: "I think that the festival of the Sabbath is not
wholly without relation to the festival of Dionysus." 2 He added that
the Jews abstain from pork because their god Dionysus-Adonis (Lord Dionysus) was slain by a boar. In the 1st century B.C. the Jews
themselves claimed to worship Dionysus under his Phrygian name of
Zeus Sabazius. 5
Tacitus said Dionysus Liber was the god of Jerusalem in a former
236



time, but a different god had replaced him, a god with less attractive Dionysus
characteristics: "Liber established a festive and cheerful worship, while
the Jewish religion is tasteless and mean."4 Dionysus and Jehovah
were literally two sides of the same coin in the 5th century B.C., when ^'"'^^^^^^^^
coins found near Gaza showed Dionysus on one side, and on the
other a bearded figure labeled JHWH Jehovah. 5
In Lebanon, Dionysus was incarnated in Ampelus, a "beautiful
youth" torn to pieces by a bull and reincarnated as a grapevine. In
Chios, the blood of men murdered by Dionysus's Maenads was used to fertilize the vines. At Orchomenus, the Triple Goddess appeared in
Dionysian rites as "three princesses" who tore apart a male child and ate
him (the earth absorbing sacrificial blood). In Thebes, a king named Pentheus dared to oppose the Dionysian cult, perhaps because he didn't
care to die like other Dionysian god-kings. But the women tore him
to pieces anyway, led by the king's own mother (or mother-goddess), who wrenched his head off.6 Later Theban rites of Dionysus cen
tered on killing and eating a fawn named Pentheus, and the Maenads
wore fawn skins. The god's Lydian totem was a fox, Bassareus, forerunner of the medieval Reynard. There the Maenads called them
selves Bassarids, and wore fox skins. 7
These darker legends show Dionysus's typical "savior" pattern: first and most primitive, a king killed and cannibalized to provide both
the earth and women's wombs with fructifying blood; then a surrogate for the king, a condemned criminal or a young man chosen by lot; then an animal substitute for the man; and finally, "flesh" and "blood"
devoured in the form of bread and wine, the classical Dionysian
sacrament at Eleusis.
In Palestine, Dionysus was identified with Noah, the first biblical
patriarch to get drunk (Genesis 9:21). His Greek title was Deucalion,
"New-wine sailor," the flood hero in pre-Hellenic myths. 8 Dionysus was also a form of Adam, offspring of Father Heaven and Mother
Earth (Zeus and Demeter), torn to pieces to make a sin offering of the "wine" of his blood.9 His later hero-incarnation Orpheus, star of the
popular Orphic Mysteries, was the same sacrificial god, torn to pieces by the Maenads. Proclus said, "Orpheus, because he was the principal in
the Dionysian rites, is said to have suffered the same fate as the god." 10
Orpheus was a third-generation savior, identified with his divine [father Dionysus as Dionysus was identified with his divine father
Zeus. Seated on the Heavenly Father's throne, brandishing his light
ning-scepter, Dionysus was hailed as King of Kings and God of
Gods. 11 He was also the god-begotten, virgin-born Anointed One UChristos) whose mother seems to have been all three forms of the
Triple Goddess: the earth mother, Persephone the underworld queen, Semele the moon-maiden. Hints of a hanging or crucifixion ceremo
ny appeared in his sacrificial title Dendrites, "Young Man of the
[Tree."
12 He was also a Horned God, with such forms as bull, goat,
and stag. According to the classic story of his dismemberment, the god took

Dionysus

geographer of the 2nd century a.d. Living in a time of declining culture, he was inspired by a desire to describe the ancient sacred sites for
posterity.
such animal forms in rapid succession to avoid the onslaught of the
Titans (pre-Hellenic earth-deities), who eventually caught him, tore him to pieces, and devoured him. They trapped his soul in a mirror
while he was admiring his reflection, which equates Dionysus with the
spring-flower god Narcissus, another of his many disguises. According to Pausanias, it was Onomakritos who made the Titans into
"authors of Dionysus's sufferings," but the orgia had not included
this detail of old. Probably one of the god's oldest forms was Dionysus
Melanaigis, "Dionysus of the Black Goatskin," a scapegoat-satyr like Marsyas. 13 His traditional costume contributed much to the medieval
Christian notion of the devil's habit of appearing in the form of a
black goat.
At Eleusis, the place of his "Advent," Dionysus appeared as a newborn Holy Child laid in a winnowing-basket, liknon, from which he was called Dionysus Liknites. This sacred object, his cradle, was
carried in his processions by a special functionary called a liknophoros, cradle-bearer. 14 The liknon was the original form of the
"manger" in which the infant Jesus was laid. All grain-gods, whose flesh was eaten in the form of bread, appeared as newborn babes in a
vessel intended for seed corn.
A long-remembered incarnation of the god was King Dionysus of Syracuse, who altered the custom of king-sacrifice in the 4th century B.C. When the time of his immolation approached, King Dionysus substituted for himself a courtier who was called Damocles, meaning
either "Conquering Glory" or "Glory of Blood." Damocles was said to have volunteered to take the king's place because he envied the
privileges of kingship. He enjoyed these privileges for a short while, but soon discovered a sword suspended above his head by a single hair:
symbol of the fate of kings, in a time when they and the gods they
embodied were periodically fated to die. 15 See Kingship.

Dioscuri
Greek version of the Heavenly Twins, gods of the morning and evening star, born together out of the World Egg of Leda. Each wore his half of the egg shell as a cap or crown. The twins were named
Castor and Polydeuces, the latter meaning "abundant wine," perhaps a reference to the flowing blood of the solar Savior whom the twins
ushered in and out of the underworld in rites linked with fertility.
1 The
name of Castor has been associated with the rite of castrating the god,
in classical paganism defined as "the act of offering the phallus to the Love Goddess." 2
238



The Love Goddess was called Venus in Rome, and her planet is Diotima
the same one that appears as both morning and evening "star." Djsjr Perhaps this was why Christians associated Pollux, the Roman form of
Polydeuces, with "pollution." Like Shaher and Shalem in the land of Canaan, the Heavenly Twins announced the daily birth of the sun with the words "He is risen," and sent him into the underworld at his daily death with the word "Peace" (Shalom, or Salaam). See Lucifer.
To Mithraic sun-worshippers the Dioscuri were symbolized by two golden stars, which still appear in the heavens as the Alpha and Beta stars of the constellation Gemini (the Twins). When the Dioscuri
were shown in anthropomorphic form in Mithraic shrines, they held
spears or torches, one upward, the other downward, signifying the rising and setting directions of the sun. Their pose was standard: one twin
had the right leg crossed over the left, the other had the left leg crossed
over the right.
3 The same "magic 4" leg position is seen on the Emperor card of the Tarot trumps. The Dioscuri were revered in
Sparta as horsemen, warriors, and war dancers.

underworld so they would accept the town's location as their home.
They were honored each year at the festival of Parentalia.

Dis Pater Dis Pater
^* "Father Dis," a Roman name of the Lord of Death inherited from
^^^^^^^^^^i Etruscan times. On occasion he wore the wolf head of the Etruscan god
of the dead. Like underground Pluto he was called "the rich one,"
because he knew everything about mines, deposits of gem stones, and buried treasure. 1 Gallic Celts worshipped Dis above every other male
deity, claiming he was the "father" of their race in the old way of the
dying god who became "father" by shedding his blood (see King
ship). In Britain, Dis was regarded as a universal deity very like Jehovah, whose later adherents, however, transformed Dis into an alternative
name for the devil. 2

Djinn
Arabic "spirits," or ancestral souls. Djinni was a genie, cognate of the
Roman genius, paternal ghost or begetter. Mohammedans viewed the djinn as pagan semi-demons because they were connected with the Old Religion. See Genius.
Dog
No one knows when man first domesticated the dog. Evidence
suggests that "man" didn't do it at all; woman did it. In myth, dogs
accompanied only the Goddess, guarding the gates of her after-world, helping her to receive the dead.
Like other carrion eaters e.g., vultures dogs, wolves, and jack
als were associated with funerary customs. Dogs carried the dead to
their Mother. In Iran, even after it became usual to bury the dead, it was
thought necessary to let dogs tear the corpse before burial, a survival of the older practice. 1 The Vendidad said the soul enroute to heaven would meet the Goddess with her dogs: "Then comes the beautiful,
well-shapen, strong and graceful maid, with the dogs at her sides, one who can discern, who has many children, happy and of high understanding. She makes the soul of the righteous go up above." 2 Semitic tradition transformed the Goddess into the Angel of
Death, whose approach can be seen only by dogs which is why dogs howl at the moon to announce a death. 3 Devonshire folklore still
says there is a dog in the moon who acts as a messenger of death. 4
The Irish say two dogs guard the gate of death, which used to lead to
Emania, the Moon-land; mourners were enjoined not to wail too
loudly, lest they disturb the dogs and cause them to attack the soul at the
gate. This and many other similar images can be traced to the ancient
Vedic concept of the moon as death's gate, ruled by the Goddess and
guarded by her two dogs. 5
240
'*ty



This Oriental symbol is still seen in an almost pure form on Tarot
trump #18, the card of the Moon. The conventional picture is of two
dogs howling at the full moon in front of a gate, or two pylons, with a road leading between them to a distant horizon. The scene was
usually interpreted as having to do with death.6 Sometimes the card was
called Hecate, after the classic death-goddess whose totemic companions were dogs. 7 Her gates were guarded by the three-headed hound
Cerberus, "Spirit of the Pit." 8 In Celtic myth the gatekeeper was a dog named Dormarth, "Death's Door." 9 The same dog might be seen
on the famous Gundestrup Cauldron, guarding the yonic gate through which heroes pass on their way to death and transfiguration. 10
According to the Vedic tradition, the Bitch-goddess Sarama was the mistress of the death dogs, and a divine huntress like Artemis,
Diana, Anath, and other western versions of the lunar maiden. 11
Ancient Babylon knew her as Gula, the Fate-goddess, whose symbol was a dog. 12 She was assimilated to Ishtar, whose sacred king Tammuz
was torn to pieces by "dogs." B Under his Greek names of Adonis or
Actaeon, he was torn to pieces by the Dogs of Artemis. As the savior
Orpheus, he was incarnated in Neanthus of Lesbos and torn to pieces
in the Orphic temple by "dogs.
" H When Athene assumed the guise of
the death-goddess, her priestesses filled her temple with canine "howlings" (houloi), like wolves or dogs singing to the moon. 15 Sometimes a whole pack of dogs or priestesses? hunted souls in the
realm of death, like the Celtic Hounds of Annwn, which Christians soon converted into the Hounds of Hell. 16 Originally this meant the hounds of the Goddess Hel, ruler of the
land of death. Norse myth said she gave birth to lunar wolf-dogs who
ate the flesh of the dead and carried souls to paradise. Their leader was
Managarm, "Moon-Dog." The Prose Edda says Managarm was "gorged with the flesh of the death-doomed; and with red blood he
reddens the dwelling of the gods." 17 In other words, he carried the
dead away in primitive, carrion-eating canine fashion. An alternative name for the Norse moon-dogs' mother was Angur
boda, the Hag of the Iron Wood: an older version of Hel, sometimes
called Hel's mother. 18 Two of Angurboda's canine children, Geri and
Freki, lived in Valhalla and ate the food offered on "Odin's table,"
meaning the altar. 19 This suggests that the Vedic image of the two death
dogs passed into Norse mythology as a pair of canine gods, like the
many holy dogs, wolves, or jackals of the ancient world in general. One of the oldest of these gods was Egyptian Anubis, brought from central Asia at a very early date under the name of Up-Uat,
"Opener of the Way." He was also known as Mates, "He of the
Mother," similar to the archaic Irish word for a dog, madra. 20 This
old Asian god was said to be a wolf, but he soon merged with the jackal
Anubis, who was called his twin. The composite was a deity "whose
face is like unto that of a greyhound . . . who feedeth on the dead . . . who devoureth the bodies of the dead, and swalloweth hearts." In the

D8 predynastic period he governed sacrificial priests, "jackal-headed men with slaughtering-knives," in an old section of the underworld. 21
mhmm^^^^^m Coptic Christians later identified Anubis with Cabriel, who was called a
judge of the dead. 22
As a lord of the land of death, Anubis became the god of
mummification. He was often shown bending solicitously over the mummy of Osiris, applying the preservative mumiya from which the
word "mummy" descended. When the Osiris cult became astrologi
cal, much of its imagery was transposed from the underworld to the
heavens, including the image of Anubis. The star of Anubis was Sothis (Sirius), the Eye of the Dog, in
Greek, Canopis. Sirius is the star forming the "eye" of Canis Major, the Great Dog. It is the brightest star in the sky. Egyptians believed it
held the soul of Osiris, whose rebirth coincided with the rising of the
Nile flood, when his star rose in the east. "Three wise men" pointed
the way to the newborn Savior: the three stars in Orion's belt, which
form a line pointing to Sirius. The holy city of Anubis on earth was
also Canopis, the Eye of the Dog, origin of the canopic mummy-jar. Anubis came to Rome as a leading character in the Osirian
Mysteries. He was seen in processions "condescending to walk on
human feet . . . rearing terrifically high his dog's head and neck that
messenger between heaven and hell displaying alternately a face black as night, and golden as the day; in his left the caduceus, in his right
waving aloft the green palm branch. His steps were closely followed
by a cow, raised into an upright posture the cow being the fruitful
emblem of the Universal Parent, the goddess herself, which one of
the happy train carried with majestic steps, supported on his shoulders.
By another was borne the coffin containing the sacred things, and
closely concealing the deep secrets of the holy religion." 23 Not only Anubis, but many other dog-deities were worshipped throughout the Roman empire. An early Roman cista from Palestrina-Praeneste showed the Moon-virgin Minerva sacrificing a naked Mars over a cauldron, attended by her three-headed death dog,
clearly the same as Persephone's or Hecate's Cerberus. 24 The dog as
the keeper of Mother's gate was known everywhere in antiquity, probably because wild dogs were first domesticated as guardians of the
home threshold, doorways being generally sacred to women who owned the houses. In Assyria, images of dogs were buried under
thresholds of houses, suggesting similar burials of deceased watchdogs
in former times. 25 The dogs' spirits continued to halt intruders, which may account for the ancient custom of lifting a new bride over a
threshold, so the guardian spirits beneath would not think her an
intruder but would accept her as a resident.
The Cynic sage Diogenes made himself a watchdog at the gate of the Great Mother's temple, where he lived in "a large earthen pot,"
representing the terrestrial womb. 26 Cynics were the Goddess's "doglike
ones" (kynikos). Their sect, founded in the 4th century B.C., professed
242



to foretell the end of the world from the circumpolar constellation Ursa Dog
Minor, which they called the Dog. The north pole star was the Dog's
Tail, kunos oura, the Cynosure. 27 When it moved from its place at the
still point of the turning world, according to the Cynics, the end of the present universe was at hand.
The Cynic idea of the dog affixed to the north pole is still found in
European folklore. Slavs spoke of the three Zorya (triple Fate
goddess), keeping "a dog which is tied by an iron chain to the constellation of the Little Bear. When the chain breaks it will be the
end of the world." 28 Egyptians similarly believed the Goddess kept
"powers of darkness" fettered by a heavenly chain until the last days of the world. 29 Northern peoples said the chain held the cosmic
doomsday-wolf Fenrir, who would be released by the Norns (triple
Fate-goddess) to devour the heavenly father at the end of the world; this would signal the destruction of all the gods. 30 Norsemen therefore
called doomsday the Day of the Wolf. 31
The Great Goddess was herself a wolf, in the very old Roman cult
of the She-Wolf Lupa, whose original consort was Lupus, the Wolf.
He was also Feronius, or Dis Pater, a subterranean wolf god inherited from the Etruscans, as was the She-Wolf who suckled Rome's
founders, Romulus and Remus. The famous Lupercalian statue of the She-Wolf was cast in bronze during the 5th century B.C. The two
babies under her belly were not part of the original work but were added centuries later, to suit the Roman version of the legend. 32
The Lupercalia may have been a corruption of Lupa-Kali; the Oriental Great Goddess was also a she-wolf. Under her yoni-name of
Cunti she gave birth to a divine son "in the cave of the wolf," like the
Lupercal grotto. Her child was placed in a basket of rushes and set
afloat on the Ganges, as Romulus and Remus were set afloat on the
Tiber, Moses was set afloat on the Nile, and Sargon was set afloat on
the Euphrates. The wolf bitch Lupa was identified with the midwifegoddess Acca Larentia who took Romulus and Remus from their
basket, just as Akka took Sargon, and "pharaoh's daughter" (another version of Akka) took Moses. Akka, Acca, or Acco was the same as
Hecate, who turned into a wolf bitch in Homeric legend. 33 Lupa (or
Acca) disappeared into the sacred spring of the Lupercal grotto,
where her spirit was worshipped every year at the Lupercalian festival. There were many lupine foster-mothers in Middle-Eastern myths.
Tu Kueh, legendary founder of the Turkish nation, was preserved in infancy by a holy she-wolf whom he subsequently married: that is, she was the Goddess of the land in totemic form. 34 A famous Turkish
leader was Ataturk, "the Gray Wolf." 35 Zoroaster was raised by a she
wolf. Cyrus the Great, born of Mandane (Moon-mother), was nursed by a woman whose Greek name was Cyno, her Median name
Spako, meaning "Bitch." Siegfried too was a wolf's foster child; his
oldest name was Wolfdietrich. 36
The oldest religion of the Canary Islands was a dog- or wolf-cult,
243



Dog traces of which are still seen in many ancient canine statues. Canary
birds and canary wine took their name from the islands, which were
^^mmmmmm^^^^am really named for Canis, the dog. 37
The same name once applied to the hereditary caste of Jewish priests, Kohen or Cohen, from Greek kuon, "dog." 58 Because dogs were associated with the old matriarchy, the epithet "dog" became an
insult to Semitic patriarchs; Islam forbids both women and dogs to
approach a shrine. 59 Yet Moslems still incongruously believe the gall of
a black dog can serve as a holy amulet to purge an entire household
of evil influences.40
Early Christians made an effort to assimilate the Gallo-Roman
wolf god under the name of St. Lupus or St. Loup, "Holy Wolf." 41
He was made a legendary bishop of Troyes, credited with miraculously
turning back the invading Huns from his province; but this story was fiction masquerading as history.42 The church was not wholly comfort
able with any of the manifestations of Lupus, who was really a
prototype of the werewolf. Saxons used to worship him in the first
month of the sacred year, called Wolf-monath (Wolf Month); but
Christian authorities changed the name of this month to After-Yule, or
Jesu-monath. Its runic sign was a dot in a circle, the same as the
Festival of the Circumcision of Christ (New Year's Day). 43 Diana the Huntress and her "dogs" had an extensive cult in
England. Some of her legends merged with those of Arthur, Lancelot, and other British heroes. One of the tales told how Lancelot, like
Actaeon, trespassed in the Goddess's greenwood and fell asleep at her
secret spring:
There was a Lady dwelt in that forest, and she was a great huntress, and daily she used to hunt, and ever she bare her bow with her; and no man went never with her, but always women, and they were shooters, and could well kill a deer, both at the stalk and at the trest; and they daily bare bows and arrows, horns and wood knives, and many good dogs they had. 44
When the "Lady" caught Lancelot in the forbidden place, she didn't set her dogs on him as her forerunners had done. She only shot
him in the buttock, "that he might not sit on no saddle."45 Thus he
was disgraced, since a warrior was supposed to show wounds only in
front. Because dogs were natural companions of the housewife as well as
the huntress, they were often cited as witches' familiars. A black dog
seemed even more suspect than a black cat. The dog was frequently believed to be the animal form of a demon lover, probably because women were inclined to fondle their dogs; many women were hanged
in England on that count alone. One witch was officially condemned
for having "carnal copulation with the devil in the likeness of a man, but
he removed from her in the likeness of a black dog." 46 Gypsies told a story based on such witch trials: there was a beautiful maiden whose lover was her dog. Once each year he
244



transformed himself into a man and lay with her. In due time, she gave Dog
birth to a "little white puppy," then she jumped into the river and
drowned (a popular method of disposing of witches was to drown them ^^^^_^^^__
in the so-called swimming ordeal). The demon lover assumed his
human shape, retrieved the maiden's corpse, and brought her back to
life by placing the puppy-child at her breast to suck. Afterward, as in
all fairy tales, they married and lived happily ever after. 47
The black dog was the witch's helper in gathering materials for
charms. According to an exceptionally durable superstition, the miraculous mandrake root could not be pulled out of the ground except
by a black dog. This curiously formed root, called "the phallus of the field," or "the devil's genitals," was supposed to emit a scream if uprooted by the unwary; and all who heard the sound would go
insane, or die. 48
The Irish remembered the dog's connection with death and maintained that true curses could be cast with a dog's help. Among
the Celts, cainte, "dog," denoted a satiric bard with magic power to speak curses that would come true. 49
Dogs or wolves played their ancient role of psychopomps in a
number of strange stories about cathedral-building, which might be traced all the way back to the Etruscan Lupus or Dis Pater, the wolf
headed Lord of Death who carried sacrificial victims away. In the very
old rite of the mundus, trenches dug for temple foundations were
filled with sacrificial blood. It was believed the building would be
unstable if this blood-magic were omitted; so it was done, from Hindu
India to Latium and Britain. Lupus appeared in sacred art as a wolf
angel carrying the victim to a blessed after-life. On an Etruscan vase,
the death-god Charon is assimilated to Lupus and wears a wolfskin. 50
This notion that sacred buildings needed to be founded in blood
has been evident in every tradition including the Judeo-Christian one. The Bible says when Hiel founded the city of Jericho, "he laid the foundation thereof in (the blood of) Abiram his firstborn and set up
the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of
the Lord" (1 Kings 16:34). British legend said Vortigern's temple walls kept falling down because the blood sacrifice for their foundation had been forgotten. 51 Such pagan customs continued in the Middle
Ages. Many skeletons have been found buried in walls, pillars, and
cornerstones of churches and abbeys, placed there as supportive sacrifices. 52 A deaf-mute was buried under the cornerstone of a monas
tery near Gottingen. 53 A parish church at Holsworthy, North Devon, was found in 1845 to have a skeleton in its southwest wall. 54 Illegitimate
children were frequently buried in building foundations. One St.
Benezet, or Little Bennet, was walled up in the foundation of a bridge
at Avignon in 1 184. Five centuries later his crypt was opened, and
St. Benezet proved his saintly status by remaining fresh and unde
cayed. 55 So his ecclesiastical press agents claimed, at any rate. "It was
really a common thing among Christians to sacrifice children, maids, or
245



Dog
Chansons de gestes Old French epic poetry of the 11th to 1 3th centuries.
grown-up people by burying them alive under the foundations of
castles, etc., to insure their stability." 56 When St. Columba founded a monastery on the island of Iona, he called for a volunteer to be buried alive in its foundation. A monk
named Oran, or Odran, earned a later canonization by offering
himself. 57 For some reason perhaps a promise of Christ-like resurrec
tion he was dug up again after three days. Still alive, he began to
preach blasphemous doctrines: there was no God, no devil, no heaven
or hell. St. Columba therefore had him killed and re-buried. 58 It was
not uncommon for monks infected with Gnostic, agnostic, or atheistic
beliefs to meet with such a fate.
Europe's totemic dog or wolf clans seem to have become involved
in these sacrificial customs, just as they were involved in the ancient
cult of the mundus. For instance, Cologne Cathedral was said to have
been designed by the devil, and its bells were cast under the devil's
direction at the foundry of a mysterious smith named Wolf. After
casting a certain discordant bell, supposed to be rung only in time of
disaster, Wolf was killed by a fall from the bell tower. The architect who
collaborated with the devil was also killed, crushed by a great stone
that already had his name engraved on it. 59
Chansons de gestes told a somewhat different version. The build
ers of Cologne Cathedral killed a hero named Renaud (Fox) and
buried him in the foundation. A church was erected to Renaud's
memory in 81 1 a.d.; a chapel stood on the spot in Cologne where he was slain.60 Some said Renaud was the same as the trickster-hero
demigod Reynard the Fox; others said he was a great warrior, one of
Charlemagne's paladins. The devil and the wolf were also linked with Charlemagne's tomb
at Aix-la-Chapelle. The devil contributed money to build the cathe
dral. In return, he demanded the life of the first creature to enter its
doors. At the dedication ceremony, people thrust a wolf into the
door. The devil took the wolfs life. Then it was safe for people to enter.
Like Cologne, Aix-la-Chapelle had a discordant bell for emergencies. The founder of this bell was crushed to death by the clapper, so the bell
was baptized with his blood.
Similar stories were told of Strasbourg Cathedral, supposedly
designed by a wise witch named Sabine, once a title of Lupa, the Sabine She-Wolf. The dedication of the cathedral was marked by the
sacrifice of twin brothers, like Romulus and Remus, one of whom
killed the other by pushing him under a cornerstone as it was dropped
into place. (Of the twins nursed by the Sabine She-Wolf, Romulus killed Remus while digging a furrow for the foundation of Rome's
walls.) The bishop of Strasbourg ordered the cornerstone raised again, and the second brother was crushed under it also, by his wish. He
explained, "My body will serve as a protection to the cathedral." 61 Remnants of these curious beliefs and customs survived to the present time. In World War II, the Nazi SS caused human bodies to
246



be "encased in the concrete fortifications and bunkers, as though such Dolcinists
bodies could give strength to inanimate matter." 62 To this day, Greek
peasants insist on a blood sacrifice at the building of any bridge, to bathe ^^^^^^^^^^^
the foundation in the lifeblood of a bird or animal to "strengthen"
it."
The notion that a dog's blood is equivalent to the blood of a
human being is still found among the Berbers, who believe that a
murderer is magically tainted by the blood of his victim for the rest of his
life. The killer of a dog is similarly tainted. 64 Nearly everywhere one can still find the belief that dogs can see ghosts and other spirits, left over
from the formerly universal association of canines with the world of
death and the special preserve of the underground Goddess. 65

Dolcinists
Medieval heretics formerly called the Apostolic Congregation, founded by a peasant named Segarelli, who tried to join the Franciscan
order and was rejected. Believing himself nevertheless a true spiritual
son of St. Francis, he gathered disciples and preached against the worldly wealth of the church. He was caught and burned, but the Congregation continued under Fra Dolcino, who preached the oncom
ing doomsday, the fall of the sinful church, and the triumph of the
poor and simple over the theocracy. Dolcinists admitted women to their ranks, and granted their
"sisters in Christ" the same right to preach and lead prayers as the
men, one of the worst manifestations of their heresy. Dolcinists claimed
to renounce sexual relations; so when Dolcino's particular "dearly beloved sister in Christ" Margherita di Trank bore him a child, it was
brought about through the miraculous agency of the Holy Ghost,
they said.
The Inquisition harassed the Dolcinists until they took refuge in
the high mountains. Three crusades were preached against them. In
the winter of 1 307 they were finally reduced to starvation, trapped, and
247



Doomsday slaughtered. Dolcino was captured alive, unfortunately for him. After
watching his Margherita burn, he was torn to pieces by red-hot pincers on a cart rolling slowly along the roads for all to watch.
Despite this edifying example, Dolcinism persisted for another century. Two Dolcinist Apostles were captured and burned in Germany in 1404. 1

Puranas are ancient
Sanskrit scriptures in verse, treating of cos
mologies, sacred histories, and the nature of the divine.
Doomsday
The universal idea of the world's end was rooted in ancient Hindu
belief in the cyclic alternation of universes, brought about by Kali.
Each successive creation was divided into four yugas or ages:
Satya, Treta, Dvapara, and Kali, the fourth and last marking the age when Mother turns Destroyer because the race of men become violent
and sinful, failing to perceive deity in the feminine principle. "Due to the limited intelligence and lust of men in the Kali Yuga, they will be unable to recognize women as manifestations of the Shakti." Only a
few may escape spiritual degeneration: those who are devoted "to the lotus of their mothers' feet and to their own wives." l
When Kali's doomsday arrived, the gods would slay each other. Earth would be overwhelmed by fire and flood. The Goddess would
swallow up everything and un-make it, returning to her primordial state of formless Chaos, as she was before creation. All beings would enter
her, because "She devours all existence." 2 After a time that could not
be counted because even Time was destroyed, Kali would give birth
to a new universe.
The Matsya Purana said signs of approaching doomsday were to be found in the breakdown of social structures, the increase in
violence and crime, and the decline of human intelligence:
There is no one, any more, in whom enlightening goodness (sattva) prevails; no real wise man, no saint, no one uttering truth and standing by his sacred word. The seemingly holy Brahmin is no better than a fool. Old people, destitute ofthe true wisdom ofold age, try to behave like the young, and the young lack the candor ofyouth. The social classes
have lost their distinguishing, dignifying virtues. . . . The will to rise to
supreme heights has failed; the bonds ofsympathy and love have dissolved; narrow egotism rules. . . . When this calamity has befallen the once harmoniously ordered City ofMan, the substance ofthe worldorganism had deteriorated beyond salvage, and the universe is ripe for
dissolution. }
The Vishnu Purana said the world in its last days reaches a stage
where "property confers rank, wealth becomes the only source of virtue, passion the sole bond of union between husband and wife, falsehood
248



the source of success in life, sex the only means of enjoyment, and Doomsday when outer trappings are confused with inner religion." 4
Asiatic arts of astronomic observation and calculation of calendars ^^-B^^^
were motivated by an earnest desire to know the exact length of each
yuga, to foresee the end. An age was supposed to begin when sun,
moon, and planets stood in conjunction at the initial point of the ecliptic and to end when they returned to the same point. By Hindu
reckoning, the present yuga began in 3 1 02 B.C. The chronology of 'the Central American Maya began in 3 1 1 3 B.C., only 1 1 years later, "a
discrepancy probably due to some minor miscalculation in reckoning backward from the observed movements of the heavenly bodies." 5
Ancient Mesopotamia set the same dates as India and Mexico
between 3113 and 3 1 02 b.c. for the beginning of civilized arts,
especially astronomical calculation. The Babylonian sage Berossus said
"the world will burn when all the planets that now move in different
courses come together in the Crab, so that they all stand in a straight
ine in the same sign, and . . . the future flood will take place when
the same conjunction occurs in Capricorn. For the former is the
constellation of the summer solstice, the latter of the winter solstice;
they are the decisive signs of the zodiac, because the turning points of
the year lie in them." Jeremias commented:
This Babylonian doctrine has spread over the whole world. We find it
again in Egypt, in the religion ofthe Avesta, and in India; traces ofit are discovered in China, as well as in Mexico and among the savage nations ofSouth America. To refer these phenomena back to "elemen
tary ideas" such as may arise independently among different peoples, will not hold good in view ofthe circumstance that we have to do with ideas connected with definite facts which rest upon continued astronomical
observations. 6
These remarks shed light on the great Neolithic monuments
piown to be astronomical calculators, suggesting a good reason why hey were built with so much care and effort. The Stoic philosophers
)f doomsday drew upon a very ancient tradition in predicting the
vorld's end in terms almost identical with those of Oriental sages: "A
lew sea will overrun everything, and the Ocean, today the boundary .nd girdle of the world, will occupy its centre. . . . What nature has
nade into separate parts will be confounded into a single mass." This
reed of dissolution into Chaos became "an important part of
itoicism." 7
Northern Europeans drew their myths of doomsday or Ragnarok rom the same ancient tradition. They said the world's end would be
rought about by the Mutspell (Mother's Curse) when violent gods eglected the old laws of peace and blood kinship. The angry Joddess would become Skadi the Destroyer, a great shadow devouring
le world, like her Oriental counterpart Kali. The gods would enter
249



Doomsday that shadow of Gotterdammerung, literally the Going-Into-the-Shadowof-the-Gods. They would be consumed, and the heavens and earth
^^^^^aa^ with them. The world would sink back into the womb of primal chaos
which gave it birth in the beginning. 8
This was the prophecy of the sybilline priestess who wrote the Voluspa. It was echoed by the Irish sybil Babd, one of the three Fate
goddesses. She foretold the coming of the Waste Land, "trees without
fruit and seas without fish; old men would give false judgments and
legislators make unjust laws; warriors would betray one another, and men would be thieves, and there would be no more virtue left in the
world." 9
After destruction of this nonvirtuous world and its cruel gods, there would be a period of dark nonexistence. Then the Goddess's womb
would bring forth a new universe. A new human race would arise from a primal couple, a woman named Life one of the Semitic names of
Eve and a man named Desirer-of-Life. 10
Patriarchal Persians made some alterations in the picture. Their
idea of doomsday was as dire as any, with the usual convulsions of the
earth, fires, flood, and fallings of heaven; but they denied the subsequent creation of a new world. Their concept was not cyclic, but
linear. Creation and doomsday could occur only once. After the great
battle Armageddon at the end of the world, "The War of the Sons of
Light with the Sons of Darkness," the heavenly forces of the sun god would prevail. 11 They would divide the sinful from the virtuous and
assign them to heaven or hell. The aftermath was not another creation, j
but eternal stasis, like the Brahman Nirvana.
Passing through Jewish-Essenic and Roman-Mithraic sects into Christianity, this Persian doomsday became the familiar one in the west
with numerous details borrowed from the older Aryan paganism. The
last Trump played on Gabriel's horn was originally played on RigHeimdall's "ringing horn" (Gjallarhorn). 12 The Great Serpent slain by Thor in the final battle became identified with Satan. 13 Like
paganism's sacred dramas, the final drama of the earth's dissolution
was divided into five acts. 14 Christians even translated the Norse
"Mother's Curse" as "Judgment Day" when they found it variously
rendered Mutspell, Muspell, Muspelle, Mudspeller, or Muspilli. 15 The Savior destined to appear before the world's end had an old I
form in Buddhist scriptures as Kalki Avatara, the Destroyer of Sin, who would come from heaven to announce doomsday. 16 Persians
copied him, changing his title to Son of Man, or Messiah. Before 1 70
B.C., the Book of Enoch called him Christos, the Anointed One, and announced that he had already come and gone, and that his Second
Coming was expected at any moment. 17
According to the Gospels, Jesus identified himself with this person age who would be seen "coming in the clouds with great power and
250



glory. And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his Doomsday elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the
uttermost part of heaven" (Mark 13:26-27). Jesus was not the only ^^^^^^^^^^
Messiah of his time. Josephus said before 70 a.d. there were countless
Messiahs and Christs announcing the end of the world. 18
The Gospels promised doomsday almost at once. Jesus said it would occur in his own generation: "There be some standing here,
which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God" (Luke
9:27). Early Christians accordingly expected the world's end so soon that there was no reason to marry and beget children who would never
grow up, a major reason for Christianity's renunciation of marriage. Motherhood would only harm women in the convulsions of the last days: "Woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
suck, in those days!" (Luke 21:23). Hopeful Christians found that Jesus's generation and many other
generations passed without apocalyptic symptoms. Seeking an explanation, theologians discovered the text saying a thousand years were but
a day in the sight of God (Psalms 90:4), another borrowing from Oriental sages who said a Day of Brahma lasted a thousand years. On
the basis of this scripture it was decided that the world would end in
the year 1000 a.d. With the approach of that year, Europe was seized by an apocalyptic mania. Farms and towns were abandoned as
fanatics tramped the countryside announcing the Last Days. In some areas, agriculture and commerce came virtually to a standstill. The
year passed uneventfully enough, but human society suffered greatly from famines and civil disorders caused by the doomsday belief. 19
Some Franciscans declared that Christ really had returned to earth
in 1000 a.d., disguised as St. Francis, the new Messiah, who was "entirely transformed into the person of Christ." Francis was said to
have performed all the Christ-like miracles, cast out devils, turned
water into wine, cured the sick, raised the dead, made the blind see, and so on. 20 There were those who went so far as to claim that Christ was
important only as a precursor of St. Francis. 21 Not only the Christ figure was supposed to return just before
doomsday, but also Antichrist, his adversary, for the final battle between good and evil couldn't take place until all the forces were
assembled on either side. According to a German legend, Antichrist
could not come to earth as long as the Holy Roman (German) Empire
stood. 22 This legend served to keep some of the warring nationlets in
line at times, but the Holy Roman Empire was a rather loose, indefin
able entity for most of its existence. Antichrist was almost as
constantly anticipated as Christ. Another who taught that the Last Judgment had already taken
place was Swedenborg; he gave its date as 1757, the date of the
establishment of his own Church of the New Jerusalem. He wisely

Doppelganger refrained from predicting the world's end a short time in advance, but
Dove others fell into this trap, dimming, in England, predicted the end of the
^
wm world in 1867, with resulting injury to his credibility when the end failed to come.
A prominent doomsday prophet was William Miller, inadvertent founder of the sects of Jehovah's Witnesses and Seventh-Day Adventists. He fixed the date of the millenium on March 21, 1843. His
followers were afire with enthusiasm, but still failed to see Christ
descending from the clouds as expected. Miller decided he had miscalculated, and fixed a new date on October 21 of the same year. "On
the appointed day of doom frenzied believers donned their robes,
tucked an ultimate lunch in the folds, and took their places on the
housetops, facing east. On the 22nd they ate their lunch and climbed
down. Miller confessed his disappointment, but insisted 'the day of
the Lord is at the door.' " 23 The Millerites never gave up hope. Their
offshoot sects still exist and flourish, though naive displays of credulity
are usually avoided.

Doppelganger
German word for one's "double," corresponding to the Egyptian ka, or a reflection-soul. Sometimes the afterbirth was said to be an un
formed twin of the newborn baby; by magic it might assume the
living twin's shape and follow him through life. Sometimes this was
thought to be the Doppelganger seen in one's reflection.
Dove
Aphrodite's totem, the bird of sexual passion, symbolically equivalent to the yoni. 1 In India, too, the dove was paravata, the symbol of lust. 2 Joined to her consort the phallic serpent, the Dove-goddess stood for sexual union and "Life."
The phrase attributed to Jesus, "Be ye therefore wise as serpents,
and harmless as doves" (Matthew 10:16), was no random metaphor
but a traditional invocation of the Syrian God and Goddess. 3 The
Oriental meaning was remembered by the gypsies, whose folk tales
said the souls of ancestors lived inside magic hollow mountains, the men
having been changed into serpents and the women into doves. 4
252



Christians adopted the feminine dove as a symbol of the Holy Dove
Ghost, originally the Goddess Sophia, representing God's "Wisdom" as the Goddess Metis represented the "Wisdom" of Zeus. Gnostic ^^^^^^^^^^^
Christians said Sophia was incarnate in the dove that impregnated the
virgin Mary, the same dove that descended on Jesus at his baptism to
impregnate his mind (Matthew 3:16). Pious admirers of Pope Greg
ory the Great made him even more saintly than Jesus by reporting that the Holy Ghost in dove shape descended on him not once but many
times. 5 All this was copied from Roman iconography which showed the human soul as a dove that descended from the Dove-goddess's
oversoul to animate the body. 6
Aphrodite as a bringer of death, or "peace," sometimes bore the name of Irene, Dove of Peace. Another of her death-goddess names was Epitymbria, "She of the Tombs." 7 Romans called her Venus
Columba, Venus-the-Dove. Her catacombs, mausoleums, and necropoli were known as columbaria, "dovecotes." 8 Thus the soul
returning to the Goddess after death was again envisioned as a dove.
From this image, Christians copied their belief that the souls of saints became white doves that flew out of their mouths at the moment of
death. In the Catholic ceremony of canonization, white doves are
released from cages at the crucial moment of the ritual. 9
Christian iconography showed seven rays emanating from the dove of the Holy Ghost: an image that went back to some of the most
primitive manifestations of the Goddess. 10 In the Orient, the mystic seven were the Pleiades or "Seven Sisters," whose Greek name
meant "a flock of doves." They were daughters or "rays" of Aphrodite under her title of Pleione, Queen of the Sea. 11 Herodotus said seven
holy women known as Doves founded the oracles of Dodona, Epirus, and Theban Amon. 12 They were worshipped in the Middle East as
Seven Sages or Seven Pillars of Wisdom: the seven woman-shaped
pillars that had been upholding temples of the Goddess since the
third millenium B.C. 13 See Caryatid. Arabs still revere the Seven Sages,
and some remember that they were women, or "doves." H The
Semitic word for "dove," ione, was a cognate of "yoni" and related to
the Goddess Uni, who later became Iune, or Juno.
The cult of the Doves used to incorporate primitive rites of
castration and its modification, circumcision. India called the seven
Sisters "razors" or "cutters" who judged and "critically" wounded men,
the Krittikas, "Seven Mothers of the World," root of the Greek
kritikos, "judge." They killed and gave rebirth to gods who were castrated to make them fertile, like women. The name of Queen
Semiramis, legendary founder of Babylon, also meant "Dove" in the
Syrian tongue. She was said to have castrated all her consorts. 15
When circumcision replaced castration, the doves were involved in
that too. Even Christian symbolism made the connection. The
253



Drama official symbol of the Festival of the Circumcision of Christ was a dove,
holding in its beak a ring representing the Holy Prepuce. "Christ's
^HMMHHHi^^^^M fructifying blood" was linked with the similar emblem of Pentecost,
which showed the descending dove on a background of blood red,
officially described as a representation of the church fertilized by the
blood of Christ and the martyrs. 16
A certain "maiden martyr" called St. Columba (Holy Dove) was
widely revered, especially in France, although she never existed as a human being. 17 Another curious survival of pagan dove-lore was the
surname given to St. Peter: Bar-Iona, "Son of the Dove." 18 Some
survivals may have been invented to explain the doves appearing on
ancient coins as symbols of Aphrodite and Astarte. 19

Drama
All drama began as sacred or magical drama, seasonally performed, having the same universal theme: the challenge, trial, marriage, sacrifice, and resurrection of the hero, or sacred king, or savior. The
audience participated with songs, dances, sexual orgies, laments, eating the god and rejoicing at his restoration. One object was attainment of
religious ecstasy: entering into the "dream." It has been shown that every dream bears "a remarkable resemblance to drama." 1 Old Norse draumar, related to German Traum
(dream), featured a sacrificial slaying of the god, the "tragic" part of the
performance. 2 Tragedy descended from the "goat-song" enacting the sacred dramas of Dionysus or Pan. The five-act structure of classical tragic
drama still seen in the plays of Shakespeare was established by the
five-act rites of the god. The acts were: (1) agon, the Contest: the
incumbent incarnation of the god fought his challenger; (2) pathos, the
Passion: the god united with the goddess and sent forth his soul with
his semen (or blood) to fertilize the world anew he died in his own
begetting; (3) threnos, the Lament: a "threnody" of wailings and
gestures of grief, partly to absolve the audience of responsibility for the
god's death; (4) anagnorisis, the Discovery: priestesses returned to the tomb to find that the god was "risen," in much the same ritual enacted
by Mary Magdalene and other temple-women at the tomb of Jesus
(Luke 24:10) where, significantly, no men were present; (5) apotheosis, the Deification: the resurrected victim became God, and rose to
heaven, to be a part of his divine father. 3 On this occasion the
254



worshippers threw themselves into an orgy of rejoicing, such as Droit du Seigneur
distinguished the Roman carnival called Hilaria, "Day of Joy," following the death and resurrection of the savior Attis.4
Dionysus, Pan, Attis, Osiris, Orpheus, and many other gods of the mystery-cults contributed their dramas to medieval mystery plays,
their linear descendants. The mummers' play, the ceremonies of
Carnival, May Day, Harvest Home and other festivals used parts of the old sacred drama. Characters of the classic commedia were modeled
on some of the pagan deities. The Dove-goddess became Columbine
(Dove). The Serpent-god became Pierrot (Big Peter, or the Pied One). The name of Harlequin came from the Hellequins, or Hella cunni, "kindred of the Goddess Hel," souls of the pagan dead riding forth from her underworld. 5
Masks were customary in the early medieval drama, just as they were in the plays of ancient Greece and Rome. From a magical point
of view, the essence of the character lay in the mask, not in the actor
who wore it. This was the primitive theory behind all appearances of mask and costume in religious ceremonies, from the animal-headed
"gods" of Egypt human bodies wearing the deities' disguises to modern priestly vestments. Savages still say that, by putting on the mask
and costume of an animal, spirit, or deity (or all at once), they do not simply make believe but actually become that creature. 6 See Mask.

Jroit du Seigneur
The Lord's Right," also called jusprimae noctis, "the law of the first
light." An outgrowth of the feudal system that equated ownership of and with ownership of women. The droit du seigneur meant that ivery serf's bride must be deflowered on her wedding night not by her
>ridegroom but by the lord of the land.
As laid down by Ewen III of Scotland in the 9th century, the law aid wives of common folk could be raped by any nobleman at any
ime; and "the lord of the ground shall have the maidenhead of all
irgins dwelling on the same." ' The church upheld the droit du seigneur as a God-given right of le nobility. For a vassal bridegroom to consummate his marriage
/ithin three nights after the wedding was declared blasphemous "to the benediction" and tantamount to "carnal lust." 2 The overlord's
however, was right and proper. The eastern church provided legal lties for a man who tried to consummate his marriage before his
er could rape the bride.*
Droit du seigneur was a general rule throughout the feudal period continued in Russia up to the 19th century.4
255



Druids The system also continued in America's slaveholding south before
the civil war, unofficially but generally acknowledged. Every black woman was the sexual property of her master, whether she was married
to another slave or not. 5 Slave marriages could be legally ignored if plantation owners cared to do so. In 1757, Peter Fontaine said plantation owners begot so many children on their female slaves that "the
country swarms with mulatto bastards." Thomas Anburey praised the
system, calling it "a pleasant method to procure slaves at a cheap rate." 6

var. dryads, druides,
druidai, drysidae, Gaulish druvis, Old Irish drui. 1
Druids
Europe's sacred-oak cultists were known by many names. Greek
myth said the dryads were oak nymphs, each an oracular priestess with
her own personal tree spirit, like the biblical Deborah who lived
under a tree that bore her own name (Judges 4:5). Dryads were called
priestesses of Artemis, whose souls dwelt in their trees. They could
also assume the shapes of serpents, and were then called Hamadryads,
or Amadryades. 2 In their druidic groves throughout northern Europe, Strabo said, they practiced rites "similar to the orgies of Samothrace."*
Dryadism and druidism were two phases of the same religion,
evidently restricted to a female priesthood in the earlier, matriarchal
stage, later open to male priests as well. Gaulish and British priests of th<
oak groves formed a class of bardic wizards, keeping a sacred tradition
by memorizing orally transmitted material, the nucleus of medieval
sagas, epics, and ballads.
There is no break between the ancient semi-magical formulae chanted b4 the Druids and the later incantation ofthe wizard and the "wise
woman. " They both arose in the Veda-like sacred hymns which formed
the depository of the learning professed by the body of the druidical teachers and diviners and taught orally in the druidic schools. Most of them were never written down, and the fragments that we possess in writing are probably only the remains ofa considerable body oforal
literature. 4
Druids were attacked by the Christian church for their pagan
ism, but especially for their propensity to include sacred women in their
ranks. Scot said even in his day there were feminine spirits associated with trees, called Dryads in Greece and Druids in Scotland. They were
shape-shifters, and could appear as either birds or women. "They know our thoughts, and can prophesy of things to come." 5 Despite nominal conversion to Christianity, the Irish clung to
druidism for many centuries. Their revered pagan king Diarmuid was i
256



called "half a druid and half a Christian." To make St. Patrick's legend Durga
more palatable to the Irish, monks claimed he had been educated by a
druid.6 Irish churches were known by the old druidic name of dairthech, ^^^^^^^^^^
"oak-house," formerly applied to the sacred grove. 7
The "colleges" of druidesses, or dryads, passed by almost imperceptible degrees into a new designation of Christian nuns. One of the three classes of druidesses consisted of secluded sisterhoods, like the
priestesses of Brigit, living in convent-like sanctuaries and tending
sacred fires that were kept perpetually burning. Another, less secluded class of druidesses consisted of married women who lived at the
temple and went home occasionally to visit their husbands. A third class
was composed of temple servants who lived with their families. 8 With
the coming of Christianity, the high holy sisterhoods were assimilated as nuns. The others were usually described as witches.
The druidic religion lasted a surprisingly long time over a surprisingly wide geographical area. Christians continued to worship oak
deities in their sacred groves through the 8th century a.d. in Hesse.
According to Gildas, Christian monks copied their tonsure from the druids. Traces of druidism were found as late as 1874 in Russia.9 Even
clearer traces were found in the 20th century in the Holy Land,
where the Goddess of the sacred groves was worshipped as Asherah
since pre-biblical times, and was known in Canaan as progenitress of the gods. 10 Her priestesses the oak-nymphs continued to be venerated
under the title of Benat Ya'kob (Daughters of Jacob), said to dwell in
their trees near old shrines that were rededicated to mythical Moslem
saints. The trees were taboo. Their wood was never taken for fuel,
except for votive purposes. 11 To some extent the mystical reverence for oak trees persists to this
day. Many British and American towns have their venerable "Char
ter Oak" or some superannuated tree where seasonal ceremonies take
place. Acorns and oak leaves are still considered appropriate for
wreaths and harvest decorations, even if they no longer crown the
| Goddess's sacred kings.

Durga
Kali's Creating-Preserving-Destroying trinity was said to consist of
Parvati or Maya the Virgin, Durga the Queen-Mother, and Uma or
jPrisni the Crone. Durga was entitled "The Inaccessible." A crowned
Kmazon, she rode tigers into battle and defeated many demonic
monsters, defending her children the gods. 1 Like other forms of the
poddess-as-warrior, such as the Middle-Eastern Ma-Bellona, Durga
257



Dusii drank the blood of her enemies. 2 What this really meant was that her Dymphna, Saint altars or images were anointed with the blood of war captives, killed as
^^g^^^B^ trophies.
As "The Inaccessible," Durga personified the fighting spirit of a
mother protecting her young, and perhaps also the nursing mother sexually "inaccessible" to men, according to the old Oriental custom.
Durga stood for the basic animal instincts of maternity, for which the
adult male is no longer significant, and only her offspring claims a mother's attention. Durga was sometimes Shasthi, "the Sixth," Leader of the Mothers. This title arose from the custom of invoking her on the sixth day
after childbirth, when the continuous spells for protection of mother and child could be brought to an end. The seventh day was a day of rest. 3
This was the true beginning of the common patriarchal legend of gods who gave birth to the world in six days and rested on the seventh.
Among such gods were Persia's Ahura Mazda, Memphian Ptah, Babylo
nian Marduk, Syrian Baal, and the Hebraic Jehovah.4 Durga's titles and character penetrated western ideas of the God
dess before the first century B.C. Rome's Great Mother Juno had the
same attributes as her Oriental sister; she was Juno the Preserver,
Queen of the Mothers. 5

A canonization of what seems to have been a bit of graffiti on a brick found near Antwerp in the 1 3th century. The brick was buried near a
coffin containing the bones of an unidentified man and woman. The
words on the brick were ma dompna, "my lady," the traditional address
of a medieval poet to his lady-love. Though having no more basis than these words on an old brick,

the cult of St. Dymphna was carefully developed. A large asylum near Gheel was named after her, so she became the patron saint of the

Eag'e Eagle
Classic soul-bird, symbol of apotheosis associated with the sun god,
^^^^^^^^ fire, and lightning. Greeks thought eagles so closely akin to the lightning
spirit that they nailed eagles to the peaks of temples to serve as magic
lightning rods. Hence the name aetoi, "eagles," for the pediments of Greek temples. 1 These were ancient forerunners of the "weathercock" on the rooftree of a barn or house.
Cults of fire and the sun made the eagle a bearer of kingly spirit:
the god's soul returning to heaven after a period of earthly incarna
tion as the king. 2 It was the Roman custom to release an eagle above the
funeral pyre of each emperor, just as an Egyptian pharoah rose to heaven on the wings of the solar hawk. 3
Zeus himself took the shape of an eagle to carry his young lover
Ganymede to heaven. This was often interpreted as a symbol of the
father-god's reception of men's souls when they were initiated into the
solar Mysteries.4 The eagle was connected with rites of calling down "fire from
heaven," probably with a burning-glass, to consume sacrifices on the altar. Such "fire from heaven" came down from Yahweh to consume
the sons of Aaron (Leviticus 10:2), who died like sacrificial victims to
the solar gods of Tyre. Such victims "passed through the fire" as
offerings, and rose to heaven in the form of eagles.
We must bear in mind that in the East, whence all these beliefs and cults
derive, not only was fire regarded as an all-powerful purifying agent, but death by fire was looked upon as an apotheosis which raised the victim
to the rank ofthe gods. . . . "Fire, "says Iamblichus, "destroys the
material part ofsacrifices, it purifies all things that are brought near it, releasing them from the bonds ofmatter and, in virtue ofthe purity of
its nature, making them meet for communion with the gods. So, too, it releases us from bondage ofcorruption, it likens us to the gods. 5
The eagle was often identified with the fire bird or phoenix,
who underwent a baptism of the fire that "burns all sins" and was
reborn from his own ashes. The eagle also stood for the soul of
Heracles, who passed through fire into heaven at seasonal festivals of
Tarsus, and inspired St. Paul's belief in the virtue of giving one's
body to be burned (1 Corinthians 13:3). The eagle was the totemic
form of Prometheus, who "stole" fire from heaven, like the eastern
fire-lightning-sun hero, man, or angel embodied in the Garuda bird. Garuda flew to the mountain of paradise to steal the gods' secret of
immortality. Later, he assumed the golden body of the sun. American
Indians had a similar hero, the thunderbird or lightning bird.6
As the royal bird of Rome, and the embodiment of deified
emperors, the eagle was worshipped by Roman legionaries. Each legion had its sacred eagles, carried into battle like banners. If a legion
should lose its eagles, the disgrace was unbearable; another whole expedition might be mounted to recover them. 7
262



The Roman imperial emblem was inherited by the Germanic E-Anna "Holy Roman Empire" and its Kaisers, derived from Caesars. Thus Earth the eagle became a Teutonic symbol of sovereignty. ^^^^^^^^^^^

E-Anna
"Land of Anna," one of the territories of Babylon, named after the Goddess under one of her most common Mesopotamian names (see
Anne, Saint).
Earth
Herodotus said, "Three different names have been given to the earth, which is but one, and those derived from the names of women." ' Herodotus miscounted. Thousands of feminine names have been
given to the earth. Continents Asia, Africa, Europe were named after manifestations of the Goddess. Countries bore the names of
female ancestors or of other manifestations of the Goddess: Libya,
Lydia, Russia, Anatolia, Latium, Holland, China, Ionia, Akkad, Chaldea, Scotland (Scotia), Ireland (Eriu, Hera) were but a few. 2 Every nation gave its own territory the name of its own Mother Earth.
Tacitus said the tribes of Europe regarded Mother Earth as "the all
ruling deity, to whom all else is subject and obedient." 3 Mother Earth received universal worship because she was the
universal parent. American Indians still relate how all peoples and
animals in the beginning emerged from Earth's yonic hole, and "it was
just like a child being born from its mother. The place of emergence
is the womb of the earth." Siberian reindeer hunters say the human race
emerged from a Goddess, whose carved figurines protect the hunter's
hut, when given offerings and prayers: "Help us to keep healthy! Help us to kill much game!" 4 The central doctrine of Amerindian religion was reincarnation in a new body from Mother Earth's womb, the ancient meaning of "born
again." A chief named Smohalla spoke of his moral obligations formed
by this doctrine:
It is a sin to wound or cut, to tear or scratch our common mother by
working at agriculture. You ask me to dig in the earth? Am I to take a knife and plunge it into the breast ofmy mother? But then, when I die,
she will not gather me again into her bosom. You tell me to dig up and take away the stones. Must I mutilate her flesh so as to get at her bones? Then I can never again enter into her body and be born again. 5
Oriental Indians had much the same idea about entering the
263



Earth earth. Hindu priests told a dead man: "Go, seek the earth, that wise and
kind mother of all. O Earth, rise up and do not hurt his bones; be
^^^^^^^^m kind and gentle to him. O Earth, cover him as a mother covers her
infant with the skirts of her garment." 6 Ancient Roman philosophers had the same idea too. "The Earth
Mother is the mysterious power that awakes everything to life. ... All comes from the earth and all ends in the earth ... the earth produces all
things and then enfolds them again . . . the Goddess is the beginning
and end of all life." A Roman writer of the 3rd century a.d. prayed to
"Holy Goddess Earth, Nature's mother, who bringeth all to life, and
revives all from day to day. The food of life Thou grantest in eternal
fidelity. And when the soul hath retired we take refuge in Thee. All that Thou grantest falls back somewhere into Thy womb." 7
Patriarchal Christians might have been expected to speak of Father
Heaven rather than Mother Earth, yet even they found it impossible
to give up the older deity. The epitaph of Pope Gregory the Great said:
Suscipe Terra tuo de corpore sumptum: "Receive, O Earth, what was taken from thy body." 8 Even up to the 20th century, tombstones of German Christians bore the formula: Hier ruht im Mutterschoss der Erde . . . , "Here rests in Earth's maternal womb. . . ." 9 In Chaucer's
Pardoner's Tale an old man pleaded with the Goddess:
. . . / walk alone and wait About the earth, which is my mother's gate,
Knock-knocking with my stafffrom night to noon And crying, "Mother, open to me soon! Look at me, Mother, won 'tyou Jet me in? See how I wither, flesh and bones and skin! Alas! When will these bones be laid to rest?" 10
This was more than a poetic metaphor. As late as the 1 2th
century, many Europeans still recognized Mother Earth as a Goddess, perhaps their only supreme divinity. She was described in an English herbal of the period with no mention of God at all:
Earth, divine goddess, Mother Nature, who dost generate all things and bringest forth ever anew the sun which thou hast given to the nations; Guardian ofsky and sea and ofall Gods and powers; through thy influence all nature is hushed and sinks to sleep. . . . Again, when it pleases thee, thou sendest forth the glad daylight and nurturest life with
thine eternal surety; and when the spirit ofman passes, to thee it returns. Thou art indeed rightly named Great Mother of the Gods; Victory is thy divine name. Thou art the source ofthe strength of peoples and gods; without thee nothing can either be born or made perfect; thou art mighty, Queen ofthe Gods. Goddess, I adore thee as divine, I invoke thy name; vouchsafe to grant that which I ask ofthee, so
shall I return thanks to thy godhead. "
Up to the Renaissance, English farmers continued to call upon
Erce, eorthan modor (Earth, mother of earth) when planting. 12 Similar
264



ly, up to the 20th century, Russian farmers continued to call upon Earth
Mati-Syra-Zemlya (Moist Mother Earth) for almost everything. Instead of touching a Bible when taking an oath, a Russian peasant would put ^^^^^^^^^^
a clod of earth on his head, invoking the Mother's curse if he broke his word. 13 This perpetuated an ancient Greek habit. Even the patriar
chal Olympian gods swore their binding oaths by Mother Earth: Gaea, or Rhea, called Universal Mother, Deep-Breasted One, firmly founded, oldest of divinities. 13 Hesiod admitted that she ruled Olympus
before the coming of the Hellenic deities. She ruled Russia too. The
country bore her ancient name, Rha (Rhea), the Red One, mother of the Volga and all its tribes. 14
Home and Mother were literally identical to people who combined
both in their image of the earth-goddess. Many believed they must be buried in the same soil that supported them in childhood. Threatened by invaders, the matriarchal Cimmerians could have saved them
selves by moving away from their homeland; but they chose to face
superior numbers of enemies, and die where they were, believing their lives valueless if they couldn't re-unite with the same Earth that
gave them birth. 15 The Egyptian traveler Sinuhe felt the approach of death and hurried home to his motherland "to follow the Lady of All,"
hoping that she would "spend eternity by my side." 16 Post-mortem reunion with the Mother always overlapped with
the idea of marrying her. Man seldom distinguished clearly between his
three roles as the Goddess's child, corpse, and bridegroom. Balkan
peasants still view death as a sacred marriage, and dress corpses as for a
wedding. Formal dirges say: "The black earth for my wife I took." Ancient Greek epitaphs similarly proclaimed the dead man "admitted to the bridal chamber of Persephone." Artemidorus wrote: "All the
accompaniments of marriage are exactly the same as those of death." 17
The archetypal image of the marriage-with-Earth had a curious revival in the special mid-Victorian pornography known as pornoto
pia, in which the female body was a landscape, and man
correspondingly reduced in fantasy to about the size of a fly:
In the middle distance there looms a large irregular shape. On the horizon swell two immense snowy white hillocks; these are capped by great,
pink, and as it were prehensile peaks or tips as ifthe rosy-fingered dawn itself were playing just behind them. The landscape undulates gently
down to a broad, smooth, swelling plain, its soft rolling curves broken only in the lower center by a small volcanic crater or omphalos. Farther
down, the scene narrows and changes in perspective. Offto the right and left jut two smooth snowy ridges. Between them, at their point of juncture, is a dark wood . . . sometimes it is called a thicket . . . triangular
in shape. It is also like a cedarn cover, and in its midst is a dark romantic chasm. In this chasm the wonders ofnature abound. From its top there
depends a large, pink stalactite, which changes shape, size, and color in accord with the movement of the tides below and within. Within the chasm which is roughly pear-shaped there are caverns measureless
265



Earth to man, grottoes, hermits' caves, underground streams a whole internal and subterranean landscape. The climate is warm but wet. Thunder^^__^^___^^^^_ storms are frequent in this region, as are tremors and quakings of the
earth. The walls ofthe cavern often heave and contract in rhythmic
violence, and when they do the salty streams that run through it double their flow. The whole place is dark yet visible. This is the center ofthe earth and the home ofman. IS
Marcus attributes these images of pornotopia to a spiritual loss, possibly related in a direct way to contemporary denial of the earth
mother figure in a religious symbolism, as well as Victorian society's
suppression of sexuality:
One gets the distinct impression, after reading a good deal ofthis literature, that it could only have been written by men who at some
point in their lives had been starved. . . . Inside ofevery pornographer there is an infant screaming for the breast from which he has been torn.
Pornography represents an endless and infinitely repeated effort to recapture that breast, and the bliss it offered. ' 9
Acquisitiveness seems to have been another manifestation of the
hidden psychic hunger for possession of Mother Earth. Her European names Urth, Hertha, Eortha, Erda, Hretha, etc. stemmed from
Sanskrit Artha, " materia] wealth." Among the Hindu-rooted gypsies,
"earth" meant good luck, fortune, money. 20 Latin Mater (Mother) became English "matter," of which Plutarch said, "Matter hath the function of mother and nurse . . . and containeth the elements from
which everything is produced." 21 Tibetans still say the elements are
produced by the Old Mother. 22 The material body has the special
name of Anna-Maya, variations of which appeared everywhere in the ancient Mediterranean world as names of the Great Goddess. 23 The
"soul manifested in matter" is defined as the Anna-Maya self. The sages say, "Mind and matter are at base one as modes of the same Power.
. . . Mind is the subjective and Matter the objective aspect of the one polarized Consciousness." 24
Western theology split this former unity into a duality, regarding
matter (or flesh) and mind (or spirit) as intrinsically different from, and opposed to, one another. Thus, says Jung, "the word 'matter'
remains a dry, inhuman, and purely intellectual concept, without any
psychic significance for us. How different was the former image of
matter the Great Mother that could encompass and express the profound emotional meaning of Mother Earth." 25
After the image of Mother Earth as birth-giver, perhaps that of Mother Earth as receiver of the dead aroused the most profound
emotional responses. When death was viewed as a return to the infantile
state of sleep in the Mother's bosom, it seemed less terrifying. The Rig Veda says, "Crawl to your Mother Earth. She will save you from
the void." 26 In medieval ballads, the hero's lady-love sometimes
impersonated Mother Earth by covering her lover with her green
266



mantle, to put him "out of sight" as if buried. 27 Greek peasants Easter thought the worst kind of curse on an enemy was to wish Mother Earth would not accept him: "May the earth not digest thee! May the black ^^^^^^^^^^
earth spew thee up! May the ground not consume thee!" 28 Such a one rejected by the earth would be a revenant or a restless ghost.
In France during the 12th century, a sect of heretics were sent to
the stake by the Archbishop of Reims, apparently for worshipping Mother Earth, among other offenses. Led to execution, one of them
"cried again and again, 'O Earth, cleave asunder!'" His hearers
thought he was trying to get the earth to swallow his enemies, but he may have believed the earth could open and swallow him to save him
from the stake. 29 Like the original death aspect of Rhea or Cerridwen,
Mother Earth still was supposed to devour her children.

Easter
Springtime sacrificial festival named for the Saxon Goddess Eostre, or Ostara, a northern form of Astarte. Her sacred month was Eastre
monath, the Moon of Eostre. 1 Saxon poets apparently knew Eostre was the same Goddess as
India's Great Mother Kali. Beowulf spoke of "Ganges' waters, whose flood waves ride down into an unknown sea near Eostre's far home." 2
The Easter Bunny was older than Christianity; it was the Moonhare sacred to the Goddess in both eastern and western nations.
Recalling the myths of Hathor-Astarte who laid the Golden Egg of the sun, Germans used to say the hare would lay eggs for good children
on Easter Eve. 3 (See Cat.) Like all the church's "movable feasts," Easter shows its pagan origin in a dating system based on the old lunar calendar. It is fixed as
the first Sunday after the first full moon after the spring equinox,
formerly the "pregnant" phase of Eostre passing into the fertile season. The Christian festival wasn't called Easter until the Goddess's
name was given to it in the late Middle Ages. 4 (See Menstrual
Calendar.)
The Irish kept Easter on a different date from that of the Roman
church, probably the original date of the festival of Eostre, until the
Roman calendar was imposed on them in 632 a.d. Nevertheless, the Columban foundation and their colonies in Britain kept the old date
for another fifty years. 5 The Persians began their solar New Year at the spring equinox,
267



Ecclesia and up to the middle of the 1 8th century they still followed the old custom of presenting each other with colored eggs on the occasion.6
^
m^^^^m Eggs were always symbols of rebirth, which is why Easter eggs were
usually colored red the life-color especially in eastern Europe. Russians used to lay red Easter eggs on graves to serve as resurrection
charms.7 In Bohemia, Christ was duly honored on Easter Sunday and
his pagan rival on Eastern Monday, which was the Moon-day
opposed to the Sun-day. Village girls like ancient priestesses sacrificed the Lord of Death and threw him into water, singing, "Death swims
in the water, spring comes to visit us, with eggs that are red, with yellow
pancakes, we carried Death out of the village, we are carrying
Summer into the village." 8 Another remnant of the pagan sacred drama was the image of the
god buried in his tomb, then withdrawn and said to live again. The
church instituted such a custom early in the Middle Ages, apparently in
hopes of a reportable miracle. A small sepulchral building having been erected and the consecrated host placed within, a priest was set to watch it from Good Friday to Easter Sunday. Then the host was taken out and displayed, and the congregation was told Christ was
risen. 9
A curious 16th-century Easter custom was known as "creeping to
the cross with eggs and apples," a significant use of the ancient
female symbols of birth and death, beginning and fruition, the opening and closing of cycles. The Ceremonial of the Kings of England ordered carpets to be laid in the church, for the comfort of the king,
queen, and courtiers as they crept down the aisle on hands and
knees. 10 The penitential implication of the creeping ceremony is clear
enough, but the female-symbolic foodstuffs are a bit mysterious. Germany applied to Easter the same title formerly given to the season of the sacred king's love-death, Hoch-Zeit, "the High Time."
In English too, Easter used to be called "the Hye-Tide." n From these
titles came the colloquial description of any festival holiday as "a high old time."

Ecclesia
"The Church," a title of the virgin Mary, who was supposed to represent the physical body of which Christ was the spiritual head. Holy Mother Church was both bride and mother of God, according to Christian mystics, postulating even an incestuous Sacred Marriage in
the old pagan style. The erotic poetry of Solomon's Song was glossed as an expression of the love between Christ and "Ecclesia." Irenaeus
said Mary-Ecclesia was "the pure womb which regenerates man unto
268



God." As in the manner of pagan temples, even the church building was likened to Mary's body.
Echo Eden
Echo
Greek "nymph" at whose reflecting pool Narcissus met his death.
According to the classical myth, Echo grieved so sorely for her beloved flower-god that she pined away until there was nothing left of her but her voice.
Originally, she was Acco, the pre-Hellenic birth-goddess, in an oracular mood as "the last echo of the Voice," meaning the Voice of
Creation, the same as the Goddess Vac in ancient India (see Logos). In
Hebrew she was Bath Kol, Daughter of the Voice. 1
Apparently the Word she spoke to the springtime god NarcissusAntheus-Adonis-Hyacinthus was the death curse heralding the final phase of the sacred king's fatal drama; for Narcissus was the same god as
Dionysus with all his flower-titles. 2

Irenaeus Doctor, saint, and father of the church, said to have lived in the 2nd century a.d. as bishop of
Lyons. His history is obscure, largely
based on (possibly fraudulent) assertions of Eusebius, who claimed to have letters from Irenaeus, but none of these
were preserved. The story of Irenaeus's martyrdom has been proved false.
Ecstasy
Greek ekstasis meant "standing forth naked," a word for the state of
mind ensuing in a religious trance when the consciousness was stripped
I away, leaving only the essential self. In Greece as in ancient India,
proper worship was sometimes conducted in a state of physical naked
Iness (Hindu digambara) to symbolize purification from all distractions, to concentrate on the ecstatic experience.
Edda
"Great-Grandmother," a Norse name for Mother Earth (Erda); also the word for sacred poetry inspired by her. Icelandic sagas or Eddas
usually opened with an invocation to this Goddess, who gave birth to
the oldest third of the human race. 1

sbrew "Garden of Delight," based on the Persian Heden or primal
rden where the first couple were joined together as a bisexual being in
Golden Age. Like all images of the earthly paradise, Eden was ated in the far west originally, where the sun went each night. That is
ly the Bible says known lands lay "east of Eden" (Genesis 4:16).

Edmund, Saint Edmund, Saint
Egg-and-Dart Frieze Canonized form of the heathen deity worshipped at Bury St. Ed
munds, where he was seasonally slain, like Shiva, in the shape of a white bull.
Ritual bull-killing dated back to the Cretan Minotaur cult, through
rites of Artemis Tauropolos, the Roman Taurobolium, and via
Iberian paganism up to the bullfights of modern Spain. St. Edmund's shrine was supposedly founded on the tomb of the saint, a young man who became "chosen king" of the East Angles in the 9th century. 1
But his legend was wholly mythological. Like other Celtic savior-gods he was tied to a tree and pierced by many arrows: the same fate meted
out to the sacrificial bull, still demonstrated by Spanish picadors. On
Edmund's heraldic crest, the martyr's head was held by a wolf, the
traditional Doorkeeper of Death, and the Triple Goddess appeared symbolically in the shape of three Crowns. (See Dog.) Monastic records reveal the true totemic nature of "St. Edmund."
A white bull was chosen each year to be paraded through the streets, while women wishing to conceive would caress him, for a doomed god
was usually credited with great fertilizing power. A contract paper from the monastery said: "This indenture certifies that Master John
Swassham, sacrist, with the consent of the prior of the convent . . .
shall find, or cause to be found, one white bull every year of his term, so
often as it shall happen that any gentlewoman, or any other woman, from devotion or vows made by them shall visit the tomb of the glorious
martyr St. Edmund to make oblation to the same white bull." 2

E gg
Mystical symbol of the Creatress, whose World Egg contained the
universe in embryo. Orphics said the Great Goddess of darkness,
Mother Night, first brought forth the World Egg which was identified with the moon. Heaven and earth were made of the two halves of
the eggshell, and the first deity to emerge was the bisexual Eros the
Desired. The Egg was a common Oriental image of creation. Its
western versions "went back to cosmologies of the Tiamat-type and
to early exchanges between Greece and the East." ' Egyptians' signs for the World Egg was the same as for an embryo in a woman's womb.

Egg-and-Dart Frieze
Classical architectural decoration sometimes called the Frieze of
Venus and Mars: a symbol of the magic circle alternating men and
women. On the frieze, ovals alternate with trident-shaped darts,
270



female and male genital emblems. Ancient builders carried the frieze all Eide the way around a building or room without a break, since an El
interruption in the frieze could mean a break in the succession of i_^^^^^^^^^
human generations. The same design in Egypt presented even more overtly sexual hieroglyphs: downward-pointing phalli alternating with narrow mandorlas (female almond shapes), each topped by a small triangle
representing a clitoris. 1 The Tantric "magic circle" or chakra was a human equivalent of
the Egg-and-Dart frieze. In pagan Britain, druidic priests also worked
in magic circles alternating with green-robed dignitaries known as Ovates, or Eggs. 2 Wearing the color associated with Life in druidic
religion, these must have been priestesses, like the eastern shaktis, or
else men impersonating women by wearing female dress.
Many counting-games originated with the magic circle, in which the even numbers were assigned to men, the odd numbers to
women. Pagan traditions said odd numbers represented "immortality" because all odd numbers are female. 3 This explains why Roman
religious festivals were scheduled for odd-numbered days, on the theory
that these days were more propitious.

Elaine
Britain's "Lily Maid," the virgin Moon-goddess bearing the same name as Helen of Troy; British tradition claimed the islands were
colonized by Trojans. According to the bards, the Roman emperor
acquired Britain only by marrying its queen, Elen. The people agreed to help build Roman roads because she ordered them, and the roads were called Roads of Elen of the Hosts: "The men of the Island of
Britain would not have made those great hostings for any save for
her." 1 Elen or Elaine became the mother-bride of Lancelot-Galahad in Arthurian romance. Lancelot the father begot on her his own
reincarnation, Galahad the son; but Lancelot in his youth had been named Galahad, and his mother was Queen Elaine. The Lily Maid gave Lancelot her sexual-symbolic charm to make him invincible: her
pearl-bedewed sleeve of red silk. The womb-symbol of the Holy Grail was displayed in her castle, tended by her dove-soul, Colombe.
Galahad saw this vision again in his last moments, as he expired at the
altar in ancient sacred-king style. 2

Electra
One of the Seven Sisters (see Pleiades); virgin mother of Dardanus, founder of Troy, whose name is still borne by the Dardanelles. Electra
was also known as a sea nymph. Myths of the classic period made her
a "daughter" of two queens responsible for their husbands' ritual
murders, Queen Clytemnestra and Queen Jocasta, who brought death to Agamemnon and Oedipus, respectively. Electra's name means "amber," and may have been applied to a priestess who wore certain amulets of amber as a badge of office.
Elements
On each of the inhabited continents, the same four elements were
distinguished as building-blocks of all substances living or dead, organic
or inorganic: water, fire, earth, and air. Indians of Missouri and New
Mexico, Aztecs, Chinese, Hindus, ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans all had the same idea. 1 The earliest known literate
civilization, Sumeria, had already designated the elements water, fire, earth, and air. 2 The "science" of western Europe continued to
272



believe in the same mystic elements up to the 18th century when real elements began to be discovered.
Indo-European tradition said the four elements were created by
Great Mother Kali, who organized them into letter-mantras carved
on her rosary of skulls, to form the Sanskrit alphabet, which she invested with power to create what it expressed. Elemental sounds were
divided into four categories: Va, water; Ra, fire; La, earth; and Ya, air.
They were bound together by the Mother-syllable Ma (Kali Ma
herself), representing "intelligence." 3 Tibetan Buddhists still say the elements are ruled by "Old Mother Khon-Ma," the Great Goddess. 4 The Goddess was addressed in scriptures: "Thou art Earth, Thou
art Water, Thou art Fire, Thou art Air, Thou art the Void, Thou art
consciousness itself, Thou art life in this world; Thou art the knowledge
of self, and Thou art the Supreme Divinity." 5 The ancient theory of
the human body's elemental "humors," adopted by the medical profession in the west up to the 1 9th century, was based on Kali's supposed
distribution of elements in living forms. She gave water to create the
blood stream, fire to make its vital heat, earth to produce the solid
parts of the body, and air to animate it with breath.6
This theory was earnestly adopted by western philosophers. Firmicus Maternus said man is a microcosm "under the direction of
Nature ... so that within the small compass of his body he might bestow
under the requirements of Nature the whole energy and substance of
the elements." 7 The same elemental symbols shown in the four hands of Kali
appeared in western iconography also. Kali's bowl of blood signified
water; her scepter or dorje (lightning bolt) was fire; her lotus wheel stood for earth; and her sword was air. The Greeks assigned their
own versions of these symbols to the Goddess Nemesis (Fate): a cup; an
apple-bough or wand; a wheel; and a sword. 8 Later in European history, the same symbols of the elements gave rise to the four suits of
the Tarot deck: (1) cups; (2) wands, rods, or scepters; (3) pentacles, coins, or discs; and (4) swords. These in turn evolved into the modern
hearts, clubs, diamonds, and spades. The two colors now allotted to the four suits of cards echo the very
ancient Tantric concept of two sexes expressing themselves as ele
ments. Female water and earth were paired with male fire and air.
Oriental sages maintained that mantras with a preponderance of fiery
or airy (male) letters are cruel and destructive. Mantras with a prepon
derance of watery or earthy (female) letters are benevolent. 9 Like the
corresponding card suits in red, the life-color, female elements were said
to possess the active, life-giving energy. Greek philosophers later reversed this opinion, calling male elements "active" and female ele
ments "passive." Yet, even in the Christian Middle Ages, an
aphorism purportedly derived from Moses said, "Only Earth and Water
bring forth a living soul." 10
According to Thales of Miletus, water was the Arche, the first of

Elements the elements, having "mastery" over the others because it represented the abyssal womb. 11 The combination of water and fire as
h^^^i^^ female-and-male signified a very ancient theory that blood, the basic
essence of life, was made of sea water infused by magic fire from
heaven, which made it warm and red, though it still tasted like sea water. Vedic sages sometimes called the combination Kali and Agni.
The Goddess, fructified by Agni's fire, become the Ocean of Blood
at the beginning of the world, source of the vitality of all living things until the day of destruction. "Sacred fire" symbolized sexual passion,
its heat engendered by fire-from-heaven gods like Agni, Lucifer, He
phaestus, Syrian Baal, Heracles-Melkart, Thor-Heimdall, etc. The fire god lost his life when he was swallowed up by the all-encompassing
Mother of Waters; sages said he was "quenched in her yoni" like a
lightning bolt quenched in the sea. 12 (See Lightning.) This image led to the Roman belief that the feminine water-element was dangerous to men. 13
Of the other male-female pair, the air-earth combination obviously
represented Father Heaven and Mother Earth, whose separation was
caused by their firstborn son, the god who "divided heaven from earth,"
an Oedipal myth known throughout southeastern Asia, Oceania, and
ancient Mesopotamia. Egyptians assigned a male-and-female pair to each of the primordial elements as they arose from the undifferentiated Abyss, or womb
(Ma-Nu). These eight, together with their Great Mother, made up the first Ennead (Nine Great Deities). 14 Their elemental totems were
associated with the four cardinal points, the four winds, the four sides of
a Holy Mountain (pyramid), the four spirits called Sons of Horus who guarded the corners of a temple. 15 These were like the four Princes
of Heaven revered in China and Japan as guardians of the four
cardinal directions: a blue dragon in the east, a red bird in the south, a
white tiger in the west, a black warrior in the north. Three animal spirits and one human were the same as Egypt's "four powers of Amenti." 16 The same elemental totems gave rise to the four angels
of the Apocalypse and the four evangelists, symbolized in Christian
iconography as a bull (earth), lion (fire), serpent (water), and eagle,
angel, or man (air). American Indians had remarkably similar elemental symbolism.
Villages and camps were divided into four quarters or phratries of fire, air, water, and earth, each with its colors and totems. For example,
the Zunis associated wind with the north, war, and yellow; fire with
the south, summer, tillage, and red; water with the west, spring, peace, and blue; earth with the east, autumn, magic, and white. Aztec
elemental totems were the rabbit (north, black, winter, air); the flint
(south, blue, summer, fire); the house (east, white, autumn, earth);
and the cane (west, red, spring, water). 17 New World mythology postulated four primordial aeons, each corresponding to an element. Sacred histories of Mexico showed that
each of the former ages was brought to destruction by the same element I
274



that ruled it. 18 "Earth, the world support and base, became the Elements
iswallower of things. Air, the breath of life, became a devastating wind.
Fire that descends from heaven tempered as the fire-of-life in ^^__^_^_^_
lifegiving rain came down as a rain of flames. And finally Water, gentle
mothering vehicle of the energies of birth, nourishment, and growth,
became a deluge." 19
These myths provide a clue to the original invention of the elements. Of all substances or forces in the world, why should these
four have been chosen as the basis of all things? The simple answer is
that the elements represented the only four possible ways other than
cannibalism to dispose of a dead body, thus returning it to an "origin."
A body could be buried in the earth, burned with fire, thrown into
water, or given to the birds of the air. Each funerary practice was viewed as a return to the same power that engendered birth.
The same four methods of corpse-disposal are still practiced all
together in Tantric Tibet. Common folk are chopped in pieces and exposed to carrion birds, as are the Parsees of India and Persia. Wealthier Tibetans are cremated, or buried if death was caused by
disease. Sometimes, as among the Hindus, corpses are thrown into I rivers or lakes. 20 Vedic peoples followed both funerary customs of burial
and cremation, maintaining that Yama, Lord of Death, received the soul either way. 21
Some ancient thinkers tried to classify different nations under
elemental categories, possibly on the basis of funeral customs pre
dominating in them. It was said that water-worship belonged to Egypt and the Nilotic Goddess; Phrygians were worshippers of "the earth, which was to them the Great Mother of everything; the Syrians and
Carthaginians of the air, which they adored under the name of
celestial Juno"; and the Persians worshipped fire. 22
A few traditions listed a fifth element that the Greeks called ether,
"heavenly," of which the immortal bodies of gods, angels, star-spirits, or saints were made. It was changeless, having no part in the eternal flux
of other elements constantly combining and re-combining. The idea of changeless ether was so important to western notions of the immortal
soul that it was never abandoned; even today some occultists call it
the substance of the "astral body." In the 18th and 19th centuries,
astronomers believed ether was a gas filling all of outer space.
Etheric spirits were immortal, but the other elements were also
represented by spirits of a superhuman nature; undines (water), salamanders (fire), gnomes (earth), and sylphs (air). Some said these were pre-human races born of the four rivers that flowed from the
Great Mother's belly in the paradisial age. Elemental colors were
associated with these four rivers of feminine nurturing fluids: water,
blood, honey, and milk. Oriental gemsmiths assigned to them the jewels
of mystical significance: sapphire or lapis lazuli (water), ruby (blood
or fire), gold (earth), and silver, crystal, or diamond (air). 2 ' According to biblical symbolism, the female land was made of rivers Milk and
Honey; the male god or ancient Savior contributed blood and water, the

very same fluids that flowed from the body of Jesus in the "land of
milk and honey" (John 19:34). The philosophical sect called Stoics after stoicheia, "the ele
ments" assigned color symbolism, signs of the zodiac, seasons, and deities to the elements. 24 Their system passed into the Roman Circus,
which was divided into four elemental regions with their colors: green
for Spring, Earth, Flowers, Terra Mater, and Venus; red for Summer, Fire, and Mars; blue for Autumn, Water, Heaven, Saturn, and
Neptune; white for Winter, Air, Zephyrs, and Jupiter. 25 The same deities were still connected with the elements in the 16th century
a.d.: Venus (water), Mars (fire), Jove (earth), and Saturn (air). The Compendium MaleEcarum quoted Psellus's list of elemental
spirits in defining various kinds of devils in the Middle Ages. "The
first is the fiery, because these dwell in the upper air and will never
descend .... The second is the aerial, because these dwell in the air
around us. . . . The third is terrestrial . . . some dwell in the fields and
lead night travelers astray; some dwell in hidden places and caverns.
. . . The fourth is the aqueous, for these dwell under the water in rivers
and lakes. . . . They raise storms at sea, sink ships in the ocean, and . . .
are more often women than men." 26 According to Scot, fire-spirits
govern the intellect, water-spirits the instincts and passions: "Fiery
spirits urge men to contemplation, watery spirits to lust." 27 Sexual prejudices entered into these definitions, for the supposed sexual
polarity of fire and water was never forgotten.
The human "temperament" came from Latin temperare, "to mix, to combine"; temperament was a mixture of elemental "humors" or
fluids. These were supposed to be controlled by various gods associated
with the elements. Thus, a character could be Martial, Jovial,
Saturnine, or Mercurial. A predominance of blood gave a sanguine
temperament; of phlegm, a phlegmatic one; of bile, a melancholic one; of ether, an ethereal one; and so on. The temperamental mixture
was also related to tempor, the time or season, for the elements were
categorized also with the four seasons of the year and various configura
tions of the stars. 28 These ideas were old even before Rome was built.
The legendary ancestor of the Scythians was said to have arranged all things in the world under four elemental symbols that came down
from heaven: a plough (earth), a bowl (water), an ax (fire), and a yoke (air, the "yoke" between heaven and earth, related to the word
yoga). 19 In general, the lore of the elements was a prime example of
what may be one of humanity's most characteristic behavior patterns:
classifying.

[Elephant Elephant
A totem of Shiva, who took the form of the elephant and also of the
[god who killed the elephant. After dispatching his victim, Shiva put on ^^^^^^^ the elephant's skin and turned himself elephantine, while "watched
| by the Goddess-spouse." ' In the erotic poem Song of the Cowherd, the i god was incarnated as Krishna and the Goddess-spouse as his sexually
insatiable consort Radha, "She-Elephant." Radha was named for an
elephant because elephants were common symbols of the most
powerful sexual energies. The Kama Sutra designated "elephant men" and "elephant women" those with the largest genitals and most
voracious sexual appetites. Yet Radha was entirely human, described as Woman, "the object of devotion to which even God, the Creator himself, bows down." 2
A male elephant was often given the title of Begetter, or Father, or Grandfather. 3 Buddha was begotten on the virgin Maya by the
elephant god under his title of Ganesha, "Lord of Hosts," most probably derived from the use of elephants in warfare. 4 Every history
student knows North African war leaders considered the magic of
elephants so essential to victory that the Carthaginian general Hannipal insisted on trying to take them over the Alps to attack Rome from
the north a disastrous tactical misjudgment, resulting in the loss of
all his elephants and his war as well.
The elephant-god "Lord of Hosts" had a flourishing worship in North Africa and Egypt, which is why this same title was taken by the
[biblical Yahweh, who was identified with the elephant god at his sacred
pity of Elephantine during the 5th century B.C. 5 Jewish mercenary soldiers stationed there insisted that their god was the same as the
klephant-mate of the Virgin Mother Neith, or Anath: the two of pern were totemized as Cow and Bull Elephant at what was then called
pe source of the Nile. 6 Elephants were worshipped as sexual
pymbolic deities in Egypt from an early date. Totem standards showing
elephants, and artifacts of elephant ivory, appeared in pre-dynastic
(times.
7
Judeo-Christian scholars tended to ignore Yahweh's involvement
In the elephant cult because, as Hooke says, "it is naturally repugnant to most people [i.e., men] to entertain the suggestion that Jahveh could ever have been thought of as possessing a female consort like all the
paals of Canaan"; and for no more reason than this allegedly natural
repugnance, evidence of the sacred marriage at Elephantine was suppressed. Yet the same author admitted that Jahveh was once one of
the very same Baals, and even addressed as Baal in the Bible. 8
A curious parallel to the Flight into Egypt of Yahweh's son is
found in Buddhist iconography. The Virgin Mother was shown
riding a white bull, led by Shiva in the costume of a peasant, holding in
tier arms the elephant-headed Divine Child, the reborn Ganesha.9
Possibly the original Egyptian version of this reborn god entered the
Bible under the name of Behemoth, who became an elephant
lieaded demon in the later mythology of western Europe.

Elias, Saint The elephant still symbolizes the sacred marriage in a Buddhist
Elizabeth, Saint fertility ritual. Monks lead a painted white elephant in solemn
mm^^^ma^^am^m procession, attended by men wearing women's clothes and making
salacious jokes. "Through this ritualistic female disguise they do
honor to the cosmic female principle, the maternal, procreative, feeding energy of nature, and by the ritualistic utterance of licentious lan
guage stimulate the dormant sexual energy of the living power." 10 The
same transvestism and lewd language can be found in fertility rituals
the world over.

Elias, Saint
Canonized form of Helios, the sun god, called El the solar bull
among Semitic peoples. 1 Elias was the god Jesus addressed from the
cross; his hearers said, "This man calleth for Elias ... let us see
whether Elias will come to save him" (Matthew 27:47-49; Mark 1 5:35). Eusebius built upon the name alone a nonsensical Christian
myth, calling Elias one of five Egyptians who were "questioned" at the gate of Caesarea and gave their names and their city, Jerusalem. "The governor ordered them to be tortured to exhort more precise information; but they remained mute and were beheaded." 2
l.Lawson, 44. 2. Artwater, 112.
Elizabeth, Saint
Daughter of a 1 3th-century king of Hungary, Elizabeth was married at the age of 13 to the Landgrave of Thuringia. She was a mother at 14,
a widow at 20, and a corpse at 24, having died of an excess of
Christianity. Her spiritual advisor was Conrad von Marburg, who loved to strip both Elizabeth and her maids and mercilessly whip them for the
slightest infraction of his orders. On one occasion the young Landgra
vine was invited to visit a nunnery and went without asking his
permission. He beat her so severely that "for three weeks the marks of
the cords could be seen upon her." After her husband's death, other
nobles robbed her of her estates and left her destitute; von Marburg ordered her to send away her last few friends and her children. She
said, "I fear a mortal man as much as I should fear the heavenly Judge. Therefore I have given my obedience to Master Conrad . . . that I
might be bereft of every earthly consolation." l
She inflicted further austerities on herself, in addition to the abuse
she received from von Marburg, and soon died of these physical
hardships. Conrad von Marburg pulled political strings to have her
278



canonized, to enhance his own reputation as her teacher. He busied himself in the torture chamber a task plainly suited to his personal
ityand was credited with bringing 8000 heretics to the stake in a
single year. At last he was assassinated by a group of irate knights,
against whom he had preached a crusade. 2 He was promptly canonized as a saint and a martyr. 5

Elohim
Hebrew plural word meaning "the goddesses and the gods," though I every time it appeared in a Bible text it was translated simply "God." In
the original manuscripts of the book of Genesis, Yahweh was only one of the elohim. Sometimes the singular form was taken as a name,
e.g. the Phoenician bull-god called simply El, "the god." l Medieval wizards thought Elohim was one of the magical secret names of God; or, at times, it was taken to be the name of a devil.

Elohim
Elves
Elves
Spenser said the word "elf meant "alive." ' But there is little doubt
that elves were the ancestral dead, still "alive" in their burial mounds; "it is well known that in Scandinavia the dead were formerly called
'elves.' " 2 The Kormaks Saga, pagan Icelandic poem of the 10th
century, described sacrifices to them for curative purposes: "Redden the outside of the mound with bull's blood, and make the elves a feast with the flesh; and you will be healed." 3
The paradise of Alfaheimr (Elf-land) was always matriarchal, inhabited by the bright female spirits who made the sun. Like their
eastern counterparts the dakinis, these Valkyries or fairies could be
both beautiful and hideous, representing both birth and death. 5 In the new creation after doomsday, the new female sun would be Glory-ofElves. 6
Christianity opposed this ancient female-centered theology, as shown by accounts of elf-feasts as demonic sabbats where "cloven
footed dancers" trod their fairy rings. Henry More, 17th century English philosopher and poet, said they often appeared in northern England and in Ireland. 7 Ballads merged the demon lover with the "elf
knight," a wooer from pagan northlands. 8 The custom of the Wild
Hunt or Night Ride, sacred to the elf-king (Odin), was transformed into
a procession of wind-riding demons, as at Halloween and other Ipagan festivals. Leader of the night riders was called the Erl King, from
Danish eherkonge, a king of those who belong to Hel. He associated with the sacred alder tree. 9
The word elf was related to the helleder,
people belonging to Mother Hel as Death
goddess. In general it meant heathen, both
dead and living. Sigvat Thordarson in the 11th century called heathen people
alfar, "elves," who worshipped their deities at feasts called
alfablot (elf-blood) in certain "heathenholy" houses ruled by
279



Elysium Endymion
Other plants often associated with elves were the holly sacred to
Hel, the mistletoe, the mandrake, and various witch-herbs including rosemary, known as the Elfin Plant, 10 named after the Goddess herself.

Elysium
Greek paradise, Persephone's heaven for heroes, also called the Isles of the Blest; located either in the underworld, or in the far west, like the
Hesperian apple-orchards of Mother Hera. Elysium too was an "Apple-land," like Avalon and Eden. 1 It became a common synonym
for "paradise."
1. Graves, CM. 1,123.
var. Emain, Hy-Many Emania
Celtic "Land of the Moon," where the dead went, ruled by the Queen of Shades called Mania, Mana, Macha, Mene, or Minne: the Fairy Queen. Like the Norse heaven Manavegr, it was identified
with the moon-path in the sky, and with earthly shrines, too. Macha's holy city was called Emain Macha. See Moon.
Empyrean
"Heaven of Inner Fire," Greek philosophers' concept of the highest heaven above the planetary spheres, "empire" of the sun god, or the divine king of the celestial mountain. "Inner Fire" probably referred
to the divine element ether, supposed to be the substance of spirits. See Elements; Mountain.
Endymion
"Seduced Moon-man," a Greek hero enchanted into eternal sleep by
the Moon-goddess Selene. He was a God-begotten king of Elis, having
ousted the former king in the usual fashion of ancient heroes. "When his reign ended he was duly sacrificed and awarded a hero shrine at
Olympia." l This was the "sleep put on him" by his Goddess, who nightly kissed him where he lay forever on the mountainside. See
Kingship. 1. Graves, G.M. 1,211.

Eos
Ennead Ennead
The Nine," primal Great Deities of Egypt: a male and female pair or each of the four elements, plus their Mother, the Creatress called bihi^h^bh >Iu, Nut, Ma-Nu, Temu, Maa, or Night, the Abyss, Chaos: the undifferentiated mixture of elements. See Creation; Elements.
Enthusiasm
>eek enthousiasmos, "having a god within," the concept of possesion by a divine spirit. It was a doctrine set forth in Asia as Svecchacara,
reedom from all sinfulness because all actions are motivated by the
inner divinity.

intrails
Courage, in modern slang, is both "guts" and "balls," a combination
f very ancient precedent. It was once thought that male genitals were
rotruding ends of intestines, literally "testes-within." Egyptian sma neant both entrails and male genitals.
1 Egyptians prayed to be delivered m the day of reckoning from a Kali-like death-goddess Baba, who not >nly "devoured" men sexually but also "feeds on the entrails of the
lead." 2
Kali devoured her lover genitally and also devoured his entrails at
fie same time. 5 Similarly, Aphrodite in her Crone form as Andro
ihonos, Man-Slayer, killed her lovers as a queen bee does by ripping ut their intestines along with their genitals.4 In northern Europe
here was the same ceremony: spring was brought to the world by
pibolically ripping out the entrails of Loki via a rope tied around his
enitals. His blood bathed the lap (womb) of the Goddess; then she piled, and the spring could come. 5 See Skadi.
Because men's "guts" were supposed to possess the spirit of the
hallic god, also mythologized as the underground serpent, it was sual to take omens from the entrails of sacrificial victims. Among the
Lmazonian tribes of the Black Sea area, the readers of entrails were
old gray-haired women." 6 The Romans called similar diviners haruspi
(es, "those who gaze into the belly." 7

lomer's "Rosy-fingered Dawn," the same birth-goddess as Mater
latuta, Aurora, or Hebe. Her rosy fingers were usually assumed to
281



Epona represent the pink clouds of sunrise, but the meaning may have been
Erinys more literal, recalling the habit of Egyptian and Asian priestesses of
g^^i^^g,^ staining their fingers red for religious ceremonies. See Henna.
Epona
Celtic-Saxon Horse-goddess of Iron Age Britain, probably modeled on Cretan Leukippe (White Mare), Mare-headed Demeter, and the equine deities of central Asia. The cult of Epona "stretched from
Spain to Eastern Europe and Northern Italy to Britain." ' Irish kings
were still symbolically united with a white mare in the 1 1th century a.d. See Horse.

var. Erebus Erebos
Greco- Roman name for the underworld, land of death, described in
Orphic mystery-religion as "the Abysmal Womb." ' Like other ancient
concepts of "hell," it was a place of regeneration. See Hell.

Eresh-Kigal
Underworld counterpart of the Babylonian Goddess Ishtar; compar
able to Nephthys in Egypt, Persephone in Greece, Kali-Uma in India,
Hel in northern Europe. She was provided with a consort, Nergal, later transformed by Christian mythographers into a demonic official of
hell.

Erinys
"Avenger," title of Mother Demeter as the threefold Furies, who
punished all trespassers against matriarchal law. In her fearsome aveng

Erl King
Danish ellerkonge, "king of elves," associated with the sacred alder or elder tree, and the underground land of the dead. As Lord of Death, he was the consort of Hel, Goddess of the elder trees. 1 He was really a form of Odin, leader of the Wild Hunt composed of ghostly riders on the night wind.

Erl King Essenes
Eros
Bisexual Greek deity of erotic love, identical with Hindu Kama.
Orphics said Eros was the first god to emerge from the womb of the
primal creatress, Mother Night, "of whom even Zeus stands in awe." ' Plato said Eros was the oldest of deities, the most worthy of
honor, the one who gave souls strength to ascend to heaven after
death. 2 In short, Eros was a kind of Savior, before cults of asceticism
began to replace the older worship of sexuality as a primary life-force.

Erua
Babylonian name for the Queen of Heaven, who chose kings and married them, and controlled the function of birth among all creatures
in her land. 1 An alternate title of the Goddess Ishtar, or Inanna.
l.Assyr. & Bab. Lit, 114.
Essenes
Jewish sect of ascetics, based on sun-worshipping Persian anchorites,
who in turn evolved their system from Jain yogis professing to work
miracles by living apart from the world and practicing extreme self
denial. Jesus, John the Baptist, and Simon Magus were said to have been trained in Essenic communities, which formed the bulk of the
first Christians. Epiphanius said, "They who believed on Christ were
called Essenes before they were called Christians." l
An Essenic hierarchy included a chief priest called Christos
(Anointed One), "head of the entire Congregation of Israel." There
were ordinary priests called "sons of Aaron," and another functionary known as the Messiah of Israel. 2 The latter was also called Teacher of
Righteousness. He suffered physical abuse in atonement for the sins of
the entire community, enduring "vindictive sentences of scourging
and the terrors of painful sicknesses, and vengeance on his fleshly
body."' Josephus said the Essenes "reject pleasures as an evil, but esteem

polemics against paganism.
283



Essenes continence, and the conquest over our passions, to be virtue. They neglect wedlock, but choose out other persons' children, while they are
^^^^^^^ pliable, and fit for learning; and esteem them to be of their kindred,
and form them according to their own manners." We are not told
whether these "other persons' children" were abandoned by their
parents, or sold, or given to, or kidnapped by, the Essenes. These harsh anchorites imposed cruel sentences for the least infraction of rules,
partial starvation being the most common punishment. Some suffered
punishments lasting two or more years for wavering from the doctrines of the community. 4
The doctrines were strikingly similar to those of early Christianity.
Essenes anticipated St. Augustine in teaching that immortal souls
belonged in heaven, but were drawn down to earth and entrapped in
corruptible flesh by the "natural enticement" of sex. 5 The soul's
purity might be recovered by ascetic techniques such as mortification of
the flesh, fasting, renunciation of sensual pleasures, and by solitary
meditation in the wilderness, like the voluntary exiles of John and Jesus.
Essenes called themselves Therapeutae, "healers," claiming their
austere lifestyle gave them power to cast out demons of sickness, even
to restore life to the dead; Jesus's raising of Lazarus was a typical Essenic
miracle.6 Much of their training as exorcists consisted of learning lists
of spirits' names, and the holy names that would expel them. Like Jesus in the episode of the Gadarene swine, Essenes always demanded the
demons' names. (See Name.) They were sworn to strictest secrecy regarding the magical names they used in their exorcisms.7
Essenes preached giving away all one's worldly goods upon joining the sect, which meant those who joined gave away everything they owned to their superiors. Dire punishments were meted out to those
who lied about their possessions in order to hold something back for
themselves or their families. 8 An Essenic episode in the Gospels tells of
Ananias and his wife Sapphira, killed by St. Peter for giving the
apostles only a part, but not all, of the money they received for a sale of
land. Peter and his associates were jailed for murder, but later escaped
(Acts 5:2-10, 18). Despite their vows of poverty, the Essenes were strangely obsessed
with visions of wealth and power coming to them after Armageddon, "The War of the Sons of Light with the Sons of Darkness." 9 Sons of
Light of course were the Essenes, and all others outside their brotherhood were Sons of Darkness, otherwise called "men of the Pit." 10 The Essenes believed firmly in the imminence of the Last
Days, when they would be called upon to fight the forces of evil. Their
reward would be to rule the world in an oddly materialistic manner,
as envisioned by their scriptures:
Arise, O Warrior, take thy captives, O glorious man! Seize thy plunder, O doer ofmighty deeds! Lay thy hand on the necks of thy enemies and
thy foot on the heaps of the slain; smite the nations, thy adversaries, and may thy sword devour guilty flesh Let there be a multitude of
284



possessions in thy fields, silver and gold and precious stones in thy palaces. Esther ...Let thy gates be continuously open, that the wealth of the nations may be brought unto thee; and let their kings serve thee, and all the _^^^^__^^___
oppressors bow down to thee and lick the dust of thy feet. "
A large colony of Essenes occupied the Qumran community from 1 10 B.C. to the fall of Jerusalem in 70 a.d. with a significant period
of vacancy during the reign of Herod, 31-4 B.C. In 31 b.c. the site had to be abandoned because a severe earthquake cracked the water
cistern and ruined the buildings. 12
Survivors evidently took the earthquake as a sign of the oncoming Last Days and went forth into the world to preach their message.
Josephus said before 70 a.d. there were many Messiahs and Christs announcing the end of the world. 15 Some were willing to die a
martyr's death, believing this would gain them special privileges in the world of the hereafter. One such martyr may have been John the Baptist, who came from the wilderness to call Herod and his court to
repentance, and remained to serve as a sacred king (see Salome). Early Mandaean Christians said the true prophet was not Jesus but
John the Baptist. They called themselves Christians of St. John, and
also Nasoraje, or "Nazarenes." H One of the colonies of exiled hermits
from Qumran settled around Nazareth and took up the craft of
carpentry; hence the craft-brotherhood of Nazorenes, from najjar, "carpenters," after whom the town may have been named. Some
Christian authorities of the first centuries a.d. wrote that during this
period "all Christians were called Nazorenes." 15 Jesus too was called
a Nazorene. The oldest Gospel called him "Jesus the carpenter" (Mark
6:3).
Oddly, what began in the east as a carpenters' metaphor passed into the Gospels as a masons' metaphor. Essene-like Buddhist her
mits described themselves as logs rejected by the carpenter's craft. 16 The
same words were put into Jesus's mouth, somewhat altered: he called
himself a stone rejected by the masons (Matthew 21:42).

ther
'Star," the Hebrew rendering of Ishtar or Astarte. The biblical Book
of Esther is a secularized Elamite myth of Ishtar (Esther) and her
consort Marduk (Mordecai), who sacrificed the god Hammon, or Amon (Haman). Yahweh was never mentioned, because the Jews of
Elam worshipped Marduk, not Yahweh. (See Purim.) Esther probably was the name given to any priestess chosen to
represent the Goddess on the occasion of the king's sacred marriage.

Ethan Even the Bible story admits that Esther-Ishtar was not the real name of
Euphemia, Saint the Elamite-Jewish queen. Her real name was Hadassah (Esther 2:7).
Ethan
Biblical sage almost as wise as Solomon (1 Kings 4:31). His origin
was not really biblical. He was the Sumerian god-king Etana, called
Eytan in the land of Canaan. He ascended to heaven on eagle-back, like Ganymede, to reach the Goddess and learn the secret of eternal life. He came down again to earth, some said thrown down by the jealous sun god for his hubris. 1 Evidently he returned to earth to be reincarnat
ed in the next king. (See Kingship.)

Eugenia, Saint
"Healer" or "Health," a title of the Goddess converted into a
fictitious "virgin martyr." Her legend claimed she was one of the
women who entered a Christian sect by "turning herself into a man," for some sects would not admit women unless they did this. 1 St.
Eugenia accordingly became a monk and called herself Brother Eugenius. The same story told of all she-monks was told of her: she was
falsely accused of rape and condemned to a life of expiation, which she patiently endured. Still, the healing miracles attributed to her shrines
were older than her Christian legend, showing that she was really the
Goddess whose "eugenic" springs were even more popular in the 1st century than Lourdes or Compostela in the 20th. 2

"Order," the first of Aphrodite's three Horae; one of the names of
the Triple Goddess's virgin aspect as the Creatress who first brought order out of chaos. See Creation; Diakosmos.
Euphemia, Saint
"Good-speaker," a fictitious Christian saint based on a title of the
Goddess as the Muse of mellifluous speech. St. Euphemia's legend
286



shows that she was not a human being but a statue. She stood aloft on
a high place, and could not be reached except with ladders; those who climbed up to pull her down were afraid, because the first of their
number had been stricken with paralysis upon touching her and was
borne away half dead. 1 That is, she was a holy image protected by so
stern a taboo that even early Christians feared to violate it.

Europa Eurynome
Europa
"Full Moon," the Great Goddess as mother of the entire continent. She was embodied in the same white Moon-cow as Hathor, Hera, Io,
and Kali who "rode" Shiva in the guise of the white bull Nandi,
just as Europa rode Zeus disguised as a white bull. 1 Her Hellenic legend
said Zeus kidnapped and raped her; but it was "deduced from pre
Hellenic pictures of the Moon-priestess triumphantly riding on the Sun-bull, her victim." 2 Garlanded white bulls were sacrificed to the
lunar cow-goddess in Crete and Mycenae from a very early date. According to Pausanias, Europa was a surname of the ancient
Mycenaean goddess, Demeter.*

Eurydice
"Universal Dike," Mother of Fate, the Orphic name for the under
world Goddess who received the soul of Orpheus. Hellenic writers
converted her into Orpheus's wife, sent by a serpent's bite to the land
if death, where he followed her; but this was an artificial myth of very
ate origin. The icons from which came the apocryphal story of
Eurydice's death seem to have represented Orpheus entering the
anderworld, to be greeted by Hecate with her serpents. Eurydice's 'snake in the grass" was her sacred animal, constant companion of the jnderworld Goddess. 1
Medieval poets knew the same classic Goddess as a queen of
England, "Heurodis," whose consort was a god-begotten king of Winchester, "Sir Orfeo." 2

'Universal One," the Pelasgian Creatress who danced alone on the mmordial ocean of Chaos until she brought the elements to "order'
themis, another of her names). Like Isis and Eve, she created the
feat Serpent, a disembodied phallus, to be her first consort. She
>ermitted him to fertilize her womb, but then he began to call
limself the Creator of everything. Angered by his arrogance, she

Eve bruised his head with her heel and cast him down to the underworld. 1
Christian Gnostics told much the same story of the Mother of
Creation, whom they called Sophia, and her first consort Jehovah, who was able to help in the work of creation only because she "infused
him with energy" and implanted in him her own ideas. He too
became too arrogant and had to be punished for forgetting his Mother. 2 See Eve. Like many titles of the Great Goddess, Eurynome was both diabolized and masculinized by later Christian writers, who consigned her to hell and made her a male "demon Eurynome," sometimes
described as a Prince of Death. 3
1. Graves, CM. 1,27. 2. Pagels, 57-58. 3.deGivry, B2, 141.
One of her Tantric names was Adita Eva: "the Very Beginning." 2 In northern Babylonia, Eve was known as "the divine Lady of Eden," or "Goddess of the Tree of Life." 3

Lady Eve," after whom
their capital city was named.
Eve
The biblical title of Eve, "Mother of All Living," was a translation of
Kali Ma's title Jaganmata. She was also known in India as Jiva or leva,
the Creatress of all manifested forms. 1 In Assyrian scriptures she was entitled Mother-Womb, Creatress of Destiny, who made male and
female human beings out of clay, "in pairs she completed them."4
The first of the Bible's two creation myths gives this Assyrian version,
significantly changing "she" to "he" (Genesis 1:27).
The original Eve had no spouse except the serpent, a living phallus she created for her own sexual pleasure. 5 Some ancient
peoples regarded the Goddess and her serpent as their first parents. 6 Sacred icons showed the Goddess giving life to a man, while her serpent coiled around the apple tree behind her. 7 Deliberate misinter
pretation of such icons produced ideas for revised creation myths like
the one in Genesis. Some Jewish traditions of the first century B.C.,
however, identified Jehovah with the serpent deity who accompanied the Mother in her garden. 8 Sometimes she was Eve, sometimes her
name was given as Nahemah, Naama, or Namrael, who gave birth to Eve and Adam without the help of any male, even the serpent.9
Because Jehovah arrogantly pretended to be the sole Creator, Eve I
was obliged to punish him, according to Gnostic scriptures. Though
the Mother of All Living existed before everything, the God forgot she
j
had made him and had given him some of her creative power. "He was even ignorant of his own Mother. ... It was because he was foolish
and ignorant of his Mother that he said, 'I am God; there is none beside me.'" Gnostic texts often show the creator reprimanded and
punished for his arrogance by a feminine power greater and older than himself. 10
The secret of God's "Name of power," the Tetragrammaton, was that three-quarters of it invoked not God, but Eve. YHWH, yodhe-vau-he, came from the Hebrew root HWH, meaning both "life" and "woman" in Latin letters, E-V-E. 16 With the addition of an I
288



(yod), it amounted to the Goddess's invocation of her own name as the
Word of creation, a common idea in Egypt and other ancient lands. 17
Gnostic scriptures said Adam was created by the power of Eve's
word, not God's. She said, "Adam, live! Rise up upon the earth!" As soon as she spoke the word, her word became reality. Adam rose up and
opened his eyes. "When he saw her, he said, 'You will be called "the mother of the living," because you are the one who gave me life.'" 18 Adam's name meant he was formed of clay moistened with blood,
the female magic oiadamah or "bloody clay." 19 He didn't produce
the Mother of All Living from his rib; in earlier Mesopotamian stories,
he was produced from hers. (See Birth-giving, Male.) His Babylonian predecessor Adapa (or Adamu) was deprived of eternal life not by the Goddess, but by a hostile God.
The biblical idea was a reversal of older myths in which the
Goddess brought forth a primal male ancestor, then made him her
mate the ubiquitous, archetypal divine-incest relationship traceable in every mythology. The reversal was not even original with biblical
authors. It was evolved by Aryan patriarchs who called Brahma the
primal male ancestor. They claimed their god brought forth the
Mother of All Living from his own body, then mated with her, so she
gave birth to the rest of the universe. 20 In the Hebraic version, a
wombless God made his offspring with his hands, and the actual birth
giving was left to Adam. The Bible as revised by patriarchal scribes
said nothing about a divine birth-giving, since the scribes were deter
ined to separate the concepts of "deity" and "mother" insofar as
possible. Gnostic scriptures however reverted to the older tradition and
said Eve not only created Adam and obtained his admission to heaven;
she was the very soul within him, as Shakti was the soul of every
Hindu god and yogi. Adam couldn't live without "power from the
Mother," so she descended to earth as "the Good Spirit, the
Thought of Light called by him 'Life' (Hawwa)." She entered into
Adam as his guiding spirit of conscience: "It is she who works at the
creature, exerts herself on him, sets him in his own perfect temple,
nlightens him on the origin of his deficiency, and shows him his
(way of) ascent." Through her, Adam was able to rise above the
gnorance imposed on him by the male God. 21 By this Gnostic route came the Midrashic assertion that Adam and
Sve were originally androgynous, like Shiva and his Shakti. She dwelt
n him, and he in her; they were two souls united in one body, which
3od later tore apart, depriving them of their bliss of union. Cabalists
ook up the idea and said the paradise of Eden can be regained only rvhen the two sexes are once more united; even God must be united
vith his female counterpart, the heavenly Eve called Shekina. 22
Another Gnostic version of the story made God a true villain, who ursed Adam and Eve and expelled them from paradise out of
ealousy of their happiness. He also lusted after the Virgin Eve, raped ler, and begot her sons Jahveh and Elohim, whose other names were
Eve
Eve was one of the common MiddleEastern names of the superior feminine power. To the Hittites, she was Hawwah, "Life." 11
To the Persians, she was Hvov, "the Earth." 12 Aramaeans called her Hawah, "Mother of All
Living." 13 In Anatolia she was Hebat or Hepat, with a Greek derivative Hebe,
"Virgin Mother Earth," with the same
relationship to the Great Goddess Hera as
Kore-Persephone to Demeter, and Hebe may have been an eponymous ancestress
of "Hebrews." A Semitic root of her names was hayy, a matrilineal kinship
group, once considered the "life" of every tribe by direct descent from the
Creatress. H The names of Eve, the Serpent, and "Life" are still derived from the same root in Arabic. 15
289



Eve
St. John Chrysostom, "Golden-mouthed John," 4th-century
Christian orator who served as Patriarch of
Constantinople until he incurred the wrath of the empress Eudoxia,
who arranged to have him deposed and exiled.
Tertullian (Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus) Influential early Christian writer and father of the church, ca. 155-220 a.d., born in Car
thage of pagan parents.
Cain and Abel. Here was one of several myths that made Eve the
mother not only of Adam, but also of Jehovah, and of all the
elements as well. The myth went on to say the first of Eve's offspring ruled the male elements of fire and air; the second ruled the female
elements of earth and water. 23
Like her prototype Kali Jaganmata, Eve brought forth death as
well as life that is, she brought forth all living forms, all of which
were subject to death for the very reason that they were alive. Under
patriarchal systems of belief, the fact that every living thing is doomed to die was blamed on the Mother who gave it a finite life. Instead of
blaming God for casting Adam out of the paradise where he might have lived forever, the patriarchs blamed Eve for bringing this about.
The Wisdom of Jesus ben Sirach said evil began with Woman (Eve): "because of her we all die." 24 Fathers of the Christian church said Eve
conceived by the serpent and brought forth Death. The seeds of all
women already existed in Eve, St. John Chrysostom maintained, so that in her sin "the whole female race transgressed." 25 The Book of Enoch said God created death to punish all humanity for Eve's sin, but many patriarchal thinkers hesitated to blame God
even indirectly. The prevalent opinion was that when Eve disobeyed the deity, death somehow just happened. 26 St. Paul blamed only Eve, absolving Adam from guilt for the apple-eating incident: "Adam was not
deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression" (1 Timothy 2:14). A church council announced in 418 a.d. that it was
heresy to say death was a natural necessity rather than the result of
Eve's disobedience. 27 This was the real origin of the church fathers' fear and hatred of
women, which expanded into a sexist attitude that permeated all of
western society: Woman was identified with Death. Her countervailing
responsibility for birth was taken away, and the creation of life was
laid to the credit of the Father-god, whose priests claimed he could remove the curse of death. As every woman was understood to be an
emanation of Eve, Tertullian said to Everywoman:
And do you not know that you are an Eve? The sentence of God on this
sex ofyours lives in this age; the guilt must ofnecessity live too. You
are the devil's gateway . . . the first deserter ofthe divine law; you are she who persuaded him whom the devil was not valiant enough to attack. You destroyed so easily God's image, man. On account ofyour desert |
that is, death, even the Son of God had to die. 28
Medieval theologians said Adam was forgiven. Christ descended
into hell and rescued Adam along with other biblical patriarchs. He
escorted Adam into heaven, saying, "Peace be to thee and to all the
just among thy sons." 29 But for Eve there was no forgiveness. No peace
was offered to her or her daughters. Presumably, they were left behind in hell. Christian theologians espoused the same theory as
Persian patriarchs, that heaven was closed to all women except those
who were submissive and worshipped their husbands as gods. 30 Even
290



modern theologians naively blame human death on the Edenic sin. Rahner said, "Man's death is the demonstration of the fact that he has
fallen away from God Death is guilt made visible." 51 Theolo
gians have not yet dealt with the question of what "guilt" causes death among non-human creatures.
Actually, churches depend for their very existence on the orthodox myth of Eve. "Take the snake, the fruit-tree, and the woman from
the tableau, and we have no fall, no frowning Judge, no Inferno, no
everlasting punishment hence no need of a Savior. Thus the bottom falls out of the whole Christian theology." 32
Equally destructive to Christian theology would be restoration of
books arbitrarily excluded from the canon, such as the Apocalypse of Adam, in which Adam stated that he and Eve were created together but
she was his superior. She brought with her "a glory which she had seen in the aeon from which we had come forth. She taught me a word
of knowledge. . . . And we resembled the great eternal angels, for we were higher than the God who had created us."" Some of these once-sacred books made Eve superior to both Adam
and the creator. It was she, not God, who gave Adam his soul and
brought him to life. It was she, not God, who cast down the evil deities from heaven and made them demons. And she, as the eternal female
Power, would eventually judge the God she created, find him guilty of
injustice, and destroy him. 34 As an allegory, this might reflect a social truth. Fragile constructs
of the collective mind, gods are easily destroyed by those who ignore them. Early Gnostic documents show that most women of the ancient world were disposed to ignore the God who was said to have cursed
their sex and their descendants forever. Had one of the other versions of
the Eve myth prevailed over the canonical version, sexual behavior
patterns in western civilization almost certainly would have evolved
along very different lines. Christianity managed to project man's fear of death onto woman, not to respect her as Kali the Destroyer was
respected, but to hate her. The uncanonical scriptures were no more and no less creditable
than the canonical ones. Their picture of Eve as God's stern mother,
he defender of mankind against a tyrannical demon-deity, had more adherents in the early Christian centuries than the picture that is now
amiliar. One of Christianity's best-kept secrets was that the Mother of
Ml Living was the Creatress who chastised God.

Evolution
Origen (Origenes Adamantius) Christian father, ca. 185-254
a.d., an Egyptian who wrote in Greek,
exerting a powerful influence on the early Greek church. At first he was accounted a saint, but three centuries after his death he was declared a heretic because of Gnostic elements found in
his writings.
Evolution
The theory of species development given to the world by Darwin and
his successors had no special religious significance, except that Christian authorities viewed it as a contradiction of their all-important Eden
myth, just as Galileo's astronomical discoveries contradicted the Bible's
geocentric cosmos. The theory of evolution showed man could not have "fallen"; there was no original sin and therefore no need of
salvation.
In 1869 a German theologian, Dr. Schund, said, "If Darwin be
right in his view of the development of man out of a brutal condition, then the Bible teaching in regard to man is utterly annihilated." The
American Episcopal Church said: "If this hypothesis be true, then is the Bible an unbearable fiction . . . then have Christians for nearly two
thousand years been duped by a monstrous lie. . . . Darwin requires
us to disbelieve the authoritative word of the Creator." Another theo
logical heavyweight declared: "If the Darwinian theory is true, Genesis is a lie, the whole framework of the book of life falls to pieces,
and the revelation of God to man, as we Christians know it, is a
delusion and a snare." '
These gentlemen were right. The theory of evolution does indeed
contradict the biblical creation myths and the dogma of the Fall. As
the evidence in favor of evolution continued to pile up, fundamentalist
churches desperately sought ways to ignore it, or else reconcile the
irreconcilable. Pope Paul IV spoke on the subject of evolution in 1966:
Such explanations do not agree with the teaching ofSacred Scripture, Sacred Tradition, and the Church 's magisterium, according to which the sin ofthe first man is transmitted to all his descendants not through
imitation but through propagation. . . . The theory ofevolution will not seem acceptable to you whenever it is not decisively in accord with the immediate creation ofeach and every human soul by God, and
whenever it does not regard as decisively important for the fate of mankind the disobedience ofAdam, the universal first parent. 2
Since the theory of evolution can never be "decisively in
accord" with the orthodox view, it can never be accepted by the "infallible" church. The orthodox view has remained on the 17th
century level of Father Mersenne who "expressed the opinion of the
most enlightened theologians when he declared that orthodoxy did not fear either science or reason, and was quite prepared to accept all
their conclusions, 'provided they agreed with the Scriptures.'" 3 Seventeen hundred years ago, Origen wrote of the Garden of
Eden myth: "No one would be so foolish as take this allegory as a
description of actual fact." 4 But Origen was excommunicated, and countless millions have been precisely that foolish.

Exorcism Exorcism
The time-honored custom of ordering demons away, by verbal
charms and magical gestures, is still practiced by ( 1 ) primitive witch naHHHi^ doctors, and (2) the Catholic church. Protestant churches don't
exorcise. As far back as 1603 the Church of England forbade ministers
to cast out devils, though a present-day Archbishop of Canterbury publicly confessed a belief in "genuine demonic possession" in 1974. 1 The Roman church maintains the office of exorcist, whose rite of
ordination states: "An Exorcist must cast out devils." 2 The Official New
Catholic Encyclopedia says, "Today the Church maintains its tradi
tional attitude toward exorcism. It recognizes the possibility of diabolical
possession, and it regulates the manner of dealing with it.
... A solemn method of exorcising is given in the Roman Ritual." 3 This "solemn method" is based on name magic and words of
power, like exorcisms used by Egyptian wizards thousands of years ago. It says in part: "I command thee, whosoever thou art, thou unclean
spirit, and all thy companions possessing this servant of God, that by the Mysteries of the Incarnation, Passion, Resurrection and Ascension
of our Lord Jesus Christ, by the sending of the Holy Ghost, and by the Coming of the same our Lord to judgment, thou tell me thy name,
the day, and the hour of thy going out, by some sign; and, that to me, a minister of God, although unworthy, thou be wholly obedient in all
things." Exorcistic power of chastity is invoked: "The continence of the Confessors commands thee." Inanimate objects can be exorcised in
the same manner, as in the consecration of medals: "I exorcise ye,
medals, through God the Father Almighty. . . . May the power of the
adversary, all the host of the Devil, all evil attack, every spirit and
glamour of Satan, be utterly put to flight and driven far away by the virtue of these medals." 4
The history of exorcism often demonstrates legalistic-theological
buffoonery at its silliest, as in the many instances of insect pests and
other vermin verbally assaulted by the exorcist, though paying no discernible attention to the anathemas that threatened them. In 1478
the authorities of Berne addressed a plague of crop-eating insects, "I
declare and affirm that you are banned and exorcised, and through
the power of Almighty God shall be called accursed and shall daily
decrease." The insects, however, only continued to increase. In 1516
the Provost of Troyes commanded all caterpillars to "retire within six
days from the vineyards and lands of Villenose, threatening them with his solemn curse and malediction if they failed to obey." The
caterpillars apparently weren't listening. From the 16th century onwards, it was a Savoyard custom to excommunicate destructive
insects, even though they seemed not to care about being banned
from God's congregation. In 1633 the consuls of Strambino summoned
the caterpillars "to appear before the bench of reason to show cause
293



Eye why they should not desist from corroding and destroying, under penalty of banishment from the place and confiscation." In 1713 the
Friars Minor in Piedade no Maranho, Brazil, claimed that their exor
cism of ants worked, and "by God's express order the ants departed to another place." 5
In a process against leeches, which was tried at Lausanne in 1451, a number ofleeches were brought into court to hear the notice served against them, which admonished all leeches to leave the district within
three days. The leeches, however, proving contumacious and refusing to quit the country, they were solemnly exorcised. . . . The doctors of
Heidelberg in particular, then a famous seat oflearning, not only expressed their entire and unanimous approbation ofthe exorcism, but imposed
silence on all impertinent meddlers who presumed to speak against it. 6
When used against human beings, the process of exorcism proved rather more baneful than absurd, tending to exacerbate the very
symptoms it was supposed to relieve. Justification is still being sought for this relic of primitive superstition, because the office exists and a
reason must be given for it. But nowadays, "demonic possession" is
usually treated by psychiatric therapists, not religious ones. (See
Possession.) 1. Robbins, 243; Ebon, ST., 193. 2. Summers, H.W.D. 208. 3. Patai, 139. 4. Summers, H.W.D., 212-13,216, 223. 5. Frazer, F.O.T., 408-11. 6. Fra/.er, F.O.T., 408.
Ayin was the "eye" in the Hebrew sacred
alphabet, possibly derived from Aya, the
Babylonian Creatress. 5 Islamic Arabs diabolized her and corrupted her name
into Ayin, spirit of the evil eye. Moslem Syrians called her
Aina Bisha, the eyewitch.
Eye
The All-Seeing Eye of ancient Egypt once belonged to the Goddess
of truth and judgment, Maat. 1 The Mother-syllable Maa meant "to
see"; in hieroglyphics it was an eye. 2 A late text transferred the All-Seeing Eye to a male god, Horus, and the common symbol came to be known as the Eye of Horus, also
representing the phallus as the "One-Eyed God." Yet the same Eye
was incongruously described as a female judge: "I am the all-seeing
Eye of Horus, whose appearance strikes terror, Lady of Slaughter, Mighty One." 3 The Eye whose appearance strikes terror was the
original prototype of the evil eye which, like the petrifying glance of Medusa, was usually associated with women and was feared by
simple folk everywhere, up to the present day. Staring idols of the Neolithic "Eye Goddess" have been found
throughout Mesopotamia. In Syria she was known as the Goddess Mari, whose huge eyes searched men's souls.4
Like Moslems, Christians diabolized the female spirit of the AllSeeing Eye. Old women were credited with the ancient Goddess's
power to "overlook" to curse someone with a glance. Judges of the
Inquisition so greatly feared the evil eyes of their victims that they
forced accused witches to enter the court backward, to deprive them of
the advantage of a first glance.6
294



Oddly enough, remedies for the evil eye were often female Eye
symbols. Necklaces of cowrie shells, those ubiquitous yonic symbols, were and are valued in India as charms against the evil eye. The triangle ^^^^^^^^^^_
or Yoni Yantra, representing the vulva, is similarly used in India, Greece, and the Balkans. Northern Indian farmers protect crops from
the evil eye by hanging Kali's symbol of a black pot in the field. In
18th-century England, the classic witch's familiar, a black cat, was supposed to afford protection; and sore eyes could be cured by rubbing with a black cat's tail. 7 In addition there were many signs,
gestures, and other kinds of counter-spells to be used as instant remedies if one suspected having been "overlooked."
It seems men were very much averse to meeting a direct glance
from a woman. In the most patriarchal societies, from medieval Japan
to Europe, it was customary to insist that "proper" women keep their
eyelids lowered in the presence of men. In 19th-century Islamic Iran, it was believed that every woman above the age of menopause possessed
the evil eye. Old women were not permitted in crowds attending
public appearances of the Shah, lest his sacred person be exposed to an old woman's dangerous look. 8
Any person invested with spiritual powers, however, could be credited with the power to curse with a look. Several popes were
reputed to be bearers of the evil eye ox jettatura. Pope Pius IX (d. 1878) was a famous jettatore. Pope Leo XIII, his successor, was said to have the evil eye because so many cardinals died during his reign.9

Fairies
The Irish called the
fairies' land Tir-nan-og, Land of EverYouthful Ones; or Tir-nam-beo, Land of the Ever-Living; or Tir-Tairngiri, Land of Promise; or Tir-naSorcha, Land of Light; or Mag Mell, Plain of Pleasures; or Mag Mon, Plain of
Sports; or I-Bresail, IBrazil, or Hy-Brasil, the Land of Bresal, which gave rise to the name of Brazil. 7 Fairyland was also the
magic "apple-land" of Avalon, or the Fortunate Isles, or
Elf-land, Elphame, Alfheim, or Elvenhome. Sometimes it was the "never
never" land, perhaps after an Egyptian word for paradise, nefemefer, "doubly beautiful." The Faroe Islands were once
"fairyland" (medieval Norse Faeroisland) because the original
explorers reached them by sailing west and believed them to be the islands of the dead. 8
Fairies
Pagan gods and goddesses, tribal ancestors, and those who worshipped them all became "fairies" in the traditions of France, Germany,
and the British Isles. The Irish still say fairies live in the pagan sidh
(burial mounds and barrow graves), several hundred of which still stand
in the Irish countryside. 1 The Welsh knew their ancestors had a
matriarchal society. Like the Irish, they called fairies The Mothers, or
The Mother's Blessing; and fairyland was always the Land of Women. 2
Fairies came out of their fairy hills at Halloween, Celtic folk said, because the hills themselves were tomb-wombs of rebirth according
to the ancient belief, and Halloween was only a new name for Samhain, when the dead returned to earth with the help of the priestesses
who, under Christianity, were newly described as witches. 3 Respect for
the pagan dead endured to a remarkably late date, even among Christians whose church taught them that the old deities were devils.
Cornish miners refused to make the sign of the cross when down in a
mine, for fear of offending the fairies in their own subterranean territory
by making a gesture that invoked their enemy.4 In the Book ofthe Dun Cow, the fairy queen described her realm
as "the land of the ever-living, a place where there is neither death,
nor sin, nor transgression. We have continual feasts: we practice every benevolent work without contention. We dwell in a large Shee
(sidh); and hence we are called the people of the Fairy-Mound." 5
The pagan after-world was a golden "dream time" of long ago, when heroes were deified by sacred marriage with the Goddess. The
Great God Lug, father of Ireland's dying savior Cu Chulainn, came "out of the chambered undergrounds of Tara where dwell the fourth
race of gods who settled Ireland. They are the glorious and golden
giants, Tuatha De Danann. These people of the goddess Dana first
used gold and silver in an Age of Bronze. They first cleared the land,
first drained the swamps. They built the great temples of stone like
the one they sent to Britain Stonehenge. When conquered, they retired to their underground barrows or Sidhe where they still live
today." 6 Fairy mounds were entrances to the pagan paradise, which might
be located underground, or under water, or under hills on distant
islands across the western sea where the sun died.
The fairy queen was obviously the ancient fertility-mother, like Demeter or Ceres. William of Auvergne said in the 1 3th century she was called Abundia, or Dame Abonde: "Abundance." 9 She was also
called Diana, Venus, Hecate, Sybil, or Titania a title of Cretan
Rhea as ruler of the earth-spirits called Titans, predecessors of the
Olympian gods. (See Titania.) She had all three personae of the
Triple Goddess, including the death-dealing Crone which is why an Irish title Bean-Sidhe, "Woman of the Fairy-Mounds," was corrupted into banshee, the shrieking demoness whose voice brought death. In
298



the form of the triple Morrigan, she sang of blood sacrifices related to
springtime renewal of vegetation. 10 A variation on her title was the notorious Morgan le Fay or Morgan the Fairy, also known as the
death-goddess, "Morgue la faye." n The Romance ofLancelot du Lac spoke of the fairy queen in another incarnation as Lady of the Lake: "The damsel who carried
Lancelot to the lake was a fay, and in those times all those women were called fays who had to do with enchantments and charms and there
were many of them then, principally in Great Britain and knew the power and virtues of words, of stones, and of herbs." Their knights were forbidden to speak their names, for fear of betraying them to
Christian persecutors. 12
Secrecy attended many aspects of the fairy-religion, for the very reason that it was carried on clandestinely under a dominant religious
system that threatened its practitioners with torture and death. One of
the charges that sent Joan of Arc to the stake was that she "adored the
Fairies and did them reverence." n
A legend repeated by the gypsies said if a man found the statue of a
naked fate (fairy) in the ruins of pagan temples or tombs, he should
embrace it with love and eject semen on it. Then, like Pygmalion's
Galatea, the fate would come to life in his dreams and tell her lover
where to find buried treasure, and she would become his "fortune." He
would be happy with her forevermore, provided he agreed never to set foot in a Christian church again as long as he lived. 14
This idea of the fairy-fortune might be traced all the way back to
ancient customs of matrilineal inheritance and matrilocal marriage,
characteristic both of Bronze Age myths and of fairy tales. The fairy-tale
hero rarely brought a bride to his own home; instead, he left home to
seek his "fortune," which usually turned out to be a foreign princess won by trial and wedded in her own country, which the hero
afterward helped rule. As in the pre-patriarchal system, a woman was :he "fortune" or "fate" of the young man, words which also meant
'fairy," through such intermediates as Fata, Fay, Le Fee, or the "fey" :>ne. Fairy and Fate were further related through fear and fair:
nedieval Latin fatare, "to enchant," became French faerox feer. 15
Many believed fairies lived in the deep woods where their sacred
jroves had been hidden from priestly interference. Romanians still
.peak of the Fata Padourii, Girl of the Woods, a fairy similar to the Irish
)anshee. At night she makes eerie sounds that portend death to the
|
learer. 16 In Brittany, where there were many groves dedicated to the
VIoon-goddess throughout the middle ages, fairies were sometimes
called man-devent, "Moon-goddesses." 17
It seems the fairy-religion was practiced secretly through most of he Christian era, especially by women, whose Goddess the patriar
chal church kept trying to take away, giving them no substitute but
Mary, who lacked the old Goddess's powers. Certain French leaders of the Old Religion were described as
Fairies

ladies showed them
indistinguishable from either Goddesses
or witches, for they had names of both, including the titles of
Fata, Maga, Incantatrice, or wisewoman. They were Oriana, She of the Mountain; Silvana or Silvanella, She of the Wood; Filidea, She

Goddess; Mirinda, the Warrior Woman; Argea, called Queen of Fate; Lucina, called the Lady of the Lake; Urganda, called the Wise One; two Fates or Fays named
Dragontina and Montana, and Morgana with her three
"daughters," the Morrigan. 21
Torquato Tasso (1554-1595) Italian poet and dramatist, whose checkered career included periods of residence in courts,
convents, and prisons. His major work was an epic on the
conquest of Jerusalem.
Aucassin and Nicolette French medieval romance based on an Arabian love story. Aucassin 's original name was AlKasim.
"great princesses who, having refused to embrace Christianity . . . were struck by the curse of God. Hence it is that they are said to be ani
mated by a violent hatred of [Christian] religion and of the clergy."
Sometimes they were called Korrigen, Korrig, or Korr, perhaps devotees of the Virgin Kore. A Breton lay said: "There are nine Korrigen,
who dance, with flowers in their hair, and robes of white wool, around
the fountain, by the light of the full moon." They seem to have been old women who used masks or makeup: "Seen at night, or in the dusk
of the evening, their beauty is great; but in the daylight their eyes appear red, their hair white, and their faces wrinkled; hence they rarely let themselves be seen by day." 18
As late as the 17th century it was said there were shrines kept by "a
thousand old women" who taught the rites of Venus to young
maidens, and instructed them in fairy feats like shape-shifting and raising storms. 19 They were known as fatuae or fatidicae, "seeresses," or
sometimes bonnes HUes, "good girls." 20
Norwegian, Scottish, and Irish Christians claimed the fairies were
offspring of the fallen angels. Like the non-fallen angels, they carried
off souls of the dead. Any who happened to die at twilight, the fairies' hour between day and night, would find themselves in fairyland between life and death, or between heaven and hell. 22 Such legends
reflect ancient views of the after-world as without either punishment
or reward but only a way-station in the karmic cycle, which is why fairies
were like the un-dead able to emerge from their tombs at will. As
psychopomps, they were the same as Valkyries or Hindu apsaras, the heavenly nymphs who became penis, "fairies," in Middle-Eastern countries where the Old Religion was also maintained as a sub-current
in patriarchal culture.
Certainly one of the strongest attractions of the fairy-religion was its permissive view of sexuality, typical of ancient matriarchal societ
ies, living on in contrast to the harsh anti-sexual attitudes of orthodoxy.
Fairyland was the heaven of sexy angels, as opposed to the Christian
heaven where "bliss" was specifically not sexual, not even in matrimony
(Matthew 22:30). The fairyland called Torelore in the romance of
Aucassin and Nicolette was a home for lovers, as opposed to the Christian heaven of "old priests, and halt old men and maimed." The
fairy king lay in bed pretending to give birth to a child, in the ancient rite
of couvade (see Fatherhood); the queen led an army against their enemies in a bloodless battle, the combatants pelting each other with
symbolic foods such as apples, eggs, and cheeses. The king said, "it is
nowise our custom to slay each other." 23 (See Paradise.)
Toward this paradise the Fairy Queen led her lovers on a "broad,
broad road across the lily lea," as Thomas Rhymer's ballad said, which some called the road to heaven, and others the road to hell: a
prototype of the famous Primrose Path. The Queen herself was
addressed as Queen of Heaven. 24 Sometimes her earthly angels were
more spirit than mortal, like the fairies called Little Wood Women

came a popular patroness of romance. English girls used to pray for vision of their future husbands, addressing St. Faith after passing a
)iece of bread three times through a wedding ring. 4

Fata Scribunda Fata Scribunda Fates
"The Fate Who Writes," Roman title of the Goddess who inscribed
each infant's future destiny in her Book of Life shortly after birth. 1
Writing was an attribute of women or Goddesses in the oldest
traditions.
l.Gaster,764.
Fates
Nearly all mythologies bear traces of the Triple Goddess as three
Fates, rulers of the past, present, and future in the usual personae of
Virgin, Mother, and Crone (or Creator, Preserver, Destroyer). The female trinity assumed many different guises in western religion: the
Norns or Weird Sisters of the north (from wyrdf "fate"), the Zorya of
the Slavs, the Morrigan of the Irish, the triple Guinevere or triple Brigi of the Britons.
In Greek myth the three Fates were Horae, Graeae, Muses,
Gorgons, Furies, and other trinities as well as the principal trinity of Moerae or Fates. Nearly always, they were weavers. In Anglo-Saxon literature, fate is "woven." Latin destino (destiny) means that which
is woven, or fixed with cords and threads; fate is "bound" to happen,
just as the spells of fairy-women were "binding." ' The Moerae were Clotho the Spinner, Lachesis the Measurer,
and Atropos the Cutter of life's thread. All were aspects of the archaic
Triple Aphrodite, of whom it was said her real name was Moera, and she was older than Time. 2 Moera was actually a late name for the
Fate-goddess. In the Mycenaean period it meant a landholding, possessed by a female property owner according to the old matriarchal
system. Hence, Moera was a lot: later, "allotted Fate." 3
Aphrodite's trinity was sometimes divided into three Horae, or
celestial nymphs: Eunomia, Dike, and Irene, meaning Order, Destiny, and Peace. These referred to the "ordering" of elements to form tr
individual; the destiny established for him by the Mother; and the
"peace" of dissolution as decreed at the end of life by Aphrodite Columba, the Dove of Peace. 4
If the weaving Fates could be induced not to cut the thread of life
at a perilous moment, the individual would be spared; if not, he would die. Magic charms were often based on this notion. A Slavic charm for healing wounds was addressed to the Fate-weaver on the
mystic isle of Bujan, or Buyan, the Goddess's paradise: "In the Ocean
sea, on the isle of Buyan, a fair maiden was weaving silk; she did not
leave off weaving silk; the blood ceased flowing." 5 According to RussU myth, this maiden was the Virgin of Dawn, equivalent to the Latin
Mater Matuta, or the Greek Eos, traditionally the first Fate. The sun
god went to rest on her magic isle, and rose again from it each day.6
Other Greek names for the Fate-goddess were Tyche, Dike, and
302



Nemesis. Romans called her Fortuna; a trinity or a monad. A
terracotta medallion from Vienne showed her as a tutelary city-goddess,
wearing a mural crown, enthroned in a laurel wreath. 7 As the
Babylonian "Mother of Destiny," Fate was named Mammetun, the Creatress. 8 All were based on the primordial Indo-European Mother of Karma, i.e., Kali Ma.
"Fate" was synonymous with "fairy" in the Middle Ages. Alphonsus de Spina placed "Fates" first on his list of devils, remarking: "Some say they have seen Fates, but if so they are not women but
demons." 9 Burchardus of Worms complained that the people hon
ored the Fates or Weird Sisters at the beginning of every year, putting
offerings of food and drink on a table for them, with three knives for
cutting their meat presumably so the death-dealing Cutter wouldn't be tempted to use her own knife. 10
Greeks still say the Fates visit the cradle of every newborn, to
determine the child's future as his fairy godmothers. Parents used to
chain up the watchdog, leave the door open, and set out dainty foods to
put the Moerae in a good humor. 11 Many fairy tales give stern lessons
in the folly of offending fairy godmothers. Gypsies still say "three ladies in white" stand at the cradle of each child, and take back the soul
when life has run its course, like the Three Queens of Arthurian legend.
Greek laments for the dead are still called moirologhia, giving the deceased back to the Moerae. 12

Fatherhood
Fatherhood
Myths show that, once men understood they could beget children, they wanted many children, because that was the best and easiest way to
become a god. Ancestral mothers had been deified by their descen
dants for countless generations. Patriarchs craved similar nations of
descendants, for a tribal ancestor achieved great glory in the after
world. Men transferred their allegiance from the Great Mother, the
original deified ancestress, to gods like Yahweh, on the basis of his promises: "I will make of these a great nation, and I will bless thee, and
make thy name great I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I
will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee" (Genesis
12, 17). Persians said a man who died childless couldn't enter paradise at
all. Prayers and sacrifices of descendants were essential to blessedness
for the paternal soul. Hindus defined a son as one whose incantations
and offerings kept a father's spirit from wandering homeless and hungry in the waste spaces of eternity. The Brhaddarma Purana said, "No rituals are performed for the man who has no descendants
Puranas are ancient
Sanskrit scriptures in verse, treating of cosmologies, sacred histories, and the nature of the divine.
303



Fatherhood Sons are useful to give oblations to the ancestors." ' The Chinese
thought if a man had no son, he cut the continuous line of paternal
^
h^mm ancestor-worship and lost his chance of becoming immortal. 2 Fatherhood was largely a ceremonial relationship, with little recog
nition that men might take an active part in raising their own
children. The classical Latin term paterfamilias, now connoting a father
of-a-family and household ruler, didn't convey anything like that to the Romans who invented the term:
When the ancients invokedJupiter under that title ofpater ofgods and men, they did not mean that he was their physical father, for they never supposed he was, but on the contrary believed that the human race had
existed before he did. The same title was given to Neptune, Apollo,
Bacchus, Vulcan and Pluto, whom men certainly did not suppose to be
their fathers. . . . Similarly, in legal language, the title o/paterfamilias could be given to a man who had no children, was not married, was not
even old enough to enter upon a marriage . . . ; pater, the Latin word cognate to "father" and closest akin to it in meaning, signifies not so much him who has begotten a younger person as him who has natural authority over one inferior in age or status. J
Men or gods began to claim physical fatherhood not so much by
an act of begetting, as by a different, ceremonial act designed to imitate
the motherly act of birth-giving. (See Birth-giving, Male.) In earliest times the imitation was quite literal, like the rite of couvade practiced by
primitives to establish paternal rights to a child. While the mother
gave birth, the father took to his bed moaning and groaning, and
pretended to bring forth the child. Couvade was an initiation ritual
for priests of Aphrodite Ariadne at Amathus, where a man dressed in
female clothing went through a pantomime of childbirth, to earn the
priestly title of "father." 4
Christian writers said their religion was sent to convert Europe to a
patriarchal system in which men could demand respect from their
offspring. Before Christianity came to Britain, there was a "great sin" in the structure of the clans: "the father loved not the son, nor the son
loved not the father." 5 Early missionaries complained that British tribes paid no attention to the matter of who begot whom; women took
lovers as they pleased, and "marital vows are never observed." St. Boni
face said the English "utterly despise legitimate matrimony," meaning the kind of matrimony that gave husbands control of property and
children. 6
Eventually, Christianity changed the pagans' casual attitude toward fatherhood. St. Thomas Aquinas laid down the church's
official opinion that a father is the true parent, a mother only the "soil"
in which the father's "seed" grows. He said a father should be more
loved than a mother, because the father's part in giving life to the child
is "active," whereas the mother's part is only "passive." 7 Emphasis on paternity was characteristic of patriarchal societies,
where men often tried to pretend that begetting a child was more
304



important than the mother's multi-faceted task of carrying, delivering,
nursing, and teaching it all the basic skills of living. In matriarchal
Arabia, biological paternity meant nothing. After the coming of Islam, men considered paternity so important that they instituted a year's waiting period between a woman's divorce or widowhood and her
remarriage, to make absolutely sure she was not pregnant by the previous husband, since no man wanted his wife giving birth to another
man's child. 8 The same waiting period was demanded in Christian Europe, and became so taken for granted that it became "indecent" for a woman to remarry too soon after an earlier husband's departure or
death.
One reason for the restrictive, authoritarian atmosphere of patriarchal societies seems to have been that men didn't readily see their
children as separate persons, but viewed them as extensions of the
father's own ego, therefore requiring strict discipline to make them
conform to the pattern. Zimmer says in the language of symbols, son
means "double," "alter ego," "living copy of the father," "the father's essence in another individualization." 9 Thus the father's inter
est in children was more selfish than the mother's.
Harriet Stanton Blatch wrote, "Men talk of the sacredness of
motherhood, but judging from their acts it is the last thing that is held
sacred. . . . The sense of obligation to offspring, men possess but feebly; there has not been developed by animal evolution an instinct of
paternity. They are not disinherited fathers; they are simply unevolved parents. Those who could improve humanity have been hindered by
those who prefer to improve steam engines. . . . The sex which has been
laboriously evolved by nature for the arduous work of race-building is
handicapped." Western patriarchy developed a culture of acquisitiveness, aggression, and hierarchy for the very reason that its underlying
philosophy was masculine-selfish, according to Neumann: "This situation of the patriarchate known to us particularly from its Western
[development is characterized by a recession of feminine psychology
and its dominants; now feminine existence is almost entirely deterI mined by the masculine world of consciousness and its values." 10 The masculine world of consciousness has been characterized as
"barren" and "destructive," insofar as "the fantasies of the single man
pervade our popular culture." n These focus on self-centered greed,
aggression, or defensiveness on behalf of the self, with little compre
hension of love, dependence, or responsibility toward future generations. Behavior patterns of the masculine world remind one that the earliest Chinese ideograph for "male" was also a synonym for
"selfish." 12
This culture passes harsh judgment on women who are labeled unfit mothers, because males however "dominant" identify with the
child, not the mother. Standards for fathers are not so high. Drunkards,
adulterers, child-beaters, even criminals are supposed to have a "right" to fatherhood, to say nothing of millions of men who treat their

original Febronia was Juno Februata, patroness of the passion of love
(febris), and honored by orgiastic rites in February (see Valentine). Her legend said she was martyred during the reign of Diocletian, but no one ever heard of her until four centuries later when she
began to appear in Christian martyrologies. 1

Fig
Zekerboni
A treatise on
oneiromancy (dream interpretation) by Pierre Mora,
manuscript #2790 in the Bibliotheque de l'Arsenal.
Romans used to celebrate "a rude and curious rite" in connection with
the fertilization of Juno Caprotina, Goddess of the Fig Tree, by her lecherous horned goat god. 2
Jesus's rival deity Mithra, whom some called the true Messiah, also was involved with the maternal fig tree. Shortly after his birth
from the petra genetrix, and his discovery by adoring shepherds, Mithra was adopted by the fig tree, which provided him with a continuous
supply of food (fruit) and clothing (leaves). 3 According to the Book of Genesis, fig leaves were the world's first clothing, donned by Adam
and Eve as soon as they acquired knowledge. Adoption by a fig tree also figured prominently in the legend of Buddha, protected by the Bodhi Tree, or Tree of Wisdom, Ecus religiosa, the Holy Fig, when he received his enlightenment on Full Moon Day in the month of
May. 4 The fig was a common Indo-Iranian symbol of the Great Mother.
Babylonian Ishtar also took the form of the divine fig tree Xikum, the
"primeval mother at the central place of the earth," protectress of the savior Tammuz. 5 Patriachal writers of the Koran later turned Ishtar's
tree to Zakkum, the Tree of Hell, growing downward from the earth's
underside. 6
Gaulish gods called Dusii were described in medieval Latin as
ficarii, "fig-eaters," which meant the same as the Homeric "lotus
eaters," in view of the fact that both the fig and the lotus symbolized
female genitals. 7 Anglo-Saxon "fuck" may have been derived from
Reus, "fig." To this day, Italians make the mano in fica, "fig-hand," as a
derogatory sexual sign implying, like the raised middle finger, "fuck you." The mano in fica was of Oriental origin, a lingam-yoni formed by the thumb projecting between two fingers. Hindus called the fighand a sacred mudra, and Ovid said Roman householders used it as a
protection against evil spells. 8 To Christians however, it was manus obscenus, "the obscene hand." 9
Like other genital symbols, the fig was often incorporated into love charms together with many other items formerly sacred to Venus.
Some of these items blood, bread, doves, and pentacles joined the fig in a charm from the Zekerboni, to make bachelors see their future
brides in a dream:
They must have powdered coral and some fine powdered lodestone, which they shall mix together and dilute with the blood ofa white
pigeon, and they shall make a dough ofit, which they shall enclose in a
large fig after having wrapped it in blue taffeta; they shall hang this round their neck, and when they go to bed shall put the pentacle for
Saturday under their bolster, saying a special prayer the while. w

Fmgers Fingers
The Dactyls "Fingers" were spirits born from the fingerprints of
the Goddess Rhea: five males from the print of her right hand, five mhmh^m^mmmb Females from the print of her left hand. 1 Their Greek name was
ierived from Sanskrit Daksa, "dextrous one," a Hindu god of the hand.
Mano pantea, the Hand of the All-Goddess, was a sacred fetish of which many examples have been found in the ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum. 2 It always showed the thumb and first two fingers raised,
the last two fingers folded down. Middle finger, index finger, and
thumb invoked pagan trinities of Father-Mother-Son, such as Jupiter[uno-Mars, or Osiris-Isis-Horus. The same kind of trinity, consisting
jf God, Mary, and Jesus, used to be worshipped by eastern Christians
which may explain why Christianity adopted the mano pantea and
renamed it "the hand of blessing." 3 The gesture was displayed by hristian priests and by emperors or kings by way of benediction and
expression of their own union with the land.4
The thumb was the child, or child-soul symbolized in such fables
is Hop-O-My-Thumb. The index finger was the Mother, the one
who pointed, controlled, cast spells. The middle finger was the Father, a
phallic symbol for thousands of years, up to and including the present
day. Arabs used to cut open a vein of the middle finger with a stone
cnife when making a pledge of faith, invoking a curse of castration if
:he pledge be broken. 5 Roman male prostitutes used to signal potential :ustomers by thrusting the middle finger into the hair of their heads.6
Like all widely recognized phallic symbols, the middle finger was associated with the devil by Christian authorities, who referred to it as
digitus infamis, "the vile finger." When the torturers asked accused
bitches which finger they raised to take the devil's oath, the only
'right" answer they would accept was the middle finger. 7 It was
:onsidered evil to wear a ring on the middle finger, for reasons plainly
associated with its sexual meanings. 8
Oddly enough, the classic finger-sign of the devil didn't use the
niddle finger at all, but displayed his "horned head" by pinning down the middle and fourth fingers with the thumb and extending the
ndex and little fingers. On the well-known magic principle that an
svil sign was prophylactic against evil, this gesture was often used in Italy and the Balkans as a defense against the evil eye. Like most
European symbols, it seems to have originated with Kali Ma, who jhowed it as a mudra (sacred gesture) in her manifestation as
[agadamba, "Mother of the World." 9 Probably it was meant to signify tier own horned head embodied in the sacred cow.
The most revered mudra was the one meaning "infinity" or
'perfection," and most generally associated with female genitalia:
thumb and forefinger pressed together at the tips, the other three fingers
309



Firmament extended our modern OK sign. 10 Tantric yogis and bodhisattvas
made this gesture in token of contemplative ecstasy. 11 Persian sacred
^^^^^^^ amulets of the Sassanian period (3rd century B.C.) showed a hand in
this position, flanked by horns of fertility.
12 The joined thumb and index
finger formed a vesica piscis, immemorial symbol of the yoni, while
the three extended fingers perhaps referred to the Goddess's trinity.
Western Europe inherited the Egyptian idea that the index and
middle fingers stood for the mother and father, respectively. Egyptian mummies were buried with a protective amulet invoking both parents, called the Amulet of the Two Fingers. 15 The index or "mother"
finger was the most magical. This was the finger that guided, showed, beckoned, called for attention, blessed, and cursed. Medieval Christians feared the pointing of a witch's index finger,
which is why children are still taught that it's rude to point, and why a
woman's characteristic scolding gesture brandishes the index finger like
a weapon. In Tantric tradition, this mother-finger was known as "the
threatening finger." 14 All Indo-European traditions knew it was female. Arabs said the index finger represents the Goddess Fatima, whose
symbolic Hand is still revered as a mystic summary of "the whole
religion of Islam." 15
Jewish patriarchs insisted on fettering a woman's threatening, spellcasting right index finger with the wedding ring, and orthodox Jewish women wear a wedding ring on that finger to this day. Christians,
however, copied their wedding-ring custom from the pagans, who said a mystic "love vein" ran directly from the fourth finger of the left
hand to the heart, therefore this finger should be bound in marriage. Macrobius wrote that a woman's wedding ring should be placed on that
finger "to prevent the sentiments of the heart from escaping." 16
There was a universal prejudice against cutting fingernails without
careful disposal, lest fingernail pairings be used in malignant spells against their former owner. Norse myth said the doomsday ship Naglfar was made of dead men's fingernails, so "if a man dies with his nails
unshorn he is adding greatly to the materials for Naglfar" and bringing
doomsday that much closer. 17 Hence the custom of manicuring
corpses.

Firmament
The Hebrew word for firmament meant "a sheet of hammered metal." Sometimes this was called "the heaven of brass." The Bible
gives the ancient notion that the heaven was the bottom of a vast
310



pistern, holding "the waters which were above the firmament" (Gene- Firstborn
is 1:7) i.e., rain.
According to this primitive notion, the rain fell down when angels ^^m^^m^mi^^
ppened the "windows of heaven" to let some of the water out of the
enormous cistern. Canaanite and early Jewish temples had magic
b/indows in the roof, supposed to be models of the celestial windows,
ince everything about a temple was meant to copy the cosmos, not only
ymbolically but literally. When rain was needed, the magic windows ivere opened, and this was believed to cause a corresponding action in
he celestial region. 2 This is why the Bible says God sent Noah's
flood by opening all the windows of heaven at once (Genesis 7:1 1).
The biblical firmament of brass was based on an ancient Oriental
mage of the house of Varuna, located in the zenith. It was a "house
bf many mansions," corresponding to Jesus's description of his father's heaven (John 14:2). It had a thousand doors through which the light
bf the celestial regions could shine, forming the stars. 5 These were iransmuted by biblical writers into the windows of heaven.

Firstborn
liost Asiatic gods claimed the title of Firstborn of the Womb, in
anskrit Hiranyagarbha. Each priesthood wanted its own god to be firstborn" of the Creatress, because her eldest child would wield
atural authority over the others. Since it was impossible for more than
ne god to be the Firstborn, scholars simply used the title and
llaimed each god was the firstborn of one of the Great Mother's virgin
manations.
The classic example was the Buddha, born in many incarnations, ach time as a "firstborn" of the Goddess's earthly representative, a
pmple maiden or devadasi, "Virgin Bride of God," bearing the name and spirit) of Maya, the virgin aspect of Mother Kali. As in all myths f divine births, the maiden might have an earthly husband, but he
kln't lie with her until after she brought forth her firstborn child,
|ho was the son of God, or, in Buddha's case, the son of Ganesha, the
Lord of Hosts. 1
The actual mechanism of these divine impregnations was quite leral. The virgin mother-to-be deflowered herself by straddling the
icred lingam the god's erect penis and allowing it to penetrate her. 2
i/hile thus conceiving the god's son, the virgin placed a wreath of owers on the head of his image, a symbolic act reminiscent of the
ticient Indian svayamara ceremony. 3 The wreath was her own
pnital symbol; the god's "head" was his. The god's head and the head This lingam were both anointed with holy oil for the sacred
liarriage, certainly a logical necessity for inserting a stone shaft into a agina. The custom and the temple phalli were standard
I
311



Firstborn throughout the Middle East and the Mediterranean world, where the
holy oil was known as chrism, and the priapic god was therefore a
,^^^mwm Christos or "Anointed One."
In the Middle East, Maya became Maia, Mari, or Mary, another
"virgin bride of God" who served as a temple maiden or kadesha, the equivalent of the Hindu devadasi. According to the classic Indo
European pattern, the angel of the Lord "came in unto" Mary (Luke 1:28), which was the biblical term for sexual intercourse; and her husband Joseph "knew her not until she had brought forth her
firstborn son" (Matthew 1:25). Divinely begotten firstborn children were sacer singled out for a
special fate from the earliest times, when first fruits of all kinds were
offered to the same deities supposed to have given them. Firstborn sons
embodied the god, became the god, and were offered to the god. A
mass sacrifice of firstborn sons in Egypt, to appease the deities during a severe drought, was recorded in the Old Testament by Jewish scribes
who revised the legend to claim their own Yahweh was responsible for
killing the Egyptian children (Exodus 12:29). Actually, Egyptian firstborn-sacrifice came from very ancient tradi
tions. The Book ofthe Dead said, "On the day of hacking in pieces the firstborn ... the mighty ones in heaven light the fire under the cauldrons where are heaped up the thighs of the firstborn." 4 Under
the later dynasties these may have been animal sacrifices, but the
hieroglyphic sign of the "thighs" showed human legs, not animal legs. The Bible says Yahweh copied the act of Egypt's "mighty ones in heaven," and sent out fire to consume the sons of Aaron on the altar
(Leviticus 10:2).
Like an Egyptian god, Yahweh told his priests: "Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children
of Israel, both of man and of beast; it is mine" (Exodus 13:2). Firstborn
children were offered on Yahweh's altars until priests began to permit
redemption of the child by offering a lamb instead (Exodus 13:1 5). Thus the paschal lamb of the Passover legend was really a substitute for the son, just as the ram who replaced Isaac on Yahweh's altar also
represented a transition from human to animal sacrifice (Genesis
22:9-13). The story of Isaac and the ram probably was copied from the Boeotian myth of the king's firstborn son Phrixus, who was to be sacrificed on the altar, when the ram of the Golden Fleece miraculoush
appeared as a substitute victim. 5
Yahweh's acceptance of an animal sacrifice in place of a human
one didn't necessarily mean he was more humane than contemporary gods elsewhere. Long before the period allotted to Abraham, Oriental
nations had been offering animals instead of human victims. 6 Indeed,
the Jews seem to have clung to the older custom for a longer time than
most of their contemporaries. They ignored Hadrian's prohibition of
human sacrifice, and continued in secret to sustain their god on humam
blood, as in the rites of the Essenic Christos. 7 See Virgin Birth.
312



Romans may have given up human sacrifice, but they had not riven up the ceremony of firstborn-conception. Roman brides routinely deflowered themselves on the carved phalli of Hermes, Tutunus,
j-'riapus, or some other "anointed" god before lying with their
bridegrooms, so their firstborn children would be god-begotten. 8 It was
tommon everywhere to refer to firstborn children as "born by the trace of God." 9
Fathers of the Christian church deplored the custom, because it
|nade an everyday event of the birth of a Christos which they [referred to consider miraculous. St. Augustine denounced Roman lomen for encouraging young brides to "come and sit on the
riasculine monstrosity representing Priapus." The women, he said, riewed this custom as "very honest and religious." 10 Lactantius
jxplained that the idea of the ceremony was to render the bride fruitful
by her communion with the divine nature." u
After the "divine nature" of these priapic gods was declared a
levilish nature, yet the ceremony may have persisted, as indicated by hedieval witches' description of intercourse with the devil. They
laimed his penis was hard and cold, and his body was "cold all over,
Ike a creature of stone." 12 Such a "devil" could well have been a
feature of stone in fact that is, a statue of Priapus or one of the
llther phallic gods, believed to beget Antichrist in the classical manner,
b the firstborn of a virgin mother.

ish
k world-wide symbol of the Great Mother was the pointed-oval sign f the yoni, known as vesica piscis, Vessel of the Fish. It was associated
dth the "Fishy Smell" that Hindus made a title of the yonic Goddess
erself, because they said women's genitals smelled like fish. 1 The
Chinese Great Mother Kwan-yin ("Yoni of yonis") often appeared s a fish-goddess. 2 As the swallower of Shiva's penis, Kali became
linaksi the "fish-eyed" one, just as in Egypt, Isis the swallower of
)siris's penis became Abtu, the Great Fish of the Abyss. 3
Fish and womb were synonymous in Greek; delphos meant both. 4
Tie original Delphic oracle first belonged to the abyssal fish-goddess nder her pre-Hellenic name of Themis, often incarnate in a great fish,
hale, or dolphin (delphinos). The cycles in which she devoured and Kurrected the Father-Son entered all systems of symbolism from the
Ijws' legend of Jonah to the classic "Boy on the Dolphin." Apuleius
m
the Goddess playing the part of the Dolphin was Aphrodite Salacia,
with fish-teeming womb." 5
Her "boy" was Palaemon, the reincarnated young sun, made new

Flidhais after sinking into the same abyssal womb as the dying god Heracles.6
The fish-goddess Aphrodite Salacia was said to bring "salacity" through ^^^^^^^^^^^ orgiastic fish-eating on her sacred day, Friday. The Catholic church
inherited the pagan custom of Friday fish-eating and pretended it was a holy fast; but the disguise was thin. Friday was dies veneris in Latin,
the Day of Venus, or of lovemaking: Freya's Day in Teutonic Europe. The notion that fish are "aphrodisiac" food is still widespread even
today. The Celts thought fish-eating could place new life in a mother's 1 womb. Their hero Tuan was eaten in fish form by the Queen of Ireland, who thus re-conceived him and gave him a new birth. 7 In
another myth, fish were associated with the clots of "wise blood"
emanating from the Mother-tree with its sacred fountain, in Fairyland. 8 They were called blood-red nuts of the Goddess Boann, eaten by "salmon of knowledge" who swam in her sacred fountain. "Poets and
story-tellers, speaking of any subject difficult to deal with, often say, 'Unless I had eaten the salmon of knowledge I could not describe it."" The fish symbol of the yonic Goddess was so revered throughout
the Roman empire that Christian authorities insisted on taking it
over, with extensive revision of myths to deny its earlier female-genital meanings. Some claimed the fish represented Christ because Greek
ichthys, "fish," was an acronym for "Jesus Christ, Son of God." But the Christian fish-sign was the same as that of the Goddess's yoni or
Pearly Gate: two crescent moons forming a vesica piscis. Sometimes the
Christ child was portrayed inside the vesica, which was superimposed
Fish on Mary's belly and obviously represented her womb, just as in the ancient symbolism of the Goddess. A medieval hymn called Jesus "the Little Fish which the Virgin
caught in the Fountain." ,0 Mary was equated with the virgin
Aphrodite-Mari, or Marina, who brought forth all the fish in the sea. Or
the Cyprian site of Aphrodite's greatest temple, Mary is still worshipped as Panaghia Aphroditessa. 11 In biblical terms, "Jesus son of Maria" meant the same as Yeshua son of Marah, or Joshua son of Nun (Exodus 33:1 1), which also means son of the Fish-mother. Mary's
many Mesopotamian names like Mari, Marriti, Nar-Marratu, Mara, j
were written like the Hebrew Mem with an ideogram meaning both "sea" and "mother." 12 The next letter in the Hebrew sacred alpha
bet was Nun, "fish." Another biblical name for the Goddess was Mehitabel, none other
than the Egyptian Fish-mother Mehit in a Hebrew disguise. 15

Flood
The biblical flood story, the "deluge," was a late offshoot of a cycle of
flood myths known everywhere in the ancient world. Thousands of years before the Bible was written, an ark was built by Sumerian
Ziusudra. In Akkad, the flood hero's name was Atrakhasis. In Babylon
he was Uta-Napishtim, the only mortal to become immortal. In
Greece he was Deucalion, who repopulated the earth after the waters
subsided, with the help of his wife Pyrrha and the advice of the Great
Goddess of the waters, Themis. In Armenia, the hero was Xisuthros a corruption of Sumerian Ziusudra whose ark landed on Mount
Ararat. 1
According to the original Chaldean account, the flood hero was
told by his god, "Build a vessel and finish it. By a deluge I will destroy
substance and life. Cause thou to go up into the vessel the substance of
all that has life." Technical instructions followed: the ark was to be
600 cubits long by 60 wide, with three times 3600 measures of asphalt
on its exterior and the same amount inside. Three times 3600 porters
brought chests of provisions, of which 3600 chests were for the hero's
immediate family, while "the mariners divided among themselves twice three thousand six hundred chests." 2 It seems that Noah's ark was
much smaller than earlier heroic proportions.
As long ago as 1872, George Smith translated the Twelve Tablets
of Creation from Ashurbanipal's library, and discovered the earlier
version of the flood myth. 5 Among the details that religious orthodoxy
took care to suppress was the point that the god who caused the flood
was disobedient to the Great Mother, who didn't want her earthly
children drowned. Mother Ishtar severely punished the disobedient
god by cursing him with her "great lightnings." She set her magic rainbow in the heavens to block his access to offerings on earthly
altars, "since rashly he caused the flood-storm, and handed over my
people to destruction." 4 Old Testament writers copied other details of the ancient flood
myth but could not allow their god to be punished by the Great Whore of Babylon, as if he were a naughty child sent to bed without
supper by an angry mother. Thus, they transformed Ishtar's rainbow
barrier into a "sign of the covenant" voluntarily set in the heavens by
God himself (Genesis 9:13).
The Tigris-Euphrates valley was subject to disastrous floods. One especially was long remembered; geologists have linked it with the volcanic cataclysm that blew apart the island of Thera (Santorin) and destroyed Cretan civilization. When Sir Leonard Woolley was

excavating the site of Ur, he found the track of a mighty flood a layer
of clay without artifacts, eight feet thick. 5 Such a flood may have been
identified with the watery Chaos that all Indo-European peoples believed would swallow up the world at the end of its cycle, and out of which a new world would be reborn in the womb of the Formless
Mother.6 The ark and its freight represented seeds of life passing through the period of Chaos from the destruction of one universe to the
birth of the next. Even in the Bible, the "birth" was heralded by the
Goddess's yonic dove (Genesis 8:12). Gnostic literature preserved the older view of the flood-causing
God as an evil destroyer of humanity, and the Goddess as its
preserver. Because people refused to worship him alone, jealous Jehovah sent the flood to wipe out all life. Fortunately the Goddess
opposed him, "and Noah and his family were saved in the ark by means
of the sprinkling of light that proceeded from her, and through it the world was again filled with humankind." 7 This Gnostic interpretation had both Babylonian and Hellenic roots. Greeks said the primal sea-mother Themis gave Deucalion and
his wife occult knowledge ("light") of how to create human beings from
stones, "the bones of their Mother," i.e., of the earth. 8 Raising up living people from stones or bones was a popular miracle. Jesus mentioned it, and Ezekiel's God claimed to have done it in the valley
of bones (Ezekiel 37).

Roman Goddess of spring, "The Flourishing One," annually honored at the May Day festival called Floralia. Lactantius noted with
distaste that Flora was "a Lady of Pleasure," but she was prominent
and important in Roman religion. Some said her name was the secret soul-name of Rome itself. 1 St. Augustine and other fathers of the church abominated Flora
and her festival, which, they said, was a licentious orgy of nude
dancing and promiscuous behavior. 2

Popular soul-symbol in many ancient religions, due to a primitive belief that women could conceive children by swallowing a fly bearing

the very word for soul, psyche, meant a butterfly. In the Middle East,
Baal-Zebub or Beelzebub was "Lord of Flies" because he was a psychopomp; his title really meant Lord of Souls. Behind such images can be seen an archaic mode of thought,
predating the discovery of fatherhood, when men evolved various crude theories to explain the mystery of how a fetus came to be in a woman's body. 2

Flying Ointment
Flying Ointment
A drug like aconite was probably responsible for the report that witches flew through the air with the heathen Goddess Diana, covering
vast distances between sunset and cockcrow. 1 A Dominican friar,
Father Nider, said two of his brethren witnessed a witch's trip to the
sabbat, which turned out to be a drug trip only. She rubbed her body
with an ointment, then lay down in a kneading-trough and passed into a
state of delirium, thrashing about, and muttering of Venus and the
devil. When she returned to her senses, the friars told her she had been
to a meeting of devils and witches. On another occasion, Pope Julius
Ill's chief astrologer experimentally rubbed a woman's body with witch
salve composed of hemlock, mandrake, henbane, and belladonna. She went into a coma lasting 36 hours and experienced many hallucinations. 2
Professor H. S. Clarke recently noted that many drugs used by witches were known to cause such effects. Aconite disturbs the
heartbeat and produces peculiar sensations, including dizziness or a sensation of flying. Belladonna produces delirium. Hemlock causes
excitement and later paralysis. "Rubbing such ointments into the skin
would intensify any physiological properties." These drugs, not the fat of boiled children that churchmen deemed essential, made the "magic" of witches' flying ointment. 3
Oil was the vehicle for a flying ointment of Roman witches,
according to Lucian, who described a woman transforming herself
into a night-raven by rubbing her body with holy oil, then flying away through the window.4 The flying journey to heaven was the primary
component of any magical initiation; it could be induced by ointment, or by eating the body of a god. By eating the flesh of Osiris in the
form of bread, an initiate could become an Osiris and ascend to heaven,
and "in one little moment pass over limitless distances which would
need millions and hundreds of thousands of years for a man to pass over.
Though ascent to heaven via a god's eaten body was certainly a central Christian doctrine, the church declared it a sin to believe it
could be done by the living, with the help of a non-Christian deity. Up
to the middle of the medieval period, the church said the flights of

Focus witches were wholly imaginary, and it was heresy to believe them real.
Footbinding After the Inquisition took shape, the church said the flights of witches
^^^^^^^^^^^ were real, and it was heresy to believe them imaginary.
The earlier opinion appeared in the Canon Episcopi, written by a
secretary of the Archbishop of Trier about 900 a.d., though it was
passed off as a canon of the 4th-century Council of Ancyra; its
fraudulence was demonstrated centuries later. It told Christians to
reject the "demonic illusions" that made women think they flew through the night air with the pagan Goddess Diana. 6 When the
church's opinion was reversed in the 1 3th century, those who doubted
the witches' flights were said to "sin in the lack of true reverence to
our mother the church." 7
Supported by plenty of "evidence" from the torture chamber, the
useful theory of witches' flights could account for the fact that no one
ever saw the vast assemblages, allegedly coming together from great distances, to the devilish sabbat. 8 It could also account for the prison
suicides of victims who beat their heads against their cell walls until they
died, to avoid further torture. The inquisitor Bodin said witches left unbound between sessions in the torture chamber often dashed them
selves against the wall and broke their necks because they tried to fly away with Diana or Minerva.9
Many women confessed under torture that they dug up children's
corpses to make their flying ointment. On one occasion at Lindheim, six women confessed to this crime and were sentenced to the stake. The
family of one of the women instituted an investigation of the grave in
question, where the child's body was discovered intact. The inquisitors
smoothly explained that the devil had reassembled the body to cause
confusion. The witches were burned on schedule. 10

Focus
Latin for "hearth," the first altar, and center of early tribal life. 1
Goddess of the focus was Vesta (Greek Hestia), whose priestesses tended a perpetual fire that was bound up with the soul of Rome. It
was believed the altar of Vesta was the center of the universe. The cult
arose from Neolithic views of matrilocal power radiating from the
home center of the clan, with the matriarch as high priestess and
religious ceremonies centering on her hearth. 2

Footbinding
Strange erotic custom of medieval China, practiced for a thousand
years, up to the beginning of the 20th century, even exerting some
318



influence on western Europe where women were often praised in
romantic literature for having the tiniest possible feet.
Crippling of the Chinese girl began at the age of five or six. Footbinding was a lifelong torment that slowly broke bones and deformed the flesh until the full "beauty" of the atrophied, three-inch "lotus hook" was achieved. Many women died of suppuration and
gangrene before the desired effect was complete.
Chinese men were conditioned to intense fetishistic passion for
deformed female feet. Chinese poets sang ecstatic praises of the lotus feet that aroused their desire to fever pitch. The crippled woman was
considered immeasurably charming by reason of her vulnerability,
her suffering, and her helplessness she couldn't even escape an attacker by running away. 1 Westerners sometimes imagined that footbinding produced a well
shaped but miniaturized foot. Actually, it bore little resemblance to a normal foot. The four smaller toes were folded completely under the
sole; then the whole foot was folded so the underside of the heel and
toes were brought together. The victim had to keep her feet tightly
bandaged forever; letting them spread again would cause even worse
pain.

Forgery
Forgery
Documentary foundations of the Christian church's temporal powers
were often forged, including the crucial Petrine doctrine of the keys (see
Peter, Saint). Notable among later forgeries were the Decretals of
St. Isidore, alleged canons and decrees of the papacy from apostolic
times to the 8th century a.d., upholding papal claims to authority over European nations. These documents were first composed in
France about the year 850 a.d., though they pretended to date from the earliest foundations of the church. Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa patiently investigated the Decretals in
the 1 5 th century and found them to be clumsy forgeries full of
anachronisms and garbled history.
1 The church refused to acknowledge
that its traditional privileges were founded on false documents. The
works of subsequent scholars revealing the deception were banned and
their authors persecuted. Apologists who tried to explain away the forgery were rewarded with ecclesiastical preferments. In 1628, when
Blondel published irrefutable proof of the Decretals' fraudulence, his work was promptly placed on the Index of Prohibited Books.
Among the False Decretals was the so-called Donation of Con
stantine, whereby Pope Sylvester I and his successors were granted temporal as well as spiritual dominion over the entire empire, and the
fiefdoms of the Papal States were established. According to this
document, Constantine made the pope the greatest feudal lord in Italy:
[Wherefore, that the pontifical crown may be maintained in dignity,
Index of Prohibited Books (Index Librorum
Prohibitorum) The first official edition
appeared in 1 5 59, though ecclesiastical authorities censored, condemned, and
destroyed various kinds of books from the earliest centuries of the Christian era. Catholics were forbidden to read any books listed on the Index, which was
regularly updated. Observation of this
prohibition was
obligatory up to 1966, when Pope Paul VI
suppressed the Index.

composer of the Donation, a papal official named Christophorus, made serious historical mistakes. He made Constantine call himself
conqueror of the Huns, fifty years before they appeared in Europe. He called the bishop of Rome "pope" two hundred years before the
title was used. 2
Lorenzo Valla proved the spurious nature of the Donation as earl
as 1440. He wrote: "Even if it had been genuine, it would by now
have been rendered void by the crimes alone of the Papacy, through whose avarice Italy has been plunged in constant war." 3 The church
refused to admit the fraud until nearly four centuries later. A Greek
saying was that the chief industry of papal Rome was fabrication of
false documents. After setting the precedent, "Nearly every pontificate will add its supplement of false documents to this formidable corpus
whence the theologians, St. Thomas Aquinas among them, will for a
long period confidently derive the justification for whatever the Roman Pontiffs may desire to do or say." 4 The Gospels themselves
were forged as required to uphold privileges and practices of the early church. "We must never forget that the majority of the writings of the New Testament were not really written or published by those whose
names they bear." 5 After burning books and closing pagan schools, the church dealt in
another kind of forgery: falsification by omission. All European
history was extensively edited by a church that managed to make itself
the sole repository of literary and historical records. With all impor
tant documents assembled in the monasteries, and the lay public
rendered illiterate, Christian history could be forged with impunity.

crucified. It was also a phallic symbol of the god's sacred marriage. 2 Thej
"thieves' cross" in Christian iconography had the same shape. Such
crosses flanking Jesus's cross may have represented sacred marriage. The Y-shaped fork was sometimes regarded as a female genital
symbol, in conjunction with the male trident or three-pronged fork. 5 The voodoo savior-god Legba characteristically used as his crutch a derivative of the sacred furka of Set. 4

tort""6 Fortune
The Roman Triple Goddess of Fate had many "Fortune" titles: Frastrada
Fortuna Primigeneia, the Firstborn; Fortuna Muliebris, Goddess of mmmmhmmm
Women; Fortuna Scribunda, the Fate Who Writes; Fortuna Regia, Goddess of Rulership; Bona Fortuna or Mala Fortuna, good and bad
fate.
Fortuna Augusti was the foundation of the emperors' right to rule.
Romans swore by the emperor's personal Fortuna, who governed his soul. Caesars "constantly had before them, even during sleep or on
voyages, a golden statue of the goddess, which on their death they transmitted to their successor and which they invoked under the name
pi Fortuna Regia, a translation of Tyche Basileos (Fate of the
Rulership)." l Greek Tyche was the same as Fortuna. When she was a Fate
attached to an individual, like a guardian angel, she was a psyche ssoul) or anima (spirit). Her Roman name Fortuna may have descended
from Vortumna, "She Who Turns the Year," the Great Mother turning the celestial wheel of the stars and also the karmic wheel of
fate. 2
Under the name of Agatha, "Kindly Fortune," the Goddess was
associated with a serpent-consort, Agathodemon, a genius of kindly rate. 3 On the Orphic Bowl of the 5th century a.d. he appeared next to
her in the guise of the Lord of Death, "halfway around the circle, at
he point of midnight . . . holding in his right hand the poppy stalk of the Bleep of death, turned downward." 4 In this case Fortuna and her
consort stood for a fortunate life followed by a gentle death. The
Goddess's favored ones went to her paradise in the far west, often
balled the Fortunate Isles.
On the Goddess's magic wheel of time, odd numbers were sacred
|o her, even numbers to her consort. Roman religious festivals were Icheduled for the odd-numbered "female" days, because they were
[upposed to be more propitious than "male" days. 5
Fortuna became patroness of gamblers when her fate-wheel was
lecularized as the carnival Wheel of Fortune, and she was renamed
Lady Luck. In England she was transformed into a fairy-creature called
ji "portune," which might lead horses astray, make travelers lose their Ivay, and other pranks.6 Like most other forms of the Goddess she was
Converted into a malicious spirit.

Frederick II
Holy Roman Emperor who opposed his church, once remarking that "three have seduced the whole world, that is, Moses the Hebrews, Christ the Christians, and Mohammed the heathens." Medieval
heretics revered him and made him a legendary hero like Merlin, similarly hidden in an enchanted sleep, awaiting his Second Coming. It was believed that Frederick rested in a magic mountain with his
sleeping knights around him, guarded by supernatural ravens. The prophecy of Frederick's awakening or reincarnation did not
remain in the realm of folklore. It was taken up by educated writers
and poets, who made it an article of anti-clerical propaganda. Books
referred to the "old" German prophecy that another Frederick would come from the seed of the first, to humble the German clergy, and
bring peace, prosperity, and freedom to the land..1

FreeWill
Theological doctrine stated that God allows human beings to be
tempted into evil, so by a personal decision each individual may "freely"
elect to resist temptation or not. The doctrine was developed in
answer to the argument that God could prevent sin if he wanted to, and
because he did not prevent it, there was something wrong with him, not with humanity. As 2 Esdras put it: "It had been better not to have
given the earth unto Adam; or else, when it was given him, to have
restrained him from sinning. For what profit is it for men now in this
present time to live in heaviness, and after death to look for
punishment?" The problem was to absolve God from suspicion of a frivolous
malice, like that of a child who teases an animal with food, then
punishes it for eating. If God was all-knowing then he must have known in advance what man would choose, which would take the element of surprise out of human sins. On the other hand, if God couldn't foresee
what man would choose, and could be surprised by human actions,
he wasn't all-knowing.
322



Scotus Erigena piously tried to thrash his way out of the paradox
with a new dogma of "divine ignorance," but unfortunately succeed
ed in demonstrating that God fails to understand what he created.
Erigena said: "There is another kind of ignorance in God, inasmuch as he may be said not to know what things he foreknows and predestines
until they have appeared experientially in the course of created events There is a third kind of divine ignorance, in that God may
be said to be ignorant of things not yet made manifest in their effects
through experience of their action and operation; of which, nevertheless, he holds the invisible cause in himself, by himself created, and to himself known." 2
These subtleties added up to a statement that God doesn't know what he knows, with a hidden conclusion that man is smarter than
God, because man (that is, Erigena) knows all about what God knows and what God doesn't know. Theologians who wrote learnedly on
the subject of God's ignorance were going out on a limb, claiming that they could scrutinize and analyze what they themselves declared inscrutable. So troublesome did the doctrine of free will become that
some Protestant sects, such as Calvinist Presbyterianism, abandoned
it altogether in favor of predestination, stating that every person was already saved or damned from birth by God's unalterable decree.
This idea restored God's omniscience, but eroded the incentive to live a
godly life.
There was an eastern folk tale that allegorized the relationship
between God and humanity as between a wizard-shepherd and his
flock of remarkably intelligent sheep. Knowing that their master would
eventually kill, skin, and eat them, the sheep kept trying to run away, and proved very troublesome. At last the shepherd used his magic
power to put his sheep into a hypnotic trance and gave them suggestions that they would internalize as their own beliefs. He told
[them they were immortal, so death could do them no harm. He
old them to trust in their master's goodness no matter what happened
to them. Finally, he told them not to think about their fate at all,
Decause it wouldn't happen right away. There was no need to anticipate
it. Then the sheep became obedient, and stopped trying to escape. Each one quietly awaited its own death at the master's hand, believing
that it had decided to do so of its own free will. 3
One of the "suppressed" verses of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam Iso made nonsense of the doctrine of free will, after the fashion of
he author of Esdras. In this verse, not man but God was made
esponsible for the Fall, since he had foreseen it, planned it, and
supplied the circumstances that made it inevitable:
O Thou, who Man ofbaser Earth didst make, And even with Paradise devise the Snake; For all the sin wherewith the Face ofMan
Is blackened, Man 's forgiveness give and take!

Freya
var. Frea, Frigga, Frigg
Freya had many alternate names. She was Gerd the Earth Mother, or Eartha; Godiva, "the Goddess"; Syr, "the Sow"; Gefn, "the Giver"; Horn, the holy harlot; the Vanadis; or Mardoll, the Moon
Shining Over the Sea.8 Sometimes she
was simply Lofn, "Love." 9 She was also identified with
Mana, the Moon; or Hel, the underworld; or Nerthus, the primal Goddess of the Plow,
in charge of the fertility of the earth; she separated the island of Zealand from
Sweden by plowing a furrow around it. 10
Freya
Great Goddess of northern Europe, leader of the "primal matri
archs" called Afliae, "powerful ones," or Disk, "divine grandmothers": the same as the Hindu matrikadevis or mother goddesses. Freya was
the Vanadis, the ruling ancestress (dfs) of the Vanir or elder gods, who
ruled before the arrival of Odin and the patriarchal Aesir ("Asians")
from the east. Myths said Odin learned everything he knew about magic
and divine power from Freya. 1
The pagans said nothing could be lucky without Freya's presence. Even the gods languished and began to decline toward death, like mortals, when Freya was taken from them. 2
Like all forms of the Goddess, Freya represented sexual love, which is why her alternate name Frigg became a colloquialism for sexual intercourse. Her consort Frey sometimes took the form of a
phallus. In Uppsala his name was Fricco, "Lover," cognate with the
phallic god Priapus, from the Indo-European root prij, to make love which also gave rise to the modern "prick." 3
Though he was sometimes called Freya's twin brother, like the
Artemis-Apollo, Isis-Osiris pairs, Frey made a lingam-yoni combination with Freya. Their names meant "the Lord" and "the Lady." 4
Some writers identified them with Attis and Cybele, tracing Frigga to
"Frigia" or Phrygia, the Magna Mater's home. 5
Frey was the god of Yule, the pagan solstitial festival assimilated to
Christmas. At the turning of the solar year he was born of his virgin
mother-sister-bride.6 Like other seasonal gods he had a perpetual rival,
Njord, the other half of the year. They were collectively blotgodar (blood-gods), who fought and sacrificed each other over and over. Njord
was called the first god of the Swedes, having ruled before Odin
brought alien gods from Asia. Frey was another aspect of him, wor
shipped in the sacred grove at Uppsala long before it was taken over
by Odin's priests. 7 The grove itself stood for the body of the Goddess.
Many of Freya's names were only kennings (metaphors) from the hymns composed in her honor by her skalds. Focusing on the theme
of love, and known as mansongr, "woman songs," these compositions jj were specifically forbidden by the medieval church. 11 Despite the
opposition of the clergy, Germans persisted in believing that Freya's sacred day, Friday, was the luckiest day for weddings. 12 Freya or one of her equivalents married each of the early Swedish ; kings: "They were regarded in heathen times as the husbands of the
fertility goddess. . . . [T]hey suffered a real or symbolic death in that capacity when their time of supremacy came to an end." Scandina
vian Aryans followed the typical pattern of sacred marriage between
Goddess and king, the latter becoming identified with the male
fertility deity whose function it was "to die for the land and for his
people, while the goddess never dies. Her function is to weep over
him, perhaps to help bring about his return, or to give birth to the divine a
child who is to take his place." 13 (See Kingship.)
324



After their abrupt sacrificial deaths, Freya kept the spirits of slain Friday kings and heroes in her Fensalirox Marsh-halls, also called Folkvangr, the Field of Warriors. 14 They could be reborn after spending a ^^^^^^^^^^
cycle of time in the wet, fertile earth-womb. Freya's Marsh-halls
recall the "bog" where Baal-Hadad lay for seven years before he was
resurrected to godhood by priestesses of Asherah. 15 Like the early
Semitic worshippers of the Great Mother, Aryans were "men of clay" the meaning of their name because their bodies came forth from Modir. This meant the root of both "mud" and "mother"; she was
the same primal creatress whom the Russians called Moist Mother
Earth. 16 Modir too was another manifestation of Freya.
She was especially linked with the strange archaic god Heimdall, whose name meant "a ram," undoubtedly one of the ubiquitous animal substitutes for a human sacrifice. The ram's horn was Heimdall's
ringing Gjallarhorn, on which he blew the Last Trump to announce the coming of doomsday and the world's destruction. In the Bible,
magic ram's horns were supposed to bring about the destruction of Jericho in the same manner. 17 The link between Heimdall and Freya
suggested her Kali-like function as a Destroying Goddess, which she would assume when men and gods displeased her by forgetting her
principles of right living, justice, honor, and peace. She knew more
magic than the gods. Her knowledge was collectively seidr, cognate of Sanskrit siddhi, the miraculous powers developed by the practice of
yoga. Freya had so many incarnations and aspects that the scholars who
tried to characterize her by only one of them soon ran into a mass of
contradictions. She was called the Goddess of fertility, love, the moon,
the sea, the earth, the underworld, death, birth; virgin, mother,
ancestress, queen of heaven, ruler of fate, of the stars, of magic; the Great Sow wedded to the sacrificial boar; the Mistress of Cats; the
leader of Valkyries; the Saga or "sayer" who inspired all sacred poetry. In sum, she was as many-sided as any other version of the Goddess.

Friday
Day of the Goddess Freya, called unlucky by Christian monks,
because everything associated with female divinity was so called. Friday
the 13 th was said to be especially unlucky because it combined the
Goddess's sacred day with her sacred number, drawn from the 1 3 months of the pagan lunar year. (See Menstrual Calendar.)
Romans named the day dies Veneris after Venus, their own

version of the same Goddess. In modern French, Friday is still
vendredi, 1 and in Italian, venerdi. Friday used to be the seventh day of the week. It was the Sabbath
of the Jewish lunar calendar and is still the Sabbath of Islam.
Scandinavian pagans, Hindus, and rural Scots insisted that Friday was
the most propitious day for a marriage because it was the day that
favored fertility.
Fish were eaten on Friday as fertility charms, in honor of Venus (or Freya) whose totems they were. Fish are still considered "aphro
disiac" food because they were sacred to Aphrodite. Thus the Catholic
habit of eating fish on Friday was wholly pagan in origin. But the church never acknowledged the debt. In the Middle Ages, when pagan
votaries of Freya continued to celebrate her rites on Friday, church
men designated her day as the day of "devil worship." 2

Cylinder seals A type of sculpture that developed in Mesopotamia during the protoliterate period. Cylinder seals were small stone
cylinders with figures carved in relief, to be rolled across a tablet of wet clay which would then take the
impression of a picture. Subjects were usually magical or religious.
Frog
Medieval totems of witches were frogs because ancient traditions
associated the frog with Hecate Egypt's Hekat, Queen of the Heaven
ly midwives. Egyptians made the frog a symbol of the fetus. Hekat's
sacred Amulet of the Frog bore the words, "I Am the Resurrection,"
another phrase of birth-magic copied by early Christians. 1 In Rome, the frog was sacred to Venus, of whom Hecate was one
aspect. Her triple yoni sometimes was shown as a fleur-de-lis com
posed of three frogs. 2 To this day, a garment closure of cord shaped like
a fleur-de-lis is called a "frog." Tailors' folklore said every garment
should have exactly nine frogs, which might be traced all the way back
to Babylonian cylinder seals showing nine frogs as a fertility charm: the Ninefold Goddess ruling the nine months of gestation. 3

Furies
Also called Erinyes or Eumenides, the Furies personified the vengeful moods of the Triple Goddess Demeter, who was also called Erinys as a punisher of sinners. The three Erinyes were emanations of her. "Whenever their number is mentioned there are three of them But
they can all be mentioned together as a single being, an Erinys. The proper meaning of the word is a 'spirit of anger and revenge' Above all they represented the Scolding Mother. Whenever a mother was
insulted, or perhaps even murdered, the Erinyes appeared. Like swift bitches they pursued all who had flouted blood-kinship and the deference due to it." '
Greeks believed the blood of a slain mother infected her murderer
with a dread spiritual poison, miasma, the Mother's Curse. It drew
the implacable Furies to their victim, and also infected any who dared
help him. In fear of the Furies' attention, lest they might have
inadvertently assisted a matricide, people called the Furies "Good Ones" (Eumenides), hoping to divert their wrath.
Aeschylus called the Furies "Children of Eternal Night." Sopho
cles called them "Daughters of Earth and Shadow." Their individual
names were Tisiphone (Retaliation-Destruction), Megaera (Grudge), and Alecto (the Unnameable). Some said they were born of the
blood of the castrated Heavenly Father, Uranus; others said they were older than any god. 2 Their antiquity is demonstrated by the fact that
they were invoked against killers of kinfolk in the female line only: a
relic of the matriarchal age, when all genealogies were reckoned
through women. 3
Aeschylus's drama The Eumenides presented the Furies pursuing Drestes for killing his mother, Queen Clytemnestra; but they cared lothing for the murder of the father. He was not a real member of the
:lan. When Orestes asked them why they didn't punish Clytemnestra
or murdering her husband, they answered, "The man she killed was lot of blood congenital." Orestes inquired (as if he didn't know), 'But am I then involved with my mother by blood bond?" The Furies
napped, "Murderer, yes. How else could she have nursed you >eneath her heart? Do you forswear your mother's intimate blood?" 4 In
hort, the Furies harked back to a matriarchal clan system like the one
n pre-Christian Britain, where "the son loved the father no more than a
stranger." 5 Indeed the name of the archaic Triple Goddess of
Ireland, Erin, or Eriu, has been linked with the triple Erinyes. 6 The Furies were also "fairies," identified with witches because of
327



Furrow their ability to lay curses on any who transgressed their law. Such "fairies" may have been real witches who tried to defend the rights of ^^^^^^^^^^ women against encroachment by Christian laws. Their modus ope
randi could have been similar to that of the Women's Devil Bush
society in Africa: if a woman complained to this society that her husband abused her, he soon died of a mysterious dose of poison. 7
Christianity adopted the Furies, incongruously enough, as servants of the patriarchal God. They became part of God's penal system in
hell: dog-faced she-demons known as Furies Who Sow Evil, Accusers
or Examiners, and Avengers of Crimes. 8 Their duty, as always, was
to punish sinners. As "grotesques" they appeared on the tympanum of
Bourges Cathedral, with large pregnant bellies bearing the full
moon's Gorgon face, and pendulous breasts terminating in dogs' heads.9 Greek art, however, depicted them as stern-faced but beauti
ful women, bearing torches and scourges, with serpents wreathed in their hair like the Gorgons. 10
Although classical tradition understood the Fury as a symbol of the
impersonal functioning of justice, yet she came to represent men's hidden fear of women, an image apparently still viable. Psychiatric Worldview says:
To those men who are aware ofcontemporary changes it becomes abundantly clear that there are a number ofopenly angry women around. . . . Men trained to recognize and enhance their own anger and
aggressiveness in a society where rape and revenge are commonplace view angry women with alarm. . . . Men see women project onto them the
full extent of their own potential aggressiveness. The spectre ofan angry Fury or Medusa 's head strikes fear in men, which is then often
awkwardly handled because men are not supposed to display fear. A woman seeking only reasonable social or vocational equity may be
perceived by a man as being out to get the kind ofrevenge that his
pride would require had he experienced the narcissistic and practical
wounds that she has sustained. "

Furrow
World-wide female-genital symbol, often combined with a male
symbol in agrarian religions. Indian scriptures made the Earth-mother Sita, "Furrow," the wife of Rama, whose name meant "Enjoyment of Virility" and who was an incarnation of the phallic Krishna. 1 Ancient
Egypt celebrated an important annual rite called "the finding of the
scepter of flint in the furrow of [the Goddess] Maat."2 Similarly, Rome
kept a sexual-symbolic festival devoted to finding "the flints of
Jupiter" in a sacred furrow representing Ceres or Ops, Mother Earth. 5
The city of Rome itself was established by plowing a furrow, an act
328



attributed to the legendary Romulus. A pre-Roman ancestral hero Furrow called Tages was said to be "born from the furrow" as a son of Mother
Earth.4 ^^^^^
The name of the zodiacal sign of the Virgin originally meant
"Furrow." 5 Its principal star, Spica, was known in Babylon as "the corn-ear of the Goddess Shala." Corn-ear meant the shibboleth dis
played at the culmination of the rites of Ishtar, Astarte, and Demeter, all of whom were also the Furrow. Demeter made Iasion or Iasus her
lover "in a thrice-plowed field," giving him the name of Triptolemus, "Three Plowings," because he entered the Furrow three times. He was also surnamed Soter, meaning both "Savior" and "Sower."
Seed entering the furrow was almost invariably likened to semen
entering the womb, as shown by numerous pagan savior-gods who entered their Mother in the form of seed and were reborn as new vegetation. The Latin god Semo Sancus, whose name meant both "seed" and "semen," mated thus with Ops and died in her embrace, to
regenerate himself. 6 The classic custom of plowing a furrow for magical protection
around a town was perpetuated by country folk all over Europe. Even in the 20th century, Russian villages were annually "purified" by the same ceremony, which remained exclusively in the hands of women. Nine virgins and three old women (representing the Fate
sisters, or Zorya) plowed a furrow around the village at midnight,
calling on the Moon-goddess. Armed with scythes, clubs, and animal
skulls, they struck down and beat any man they happened to encounter while performing this magic. 7

Galahad
Son and reincarnation of Lancelot, by Elaine the Lily Maid, who was also Lancelot's mother Queen Elaine for Lancelot and Galahad were
mystically identical. Queen Elaine's son Galahad was taken to Mei
delant, the holy Land of Maidens, where the Lady of the Lake brought him up and changed his name to Lancelot. Afterward he coupled with the Lily Maid and begot himself as a new Galahad the same
Oedipal idea running through all mythology, even in Christian
father-son identity (see Incest). As a sacred king, Galahad ruled his land for a term of one year,
then died "suddenly, at the altar," while experiencing a vision of the
Holy Grail, his Mother-symbol. He was carried to heaven by angels.
1
When the monks rewrote his story, Galahad was viewed as a purer
knight than his father-predecessor Lancelot, whose life was marred by I "the vile sin of lust." Galahad was chosen to realize the Grail quest
because he was the only knight in the whole company of the Round
Table who was still virgin. 2 This Christianized Galahad was said to have
j
descended from Joseph of Arimathea; but another author announced through Guinevere that Galahad was a descendant of Jesus himself. 3

Galatea
"Milk-giving Goddess," a title of White Aphrodite of Paphos, where her high priest Pygmalion "married" her, by keeping her white image id his bed. 1 The custom formed a basis for the classical myth of
332



Galatea's marble statue brought to life by Aphrodite for her bridegroom. Galileo rhe story probably arose from a ritual of invocation, to call down the Goddess's spirit into her sculptured eidolon. ^^^^^^^^^^^
Galatea was another name not only for Aphrodite but also for
Egyptian Hathor the Celestial Cow, and Phoenician Astarte, the
lame milk-giving Mother. Pygmalion was a Hellenized version of her
iigh priest Pumiyathon at Byblos. 2 Celtic tribes from Galatia named after her also worshipped the
hilk-giving Mother as Galata, from whom Gauls and Gaels traced heir descent. 3 Their early-medieval hero Galahad was one of her sacred lings. He was a Gaulish form of Heracles, who married the Gauls'
ncestral Goddess Galata, sometimes symbolized in Britain as Albion, he White Moon, source of the Milky Way. Heracles also was a
plar hero who lived for a year like Galahad in the palace of the
Goddess, at the hub of the spinning wheel of the galaxy (Milky Way). In this Lydian story the Goddess was called Omphale, the
center," or omphalos. When the year turned around this hub full
lircle, Heracles too was supposed to die the year-god's death in a fiery
Iheel. 4
All the names of Galatea-Galata-Galatia were based on gala,
mother's milk," for the Goddess was supposed to have made the
Lheel of the stars and constellations from her own milk. 5 Therefore the
Moon-goddess often appeared in ancient iconography as the divine low, horned like the moon.

Salileo
[he first Christian man to achieve visual confirmation of the true
lotion of heavenly bodies. Before Galileo, all Christendom accepted le church's view that man and his works stood at the center of the
niverse, on a fixed earth surrounded by "spheres" of sun, moon,
lanets, and stars. This was the biblical view, supported by such
rlibles
as Albert the Great, Isidore of Seville, St. Thomas Aquinas. The Dark Age had destroyed or forgotten ancient astronomers' owledge of the solar system. Aristarchus taught about 275 B.C. that
le earth is a revolving globe in orbit around the sun. Eratosthenes
x>ut 250 b.c. calculated the circumference of the globe at 24,662
liles, less than 300 miles short of the true figure, 24,902. About
40 b.c, Hipparchus calculated the diameter of the moon, and its
istance from the earth, within a few miles of the correct figures.
1 But
cording to Christian authorities, this information was pagan and

Galileo
Index of Prohibited Books (Index Librorum Prohibitorum) The first official edition
appeared in 1559, though ecclesiastical authorities censored, condemned, and
destroyed various kinds of books from the earliest centuries of the Christian era. Catholics were forbidden to read any books listed on the Index, which was
regularly updated. Observation of this
prohibition was
obligatory up to 1966, when Pope Paul VI
suppressed the Index.
around the sun. After hesitating and re-checking his results for nearly 1
thirty years, Copernicus published his book in 1 543. It was not well received by Catholics or Protestants. Martin Luther scoffed at it:
"People give ear to an upstart astrologer who strove to show that the earth revolves, not the heavens or the firmament, the sun and the moon. . . . This fool wishes to reverse the entire science of astrono
my; but sacred scripture tells us that Joshua commanded the sun to
stand still, and not the earth." 2
The Roman church investigated Copernicus's theory by consultingthe scriptures, and placed his book on the Index of Prohibited
Books, where it remained until 1835. The pope announced, "The first proposition, that the sun is the center and does not revolve about the
earth, is foolish, absurd, false in theology and heretical, because express
ly contrary to Holy Scripture. The second proposition, that the earth revolves about the sun and is not the center, is absurd, false in
philosophy and . . . opposed to the true faith." Copernicus's calculations nevertheless fascinated Giordano Bruno,
who accepted the heliocentric theory, attacked St. Thomas Aquinas's I
cosmology of the spheres, published an early elucidation of the nebular hypothesis, and even developed something like a theory of evolution. I He also doubted the reality of witchcraft and asserted that most women
burned at the stake were innocent. He was silenced in the same way: I
burned on the Campo dei Fiori in 1600.
Ten years later, Galileo's little telescope revealed the phases of Venus, the moons of Jupiter, and the moving spots on the sun. Galileo
invited clergymen to look through the telescope for themselves, but
they refused, saying it would imperil their souls because objects like the moons of Jupiter were illusions of the devil. The Church said there
could be only seven planets, because scripture presented seven archan
gels, seven churches of Asia, seven golden candlesticks, and other such allegories. One of the church's main objections at the time to
Galileo's discoveries was that they upset the received knowledge of
the zodiacal system; learned ecclesiastics leaned heavily on the guidance
of astrology. In 1632, Galileo published his Dialogue, with overwhelming prod
of the Copernican theory. There was a storm of opposition from the
|
church, which went on for many years and involved priests, cardinals, I and two popes. A document was forged and "found" in the church's I files, to the effect that Galileo had been previously forbidden to teach or
discuss Copernicanism, on pain of punishment by the Inquisition. Galileo was arrested, threatened with torture, and forced to abjure on I his knees, vowing to "curse and detest the error and the heresy of the I
movement of the earth." According to legend, he went on to whisper I under his breath, Eppursimuove "But it does move." Pope Paul
V closed the subject with a solemn statement: "The doctrine of the
double motion of the earth about its axis and about the sun is false,
and entirely contrary to Holy Scripture." 3
334



The pope forbade interment of Galileo's remains in his family
tomb, directing that he be buried without ceremony, monument, or epitaph. His memory was execrated for two centuries, for what Pope Urban VIII called "so great a scandal to Christendom." Ecclesiastical censors ordered that a later scientific work calling Galileo "renowned"
must alter the word to "notorious." In 1846, Monsignor Marini was
given the job of publishing the records of Galileo's trial and falsifying them to the church's advantage. The deception was uncovered by
M. L'Epinois twenty years later. 4 Many books were hurried forth under ecclesiastical auspices to confute Galileo. Some contained very quaint reasoning, like Chiaramonti's:
Animals, which move, have limbs and muscles; the earth has no limbs or muscles, therefore it does not move. It is angels who make Saturn, Jupiter, the sun, etc., turn round. Ifthe earth revolves, it must also have an
angel in the center to set it in motion; but only devils live there; it would therefore be a devil who would impart motion to the earth. 5
The naive theology of the time often declared that if the earth
moved, a stone dropped from a height would fall some way behind the spot directly below. Theology was shackled to the dictum of St.
Augustine: "Nothing is to be accepted save on the authority of the Scripture, since greater is that authority than all the powers of the human mind." 6 Voetius in 17th-century Utrecht repeated the same dictum: "Not a word is contained in the Holy Scriptures which is not
in the strictest sense inspired, the very punctuation not excepted." 7 Even in the late 1 9th century, churchmen were still beating the
dead horse of biblical cosmology. A president of the Lutheran
Teachers' Seminary published a book refuting Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Newton, and all subsequent astronomers:
The entire Holy Scripture settles the question that the earth is the
principal body ofthe universe, that it stands fixed, and that sun and moon serve only to light it. . . . God never lies, never makes a mistake; ou ofhis mouth comes only truth when he speaks ofthe structure ofthe
universe, ofthe earth, sun, moon, and stars. 8
In 1885 the Catholic scholar St. George Mivart realized that
God had indeed lied about the structure of the universe, and hypothe
sized that God had deliberately led his popes and cardinals into error
jin order to teach them that astronomy lay outside their jurisdiction. This
[became the accepted Catholic view of the Galileo fiasco.9 It was a
(view that did irreparable damage to the doctrine of papal infallibility, and
lopened the way to future doubts about God's veracity. If he deceived Ihis chosen envoys in one matter, who could be sure he didn't deceive
Ithem in others?
The battle with Galileo set the pattern for three centuries of
[ecclesiastical condemnation of each new discovery in an Age of
Enlightenment when almost all scientific knowledge was found to be

Ganesha contrary to Holy Writ. Linnaeus's observations of the sexual system Ganges of plants were banned. The theological faculty of the Sorbonne forced ^^^^^^^^^am Buffon to publish a recantation of his geological discoveries "which
may be contrary to the narrative of Moses." Bernouilli was forced to
expunge from his works the proof that the living body constantly changes its parts, because this contradicted the church's doctrine of the
resurrection of the flesh. The Egyptologist Sir J. G. Wilkinson had to
"modify" ancient Egyptian chronology because it interfered with the
biblical flood myth. Dr. Franz Gall was forbidden to study the struc
ture of the human brain on the ground that it was "blasphemous." 10
Nearly every important scientific book of these three centuries
appeared on the Index of Prohibited Books, "infallibly" declared false
because it contradicted the Bible. The biologist Huxley said he encoun
tered in every path of natural science a barrier reading: "No
thoroughfare. Moses." 11 In 1832, Pope Gregory XVI's encyclical Mirari vos declared war on (1) all forms of society founded on liberty
of conscience; (2) liberty of the press, "which cannot be sufficiently execrated and condemned, for by its means all evil doctrines are
propagated"; and (3) liberty of scientific research. 12 Stanton says, "All
through the centuries scholars and scientists have been imprisoned, tortured and burned alive for some discovery which seemed to conflict
with a petty text of Scripture." 13 The Galileo case was the very
beginning of a long retreat.

"Lord of Hosts," Hindu elephant god who begot Buddha on the
virgin Maya. 1 At Elephantine in Egypt he appeared as a form of
Yahweh, consort of the Goddess Anath, or "the Virgin Zion." He
also reappeared in the Bible as Behemoth, who later became a demon.

Ganges
River of the Goddess Ganga, daughter of the Mountain-mother Nanda Devi (Blessed Goddess), one of the Himalayas. Ganga's waters
represented baptism and redemption. Shiva's hymn of praise to her said: "Heaps of sin, accumulated by a sinner during millions of births,
are destroyed by the mere contact of a wind charged with her vapor. ... As fire consumes fuel, so this stream consumes the sins of the
wicked. Sages mount the staired terrace of the Ganges; on it they

dissolution of the universe." ' No wonder millions come from all over
India to bathe in Ganga's magic waters.

Ganymede
"Rejoicing in virility," the boy-lover given to Father Zeus by Hellenic writers anxious to create a divine prototype for their cult of
homosexuality. Ganymede was carried to heaven on an eagle's back to slake Zeus's lust. He became Cupbearer to the Gods, replacing Hebe
who was the virgin aspect of Mother Hera. 1 Thus the dispenser of immortality was made male instead of female.
1. Graves, CM. 1,116-17.
Garlic
Throughout the Christian era, garlic was considered a protection against vampires and werewolves, as efficacious as a crucifix if not more
so. The source of this belief might be found in pagan tradition, since
blood-drinking revenants were simply diabolized versions of pagans who
believed they could attain immortality by drinking the blood of gods other than Christ. Garlic and garlic-eaters were taboo in Greco-Roman
temples of the Mother of the Gods. Probably the Goddess's dislike of
garlic was based on its unsuitability for group contact and sexual
worship, which required sweet-smelling breath.
Gautama
Hindu sage who castrated the god Indra and took his wife from him,
in a primitive Oedipal myth recounted in the Ramayana. 1 Gautama was one of the many names of Buddha, of whom the archaic sage was one emanation.

^^m___^^^^^ Another battle story made Gawain symbolize the new sun at the
turning of the year. He beheaded the Green Knight (old year) at the festival of the winter solstice, and had to submit to a similar fate himself
at the following New Year. 1
Along with his three brothers Gaheris, Gareth, and Agravine, Gawain represented the Celtic sacred year with its four quarters. All four were born of the Triple Goddess under the name of Margawse,
Arthur's sister-wife, who also gave birth to Mordred, Arthur's son
nephew, destined to defeat and replace him. (See Arthur.)

Gehenna
Valley of Hinnom outside Jerusalem, once the site of a fire-altar
called Tophet, where sacrifices were made to the Tyrian god Moloch,
Molech, or Melek, "the King," worshipped by Solomon
(1 Kings 11:7). After the Jews gave up passing their firstborn children "through
the fire to Molech" (Leviticus 18:21), the shrine was abandoned.
The valley became a dump where rubbish, including corpses of criminals and other outcasts, was burned. 1 Thus the stench and fire
associated with Gehenna eventually made its name a synonym for hell.
The Jews elaborated the basic seven-layered Babylonian underworld into a mystic Gehenna sixty times as big as the world, where each "palace" had 6,000 houses, and each house had 6,000 vessels of fire and gall. Prince of Gehenna was Arsiel, copied from the
Babylonian netherworld god Aciel, "Black Sun," negative aspect of the sun god. 2 In Gehenna's central pit lived the serpent-angel Apollyon,
another name for the same negative aspect of the sun god Apollo
(Revelation 9:11).

Genevieve, Saint
"Generator of Life," a canonized Gallic Diana, patron of Paris. In her church at Andernach she was a "queen" who lived in a sacred cave and bore a holy child. She could take the form of a white hind, like
the Goddess. One King Siegfried met her while he was hunting, married her, and became her Lord of the Hunt. 1 The Frankish king Clovis had himself buried in the shrine of
"St. Genevieve," which Gregory of Tours insisted on calling by its newer name, the Church of the Holy Apostles Saints Peter and Paul; but in Gregory's time it was still remembered as the temple of the
338



Goddess. 2 Gregory's history, written over a century later and full of Genius
legendary material, is the only extant source of information about Clovis George, Saint
or Genevieve.
St. Genevieve's runic emblem was a pentacle raised above a cross:
a strong hint of paganism. 3 The people of Paris still commemorate
the occasion in 1 129 when her holy relics allegedly halted an epidemic
in the city. 4

Genius
"Begetter," a Roman word for a spirit of paternal ancestry, cognate
with Arabic djinni or genie. Each Roman man had his personal genius
as a guardian angel or familiar; each woman had a corresponding female spirit called a juno. 1 In the time of the empire, the word genius
came to be applied to both sexes. Official prayers were addressed to the "Genius of Rome, whether masculine or feminine, whether god or
goddess." 2 The meaning of genius changed again in the Middle Ages, when it
was virtually synonymous with "spirit." One could speak of a genius loci, spirit of a place; or an "evil genius," a demon. The modern
meaning, an exceptionally intelligent or inspired person, was of late origin. In 1875 a.d., James Hinton defined genius as "the woman in man." 3 In this sense a genius was very similar to a Muse or a Shakti.

George, Saint
Fictitious patron saint of England. St. George's Day was known to the Romans as the Feast of Pales, a fertility festival. Medieval custom
honored St. George on Easter Monday, the Moon-day following the Sun-day of the Christian hero. Folklore named the pagan savior Green
George, a spirit of spring.
1 His image was common in old church
carvings, a human head surrounded by leaves or looking out of a tree
trunk. Some called him the witches' god, "a confused idea of
something between a tree and a man," or "the devil in the shape of a trunk of a tree . . . with some form of a human face." 2
St. George the Dragon-slayer apparently evolved from a mythic meld of Green George with an Arian bishop of Alexandria who opposed St. Athanasius, and put to death an orthodox Master of the
Mint named Dracontius, "Dragon." ? St. George's emblem was a vesica piscis, a prime fertility symbol because it represented the Goddess's yoni; but Christian authorities
preferred to interpret it as a "shield." Still, George was so shamelessly involved in fertility rites that the church discredited him and began

Ghora calling him "the imaginary saint." An old English ballad said: "Some
Giants say there was no George; some, that there no Dragon was; pray God, ^mmmmmmm^^^^m there was at least a maid." 4

Ghora
"Horrible," the third of Vishnu's three boar-children destined for
sacrifice so their "energy" (blood) might nourish and uphold the world.
Their names probably were based on archaic titles of the Triple Goddess; the first two meant "Well-Rounded One," and "Golden
One." Ghora personified a primal taboo, as did the Greek Gorgon who was also "Horrible." Ghora was destructive, therefore sacrificed
with his siblings "for the sake of the three universes," for these boar
children were capable of destroying even the gods in the highest heaven. 1
l.O'Flaherty, 193-96.
Ghost
A cognate of "guest," both words rooted in Germanic Geist, originally a spirit of a dead ancestor invited to tribal feasts on such occasions as
Samhain (Halloween) and other solemn ceremonies. Many Europe
an peoples preserved the heads or skulls of ancestors, which were set up,
painted, and decorated, in a prominent position at gatherings of the clan, and were consulted for oracles after being offered their portion of
the collation. Hence the "Death's-head at the feast." During later
Christian times the custom was discouraged, for the church's doctrine of resurrection of the flesh forbade burial of bodies without heads.
Nevertheless, the visiting ghost was an ineradicable belief. Ghosts were
supposed to haunt all the scenes of their former lives, especially if
they died violently or unhappily, or were buried in unconsecrated
ground, or had possessed evil spirits. The earlier, more benevolent
type of family ghost is still suggested by the identical pronunciation of
"ghost" and "guest" in northern England. 1 The anger of ghosts was most feared by people who refused to honor them as guests.

Giants
Appearing in every mythology as a primal Elder Race, giants were obvious projections of every child's earliest perceptions of the adult
world. Like grownups seen through the eye of the toddler, giants

Itended to be fearsome, sometimes bloodthirsty but sometimes benevo- Giants
Blent; possessors of an arcane ancient wisdom; and adepts of magic. According to the Bible, giants were like all Savior-figures up to and ^^^^^^^^^^^
(including Jesus: offspring of divine fathers and human mothers
(Genesis 6:4). Semitic tradition held that all the biblical patriarchs were
of enormous size. Abraham was seventy times as big as a modern
man. Philo maintained that Adam was a giant. 1 Unlettered Arabs still
say the megalithic structures being studied by archeologists were not so hard for the ancient people to build, because those people were
giants. 2 Long before the Bible was written, Hindus were saying the same
of the people of the Golden Age, in the childhood stage of humanity.
Like parent figures, the earliest races were gigantic, sinless, wise, and long-lived. They died only when they wished to. They could live a thousand years because, in their age, life was "centered in the blood" i.e., the immortal blood of the Goddess. 3 (See Menstrual Blood.)
That this life-giving blood was a feminine effluent is suggested by the
story of Thor's journey to Giant-land to learn the secrets of the
giants' ancient magic; he could not find the right way until he crossed a
river of the giantesses' menstrual blood.4 In Greece, the similar river
leading to the land of "ancestors" was the Styx.
Greeks called the giants Titans, offspring of Mother Earth and
Father Sky (Uranus). The heavenly Father was jealous of his children and tried to smother them by clinging too closely to Mother Earth to let them breathe air. Earth gave her son Cronus the moon-sickle and bade him castrate and kill his Father. Later, Cronus married Rhea
the Titaness another incarnation of the same Mother Earth and
feared the same Oedipal fate from the other end. To preserve his own life, he swallowed his children. The mother saved one of them, Zeus, who did indeed attack his father and marry the same Mother Earth
under a variety of her names Hera, Olympia, Rhea, Gaea, or Danae. The Oedipal theme of the father-son rivals almost always
appears in connection with the giant-myths. 5
Greeks assigned to the Titans all the crude religious rites of their
ancestors, such as cannibalistic sacraments and dismemberment of
divine victims like Dionysus or Zagreus. As archaic earth-deities, the
Titans battled the newer Olympian gods in a myth known as the
Giants' Revolt, paralleled by Persian, Jewish, and Christian stories of the War in Heaven. 6 One of the mythic reasons given for the war was
Zeus's punishment of the Titans for eating Dionysus's flesh; but Zeus,
inconsistently, himself devoured Dionysus's heart. Legends of giant ancestors were used by Christians to defend the
fraudulent miracle-working bones of the Holy Innocents supposedly slaughtered by King Herod. When it was observed that these profitable bones were too large to have come from children less than two years of age, churchmen argued that the human frame was bigger in Herod's
time, because it was closer to the age of giants. 8 The Irish said giant people still lived in "the chambered under

eval folklore as Titania, the Fairy Queen. 10 Curiously, though she was a Titaness and the Tuatha De Danann were giants, they shrank as
popular belief in their powers waned before the encroachment of the
new religion. Eventually they became fairies or elves, not giants but "little people," the size of children or even smaller. 11 This reduction in
their size was surely related to a reduction in awesomeness. Signifi
cantly, their religious myths became "fairy tales" for children, and many
of their liturgies and sacred songs reappeared in the guise of nursery
rhymes.

Giles, Saint
Druidic deity adopted into the Christian canon. His legend originated
at Nimes, named after the Dianic moon-grave or nemeton. (See
Grove, Sacred.) He was nurtured in a cave by a magic hind, the Goddess in deer shape. He was identified with the Celtic hero Oisin, whose mother was a deer. 1 Like most Celtic Lords of the Hunt, he
was slain by arrows. Enacting the hero's Liebestod, as he died he
clasped the same magic hind in his arms.
Some said St. Giles was a Greek, born in Athens, possibly to account for his connection with such deer-gods as Actaeon, whose cult was dedicated to the same Diana. 2 Another such hero was Tele
phus, king of Mysia. In infancy he was nursed by a doe and discovered by shepherds. An oracle sent him to Mysia where he married
the queen, his own mother Auge, in typically Oedipal fashion. 3 Like the smith-priests of the archaic Diana, St. Giles was lame, and
so became the patron saint of cripples. Because of his enormous
popularity, a fictitious "Life" was composed for him in the 10th
century. More than 1 50 churches were dedicated to him, including
St. Giles Cripplegate in London and the high kirk in Edinburgh. 4 Yet his legend had almost nothing Christian about it, and his sainthood
was based on forgery.

Gilgamesh
Hero of a Sumero-Babylonian epic recounting man's vain search for
the immortality guarded by the jealous gods. The principal extant text came from the library of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh, 7th century B.C.; but older fragments reveal the story in Babylon at a much earlier date, the beginning of the second millenium B.C. 1
342



Fearful of death, Gilgamesh journeyed in search of Uta-Napishtim Glory-of-Elves
(Noah), the flood hero who was the only immortal man, to learn his Gnosticism
secret. After many adventures Gilgamesh found the patriarch, who ^^^^^^^^^^^
showed him a magic "rose" of eternal life. Gilgamesh took the plant, but it was stolen from him by a serpent. Thus the serpent became the
only immortal creature, capable of shedding its skin and becoming
periodically reborn without any sojourn in the land of death.
On his journey, Gilgamesh met the Goddess disguised as an
innkeeper that is, the dispenser of the Wine of Immortality to the
I gods. She was called Siduri Sabitu, the Wine-Bearer, later adopted by
Sufi philosophers as the Goddess Saki, who poured for each man the cup of "reality revealed." 2 In Greek, she was Oenothea, "Wine
goddess." 3 She revealed reality to Gilgamesh by advising him to abandon the search for immortality, because the cruel gods decreed that all human
Ibeings must die. She told Gilgamesh to return home, to take pleasure in
the good things of life while he could: to bathe and dress himself, eat
and drink, play with his children, make love to his wife, and "make
Jevery day a festival." 4
Siduri's live-for-today philosophy was copied into the ninth chapter
of Ecclesiastes, a curiously pagan passage wherein the "word of God"
Idenies the after-life with all its rewards or punishments, and the Judeo
IChristian deity dispenses no justice.

Gnosticism
"Knowledge." Gnosticism was a general term for mystery cults of the early Christian era and for derivative heresies of the medieval period.
Their "knowledge" meant secrets of the after-life, spells and words of
power required for advantageous placement in heaven, and revelations of the true nature of God. Leading Gnostic sects focused on the
Great Mother and her Dying God e.g., Eleusinian, Orphic, and Osirian mysteries. Angus says Gnosticism was "for over half a
millenium the approach to religion for thoughtful minds." ' Tantric-style meditation and sexual rites figured in western Gnosti
cism, including sects that were fundamentally Christian. As the ultimate aim of Tantric yoga was to enter the primal realm of Silence, a

Gnosticism
Origen (Origenes Adamantius) Christian father, ca. 185-254
a.d., an Egyptian who wrote in Greek,
exerting a powerful influence on the early Greek church. At first he was accounted a saint, but three centuries after his death he was declared a heretic because of Gnostic elements found in his writings.
Tertullian (Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus) Influential early Christian writer and father of the church, ca. 155-220 a.d., born in Car
thage of pagan parents.
Irenaeus Doctor, saint, and father of the church, said to have lived in the 2nd century a.d. as bishop of
Lyons. His history is obscure, largely based on (possibly fraudulent) assertions of Eusebius, who claimed to have letters from Irenaeus, but none of these
were preserved. The story of Irenaeus's
martyrdom has been proved false.
feminine power enfolding the original Creative Word, the Logos, so Gnostic Christians sought communion with the Goddess Sige (Silence)
who dwelt at the beginning of all things. 2 She gave birth to Sophia (Wisdom, or Knowledge), the Gnostic Great Mother, both spouse and mother of God. Some Gnostics adopted the Oriental idea of the world soul,
identified with Sophia, sometimes in androgynous communion with God. This was the view of the church father Origen, who was revered
in his time but three centuries later excommunicated for holding
heretical beliefs. 3 He said, "As our body while consisting of human
members is yet held together by one soul, so the universe is to be
thought of as an immense living being which is held together by one soul." 4 The trouble with the world soul from the Christian point of
view was that it mingled the blessed with the damned in one divine
spirit, preventing the separation of sheep and goats that was thought
necessary at doomsday. The orthodox church especially objected to Gnostic feminine
imagery. It was impossible to see God deserving the Great Mother's punishment, as the Gnostics said he did. Followers of St. Paul de
nounced the Gnostics as firstborn of Satan, ravening wolves,
demoniacs, atheists, robbers, pirates, beasts in human shape, and dealers in deadly poison typical of the insults Christian traded with Chris
tian in those times. 5
From the 4th to the 8th centuries, the church incessantly persecut ed Gnostic minorities. Nevertheless, "Secret fraternities perpetuated the doctrines of Gnosticism and the illuminism of the Pagan religions
for many centuries after their supposed disappearance." 6 Gnostic cult
objects have been found throughout Sicily, Spain, and southern France,
especially the coffrets gnostiques or sacred boxes, like Greek cistae or
Semitic "arks," dating from the early Middle Ages. 7 Church fathers were particularly offended by the Gnostics' pro- i
pensity to admit women to ecclesiastical rank: "All initiates, men and
women alike . . . might be elected to serve as priest, bishop, or prophet" Tertullian reported with horror that Gnostic women "teach, they
engage in discussion; they exorcise; they cure." They even baptized,
showing that they had episcopal status. "They all have access equally,
they listen equally, they pray equally even pagans, if any happen to come. . . .They also share the kiss of peace with all who come." 8 Some Gnostic groups went so far as to claim the true revelation ofi
esoteric Christianity came through a woman, the "apostle to the apostles," Mary Magdalene, Jesus's beloved. They prayed to a two- *
sexed deity addressed as Father and Mother, identified with Jesus and
j
Mary. Irenaeus anathematized such groups, insisting they "repent" anoj submit themselves to him, so he could punish them with "advance
discipline" that would save their souls.9
Gnostic principles of enlightenment were incorporated into bardic
romance, mystery plays, and fairy tales early in the medieval period. Such sources maintained secrets of the heretical religions as allegories i

[inquisition accused the Cathari of calling the Roman church names,
buch as Mother of Fornication, Babylon the Great Whore, the
Devil's Basilica, and Satan's Synagogue. The story of John the weaver of Toulouse shows opposition between the Roman church and Catharan principles of ritual purity.
Kccused of following the Gnostic heresy, John proclaimed that he lied, pwore, ate meat, and enjoyed sex with his wife; therefore he proved nimself a faithful Christian and no Catharan heretic. 11
Other strands of Gnosticism ran through astrology, alchemy,
Hermetic magic, and occultism. Insofar as the sought-after knowl
edge was the natural science that alchemists and sorcerers were
beginning to discover (or rediscover), the church opposed it as destructive to the faith. St. Augustine had firmly censured "the vain and
curious desire of investigation, known as knowledge and science."
fret Hermes Trismegistus, the half-acknowledged god of medieval alchemists and occultists, had been praised by Lactantius as the
jevealer of "almost the whole verity." Women were involved, too, in
:he pursuit of natural science. Women were closely associated with
he origins of alchemical/mystical gnosis: Theosebia, Mary the Jewess,
me who called herself Cleopatra, another who called herself Isis. 12
Rediscovery of pagan writings had brought Isis back into an nfluential, if secret, prominence. The Hellenistic world identified 'Isis of the Myriad Names" with every other female divinity. 13 Medi
eval occultists in turn found her glorified in the writings of Plutarch
ind identified her with the World Soul, or Sophia. She appeared in lumerous occult books as the Naked Goddess crowned with stars,
ler dominion over land and sea symbolized by her right foot on the
;arth, her left foot in water. Her vulva was marked by a precisely
X)sitioned crescent moon, which a modern male scholar, with the
airiously typical vague perception of female genitalia, chose to
lescribe as covering her "womb." H On the whole it was a general rule that wherever the orthodox
lurches found any hint of female divinity or authority, there they at Mice found heresy. Persecution of various kinds of Gnostics proved the
le over and over. Both natural science and feminine spirituality

Goddess
Few words are so revealing of western sexual prejudice as the word
Goddess, in contrast to the word God. Modern connotations vastly
differ from those of the ancients, to whom the Goddess was a full
fledged cosmic parent figure who created the universe and its laws, ruler
of Nature, Fate, Time, Eternity, Truth, Wisdom, Justice, Love, Birth, Death, etc. Male writers through the centuries broke the Goddess figure down,'
into innumerable "goddesses," using different titles or names she
received from different peoples at different times. If such a system had
been applied to the usual concept of God, there would now be a
multitude of separate "gods" with names like Almighty, Yahweh, Lord,
Holy Ghost, Sun of Righteousness, Christ, Creator, Lawgiver, Jeho
vah, Providence, Allah, Savior, Redeemer, Paraclete, Heavenly Father,
and so on, ad infinitum, each one assigned a particular function in the
j
world pantheon. During the Middle Ages, most of the old names and i
titles of male deities were amalgamated as "secret names" of the one God, while the names and titles of the Goddess were ever more
minutely classified, and some were even masculinized, humanized,
or diabolized. Yet such classification tends to disintegrate under deeper
study that reveals the same archetypal characteristics in nearly all the
"goddesses." Probing ancient views of the Goddess is instructive. It shows a
female figure almost always more powerful than the male. Not only is \
she his Mother, the author of his being; she is also the deity who infuses
all creation with the vital blood of life. Gods prosper only when they
partake of her wisdom or adopt her powers, until they commit the
ultimate hubris, symbolic matricide, by setting up an all-masculine theology. The strength of the Goddess was harnessed to support new
male religions as the strength of women's nurturing, caretaking
instinct was harnessed to a patriarchal marriage system supporting men. Even today, scholars tend to call all ancient deities "gods" when they include both male and female; and sometimes the oracular utterances of:
the Goddess are said to emanate from a "god." l Perhaps one should take more seriously the ancients' often
repeated opinion that their Goddess had a thousand names. Every
female divinity in the present Encyclopedia may be correctly regarded as only another aspect of the core concept of a female Supreme
Being. No modern temples perpetuate this core concept. Men long
346



since tore down the Goddess's shrines, as Christian Gospels com- Godiva, Lady
manded them to do (Acts 19:27). Yet even in a society that trivialized and vilified it, the core concept lives on. Some people believe that a ^^^^^^^^^^^
new feminine theology will emerge from the core concept during the
present century.
l.Pritchard.A.N.E. 1,285; 2, 185.
Godiva, Lady
The name of Lady Godiva is simply a combination of three different
ways of saying "Goddess." As Mother Goda, or Gerd, she was the same
as Freya, consort of Godan (Wotan), father of "Gods"(Goths); the old Teutonic d and th were interchangeable. 1 Diva was a universal
Indo-European word for "Goddess" derived from Sanskrit devi.
Tantric scriptures still speak of a "mother of creation" and a "holy
female river" Godavari, personifying the Western Continent, AparaGodaniya, a land of cattle and of rough barbarians who lived on meat
apparently the Goths. 2
The legend of Lady Godiva's naked ride through Coventry evolved from the Goddess's May-Eve procession, which the clergy
first tried to suppress by ordering the people to stay indoors and refrain from watching it. In Southam there were two Ladies, white and
black, representing the Virgin and Crone, summer and winter, Love and Death. 3 The black Goddess appeared with a bull-masked dancer known as Old Brazen Face: the solar bull mated to the Moon-cow. 4 The "fine lady" on the white horse in the Ride A Cock-Horse nursery rhyme was the Naked Goddess of the annual pageant. 5 Some
Iversions of the rhyme called her the "old woman." 6
Peeping Tom dared to catch a glimpse of her nakedness and was
[stricken blind for it, according to the story. This recalls other men
blinded for looking on the Goddess's nakedness, like Teiresias of
iThebes. Such divine punishment, with its accompanying gift of Igodlike insight, represented a modification of older Gothic customs [whereby the Naked Goddess could be seen only by "men doomed to
die," such as Teiresias's less fortunate forerunner, Actaeon. 7 Blindness
Iwas a common enough result of peeping at forbidden sacred myster
lies. King Philip of Macedon was blinded for peeping through a crack to
pee the serpent-god impregnating the queen with the seed of Alexan
der the Great. 8 Perhaps Godiva's "Tom" was intended to be Thomas
Rhymer, another seer like Teiresias who spent seven years serving the Goddess.
Lady Godiva's annual ride was suppressed by Puritans, but after
the fall of the Puritan Commonwealth in 1678 she appeared again, naked as before on her white horse. So she remained up to 1826, when
new wave of puritanism finally dictated that she must be clothed.9
The original purpose of her ride, to renew her virginity, consum
mate the sacred marriage, and thus provide the blessings of fertility
347



Cog for the coming year, was at last forgotten. An improbable fable was Golden Rule made up, saying a human Lady of Coventry rode naked alone, only ^^^^^^^^^^^m because her Lord insisted on it. This is all most people now know of the
history of Godiva, the Gothic Goddess.

Golden Calf
Horus, the bull-calf representing Osiris reborn from his mother Isis
Hathor, who appeared in her processions as a golden cow. Israelites in exile considered a Horus-calf so necessary that they permitted Aaron
to melt down their gold jewelry to make one. Aaron presented the
finished calf as the god who brought the people safely out of the land
of Egypt (Exodus 32:4). The sexual worship of Horus was maintained
also. The Israelites made offerings to him, sat down to a feast, then
"rose up to play" (Exodus 32:6). The word here translated "play" really
meant "copulate." '
1. Knight, D.W.P., 62.
Golden Rule
What has been called the essence of Christian teaching was not
Christian at all but a precept common to all the ancient world, ultimately based on the Tantric law of karma. The Tantric Sadhaka
or Sadhu (yogi) was told to "do good to other beings as if they were his own self." ' Tantric holy men reached the Middle East at an early date, and may have been the "Sadducees" mentioned in the New Testament. The Buddhist version of the precept was "What ye sow,
that shall ye reap," which was copied into Christian scriptures (Galatians
6:7) some 500 years later. 2
Long before the Bible, Akkadian maxims enjoined the faithful:
"Do not return evil to your adversary; requite with kindness the one
who does evil to you ... be friendly to your enemy." 3 In the Egyptian Middle Kingdom, the Golden Rule was a proverb sacred to Maat, the
Mother of Justice; "Do the other good, that he may do good to you."4 Among the Greeks, the same karmic law became the law of the
Goddess Dike, ruler of Fate, who said, "He who does wrong to another,
does wrong to himself." 5 Jewish writers adopted the principle and
attributed it to the injunctions of Hillel: "Do not unto others what thou
348



wouldst not they should do unto you, this is the whole of the Law." 6 Goose
Patriarchal writers naturally attributed the Rule to male heroes, but Gorgon
the older sources nearly always presented it as the law of the Goddess. ^^____^__

Goose
Mother Goose originated in ancient Egypt, where she was Mother Hathor, incarnate in the Nile Goose. She laid the Golden Egg of the
sun, another way of saying she gave birth to Ra. His solar disc was
sometimes called the Goose-egg. 1 Some Egyptian writings called the goose Creatress of the World because she produced the whole
universe in a primordial World Egg. 2
The fairy tale of Jack who climbed the beanstalk to find the goose that laid the golden egg, dated back to pre-dynastic shamans who climbed the Heavenly Vine, or Ladder of Set, to the celestial realm of the solar deity, invoked in prayers as "the Egg of the Goose
appearing from out of the sycamore." 3 Like Hathor, Mother Goose was the godmother of all children. In
her pictures she always wore the traditional garb of the witch
midwife: black cloak, pointed hat like the Egyptian crown, and magic wand.

iorgon
'rophylactic mask signifying Female Wisdom: a face of Athene or ledusa surrounded by snake-locks. Gorgo, Gorgon, or Gorgopis,
"Grim Face," was the title of Athene as a death goddess. 1 Athenians
tried to explain the Gorgon face on Athene's aegis with the myth that Perseus cut off Medusa's head and brought it home to his own
Goddess. But this was a late myth designed to conceal Athene's roots in
Libya, where she was herself called Medusa, or Metis.
Like other versions of the archaic Goddess, the Gorgons were a
trinity in classical mythology. Their names were Medusa, Stheino,
and Euryale: Wisdom, Strength, and Universality. Hellenic writers pretended they were monsters, but these were not the names of
monsters. They were titles of the triadic Moon Mother. Orphic mystics continued to call the moon "The Gorgon's Head." 2
The story that the Gorgon's look could turn men to stone dated
from the use of the Gorgon-face to enforce taboos on secret Myster
ies of the Goddess, guarded by stone pillars formerly erected in honor of her deceased lovers. See Athene; Medusa.

Gossip Gossip
Grace Archaic word for a woman, especially one past middle age. The
original word was godsib, "one related to the gods," i.e., a god-mother. In pre-Christian times, elder women were considered divine because
they retained their "wise blood" after menopause. (See Menstrual
Blood.) In Christian times, "gossip" came to mean any godmother; e.g. Queen Elizabeth I was the gossip at the baptism of her godson James VI of Scotland. 1
A group of elder women were called "gossips" as a term of respect
at first, after the peasant habit of calling any older woman "mother"
or "grandmother." The modern meaning of "gossip" arose from the conversation of "gossips," or old wives' tales.
1. Funk, 256.
Gotterdammerung
"Going-into-the-Shadow-of-the-Gods," often erroneously called Twilight of the Gods: the Teutonic doomsday, when all the old gods would be destroyed and reabsorbed by the Great Goddess Skadi, the
Shadow. 1 Like Kali in the Far East, Skadi stood for the primal womb of
darkness that cyclically devoured worlds and gave them new birth. The Scandinavian and Teutonic concept of cyclic universes, each with
its renewable set of gods, was essentially identical to that of India. See
Doomsday.
l.Turville-Petre, 164.
Grace
In a famous New Testament passage, the quality said to be greater than faith or hope is caritas(\ Corinthians 13), translated sometimes
"charity," sometimes "love." Both translations are inexact. The word
meant "grace," specifically the grace of the Triple Goddess, embodied in the boon-bestowing Three Graces who dispensed caritas (Latin) or charis (Greek) and were called the Charites. Julian said their grace was a
gift from heaven: "The threefold gift of the Charites comes to us
from heaven, from the circles of the stars." l
Romans sometimes called grace venia, the divine correlative of
Venus, bringing visible tokens of the goddess's favor. 2 Grace meant
the same as Sanskrit karuna, dispensed by the heavenly nymphs and
their earthly copies, the sacred harlots of Hindu temples (devadasis). Their "grace" was a combination of beauty, kindness, mother-love,
tenderness, sensual delight, compassion, and care. Graces were emanations of the Goddess. They danced in her shrines. They tended to her adornment. They acted as midwives to
the gods. They were patrons of music, dance, poetry, and art. 3 They were shown over and over in the same classic pose as three naked
350



women dancing, in attitudes strongly resembling those of the Heavenly Graeae Nymphs on the Temple of Love at Khajuraho in India. 4 Grail, Holy Greek writers called the Graces Aglaia (Brilliant), Thalia (Flower
Bringer), and Euphrosyne (Heart's Joy); but they had older names inherited from a dim prehistory. Homer knew only one Grace, named Cale or Kale, perhaps a cognate of Kali. 5 The Gnostic author Marcus also used the word Grace or Charis as a title of the Goddess: "May She
who is before all things, the incomprehensible and indescribable
Grace, fill you within, and increase in you her own knowledge." 6
Christians took the pagan concept of charis and struggled to divest
it of sexual meanings for application to an ascetic creed. "Charity"
became a basic tenet of primitive Christianity, as of Buddhism before it, on the theory that a sure place in heaven could be won by giving
away one's worldly goods to the poor. Jesus listed the blessings prepared for those who voluntarily made themselves meek, humble, and poor on earth (Luke 6:20-30). The church's word for these "Beatitudes" was
macarisma, a word of ancient origin, invoking the Triple Goddess as
Ma (birth), Charis (grace), and Ma (death). 7 The cognate word charis
ma meant Mother-given grace. Charis merged with "charity" via ancient precedents equating love and affection with hospitality and gift-giving, the "maternal virtues."
Homeric literature used the word philein, "lovingness," to mean open
handed hospitality. 8 As re-interpreted by Christian theology, the
"graciousness" that used to mean both liberality and warm physical
affection came to suggest liberality alone, practiced to secure one's
own immortality.

Graeae
The Gray Women of classical myth; like the northern Norns, a
variant on the personae of the Triple Goddess. Graeae were mothers of
Greece (Graecia). According to the Perseus myth they were less terrible than the Gorgons, but Graeae and Gorgons were originally the same triad, the former having more sinister names than the latter. The Graeae were named Enyo, Pemphredo, and Deino: Warlike One,
Wasp, and Terror. 1 They shared but a single eye and a single tooth
among them, showing that they stood for a primitive concept of the Goddess who was three in one and one in three. See Gorgon;
Trinity.

Grail, Holy
Christian myth said the Holy Grail was the chalice used by Christ at
the Last Supper when he poured wine for the disciples to drink, saying,
351



Grail, Holy "this is my blood" (Matthew 26:28). After the crucifixion, Joseph of Arimathea took the chalice to England and established it in a shrine at
^^^^^M^^M^Hi Glastonbury. Later, it disappeared.
This myth wasn't heard in Europe until the 1 2th century. The real
origins of the Holy Grail were not Christian but pagan. The Grail
was first Christianized in Spain from a sacred tradition of the Moors. 1
Like the Celts' holy Cauldron of Regeneration, which it resembled,
the blood-filled vessel was a womb symbol meaning rebirth in the
Oriental or Gnostic sense of reincarnation. Its connotation was
feminine, not masculine.
The Grail was kept in a magnificent temple governed by a queen named Repanse de Joie (Dispenser of Joy), an ancient title of a holy harlot. Bards said her husband was a Moor, and her son John founded
the eastern order of the Knights Templar, a group of warriors
dedicated to the Grail temple and the defense of women. When a lady
needed help, Grail knights like Galahad, Parsifal, or Lohengrin would receive orders in fiery letters on the rim of the Grail and ride to
the rescue.
Hispano-Moorish tradition located the Grail temple on Montsal
vatch, the "Mount of Salvation" in the Spanish Pyrenees. 2 The
temple was a model of the universe, topped by a gigantic ruby representing the maternal heart of the world, the Holy Rose. The pseudo-universe even included a miniature of itself enclosing the sacred
vessel:
The temple itself was one hundred fathoms in diameter. Around it were
seventy-two chapels ofan octagonal shape. To every pair ofchapels there was a tower six stories high, approachable by a winding stair on the outside. . . . The vaulting was ofblue sapphire, and in the center was a
plate ofemerald. . . . All the altar stones were ofsapphire. . . . Upon the
inside of the cupola surmounting the temple, the sun and moon were represented in diamonds and topazes, and shed a light as ofday even in the darkness of the night. The windows were ofcrystal, beryl, and other transparent stones. The floor was of translucent crystal, under which all the fishes ofthe sea were carved out ofonyx, just like life. The towers were ofprecious stones inlaid with gold; their roofs ofgold and blue
enamel. Upon every tower there was a crystal cross, and upon it a
golden eagle with expanded wings, which, at a distance, appeared to be flying. At the summit ofthe main tower was an immense carbuncle,
which served, like a star, to guide the Templars thither at night. In the center of the building, under the dome, was a miniature representation ofthe whole, and in this the holy vessel was kept. '
Like the Arabian brotherhood oihashishim (see Aladdin), the
legendary Knights Templar waited for the Desired Knight, or Mahdi, to rescue the world from tyranny and establish the benevolent rule of
the Grail. The alternative was a dire prediction of the Waste Land, modeled on the arid wilderness of Arabia Deserta, which some
eastern sages attributed to the departure of the Goddess.
The Grail temple was sometimes called Montjoie, "Mount of
352 M



Joy," like the castle Joyous Gard to which Queen Guinevere retired Grail, Holy with her lover. It was the same as the Mons Veneris, or Venusberg. Its
sexual symbolism served to rally heretical uprisings against the anti- ^^^^^^^^^^
sexual church. A 14th-century peasant leader calling himself William Karle, or Cale, adopted "Montjoie" as a battle cry, and banners showing the Goddess's traditional triple lily.
4 The same battle cry was
used by the legendary soldiers of Roland, supposed to have died in
the vicinity of the Grail castle. 5 Even older myths said the battle cry of
the Grail king was Amor (Love).6
The Grail was first converted into the chalice of Christ's last
supper in the Joseph d'Arimathie of the Burgundian poet Robert de Borron, between 1 180 and 1 199. The origins of the mystic vessel were
yet suspect. It was formerly a jewel in the devil's crown. Sixty thousand angels gave it to Satan when he still lived in heaven. During
his descent to hell, the jewel fell from his crown to earth, where it was
found and fashioned into a cup. 7 Joseph of Arimathea acquired the cup
land gave it to Jesus to use at his last meal with his disciples. It was the
jcup of doom, of which Jesus prayed to God in a weak moment, "Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me" (Matthew
26:39).
The poet said Joseph was imprisoned by the Jews and left in a jdungeon for a year and a day without food or drink; but he remained alive and well because he had the Grail with him. He was set free by the
emperor Vespasian, who was converted to Christianity after being cured of leprosy by the veil with which St. Veronica wiped Jesus's face.
Joseph then traveled to England with a group of pilgrims, built the
temple of the Grail at Glastonbury, and installed the Round Table for
(the rite of the holy supper. Among his followers was Bron, the Rich
[Fisher, directly stolen from pagan myths of Bran the Blessed, Welsh god of the sacred cauldron. For a touch of anti-Semitic propaganda in this chowder of fantasy, de Borron claimed the vacant Seat Perilous at
the Round Table was the seat of Judas. Another Jew, Moyses ;(Moses) once dared to sit in it, but for his hubris he was swallowed up by
the earth. 8
About 1230 appeared the even more chaotic Vulgate Cycle, jL'Estoire de] Saint Graal, a quintet of prose romances in Old French. The author pretended his book was given by the ghost of Christ himself
to a Cistercian monk on Good Friday, 717 a.d. This work frankly
called the Grail by its old title, an escuele or "cauldron." The company
Df the Grail colonized the holy city of Sarras, ruled by Mordrain and
Nascien (Death and Birth). Moys (Moses) was snatched away from the Seat Perilous by fiery hands. Solomon's ship, which moved by itself
pn the sea, carried Christianity to all lands. Members of the Grail
bompany had various adventures: Bron went to Scotland and sus
ained a poisoned wound, like Tristan. He was cured by the local
irincess, then he killed her father and married her. Alain the
j 'Hunting Dog" went to a foreign land and built a new castle for the
i Srail, Castle Corbenic (cors-benoiz, meaning either Horn of Plenty
353



Green, Wearing of or Sacred Heart). The seventh Rich Fisher, Lambor, was slain by a Saracen with the magic sword from Solomon's ship, and the land of
wmmmmm^^^m mm the lost Grail became la terregaste the Waste Land.9
A final step in the transformation of the Grail from a pagan symbol
to a Christian one was taken in La Queste del Saint Graal, written by a Cistercian monk. Now Galahad was said to be the perfect Desired
Knight, of the lineage of Joseph of Arimathea. Galahad occupied the
Seat Perilous safely, because he was virginally pure. He drew the magic sword from a stone that floated on the river, for the same reason. Through him the Grail vision was bestowed on all the Round Table
knights, who promptly left their games, feasts, and tourneys (i.e., their paganism) to follow the vision to the ends of the earth in search of the
real thing. The Queste showed obvious hostility to the contemporary cult of courtly love; but when the Grail's aura of feminine mystery was
removed, its romantic appeal declined. If the Grail was nothing more
than the cup of Christ's blood, then there was no reason for the great
Quest at all. The cup of Christ's blood was readily available to all, in
every chapel; and even though it was called a holy sacrament, its discovery somehow lacked thrills. 10 As matters turned out, to Christian
ize the Grail was to neutralize the magnetism of its secret nature.
The monkish author's real purpose was to tout the virtues of
virginity. All but one of the Round Table knights failed the Grail quest because they were guilty of sexual sins. Perceval was abandoned
because of his past links with the cult of courtly love. Gawain, who
played the part of Desired Knight in other romances, failed utterly. Lancelot, having committed adultery with Guinevere, could never see the Grail except in a dream. The only chaste knight was Galahad,
the new, purified Lancelot. Galahad's virginity led him to every
Christian treasure, including the shield of Joseph of Arimathea, laid up in a Cistercian abbey. It was white with a red cross the same "hues
of innocence and blood" on the red-and-white emblem of the Assassins'
brotherhood, borrowed by the crusaders, and later by mystics calling themselves Knights of the Rosy Cross, or Rosicrucians. 11 The Grail remained secretly pagan for many centuries in isolated
areas. English Grail stories were modeled on the Irish Horn of
Plenty, containing blood/wine for drinking and named the Vessel of the Spirit. A festival called a Grail was celebrated every seventh year in
Brunswick, until it was outlawed in 1481. 12

Green, Wearing of
Pagan springtime custom that kept its popularity in Christian Europe, especially through the month of May. By imitative magic, wearing of
354



green was supposed to encourage Mother Earth to clothe herself in Grim the green of abundant crops. The women described as fairies in Grotesques
medieval balladry always dressed in green; and their lovers, like ^^_^_^_^_
Thomas Rhymer, wore green in the fairy realm. Christians opposed
these pagan traditions, associating green with the dead and with
witches, developing the "familiar superstition that green is unlucky." 1
Green was also linked with the sexual promiscuity of old rituals.
l.Wimberly, 176.
Grim
"Mask," often a title of Teutonic deities, like Grimhild. Northern
gods as well as those of Egypt and Africa were thought to reside in the
masks worn by their impersonators at religious pageants. 1 "Grim"
came to mean "ominous" because mask-wearing priests and priestesses were traditional givers of omens.
1 . Sturluson, 49.
Griselda
Legendary model for proper wifely behavior in the Christian era. "Patient Griselda" married a man of superior rank, who abused her,
neglected her, flaunted his adulteries before her, even took away her babies to kill them and forbade her to shed a single tear because the sight
of her grief would vex him. Griselda endured everything humbly, and at last her husband reformed and rewarded her with his true love,
saying she had passed all his "tests." So they lived happily ever after,
Griselda apparently harboring no resentment for years of mistreatment.
Grotesques
"Creatures of the Grotto," decorative figures in Christian churches,
taken from the animal gods, masques, sirens, gorgons, satyrs, Green Men, serpent deities, and other idols in the sacred caves of paganism. 1 Early churches were built right over the heathen "grotto" and the
same deities were worshipped side by side with Christian ones, so the
people would continue to come to the church by force of habit, finding
their familiar idols there. 2 Some hardly noticed the change, which
was what authorities of the church counted on. Pope Gregory the Great ordered missionaries to "accommodate the ceremonies of the Chris
tian worship as much as possible to those of the heathen, that the people
may not be much startled at the change." 3
Later, when "grotesques" were re-defined as devils, churches were
left with incongruous images of the rival deities, to which people still
prayed secretly, or touched for "luck," or gave offerings. Hugo wrote, "Sometimes a porch, a facade, or a whole church presents a symbolic meaning entirely foreign to worship, even inimical to the Church." 4
355



Grove, Sacred
A common Indo
European word for the sacred grove was Nemi (Latin nemus), indicating dedication to the Moon-goddess called Nemesis, Diana Nemorensis, or Diana Nemetona Lady of the Grove. Nemeton was the
druidic oak grove. Strabo said the greatest shrine of the Galatians (Gauls) in Asia Minor was Drunemeton, the
druid-grove. Southern Scotland had a shrine called Medionemeton. France had another, called Nemetodorum (modern Nanterre). In Spain, the sacred grove of the Moon
goddess Brigit was Nemetobriga. 1 Hungary still has
Maros-Nemeti, an
old grove-shrine of Mari-Diana. 2
The Irish called a
sanctuary nemed, or fidnemed, a "forest shrine," established by the archaic colonists called Nemed or Moon-people. Religious rites continued in these forest shrines
throughout the Middle Ages. 5 Christian writers spoke of "heathen abominations" carried out in forest shrines or nimidae.
The Cathedral of Worms for example displayed along one whole side the gods and heroes of the Nibelungenlied, even though the official
theology represented these entities as devils. 5
Sometimes the traditions of the grotesques were perpetuated by
secret societies among the artisans, especially masons and smiths, whose fraternities preserved Gnostic symbols like the double-tailed
siren, the double-sexed demiurge, and the Ouroboros or World
Serpent, also greatly revered by alchemists and Hermetic magicians. See

Grove, Sacred
Next to a cave, a grove was the most popular uterine symbol in
ancient religions, even among early biblical Semites, to whom Asherah
was the Mother-Goddess of the Grove. A large tree, pillar, or obelisk
within the grove often represented the male god inside the Goddess as
both child and lover.
Brittany in the 1 1th century still had a druidic holy wood called
Nemet. This may have been the same as the fairy wood Broceliande,
the grove of Merlin's Nemesis, the lady Nimue, who also bore the name
of the fatal Goddess of the grove.
Patriarchal priesthoods seemed to consider the groves dangerous. The Bible speaks of many attacks on the asherim or Groves of
Asherah, which were consistently worshipped by both people and kings, despite the prophets' repeated condemnations: Exodus 34:13, Deu
teronomy 16:21, Judges 3:7, 1 Kings 15:13, 16:33; 2 Kings 18:4, 21:7. Destroyers of the sacred groves feared the Mother's curse, as
shown in numerous moralizing myths. Erysichthon dared to cut down one of Demeter's sacred groves, though the high priestess forbade him with the voice of the Goddess herself. Then angry Demeter
cursed him with perpetual hunger that could never be appeased. He
ended as a wretched beggar, frantically stuffing his mouth with filth. 4
Druidic sacred groves were somewhat protected by superstitious fear of similar curses. The oak grove at Derry was one of the most
popular shrines of Irish paganism, its magical name still invoked by the bardic phrase "Hey, Derry Down" in the chorus of old ballads.
Writings attributed to St. Columba said Derry's grove must be pre
served at all costs. The saint said as much as he feared death and hell,
he "dreaded still more the sound of an axe in the grove of Derry." 5 Sacred kings in Diana's ancient grove at Nemi were expected to
fight any rival challenger who broke a branch from the holy tree. This
symbolic act occurs so often in medieval romances that it can only be assumed the custom continued through the Middle Ages. The
Vulgate epic of Lancelot said Parsifal challenged a rival knight in the same manner as the heroes of Nemi: he "found a tree in the grove
356



undefended, and broke a branch from it." 6 Evidence is not lacking to Guignole, Saint
show that breaking a branch from the sacred tree was equivalent to a Guinevere threat of castration of the god, or the incumbent sacred king who ^^^^^^^^^^^
embodied the god. 7

Guignole, Saint
Phallic god of Gaul, probably a French name for Priapus, Christian
ized and worshipped in his own church at Brest. Even after adoption
into the Christian canon, St. Guignole remained an ithyphallic
figure, from whose erect penis women scraped splinters to assist in
conception charms. The priests assisted by installing a trick penis in
St. Guignole's statue, which could be lengthened secretly from behind as it was scraped away in front. 1 See Phallus Worship.
l.G.R. Scott, 247.
Guinevere
In Germany, Guinevere was Cunneware, "female wisdom." ' Accord
ing to the Welsh Triads, she was the Triple Goddess, Gwenhwyfar, "the first lady of these islands," at times one queen, at times three
queens, all named Gwenhwyfar, all of whom married King Arthur. 2 Arthur was born of the same Goddess when he was cast ashore on the ninth wave. The Welsh called breaking waves the Sheep of the
Mermaid, and the Mermaid was Gwenhidwy, or Gwenhwyfar. The ninth wave represented the "god born of nine maidens," also known
as The Ram. 3 Nine maidens signified the triplicated Triple Goddess, like the nine Muses in Greek myth. Guinevere embodied the sovereignty of Britain. No king could
reign without her. Thus, in story after story, she was abducted by
would-be rulers. Melwas, Meleagant, Arthur, Lancelot, and Mordred all took Guinevere away from the incumbent ruler when they wished
to make themselves kings. When a king lost Guinevere, he lost the
kingship. Some myths suggest that she was a sacred statue, like the Fortuna Regia of Roman Caesars. 4 Yet she was also a living woman,
who impersonated the Destroyer when she gave the apple of death to Patrick, and was nearly burned at the stake when she was accused of
witchcraft. Early legends said she disappeared into the castle of
Joyous Gard, the earthly paradise, where she reigned each spring as May Queen.

Gula Gunas
Gula
Babylonian name of the Great Goddess as Lady of Birth and Mother
of Dogs. She also ruled fate, as shown by the plural form Guises, the
Fates Who Write, corresponding to Roman Fata Scribunda, or
Teutonic Schreiberinnen, "Writing-Women." * l.Gaster ( 764.
Mahabharata Indian
epic poem, consisting of historical and
legendary material gathered between the 4th and 10th centuries
A.p, including the famous Bhagavad-Gita.
Gunas
"Strands," the threads of Fate, colored white, red, and black. In Tantric symbolism, the three colors stood for "the divine female
Prakriti" i.e., Kali in her three aspects as Creator, Preserver, and
Destroyer, or giver of birth, life, and death. 1 The Virgin-Creator was Sattva, white; the Mother-Preserver was Rajas, red; the Crone
Destroyer was Tamas, black. Together they symbolized the cyclic succession of "purity, passion, darkness." 2
The Svetasvatara Upanishad said white, red, and black were the
colors of the Goddess Maya, who was also Kali. Sattva signified
"radiant tranquility"; from sat, that which exists forever. 3 Rajas was the
color of royal blood, the color of a king {raj), and of the Mother as
queen and battle-goddess, like Durga-Kali, in "blazing motion, violence and passion." Another of her names, Aruna, may have been the origin of Arum, the Mesopotamian Goddess who made mankind out of clay reddened with her lunar blood. 4 Tamas, the color of the Crone,
stood for "passive weight and darkness," the blackness of the tomb. 5 The Gunas were not only Oriental. The same white, red, and black "strands" were associated with western forms of the Triple
Goddess also. Theocritus, Ovid, Tibullus, and Horace all said the sacred
colors of the life-threads were white, red, and black. 6 The Goddesses
who held the threads were the Fates. They were based on Oriental
images such as the three Goddesses depicted in the Mahabharata,
weaving the veil of nights and days in an underground "city of
serpents," representing cycles of light and darkness with threads of white and black linked with the blood-red thread of life. 7
Sumerian temples were ornamented with clay-cone mosaics that always showed the same three colors,8 which were also used to decorate the New World pottery known as Mimbres ware. Celtic myth
assigned them to the Hounds of Annwn or dogs of the underworld, and to the maidens in the Castle of the Holy Grail, as if they too were
Kalis or, as the Irish said, kelles (see Kelle).
The Gunas are familiar motifs in fairy tales, such as Snow White: a
story of the princess who not only personified the Virgin in combination with the Mother-queen and the Crone-witch; she also displayed the Gunas in her own person, with "skin white as snow, lips red as blood, | and hair black as ebony." Snow White was a direct descendant of
Peredur's divine lady-love, whose hair was black as jet, her skin white
and red. A vision of the colors alone (crow's feathers and blood in the
358



snow) cast Peredur into a holy trance of meditation upon her image, Gunnlod
from which he couldn't wake.9 Grimm's fairy tale of Snow White and Gwyn
Rose Red came from the same root, uniting Virgin and Mother as ^^^^^^^^^^^
Eithne the Fair and Fedelim the Rosy, repeated in the lilies and roses sacred to the virgin Mary. 10 The same Virgin and Mother colors
were combined by the Two Mistresses of ancient Egypt, Nekhbet and Buto, wearers of the white and red crowns. The same colors were
known to medieval mystics in the Middle East as the Hues of Innocence and Blood. 11
The Crone's color, black, was often dissociated from the Virgin
and Mother colors, though the three veils laid on Christian altars for Christmas Matins retained the hues of the pagan trinity, white, red, and
black. 12 Black animals were sacrificed to the underworld Goddess
from Homer's time all the way up to the 18th century a.d. 13 The Slavs offered black horses to their horse-headed Lord of Death, Volos, who
was lightly Christianized as St. Vlas. 14 Gypsy women wore red and
black for funerals, combining the attributes of Mother and Crone. 15
In China however, the funereal color was white, to suggest rebirth. Old
European ballads sometimes associate all three colors with death. The departure of the dead from Middle-Earth was heralded by "the
crowing of the white, the red, and the black cock." 1<s
So often were the sacred colors displayed in hundreds of myths,
folk tales, and even Christian customs, that Dante placed them at the
very core of his Inferno, to symbolize the essence of God's adversary: the three heads of Lucifer were white, red, and black. 17

Gunnlod
Norse name of the Earth-goddess or primal "giantess" from whose underground cauldron Odin stole the wise blood of immortality, magic, and feminine mana, to make himself a supreme god. 1 Though her myth underwent several revisions, Gunnlod was another form of
the Triple Goddess, keeping three cauldrons (or wombs) in the X)wels of the earth, which meant in herself.

Gwyn
'White god" of Wales, sometimes identified with King Arthur; an
Dsiris-like Savior slain by his perpetual rival and alter-ego Gwythur ap
Sreidawl (Set), and buried in a boat-shaped oak-coffin before his
esurrection. He was born of Arianrhod, the Great Goddess as virgin
nother, and became her consort. Like her, he was a trinity: Dylan, a
359



Gyges silver fish; Llew, a white stag; Gwyn, the white rider on a white horse.
Gypsies In these forms he matched the trinity of Arianrhod of the silver
mmmm^^^^^^^^m wheel, Blodeuwedd the white-flower virgin, and Cerridwen the deathly
white sow. Every May Day "until the day of doom," Gwyn fought his rival for the royal embodiment of the Goddess on earth, Creiddylad Shakespeare's "Cordelia" who belonged to each contestant
alternately. Gwyn was the origin of the common prefix "Win" in the names of ancient British towns. 1

Gyges
Ancient king of Lydia, chosen by the queen to kill her former husband Candaules and then to marry her, according to the archaic
system of kingship by combat. Gyges's potency was first judged by the ceremony of unveiling the queen and looking on her nakedness, whereby his physical reaction could be noted and assessed. 1 Since
virility was the principal requirement in a king at the time, his sovereign
ty was contingent on the queen's acceptance of him as a lover. See
Kingship.
1. Herodotus, 5-6.
Gypsies
Among the last active preservers of Goddess-worship in Europe were the gypsies, who began to migrate westward from Hindustan about
1000 a.d. 1 Because Christians identified their beliefs with witchcraft, gypsies were popularly known as Minions of the Moon, or Diana's Foresters. Some may have adopted the Dianic witch-cult through assimilation of the lunar Diana to their own Goddess, Sara-Kali (Queen
Kali), also called Laki (Hindu Lakshmi), or Matta the Mother. 2
Gypsies revered the female principle as the source of life; they said,
"For us, woman is like the earth. The earth is our mother, and so is
woman. The secret of life comes from the ground." 3
Many Europeans thought the gypsies came from Egypt, hence
their name, "Egyptians." 4 Their own traditions, usually kept secret from non-gypsies, showed that they came of Hindu roots. They be
lieved in reincarnation and karma. A gypsy fortune teller or
cartomancer was called a Vedavica, reader of the Vedas; for gypsies seem to have regarded Tarot cards as their own Vedas. 5 Gypsies' Goddess was a trinity: Kali as the same three sisters of
Fate worshipped by pagans and witches. Like the fairy godmothers, Moerae, or Fortunae, she came in the form of three mystic ladies to the
cradle of every newborn child. Gypsies' baptismal ceremonies includ
ed three offerings on the infant's bed, "one for each goddess of fate." 6
The three divine Mothers were symbolized by a triangle, the
Tantric yogis' sacred Yoni Yantra, immemorial sign of woman.
360



Gypsies' informal hieroglyphic system always represented "woman" by Gypsies
the Yoni Yantra. 7 A favorite method of card divination among gypsies
was to lay out cards in this same "female" shape. Like the Triple Goddess
herself, the triangle's three sides stood for past, present, and future. 8
The matriarch was the center of gypsy tribal life. "Everything that
went on around a tribal mother resembled the old pagan sex rites." Her husband was a drone, whose function was to impregnate her. The tribe supported him in idleness but looked down on him as a non
productive member. If he failed to beget perfect children, he was "accidentally" killed, and another stud-chieftain took his place. "Tribal mothers were often widowed half a dozen times over." The
male functionary closest to a tribal mother was not her husband but
"the coaxer," a man trained from an early age to control his own sexual
responses and "concentrate completely on his partner's pleasure. He was taught to know all the sensitive and erotic zones of the female body.
In this curious three-sided relationship, the coaxer gave the mother
her physical fulfillment without ever penetrating her. Instead, by a
combination of caresses, words, and breathing, he made her sufficiently excited to be ready to have an orgasm as soon as her husband
took over." 9
The queen's coaxer was trained like a Tantric yogi in the rite of
maithuna, and so were other "occult couples" revered by the gypsies
for impersonating the Goddess and God in their endless world-sustain
ing union. For the gypsy, as for the Tantric sadhu and the Sufi
dervish, occult coitus reservatus was "a means of increasing psychic
powers" in accordance with the ancient Oriental belief that all magic comes from woman. 10
The gypsy word for a fairy, rashani, actually meant "priestess." The most common gypsy surnames were Smith and Faa: "Fay," or
"Fairy." n Gypsies were generally practitioners of smithcraft, thus became involved in the medieval conviction that smiths, wizards, and
women conspired together against the Christian church. 12 (See Smith.) Legends constantly attest to hostility between Christians and
gypsies. Laws against vagrancy were invoked, or even specifically passed, to enable the Inquisition to seize gypsies and haul them off to
witches' prisons, often without even recording their names. 13 In 1 500
the Diet of Augsburg ruled that Christians could kill gypsies without
legal penalty, whereas a gypsy injured by a Christian might seek no redress in court. 14 In 1782, forty-five gypsies were tortured, broken on
the wheel, hanged, drawn, and quartered for having murdered a number of Hungarians who were really alive and well enough to watch
the execution of their alleged killers. 15 There was a popular belief that gypsies were descended from a
union of the first gypsy woman with the devil. 16 An English writer
called gypsies "thieves, rogues, and beggarly rascals . . . known by the name of Bohemians, Egyptians, and Caramaras." 17 The third of these titles was peculiarly reminiscent of Kauri-Mara, or Mother Kali as raie Goddess of Death.
361



Gypsies As the epithet "Christ-killers" supported persecutions of Jews, so
various epithets and legends supported persecutions of gypsies. It was ^^^^^^^^^^^ said gypsy smiths forged the nails for Christ's crucifixion. The gypsies
promulgated a counter-legend: they said an ancestor of their race stole one of the four nails set aside to crucify Jesus, but had no time to
steal the other three. For want of the fourth nail, Jesus's feet had to
be fastened together with a single nail. Oddly, the transition from four nails to three in Christian art occurred about the same time the
gypsies were telling this story. 18 The gypsies also claimed that Jesus, grateful for the gypsy's attempt to save him, from the cross granted all
gypsies the right to steal. Another legend said gypsies were allowed to steal because a gypsy woman stole the infant Jesus and hid him from
Herod's baby-killers in her basket. 19
Some gypsies said their race had its own special savior, a Son of God named Alako, who ascended to the moon. He defends gypsies and takes their souls to the moon after death. His two enemies are the
devil and Christ. 20 Gypsies also prayed to a spirit from Mother Earth,
the Pchuvus (cognate with Celtic pooka or Puck), who can bestow
"earth" on favored people. In gypsy terms, earth meant luck, fortune, money, like the Hindu artha, riches from the Earth-mother. 21
Gypsies claimed it was very unlucky to meet a monk or priest first
thing in the morning; nothing would go right for the rest of the day. This anti-clerical idea caught on even among Christians and was still
found throughout Italy in the 19th century. 22 Agrippa's Occult Philosophy said meeting a monk was an evil omen, "because these kind [sic] of men live for the most by the sudden death of men, as vultures
do by slaughters." 23 Reginald Scot said when hunters met a priest, they thought it such bad luck that they would "couple up their hounds,
and go home, being in despair of any further sport that day." 24 Gypsy myths repeated classical sacred dramas in the guise of fairy
tales. The Horned God sacrificed to the Triple Goddess appeared
frequently. As a gypsy youth, he ate a magic apple given him by a woman, and stag's horns grew from his head. He ate a second magic
apple, and his flesh fell away from his bones. He ate a third magic apple,
crossed a stream (the Styx), and was resurrected, fairer than ever. 25
Here was Dionysus or Actaeon or Pentheus, slain in his stag mask and
reborn from the dead. As in Vedic myth, gypsy gods were often sacrificed in pig form,
usually with the all-important apple representing the "heart-soul" (Egyptian ah). A gypsy maiden reminiscent of Circe was said to have
resurrected her dead lover by replacing all his flesh with pig's flesh, a
classic image of a god's or man's sacrificial bestialization. When she
squeezed an apple into his mouth to serve as his new heart, he returned to life. 26 The pig with an apple in its mouth was also known to
worshippers of Vishnu the boar-god, and those of his Norse counter
part the Yuletide boar (or suckling pig). Egyptians said a dead man could be brought back to life when Anubis pushed his heart into his
362



mouth. 27 Gypsies told a similar story of a gypsy witch who brought her Gypsies dead son to life again by pushing his heart into his mouth. 28 An apple often represented the heart. ^_^^__^__^_ Among gypsies, "giving the heart" in love or marriage frequently took the ceremonial form of giving an apple. "Occult couples" began
the sexual rites with formal cutting of the apple to reveal its magic
pentacle, feeding it to each other with the formula: "I am your
nourishment, you are mine. We are the feast." 29 South Slavic pagans
also used the apple in their marriage ritual: the bride ate half the
apple, and gave the other half to her bridegroom. It has been surmised
that a similar ancient marriage rite underlay the story of Eve's apple. 30
Certainly the myths that developed into gypsy folk tales were extremely old and universal throughout the Indo-European cultures. Their Goddess Sara-Kali could well have been the original Sarah who
ed her tribe from the matrilineal society of Ur of the Chaldees about
1900 B.C. 31 Her alleged consort Abraham was emphasized by biblical
writers, but rabbinic literature said he was only a Chaldean "astrolo
ger," i.e., a priest of the Moon-Goddess. 32 The Goddess appeared as
mother of the solar deity in another gypsy legend, as "an old woman
dressed in white, sitting in a beautiful temple." She explained her function in terms recalling the Riddle of the Sphinx: "I am the
bother of the Sun King, who daily flies out of this house as a little child,
it mid-day becomes a man, and returns of an evening a graybeard." 33 She also represented the divine Cauldron that daily swallowed him up and
jave him rebirth. The popular gypsy surname Kaldera or Kalderas may lave been derived from Kali-Devi as the same Cauldron. 34
The Cauldron of the Deep also appeared in gypsy lore as a mirror, ike the one in which the Titans trapped the soul of Dionysus, who
vas identified with the same sun god. Transylvanian gypsies called him me Enchanted (or Accursed) Hunter, who loved a witch named Mara or Mari that is, Mother Death. She trapped the hunter's soul in
per magic mirror and took it away from him, the typical preliminary i:o his cyclic resurrection. 35
Much of this highly significant gypsy lore was kept from nonjypsies for many centuries, as it was always viewed as heresy by Christian authorities, and even folk tales could become excuses for
jersecution. The prejudice against gypsies has lasted even into the
>resent century. The Nazis declared them "subhumans," along with
ews, Slavs, and other "non-Aryans." Over 400,000 gypsies were ailed in the German concentration camps. 36

Hades
Hag
Hades
Underworld god, Lord of Death, consort of Hecate or Persephone. In pre-Roman Latium he was known as Eita or Ade, and his bride was Persipnei. 1 Greek myth converted him into the abductor of the
Virgin Persephone, or Kore; but as "Destroyer" she was really the underworld Death-goddess to begin with. His Greek name, Aidon
eus, meant "blind one," a common title of the phallic Hidden God in the womb of the earth. 2 Hades was also known as Pluto, or Pluton, Lord of Riches. He was
supposed to know the location of all gems and precious metals in the
earth. When he was identified with the Christian devil, the belief
persisted that the devil could locate buried treasure for his followers.
Like all underground deities, Hades was thought a leading resident of hell, which was often called by his name instead of by the name Hel, the Goddess.
1. Larousse, 211.2. Graves, G.M. 2, 393.
Hebrew "wisdom" in Proverbs 8 is Hokhmah, from Egyptian heq-maa or Heka-Maat, the underworld Mother of
wisdom, law, and words of power. 2 Greek and Roman cognate
hagia meant holy, especially as applied to the principle of female wisdom, Hagia Sophia (see Sophia, Saint). Similarly in Israel, a haggiah was a holy day. Certain Jewish religious literature
dating back to Israel's matriarchal period was probably written by wise-women, since it was called the
Haggadah. Later patriarchal rabbis declared this material
"not legal." 3
Hag
Originally "Holy Woman," the Hag was a cognate of Egyptian heq, a predynastic matriarchal ruler who knew the words of power, or
hekau. x In Greek she became Hecate, the Crone or Hag as queen of
the dead, incarnate on earth in a series of wise-women or high
priestesses. In northern Europe, the Hag was the death-goddess corresponding to Hecate, like the Hag of the Iron Wood whose daughter or virgin form was Hel. 4 Old Norse hagi meant a sacred grove, the Iron Wood, a
place of sacrifice. Haggen meant to chop in pieces, which is what
happened to sacrificial victims dismembered for a feast. "Hags" may
have been priestesses of sacrifice, like the Scythian matriarchs who butchered for their sacred cauldrons and read omens in entrails. 5
Northmen colonized Scotland, where a haggis or "hag's dish" was
made of internal organs. Until the 19th century, people kept the New j
Year festival of Hagmena, Hag's Moon, going in disguise from house j
to house, begging cakes. A chronicler said: "On the last night of the old
year (peculiarly called Hagmenai), the visitors and company made a point of not separating till after the clock struck twelve, when they rose,
and mutually kissing, wished each other a happy New Year." This is
still the custom. But a contemporary clergyman said the Hagmena meant the Devil was in the house. 6
Devilish qualities were attributed to stone idols of the Hag, such as ;
the famous Stone of Scone, still used at each British monarch's
coronation. This stone once represented the Hag and her spinning
wheel i.e., Arianrhod, Goddess of the Wheel of Fate. A Danish
ballad said the Hag of Scone led the "swarthy Elves"; but she was
turned to stone by an incantation of the missionary St. Olave: "Thou 1
366



I Hag of Scone, stand there and turn to granite stone." 7 Helvetian Hair
i converts to Christianity were compelled to batter to pieces sacred stones in which their Goddess dwelt, reciting her formula, "Once I was ^^^^^^^^^^^
|
the Goddess and now I am nothing at all." 8
In the 16th century, "hag" was synonymous with "fairy." 9 Old High German called a wise-woman Hagazussa, that is, a moon
priestess.
10 Though "hagiology" still means the study of holy matters
and saints, the root word hag declined in its meanings. Shakespeare's verb bagged meant to be bewitched. His noun haggard meant a hawk, a I harpy, or an intractable woman. 11
The Hag as death-goddess, her face veiled to imply that no man can know the manner of his death, was sometimes re-interpreted as a nun. Christianized legends were invented for these veiled figures. 12

Hair
As shown by its importance in witch-charms and in the mutual
exchange of talismans between lovers, hair was usually viewed as a
repository of at least a part of the soul. At the ancient temple of
Troezen, youths and maidens dedicated locks of their hair to the savior
god Hippolytus before marriage; this was "designed to strengthen his union with the Goddess." ' When the Goddess-mother became Queen of Shades for each god
or man at the end of his life, his soul was likened to a child seeking
safety in the mother's shadow. The Great Mother's hair cast its shadow
over the approaching soul. An Egyptian found salvation by identifying himself with Osiris, for whom the Goddess made resurrection-magic with her hair: "He is found with her hair spread over him; it is shaken
put over his brow." 2 When Isis put on mourning garments for Osiris,
(she cut a lock of her hair to preserve his soul. Egyptian widows
similarly buried locks of their hair with deceased husbands, as a charm of
protection in the after-world.
When Isis restored vitality to the dead Osiris, entitled the Still
Heart, she created his new life with her hair, made his heart beat
again and his penis move so she could conceive his reincarnation, Horus. She "produced warmth from her hair, she caused air to come She caused movement to take place in what was inert in the
Still Heart, she drew essence (semen) from him, she made flesh and blood, she suckled her babe alone." ? She further protected her Divine
Child by "shaking out her hair over him." 4 Mortal women often claimed the same preservative magic for their
own hair. Ptolemy III was protected from harm on his Syrian campaign in 247 b.c. by his wife Berenice, who dedicated locks of her
hair on Aphrodite's altar for this purpose. When the hair vanished

significant omens of future catastrophes, particularly a comet, "spirit of hair." A comet was supposed to be a tendril of the Great Mother's
hair appearing in the sky as the world was slowly overshadowed by
her twilight shadow of doomsday. Most forms of the Death-goddess showed masses of hair standing out from her head, sometimes in the
shape of serpents, as in the Gorgoneum of Medusa-Metis-Neith-Anath
Athene. On the magic principle of "as above, so below," women's hair partook of the same mystic powers as the Goddess's hair. Tantric
sages declared that the binding or unbinding of women's hair activat
ed cosmic forces of creation and destruction. 6
The same idea prevailed among prophetic priestesses or witches, who operated with unbound hair on the theory that their tresses
could control the spirit world. Mother Goddesses like Isis, Cybele, and many emanations of Kali were said to command the weather by
braiding or releasing their hair. Their corresponding mortal representatives could cause to be bound or loosed in heaven what they bound or
loosed on earth hence the unflagging superstitious belief in Christian
Europe that witches' hair controlled the weather. Churchmen said
witches raised storms, summoned demons, and produced all sorts of
destruction by unbinding their hair. As late as the 1 7th century the
Compendium Maleficarum said witches could control rain, hail, wind,
and lightning in such a way. 7 In the Tyrol, it was believed that every thunderstorm was caused by a woman combing her hair. Scottish girls were forbidden to comb their hair at night while their brothers were
at sea, lest they raise a storm and sink the boats. 8 A Syrian exorcism for
werewolves invoked "that Angel who judged the woman that
combed the hair of her head on the Eve of Holy Sunday," suggesting a connection between hair-combing women and the "werewolves"
mythologized as dogs of doomsday.9 St. Paul greatly feared the "angels" (spirits) that women could
command by letting their hair flow loose. He insisted that women's heads must be covered "because of the angels" (1 Corinthians 11:10). Thus it became a Christian rule that women's heads must be covered
in church, lest they draw demons into the building. Modern women
wearing hats or head shawls to church unconsciously defer to this
ancient superstition about their hair. Due to identification of bats with
demons, the erroneous notion that bats tend to tangle themselves in
women's hair arose from the same superstition. 10
The ancients insisted that women needed their hair to work magic
spells; thus women deprived of their hair were harmless. 11 For this
reason, Christian nuns and Jewish wives were compelled to shave their
heads. Inquisitors of the medieval church insisted on shaving the hair
of accused witches before putting them to the torture. 12 Churchmen
368



j
claimed Satan told his worshippers that no harm could come to them Hair
j
"as long as their hair was on." Some inquisitors preferred to shave
i body hair too; hence the expression "to make a clean breast" that is, _ to confess arose from the custom of shaving the chest hair of male witches.
Inconsistently, churchmen apparently thought women should not (take the initiative and cut off their own hair. Cutting off her hair was one of the crimes for which Joan of Arc was condemned to the fire. The
count read: "This woman is apostate, for the hair which God gave
her for a veil she has untimely cut off." H Had she been tortured, as the inquisitors threatened, her hair would have been untimely cut off
[anyway. It seemed that men wanted to do it themselves, not to be
anticipated.
Medieval Europe had innumerable superstitions based on the pagan significance of hair. Children's hair was left uncut for many years
on the theory that their strength would be impaired if their hair was cut too soon. 15 Gypsy witches advised the lovelorn to snip a lock of the beloved's hair secretly and wear it as a ring or locket. Whoever
possessed another's hair had power over his soul. 16 Lovers often traded
I
hair-locks in token of good faith. If either betrayed the other, the hair
lock could be used to cast a vengeful spell on the betrayer. Gypsies said a witch could be known by her hair, which grew
straight for three or four inches, then began to wave, like "a waterfall bouncing over rocks." This was one of the distinctively Hindu ideas the
gypsies brought with them out of Asia. 17 The waterfall effect was
produced when naturally straight hair was kept in braids, a fashion of both Hindu and gypsy women. During childbirth however, gypsy
women always let their hair flow loose, on the magic principle that
braids or knots would "tie up" the birth. 18 European witch-midwives
often shared this belief, but many also braided female hair into amulets
to preserve suckling infants and their nurses. This custom continued in Ireland up to the 19th century. 19
Homer spoke of "Circe of the Braided Tresses, an awful goddess
of mortal speech": that is, Circe's hair and words like Kali's controlled
creation and dissolution. 20 Circe was another name for the Fate
spinner, who sat at her loom weaving the destinies of men and
singing her spells of becoming. 21 Circe's braids symbolized her power over metempsychosis; she stood for the cosmic Cirque, or karmic wheel. 22
Braiding the round of Fate was expressed in pagan dances, like the Maypole dance, with ribbons signifying the rays of sun and moon.
On May Eve, female dancers circled the pole widdershins or moon
wise the counter-clockwise direction sacred to women while male
dancers progressed in the other direction, sunwise. The resulting braid
represented interpenetration of masculine and feminine powers. 25 This heathen dance survives as the "braiding" figure in square-dancing known as Grand Right and Left, in which men and women weave
369



Hair opposite directions around a circle, with or without touching hands as
they pass.
^^^^^^^^^^^ For the sun gods, hair represented both "rays" and virility. Apollo's
phallic function was implied by his epithet Chrysocomes, "He of the Golden Locks." Ceremonial castration was the meaning of solar gods'
haircuts, like Samson's. A traditional site of the hero's castration or
hair-cutting was Calvary, "Bald Skull," a hill where sacrifices were performed. Romans sometimes called the Great Goddess Calva, "Baldness," a name so old that no one knew the reason for it. Like
Moriah, it may have descended from an altar-crowned hill of
sacrifice. 24
Head hair comes in for special attention in both West and East. Priests
who wish to conserve their vitality, to "cut offthe outflows,
" to use a
Buddhist term, shave it off. His long hair was the repository ofthe Biblical Samson 's energy. So is the Sikh s. The Indian god Shiva, who is the
personalized representation ofthe creative and sexual energy of the universe, is always represented as having a mass oflong, tangled, piledup hair on his head. Yogis who are his devotees imitate their divine pattern in this respect. Abundant hair represents the abundance ofdivine
energy, in the same way as Shiva 's erect phallus. . . . [EJven today the ordinary Indian believes that the way to avoid "catching cold" and stay
healthy (i.e., preserve his vital energy) is to wrap up his head, even ifthe rest ofthe body is practically naked. Hence the turban. 2S
Tantric sadhakas who worshipped hairy Shiva may have been the original "Sadducees" of the Bible. A related sect of hermits known
as Nazarites or Nazarenes were distinguished like sadhakas by their
never-cut hair, a tradition partly preserved by the uncut ear-locks of the
orthodox Jew. The law of the Oriental holy hermit appears in the
Bible: "He shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head
grow" (Numbers 6:5). But Christians said a man having long hair was shameful (1 Corinthians 1 1:14).
An opposing myth, relating virility to baldness, was promulgated by Hippocrates, possibly because he was himself subject to hair loss.
He said bald men are "of an inflammatory habit; and the plasma in their
head being agitated and heated by salacity, coming to the epidermis withers the roots of the hair causing it to fall off." 26 Thanks to
Hippocrates, the mythic relationship between baldness and sexual
potency has lasted up to the present day. Another durable myth claimed a witch's hair would become a
serpent when buried or placed in water, especially if the hair was plucked while the witch was menstruating. 27 This was another branch from the root of Gorgon mythology, where the female head with
serpent-hair represented "wisdom" and warned would-be trespassers of the menstrual taboo.
Hair was so universally associated with paganism that British
churches used to command men to shear their hair and beards on
Maunday Thursday, the day before Good Friday, so they would be

estern paganism also, as shown by references to circles or rings of
iries, witches, mummers, and Maypole dancers. Circles generally
cpressed cyclic religions; lines, like the rows of pews in a Christian
lurch, expressed patriarchal linearity of ideas.

II Souls' or All Hallows' Day (November 1) was the Christian
jrsion of Samhain, the Celtic feast of the dead, named for the Aryan
371



Ha, Lord of Death, Samana, "the Leveller," or the Grim Reaper, leader
of ancestral ghosts. According to the pagan lunar calendar, festivals wen
HiMHi^HM celebrated on the "eve" rather than the day. Therefore Halloween or
All Hallows' Eve was the original festival, later displaced to the follow
ing day. The Irish used to call the holy night the Vigil of Saman. Churchmen described it as a night of magic charms and divinations, reading the future with witches' mirrors and nutshell ashes, ducking
for apples in tubs of water (representing soul-symbols in the Cauldron o
Regeneration), and other objectionable rites. Even today it is said that a girl who peels an apple before a mirror on Halloween will see the image of her future husband in the glass.
1 Christian authorities wrote
of Halloween, "Many other superstitious ceremonies, the remains of Druidism, are observed on this holiday, which will never be eradicated while the name of Saman is permitted to remain." 2 The name of the
pagan deity remains in the Bible as Samuel, from the Semitic Sammael, the same underworld god.
Of course the original divinations were oracular utterances by the
ancestral dead, who came up from their tombs on Halloween,
sometimes bringing gifts to the children of their living descendants. In
Sicilian Halloween tradition, "the dead relations have become the
good fairies of the little ones." 5 Similar customs are observed at Christmas.
In Lithuania, the last European country to accept Christianity, the pagans celebrated their New Year feast at Halloween, sacrificing domestic animals to their god Zimiennik (Samanik; Samana). Their
prayer ran, "Accept our burnt sacrifice, O Zimiennik, and kindly partake thereof." 4 If the lord of the underworld accepted the offering or
behalf of all the dead, the spirits were satisfied and would refrain from
doing harm. If not adequately propitiated, they might descend on the world as vengeful ghosts, led by demons and "witches" (priestesses) who summoned them. The witches and ghosts are still associated with
Halloween, together with such soul-symbols as owls, bats, and cats. The pagan idea used to be that crucial joints between the seasons
opened cracks in the fabric of space-time, allowing contact between the ghostworld and the mortal one.

Halo
Christian symbol of apotheosis deification, or canonization taken
from the Eleusinian Mysteries, where the savior-god was deified at the
Haloa, Festival of the Threshing-Floor (the halos). 1
The god was variously named Dionysus, Triptolemus, or Iasus.
He represented the grain. At his birth, he was laid in a manger. He
372



Lvas sacrificed, buried, and resurrected: the sequence representing har- Hannah
lest, re-planting, and new growth. His flesh and blood were Hapi
bonsumed by his worshippers in the form of bread and wine. See _^^^__^_^
Demeter. ^^^^^^^^m
The deity was identified with the daily-reborn sun, so the halo was tlso a solar symbol, as in Egypt. In Christian hagiography it was
iometimes known as the aura, "circle of gold," which Byzantine art
Ihowed as a golden disc rather awkwardly attached at an angle to the back of the head. Still another variant was based on the Tantric idea of
he "thousand-petaled lotus of light" sprouting from the head of the
Completely enlightened sage. It was called the nimbus or "cloud" of
ight, a symbol of divinity long before there were Christian deities or aints. 2

Hannah
Jiblical version of the Anatolian Grandmother-goddess Hannahanna, >r Anna. Hittites called her Hwanhwanar, the Nether Upsurge, married o a sacred king at the Puruli festival, shortly before he was sent down nto her Abyss to become the new Lord of Death. 1
Hannah's biblical son bore the same name as the Lord of Death,
lama-El, Sammael or Samuel, from Samana, a Hindu title of the eath-god Yama as Conductor of Souls. 2
In Old Iranian, a clan matriarch was the hana, "grandmother."
limilarly, the Mother of the virgin mother was worshipped throughut the Middle East under such names as Hannah, Anna, Nana,
n-anna, or "Queen Nana, the Creatress." 5 In Christian tradition she vas Anna, the Grandmother of God. 4 Mother of the virgin Mary was tona or Hannah, just as Anatolian Hannahanna was the mother of
lie virgin Mari. Sometimes her virgin aspect was named Inaras, who
f/as also a death-goddess. She annually imprisoned the sacred king in temple tower, mated with him, then killed him. 5 (See Anne, Saint.)

lapi
krchaic deity of the Nile, represented as masculine but having endulous female breasts and a large pregnant belly. Ancestral pre
ynastic tribes of Egypt were said to be Hapi's children, therefore lapi was originally a form of the Great Goddess. Like most of the
Idest Oriental divinities, "he" was associated with the yonic lotus. 1

Har Hathor
var. Harmonia
Har
Ishtar as the patroness of temple prostitutes or harines was known as the Great Goddess Har. Like Greek horae, Persian houris, and other
sacred Aarlots, her priestesses occupied the part of the temple that came to be called Harem, the Sanctuary. 1 Kings had to prove their
virility, hence their right to rule, by impregnating the harines, until it became a custom to let certain priests take over this duty. (See
Prostitution.) From the root Aarcame Hara, Hebrew for both a holy mountain
and a pregnant belly; Hariti or Haraiti, the "Lofty Mountain" of paradise in both pre-Vedic Dravidian and Old Iranian cosmology; and
Harmonia, a "daughter of Aphrodite," a bringer of peace, one of the functions of the holy harlot. Harmonia was mythologized as an ancient queen of Boeotia, married to Cadmus, whose name in Phoenician was kedem, "the Oriental." 2 When Cadmus and Harmonia died and
went to paradise, they were both transformed into serpents. 3 Probably
they were assimilated to the male-and-female, perpetually entwined serpents of the Hermetic caduceus, whose meaning was "Life." (See
Serpent.) 1. /tor. &Bab. Lit, 170; Briffault 2, 320. 2. Massa, 40. 3. Graves, CM. 1, 199.
Harpies
Female death-spirits from Mount Dicte, home of the Cretan Goddess, embodied in carrion birds, probably vultures. They had bird bodies
with women's heads and breasts, suggesting the Minoan style of funerary priestesses in feather costumes with bare necks and bosoms.
Their name meant "snatchers" or "pluckers," perhaps related to
their use of the harp in funerary music, since a harp is played with plucking motions. 1 Patriarchal Hellenic myth made the Harpies obnoxious monsters, but they seem to have been once the same as
dakinis or Valkyries. Christian iconography continued to picture
winged angels, who carried souls to heaven, as harp players.

Hathor
Egyptian Mother of the Gods and Queen of Heaven, originally HetHert, "the House (or Womb) Above"; later Hat-Hor, "the House (or Womb) of Horus." Hathor was "the mother of every god and
goddess." She "brought forth in primeval time herself, never having been created." In the earliest dynasties, her name was a component
of all royal Egyptian names, indicating the archaic matrilineal queenship: based on successive incarnations of her spirit.
1
Hathor was worshipped in Israel in the 1 1th century b.c. at her
374



[wn holy city of Hazor, which the Old Testament claims Joshua Heart
[estroyed (Joshua 1 1:13, 21). The Sinai Tablets show that Hebrew
porkers in the Egyptian mines of Sinai about 1 500 B.C. worshipped _^^^^^^^^^^
Hathor, whom they identified with the Lady of Byblos, Astarte. 2 Some sources said there were seven Hathors: the Holy Midwives
ssociated with the seven heavenly spheres. They gave each Egyptian Seven souls at birth. Sevenfold Hathor entered medieval myth as the
dry godmother(s) and Mother Goose, as well as the Mother of the lun King, the Lady of the Lake, and the Huntress.
In Upper Egypt, Hathor was Sati or Satis, She of the Two Riverlanks, source of the Nile. 3 Her Destroyer aspect was a lion-headed
iuntress, the Sphinx, sometimes called Sekhmet or Sakhmis, "the j'owerful." Like Kali, she drank the blood of gods and men.

Heart
lb was the Egyptian word for heart-soul, most important of the even souls bestowed by the seven birth-goddesses (Hathors). The ab 'as the soul that would be weighed in the balances of Maat after
leath, in her underground Hall of Judgment, to see if it was too heavy rith sins to balance her Feather of Truth. The ab was most
nportant because it was the central blood-soul emanating from the
jsence of the mother.
The maxim that a pregnant woman carries her child "under her
Heart" began with the Egyptians, who believed menstrual blood that
uade the child's life descended from the mother's heart to her womb,
[he maternal heart, then, was the source of the child's life, which
| as why a mother called her child "heart's blood." The Book of the
[|)ead addressed prayers to "My heart of my mother. . . . My heart of
ansformations," meaning the source of rebirths. 1
Significantly, the meaning of the Egyptian word for the motheriven heart was reversed in Hebrew; ab was re-defined as "father."
The Egyptian hieroglyphic sign for ab was a dancing figure, and as verb it meant "to dance." 2 This referred to the mystic dance of life
ring on inside the body the heartbeat. The same mystic symbol in
idia was the Dance of Shiva, who was supposed to dwell at the
Kiting heart of the cosmos within the world-body of Kali. Shiva went
irough certain cycles when he was temporarily dead, known as hava the Corpse, and his dance ceased until his Mother resurrected
im again. Similarly, the Egyptian god Osiris passed through a death base before the Goddess brought him back to life. In this phase he was
lown as the Still-Heart.' Like other mummies, Osiris's mummy received a new ab, "heart
nulet," always made of red stone and placed in the mummy's breast bring back vitality.4 The custom of removing the mummy's real heart
375



Heart
Acts of John
A famous Gnostic text,
never entirely suppressed although the orthodox church
repeatedly denounced it
through the centuries for its heretical assertion
that, as a deity, Jesus could not actually die on the cross.
probably dated back to primitive ritual offerings of human hearts to the Goddess, who was addressed. in some archaic prayers as "swallower
of hearts." 5 As always, the primitive theory was that what a deity gave must be returned at least in part, to keep up the deity's energy to give
more. The same kind of sacrifices took place on the sacred pyramids
of Mexico. Victims identified with the dying god were cut open quickly,
so the heart could be offered still alive and "dancing." The Egyptian
word ab also meant an offering as well as a heart, suggesting that at
some point in Egyptian history the sacrificial victims were deprived of
their hearts.6 Juvenal said the Egyptians offered human sacrifices and ate human flesh. The Egyptian Goddess took an underworld form as
a monster Ab-She, "She Who Eats Hearts." 7 The old texts said the Goddess devoured what she created, after the manner of Kali, and
Earth, and Time, and Fate: "she taketh possession of hearts, she swalloweth." 8
Up to the present century, Bantu witches remembered Egyptian
ideas well enough to believe they could cast a death spell by
symbolically eating the intended victim's "heart life," a concept very lik<
the Egyptian ab. 9 Many phrases still in English usage date back to the Egyptian idea of the heart as the center of the self, the soul, or the
emotions. One is heavy-hearted or light-hearted; hope brings "new heart"; grief makes the heart ache or break; love steals the heart away, or
makes the heart full; absence makes the heart grow fonder; hearts
may be given, or taken, or withered, or gladdened; hearts may be warm
or cold, hard or soft.
So vital was the idea of the heartbeat in Oriental religions that the
very center of the universe was placed "within the heart" by Tantric sages. 10 This place was Chidambaram, where Shiva danced to the basic
rhythm of eternity. The sages said: "Sound (nada) represents the State of Power. It is experienced by the yogi when he plunges deep into himself. It is made manifest in the heartbeat. And since the micro
cosm is finally identical with the macrocosm, when the yogi hears the
Nada, this Sound of Power, he is listening to the heartbeat of the
Absolute." 11
In this expression of the basic mystical idea that deity is within the
human being, the sages in effect admitted that man creates God. The
heartbeat was also said to establish the fundamental tempo for poetry,
song, music, and dance. The Tantric idea of the heart's dance surfaced in early Gnostic
Christianity, when Jesus was equated with the dancing god-within. In | the Acts ofJohn, Jesus said to his followers: "To the Universe belongs
the dancer. He who does not dance does not know what happens.
Now if you follow my dance, see yourself in Me who am speaking. . . .
\
You who dance, consider what I do, for yours is this passion of Man
which I am to suffer." n
Though the church outlawed ecclesiastical dancing early in the ,
Christian era, the theme of the dancing god within the heart was not
forgotten. Eventually it led to the concept of the Sacred Heart, adopted
376



s an article of Catholic faith late in the 1 7th century. An oddly Hebe
bminine symbolism was attached to this re-working of the heart-soul
idea. Jesus's divinity was "the moon dwelling in the heart." His ^^^^^^^^^^^
iacred Heart was described by all the metaphors attached to the ancient
llother-heart: "as 'the temple in which dwells the life of the world,'
b a rose, a cup, a treasure, a spring, as the furnace of divine love ... as a
jridal chamber." B The church claimed that the Sacred Heart began with the divine
jision of St. Margaret Marie Alacoque in 1675. However, the idea las not original with her. An alchemical textbook published 1 1 years
jefore her birth depicted the Sacred Heart encircled by a crown of
horns. Several centuries earlier, it was shown on a stained-glass window
f the Convent des Cordeliers in Paris; on a Jacobin cloister wall; on
J window of the Chapel of St. Thomas Aquinas; and in four places of he Carmelite church of St. Michael. Some of these "certainly
elonged to the 1 5th and 16th centuries." H And of course, the concept
f the divine heart-soul at the core of the living world that is,
hiva's Sacred Heart, or Osiris's belonged to the millenia, long before here was a Christian church.

'irgin form of Hera, the Greek Mother of the Gods; a variant of
!ve, who was Hebat in Anatolia, Heveh or Hawwa in Mesopotamia,
Ivov in Persia. Greek myths said Hebe was cupbearer to the gods,
ispenser of their ambrosia of immortality. Without her, the gods would row old and die, the same doom that threatened the Norse gods
'hen they lost Freya. 1 Like Eve, in her Mother aspect Hebe governed the Tree of Life
'ith its magic apples, source of the gods' everlasting life, which they alously guarded from mankind (Genesis 3:22). Heroes like Heracles ould become immortal gods by marrying Hebe and living in her arden of paradise, where they could feed on the apples of the holy ee. 2 Such myths show that Hebe was only Hera virginized, for Hera
tas the owner of the serpent-guarded apple tree in the far-western
aradise, known to the Greeks as the garden of the Hesperides. After Hellenic Greeks introduced a social system of patriarchy and lie fashion of romantic-homosexual love, Father Zeus evicted Hebe torn her traditional post and replaced her with his own male concubine,
Janymede. Thus the Virgin Goddess was supplanted by the Youth, pe gods' new cupbearer, taken to heaven and dwelling in the stars as
pe constellation Aquarius. 5

Hecabe Hecate
var. Hecuba
Hecabe
Matriarchal queen of Troy, embodying the spirit of the Moongoddess Hecate, whose name was the same as her own. Hecabe's
"daughters" (priestesses) had divinatory powers, and the ability to cast spells, as shown by the legend of Cassandra. Hecabe herself laid
effective curses. When captured by her enemies, she transformed
herself into Hecate's totemic shape, a black bitch named Maera, Mara,
or Moera, the Destroying Fate. 1 The wanderings of Odysseus were attributable to the curse of exile she laid on him; he was preserved from
death only the by the counter-spell of his wife the Goddess Penelope.
1. Graves, CM. 2, 342.
Hecate
One of the oldest Greek versions of the trinitarian Goddess, Hecate
was derived from the Egyptian midwife-goddess Heqit, Heket, or Hekat, who in turn evolved from the heq or tribal matriarch of pre
dynastic Egypt: a wise-woman, in command of all the hekau or "mother's Words of Power." ' As a heavenly midwife amalgamating the Seven Hathors of the
birth-chamber, Heqit delivered the sun god every morning. 2 Her totem was the frog, symbol of the fetus; and this animal was still sacred
to her four thousand years later when she became the Christians'
"queen of witches."
In Greece, Hecate was one of many names for the original feminine trinity, ruling heaven, earth, and the underworld. Hellenes tended to emphasize her Crone or underworld aspect, but continued to
worship her at places where three roads met, especially in rites of
magic, divination, or consultation with the dead. 3 Her images guarded three-way crossroads for many centuries; thus she was Hecate Trevia, "Hecate of the Three Ways." Offerings were left at her roadside shrines
on nights of the full moon. As a deity of magic and prophecy she was
invoked by those who set out on journeys, like the biblical king of
Babylon, who "stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two
]
ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with
images" (Ezekiel 21:21). Hecate was called "most lovely one," a title of the moon.4 Like all i
other forms of the Triple Goddess, she was associated with the moon ]
in all three of her aspects. Some said she was Hecate Selene, the Moon,
in heaven; Artemis the Huntress on earth; and Persephone the Destroyer in the underworld. 5 Ancient texts referred to her as Hecate i
Selene the Far-Shooting Moon, mother of Dionysus though Dionysus was also the son of Persephone, which shows that Hecate and Persephone were often confused with one another. 6 Sometimes
Hecate was considered identical with Diana Ilithyia, the Moon-goddess \ as protectress of parturient women. Sometimes she was part of the
378



Dueen-of-Heaven trinity, Hebe the Virgin, Hera the Mother, Hecate [he Crone. Porphyry wrote:
The moon is Hecate, the symbol ofher varying phases. . . . [HJer power appears in three forms, having as symbol ofthe new moon the figure in the white robe and golden sandals, and torches lighted; the basket which she bears when she has mounted high is the symbol ofthe cultivation of the crops which she made to grow up according to the increase ofher
light.

Late Hellenic writers devised a rather labored explanation for
Hecate's journey from the sky to the underworld, originally a mythic rietaphor for the moon's setting. Hecate was in the house of a
woman in childbirth. The gods, fearing magical contagion from this, llunged her into the river Acheron to wash away the traces of birth
nana. The river carried Hecate underground, where she married
Hades. This was a myth derived from patriarchal anxieties about
lontact with childbearing women, demonstrated especially in the Bible
JLeviticus 12:5). Ritual bathing of mother and child in a sacred river
Ifter the lying-in period probably gave rise to the story of Hecate's river
burney. During the early Middle Ages, Hecate became known as Queen
\{ the Ghostworld, or Queen of Witches. She was especially diabo
Ized by Catholic authorities who said the people most dangerous to the pith were precisely those whom Hecate patronized: the midwives. 8
Her ancient threefold power was copied, however, by priestly writers l/ho reassigned it to their own deity: "The threefold power of Christ,
lamely in Heaven, in earth, and in Hell." 9

Jacrificial festival involving the offering of one hundred victims to

-iterally, "virility," the divine force without which Norse kings
ddn't rule. A king's virility was periodically tested, and when it
aned, he was usually killed and replaced. When King Fjolnir of weden "became impotent," he was drowned in a vat of mead, the
Dmmon euphemism for the sacred cauldron. 1 A similar custom
isposed of biblical kings, like David, who died very soon after the
laiden Abishag proved him impotent (1 Kings 1:4).

Heimdall was also the father of the castes.

var. Hekau Heka
Egyptian "Words of Power," evolved by primitive matriarchs under
the birth-goddess Hekat or Heqit (Greek Hecate). In Egyptian salva
tion-mysteries, rote learning of hekau was necessary to gain admission to various areas of the after-world. Also useful were amulets like the
Hekat, a uterine "ark" named after the Goddess. See Ship.
Hel
Norse Queen of the Underworld, whose name became the English "hell." Dead heroes who went to the house of Hel were known as
Helleder, "Hel's men." 3 Sometimes they were ancestral ghosts
known as Hella cunni, "kinsmen of Hel," corrupted in the medieval
mystery play to Harlequin, lover of Columbine the Dove-maiden, who was another version of the Goddess. 4 The Celtic Lord of Death,
wearer of the apex or pointed tiara of divinity, bore the title of
Helman. 5
The early "hell" seems to have been a uterine shrine or sacred
cave of rebirth, denoted by the Norse hellir. 6 The notion of Hel as a
cauldron-womb filled with purgative fire may have been related to the
idea of the volcanic Mother-mountain (Latin caldera). In the Pacific,
380



Mother Hell or Mother Death was often a fire-mountain entered by
way of a sacred cave. The Hawaiian volcano-goddess Pele, like Hel,
kept souls of the dead in regenerative fire. Pele and Hel may have had
linguistic connections, as p and h may be interchanged in Indo
European languages. In Malekula, the dead live in a volcano under the Goddess's rule: "Abiding in that fire is bliss; there is no fear of being consumed." Japan's sacred volcano was named for the fire-goddess Fuji, "Grandmother" or "Ancestress." 7 Similarly, Hel was a fire-mountain
according to German legend; the emperor Theodoric became immortal by entering her womb through a volcano. 8 The Infernus of classical paganism contributed to the Christian amalgam of images of Hel's land. Infernus meant an oven in the
earth; an old Roman proverb said "the oven is the mother." Roman ovens and bakeries were associated with temples of the Goddess,
whose harlot-priestesses were often called Ladies of Bread. Their orgies
were called Fornacalia, "oven-feasts," from fornix, the "oven" which gave us both "furnace" and "fornicate." 9 Naturally, Christian authori
ties maintained that tasting the sacred fire of eternity through
"fornication" was a sin.
Medieval legends spoke of Hel as Brunnhilde, "Burning Hel," also the name of a leader of the Valkyries, otherwise known as Hild the
Avenger. 10 Another of her names was Matabrune, "Burning Mother," who gave birth to King Oriant, a version of the Oriental sun god born at dawn from the bowels of the earth. 11
Magic fire surrounding the Valkyrie's castle was an allegory of cremation fire, through which a hero passed enroute to Hel. Crema
tion of the dead was later forbidden by the Christian church, on the
theory that cremation destroyed the body and prevented "resurrec
tion of the flesh" according to the orthodox dogma. The more practical
reason for outlawing cremation was that, as a pagan ceremony, it
brought no revenue to the church. 12 It was profitable, however, to
cremate witches while they still lived; inflated charges were made for
every rope, nail, and stick of wood. B
Some myths suggest that Hel was originally envisioned as not fiery
but dark: a Crone-goddess like Black Kali, eater of the dead. As the
Nether Moon, she was called Nehellenia. Her ancient altars were found in Holland at the mouths of the Rhine. 14 Vases and statues from her
shrines were discovered in Zealand in 1646. 15 Sometimes, her under
world was not hot but ice cold, as if serving as a model for Dante's
innermost circle of the Inferno. The cold, dark Queen of Shades was Nef-Hel or Nifl.
Hel was supreme and inescapable, seizing even gods in her embrace. The Swedes said Odin the Heavenly Father was buried in a barrow known as Hel's Mount. 16 Because she was associated with
mountains, Hel sometimes merged with Mother Freya. A fatespinning Goddess called Hel of the Air was worshipped on the Luftelberg. 17 She was simultaneously diabolized as feminine counterpart of the Prince of the Power of the Air (Odin-Satan) who led the
Hel
In various dialects
Hel was Holle, Halja, Hild, Helga, Holde, Helle, Ella, or Hellenia.
Helgo, Heligoland, Helsinki, Hollingstedt, Holderness, Holstein, and Holland were a few of the
many place names derived from her. She was the usual tombwomb of rebirth after death. Iceland still has a traditional "home of the dead" in Helgafell or Hel's Hill. 1 In
Germany, "Dame Holle's Well" was called the source of all the children on earth. 2

Helen of Troy Wild Hunt. Tenth-century witchcraft texts said the heathen women rode forth under the leadership of "the witch Holda." 18 ^^^^^^^^^^^^ Like her Greek twin Hecate, Hel sometimes wore all three faces oi
the Triple Goddess. The German poem Gudrun represented her as
the ruler of Holland, incarnate in three virgins living in a mystic cave:
Hild, princess of Isenland, Hilde, princess of India, and Hildburg, princess of Portugal. All three resembled mermaids or wood nymphs. The legendary Prince Hagen married all three Hels, after the usual
ritual combat with an elder king. 19 Ballads and sagas depicting such encounters between mortal men
and supernatural women were collectively described as "hellish"
that is, hellig, medieval Danish for "holy." 20
Pliny said all the inhabitants of "Scatinavia" (Scandinavia) were
children of Mother Hel, thus they were called Helleviones. 21 They
considered their Goddess incarnate especially in elder trees, which were
still called Hel-trees or elven-trees in the Middle Ages. Danish
peasants prayed at elder trees to the Hyldemoer, that is, Hel-mother, or Elder-mother. 22
Hel's ancient connection with fertility was still evident in her
medieval titles, Lady Abundia or Satia (abundance, satiety). In this guise she led the "ladies of the night" called Hellequins, who rode forth
to receive offerings of food and drink from common folk, promising in return to bring prosperity on the house. 23 Apparently these were not
mere legends but real women, carrying on the Goddess's nocturnal
festivals. Hel was despised by the church, but the common people seem to have thought her more benevolent than otherwise. Her under
world was reached by crossing a river, like the Greek Styx; the river was
Gjoll, "Wailing." On the bridge that crossed it stood the Goddess's
emanation, Modgudr (Good Mother), ready like the Orphic Persephone to greet the deceased and see him safely into eternity. 24 Northern shamans believed they could put on the Helkappe, a
magic mask or Hel-met, which would render them invisible like ghosts, and enable them to visit the underworld and return to earth
again without dying. The Helkappe seems to have represented the shamanic trance, in which death and resurrection were experienced as a vision. See Mask.

Helen of Troy
Incarnation of the Virgin Moon-goddess, daughter of Queen Hecuba, or Hecate, who embodied the Crone. Helen was also called Helle or
382



I Selene. She was worshipped as an orgiastic deity at the Spartan Helice
|
festival Helenephoria, featuring sexual symbols carried in a special Hell I fetish-basket, the helene. 1 ^^^^^^^^^^^
Trojan Helen married Menelaus, "Moon-king," who was prom
ised immortality because he made a sacred marriage. 2 However, I Helen left him and went home with her new Trojan lover Paris, so
i Menelaus lost both his immortality and the Trojan fiefs that Helen's
"matrimony" brought. He sailed with his armies to get her back, and
I this was the start of the legendary Trojan War which pitted patriarchal Greeks against matriarchal Trojans. 3
As Elen, Elaine, or Hel-Aine, the same Moon-virgin became the
| queen of pagan Britain, a "Lily Maid" who made the first alliances
with emperors of Rome. (See Elaine.) The oldest British histories said
the first British king was a Trojan named Brutus, Helen's relative. 4
After Troy fell, he sailed west to the island of Albion and founded a city,
New Troy, later renamed Lugdunum (London) after his descendant, the god Lug. 5

lough Christian theology gave its underworld the name of the
idess Hel, it was quite a different place from her womb of regenera
. The ancients didn't view the underworld as primarily a place of
lishment. It was dark, mysterious, and awesome, but not the vast
ire chamber Christians made of it.
Greeks called the underworld Erebus, Hades, or Tartarus, from
"tortoise" incarnation of Vishnu, who was supposed to support
|
earth in the form of a tortoise. Shades of the dead dwelling in
arus endured no torment other than the general cheerlessness of
lg dead. Lacking blood, shadows, voices, and vital energy, they ted yearningly for rebirth.
Like the realms of earth and heaven, the underworld had its social
lierarchy. Queen Persephone or Hecate, her consort Pluto or Hades,
uled magistrates like Aeacus, Rhadamanthys, and Minos, who were
383



He" wizard-kings on earth. There were spirits like Hypnos (Sleep), Morpheus (Dreams), and Thanatos (Death). 1 Sometimes, as in the
h^^^hh medieval vision of fairyland, the underworld was a place of sensual
delight. In the Elysian Fields, souls of the enlightened ones were tende by the Goddess's divine nymphs.
Like the Egyptian nether god, Seker or Amen, Hades was "the
unseen one" the ubiquitous Hidden God in his intra-uterine, sleeping, or dead Black Sun phase. Lord of the Underworld or Lord of Death, he was also a phallic deity, holding the "key" to the nether
yonic gate, as his heavenly counterpart Petra (Peter) held the key to th
Pearly Gate of Celestial Aphrodite. The nether god was supposed to
deposit his semen in rocks, where it solidified into precious gems, a western version of the Jewel in the Lotus. Thus he was Lord of
Riches also. Romans called Hades by the name of Dis, short for Dives,
"the rich god." 2 Most savior-gods who "harrowed hell," or plowed the earth-womb, were credited with the power to reveal buried treasure a power inherited by the Christian devil. 5
Egyptians called the underworld Amenti, Khert-Neter, NeterKhertet, or the Tuat. It was both a hell and a paradise, a place of
judgment and rebirth. Egyptian religion didn't emphasize punishment for sin. Egypt's savior Osiris came to save humanity not from
everlasting torture, but from death. 4 Egyptians feared death, which thej
called an "abomination," and devoted most of their religious efforts
to avoiding it. 5 Egyptian pictures of "the wicked" being destroyed in underworld fire-pits were interpreted by Christians as torments of damned souls.
'
However, these "wicked" were not necessarily human. They were
supernatural enemies of the sun god: spirits of darkness, mist, storm. The fire-pits seem to have represented the burning clouds of sunrise and sunset. Even when victims were human, their burning was not eternal.
Egyptians did not believe in purgatory or everlasting punishment. . . . [T]he wicked were slaughtered daily and their bodies consumed by fire,
but each day brought its own supply ofthese, and thus the avenging gods were kept busy daily, and the fire-pits were filled with victims daily. There is no evidence in the texts that the Egyptians thought the burning ofthe same victims could go on forever. 6
The idea of eternal torture in hell arose with ascetic patriarchal
religions like that of Zoroastrian Persia. Masculine preoccupation with
pain stood in contrast to the matriarchies' preoccupation with plea
sure, a psychic outgrowth of the severities of the ascetic life. There is
reason to believe hell's nastier torments were invented primarily to
intimidate women into obeying new patriarchal laws.
Zoroastrian priests insisted women who were unfaithful to their
husbands would go to hell and have their breasts torn open with iron
combs. Women who scolded would be forced to lick hot stoves with
j
their tongues. Women who showed disloyalty to men would be hung
up by one leg, while scorpions, snakes, ants, and worms dug their way ir.
384



i and out of their bodies. 7 A similar vision inspired Grunewald's Hell
| medieval picture of the hellish torments in store for those who committed the crime of loving.8 But not even the Persians supposed the ^^^^^-i^^-^_
Itorments of hell would go on forever. That refinement of cruelty was
(left to the Christians.
The Jews adopted the Persians' hell as a place for punishing the
(majority of women, judged hopelessly unworthy of the Father-god's
jheaven. Men could be consigned to hell for holding too much unnecessary conversation with their wives, or for taking feminine advice.9
(The female creation-river Gihon was converted into Gehenna, the
Jewish hell's river of fire, whose name was sometimes applied to the iwhole land. The kingdom of Gehenna was 60 times as large as the world. Each of its "palaces" had 6000 "houses," and each house had
pOOO vessels of fire and gall awaiting the sinner. Prince of Gehenna was
(Arsiel, copied from the Chaldean "Black Sun" Aciel, the negative
deity corresponding to the god of light in the celestial realm. 10
Judeo-Christian tradition populated hell with all the biblical baalim, even those who had been identified with Yahweh himself: Behe
moth, Leviathan, Baal-Peor, Baal-Zebub, Baal-Rimmon, Belial, Ksmodeus, Molech, Lucifer, Satan, Tammuz, Dagon, Nehushtan, Chemosh (Shamash), Apollyon: even Baal-Berith, the "God of the
|3ovenant." These were joined by gods and goddesses of classical
religions: Hades, Pluto, Diana, Persephone, Hermes, Python, Hecate, Minerva, Venus, Cybele, Attis, Jupiter, Neptune, Saturn, Adonis, ran, Lamia, Medusa, Lilith plus all the gods and goddesses of Oermanic and Celtic paganism. Even those who were artificially
canonized, to convert their old shrines into churches, were often
[ [imultaneously diabolized and consigned to hell in the guise of lemons.
There was a curious medieval passion for identifying, classifying,
pd naming all the demons. Sorcery required knowledge of their
> lames and titles. An exorcist could do nothing until he learned the
[jiame of the demon he dealt with. The Gospels said even Jesus iieeded to learn the names of the Gadarene devils he exorcised (Mark
|>:9). Thus, many sources provided lists of demonic names.
One of the most interesting dissertations on hell was Johann [Meyer's Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, published in the 16th cenury when Weyer served the Duke of Cleves as a healer and diviner.
i Weyer said there were exactly 7,405,926 demons, divided into 72
Bompanies. These figures had already been reported in the Talmud. 11 Miupreme Chief of the Infernal Empire and founder of the Order of
[he Fly was Beelzebuth (Baal-Zebub), the old Philistine Lord of Flies.
IHis lieutenants included Satan, Leader of the Opposition; Pluto, l*rince of Fire; Moloch, Prince of the Land of Tears and Grand Cross If the Order of the Fly; Baal, Commander-in-Chief of the Infernal Armies and another Grand Cross of the Order of the Fly; and Lucifer,
J Lord Chief Justice of hell.
Baal-Berith, erstwhile God of the Covenant, filled the post of
385



He" Minister of Treaties. Nergal, husband of the Babylonian under
ground Goddess Eresh-kigal, became hell's Chief of Secret Police. Th
^^^^^^^^^^h Royal Household included Melchom (Milcom) as Paymaster, and the Philistine god Dagon as Grand Pantler. The Hebrew elephant god
Behemoth (originally Ganesha, father of Buddha) was Grand CupBearer. Among the Masters of the Revels, Asmodeus held the post of
Superintendent of Casinos. Antichrist was only an insignificant juggler and mimic. 12
The infernal hierarchy also maintained embassies in various Eurc pean countries. Thamuz, or Tammuz, was Ambassador to Spain. Baal-Rimmon, Phoenicia's "Lord of the Pomegranate," was Ambassador to Russia. England's ambassador was Mammon, whose
appointment reflected continental resentment of the English zeal for commerce.
Sexual prejudice also extended to the denizens of hell. There wa!
only one token female among hell's governing spirits: Proserpine, called Arch-she-devil and Sovereign Princess of Mischievous Spirits.
Astaroth (Astarte) was present only in masculine disguise, as a "duke" of hell and its Grand Treasurer. The Goddess Belili took two male
shapes, as Belial and Belphegor, hell's ambassadors to Turkey and France.
Masculinized Goddesses appeared also in Collin de Plancy's
Dictionnaire infernal, an imitation of Weyer's Pseudomonarchia, showing portraits of a male "demon Ashtoreth" and a male "demon
Eurynome." Even Lilith was masculinized as a hellish "prince" in
Alexis de Terreneuve du Thym's list of devils: "Beelzebub, the su
preme chieftain; Satan, the dethroned prince; Eurinome, prince of
death; Moloch, prince of the Land of Tears; Pluto, prince of fire; Pan,
prince of the incubi; Lilith, prince of the succubae; Leonard, grand
master of the Sabbaths; Daalberith (Baal Berith), high pontiff; and Proserpine, the arch she-devil." 13
What Weyer's solemn imitators never understood was that the
Pseudomonarchia was really an elaborate joke, invented as a carica
ture of earthly hierarchies. Humor and skepticism were equally foreign to the Age of Faith, when the core of learning was credulity. It was a
childlike age. Generations of would-be Magi soberly studied Weyer's
mockery in search of demonic names to use in magic charms.
Weyer not only mocked the Christian hierarchy; he also defendet witches. As a physician, he was called to examine some of the
Inquisition's victims, and pronounced them harmless, deluded women who could not be held responsible for the statements wrung from
them by torture. He tried unsuccessfully to halt the tortures and
burnings. For this he was accused of heresy and indecency. Father
Bartolomeo da Spina scorned Weyer with heavy-handed irony: "Recently Satan went to a Sabbath attired as a great prince, and told the
assembled witches they need not worry since, thanks to Weyer and his i
followers, the affairs of the Devil were brilliantly progressing." H
386



But, Weyer aside, hell was not a joke. It was perhaps the most sadistic fantasy ever conceived by the mind of man. It was described,
painted, and contemplated with incredibly perverse relish. Berthold of Regensburg said sinful folk must imagine their punishment in hell as the pain of a body made white-hot in a white-hot universe. "Let them
count the sands of the sea-shore, or every hair that has grown upon man and beast since the days of Adam; let them reckon a year of torment for each of those hairs and, even then, the sinner will be only
at the outset of his unending agony." 15 Martin of Braga said anyone
who renounced Christianity would be "put physically into eternal fire
in hell, where the inextinguishable flames burn for ever . . . and such a
man shall long to die again, and not feel the punishment, but he will not be allowed to." 16
Churchmen claimed the fires of sexual passion were transmuted
into the fires of hell, blown by the breath of God into a heat fiercer
than any earthly flame. A single drop of sweat from a damned soul would pierce living flesh like an arrow and burn like acid. One was
told to imagine the pain of being covered with such sweat, forever. 17
The story of sinner's sweat was often told throughout the Middle
Ages. It may have been inspired by a passage from the Mahabharata:
"As the lord of gods, whose energy is infinite, became angry, a terrible drop of sweat came out of his forehead; and as soon as that drop
of sweat had fallen to the earth, an enormous fire like the fire of
doomsday appeared." 18 Perhaps the worst part of the hell-vision was theologians' insistence
that the joy of the blessed ones in heaven couldn't be complete unless
they were permitted to gloat over the sufferings of the damned. St. Gregory the Great assumed with appalling naturalness that the "good"
people in heaven would be entirely without pity. St. Thomas Aquinas
wrote: "In order that nothing may be wanting to the felicity of the
blessed spirits in heaven, a perfect view is granted to them of the tortures of the damned." Other fathers of the church proclaimed that,
while the greatest pleasure of the saved would be contemplating the Divine Essence, their second greatest pleasure would be watching the damned writhing in hell. They couldn't feel sorry for loved ones or
friends in torment, because their opinions would always be identical
with God's; and God apparently reveled in sinners' pain. 19 Thomas of Cantimpre mentioned some "simple folk" who wor
ried about having to watch former friends or relatives suffering in
I
hell. He said these worries were foolish, because no one in heaven could
grieve for anything. He cited the Blessed Marie d'Oignies, who saw
j
in a vision that her dead mother was damned, and so stopped mourning
for her at once. 20
St. Bernardino of Siena argued that heaven must be perfect, and
perfection couldn't be achieved without "due admixture of groans
from the Damned." Only a few people were good enough to be saved;
the vast majority would go to hell. This was the orthodox opinion.

Hell
Raymond Lull (Raimundo Lulio) Catalan philosopher of the late 13th century, author of numerous
mystical works in Catalan, Arabic, and Latin. Lull was revered in the Franciscan order as Doctor Uluminatus and as a saint in some areas. He
was never officially canonized, though Pope Pius IX confirmed his cultus in 1858.
Raymond Lull was condemned as a heretic for trying to teach that
Christ's mercy would save nearly all men. Christ was not that
merciful; only the mother Mary was that merciful. An Ethiopian
Christian legend said Mary was distressed to see her kinfolk in
hellfire, and asked God to give humanity holy writings that would save them. 21
The sadism implicit in the fantasy of hell was all too graphically
enacted by the inquisitors' tortures and burnings. The Inquisition's handbook directed that "eternal damnation should begin in this life, tha
it might be in some way shown what will be suffered in hell." 22 The
inquisitor Bodin considered even slow burning a negligible punishment in view of its sequel: "Whatever punishment one can order against
witches by roasting and cooking them over a slow fire is not really very much, and not as bad as the torment which Satan has made for them
in this world, to say nothing of the eternal agonies which are prepared for them in hell, for the fire here cannot last more than an hour or so
until the witches have died." 23 Of course, the witches so mercifully slain
often had been subjected to unendurable tortures already for weeks,
months, or even years. The inquisitor Nicholas Remy said witches "are justly to be
subjected to every torture and to put to death in the flames; both that
they may expiate their crimes with a fitting punishment and that its very awfulness may serve as an example and a warning to others." To
help them remember the occasion, witches' children were to be
stripped and beaten with rods around the stakes where their mothers
were burning. 24 Inquisitors obviously disliked children. They burned
"witches" 10 or 12 years of age, or even younger. 25 At Wiirzburg in
1629, children as young as 7 were executed for witchcraft, plus many
others of 10, 12, 14, or 15 years. 26 Up to the 19th century, hell was used as a convenient way to
throw the "fear of God" into children. Father Furniss's Sight ofHell
presented the following edifying fantasies to young people:
Oftwo little maids ofsixteen, one cared only for dress, and went to a
dancing school, and dared to disport in the park on Sunday instead of going to mass: that little maid stands now, and forever will stand, with bare
feet upon a red-hot floor. The other walked through the streets at
night, and did very wicked things; now she utters shrieks ofagony in a burning oven. A very severe torment immersion up to the neck in a
boiling kettle agitates a boy who kept bad company, and was too idle to go to mass, and a drunkard; avenging flames now issue from his ears.
For like indecencies, the blood ofa girl, who went to the theatre, boils in her veins; you can hear it boil, and her marrow is seething in her bones \ and her brain bubbles in her head. "Think,
"
says the compassionate father, "what a headache that girl must have!" 27
Dutch theologian Dirk Camphuysen opposed such crude train- j ing of the young, on the theory that it was more disturbing to sensitive (
minds than corrective of sinful ones. Unable to refrain from commit
388



ting some sins, people developed a personal conviction of doom, "which
necessarily produces such great fear and agony in the soul, that life is too frightening for them, and they find death by their own hand. Of this there are not a few examples, and some of them known to me
personally. Others do not go as far as suicide, but fall into fits of
melancholy and despair, sometimes ending in madness." 28
John Wesley was so implacable as to maintain that the whole Christian religion depended entirely on the horrors of hell. If there
were "no unquenchable fire, no everlasting burnings," then all New Testament teaching is a lie, and there is no reason to believe in the
revelation of heaven. 29 Yet some theologians disagreed. Johann Cloppenburg said in 1682: "It is absurd that God should be angry forever,
and punish the finite sins of creatures with infinite punishments." 30
Some thinkers maintained that only an evil God could create a hell
so savage and deliberately allow human beings to fall into it, when he had the power to prevent this. The doctrine of free will was invented by
the church to counteract this logic; but, as Bayle showed, "absolute
free will is of no real use in justifying hell or in theodicy in general."
Man's free will "does not exculpate God from being ultimately responsible for the sins He punishes, unless one takes from Him His
omniscience as well as His omnipotence. . . . [I]f, before the creation, He foresaw that most men would abuse their free will and commit sins,
he could have refrained from creating them." 31 The same sentiment
was put forth more than 2000 years ago by the author of 2 Esdras, who demanded why God had bothered to create Adam if he couldn't
restrain Adam from sinning.
In wrestling with the problem of God's responsibility for hell, theologians of the 17th and 18th centuries often found themselves
forced by their own logic into a basically Manichean image of an evil
God. Sterry said "an angry, revengeful God is no God at all, but a
projection of men's evil passions. . . . If sin is part of God's plan, then
the sinner as much as the saint can claim to be fulfilling God's will."
Jurieu admitted "the absolute impossibility of reconciling God's hatred
of sin with His permission of it." He re-phrased Esdras's question: "If God has an infinite hatred of sin, why, having foreseen it, has He not
prevented it? Why has He made men be born who, He well knew,
were to damn themselves? "
Bayle described God as "a lawgiver who
forbids man to commit crime, and who nevertheless pushes man into
crime, and then punishes him for it eternally." Thus he must be a God
"in which one could have no trust, a deceiving, cunning, unjust,
cruel nature; He is no longer an object of religion." 32 Whiston even concluded that the very existence of hell must condemn God in the
eyes of humanity:
The exquisite torments ofthese most numerous and most miserable creatures, are determined without the least pity, or relenting, or bowels
ofcompassion in their Creator, to be in everlasting fire, and in the flames
ofHell; without abatement, or remission, for endless ages ofages. And

Hell all this for the sins of this short life; fallen into generally by the secret
snares ofthe Devil, and other violent temptations; which they com^^^^^^^^^^^^ monly could not wholly either prevent, or avoid . . . instances . . . ofthe
absolute and supreme power and dominion ofthe cruel and inexorable
author of their being. n
Political implications of the "problem" of hell were set forth by
Petersen:
What fruit has the doctrine ofeternal damnation borne up till now? Has it
made men more pious? On the contrary, when they have properly considered the cruel, frightful disproportion between the punishments and their own finite sins, they have begun to believe nothing at all, and have
thought that these books ofHoly Scripture have just been compiled by the priests, who made up such threats for the common people as they thought fit, in order to keep them in check. 3*
Of course blaming the fiendishness of hell on God, or Satan, or
Adam, or any other mythic figure was a way of avoiding recognition of the fact that its real inventors were men. Eastern sages were more frank; they said "the torments of hell are morbid creations of the
individual's own ideas." 55 The ideas of the individual, however, were created by the society in the case of hell, by the church. As Chaucer's
Summoner slyly said, people sometimes thought the friars came by their familiarity with hell in a direct manner:
This friar boasts his knowledge about Hell,
And ifhe does, God knows it's little wonder; Friars and fiends are seldom far asunder. J6
Though the possibility is seldom recognized, there are many indications that the Christian vision of hell in its sadistic horror was one
of the leading causes of disillusionment with Christianity itself. Hell
was necessary, otherwise there was nothing for "salvation" to save from;
yet it often seemed people were sent to hell for no greater sin than being human. William Blake said, "When thought is closed in caves,
then love shall show its root in deepest Hell." ?7 In the end, scholars were forced to renounce hell because it made
God look more vindictive than man, though few dared admit that the
vindictiveness sanctioned and stressed by the church was really man's
alone. Shaftesbury said it was impossible to adore a God "whose
character is to be captious and of high resentment, subject to wrath and
anger, furious, revengeful ... (of) a fraudulent disposition, encouraging deceit and treachery among men, favorable to a few, though for
slight causes, and cruel to the rest." Bayle found it impossible to
exonerate "a good and omnipotent God" from responsibility for the
world's evils, though he made humanity suffer for them. The
problem became "infinitely more difficult when He has also to be
exonerated from causing the suffering and wickedness of the next
world." 38

Henna
Widely used in India and Egypt and by Greek worshippers of Hecate to stain women's palms and soles the sacred color of the Goddess,
henna was important in her sacrificial rites. The death-dealing Goddess Anath was colored red with henna before immolation of human
victims to her image. 1 Gypsy legends preserved something of the association between henna and the sacrificial ceremonies of Mari
Anath. They claimed Mary was preparing to redden her hair with
henna at the very moment when her son was crucified; therefore she
laid a curse on the red pigment that was formerly sacred. 2 Jewish
scriptures spoke of "daughters of Cain" i.e., women who didn't worship Yahweh whose hands and feet were "dyed with color" in
the Oriental fashion. 3
Like all other trappings of women's religions, henna was associated
with witchcraft in the Middle Ages. One of the heretical crimes for
which the Spanish Inquisition arrested women was the use of henna to
redden the skin or nails. 4 During the Victorian era, an Essex woman
was charged with witchcraft for no other reason than the discovery in her house of some "red ochre," or henna. 5

Hephaestus
Pre-Hellenic smith god, cast down from the Olympians' heaven by
Zeus, for trying to protect his mother Hera. Hephaestus was one of the ancient Amazonian smiths, an opponent of the divine Father. He
took Hera's side in her quarrels with Zeus; he married Aphrodite; he
was on affectionate terms with the primal Sea-goddesses Thetis and
Eurynome; he shared a temple with Athene. He was lame, like all the Amazonian smiths. He was associated with volcanoes and lightning,
like all early gods who fertilized the Great Mother's "abyss" with fire.
One of Hephaestus's major shrines was the island of Lemnos, a matriarchal colony founded by Amazons. 1

Hera
Pausanias Greek traveler and geographer of the 2nd century a.d. Living in a time of
declining culture, he was inspired by a desire to describe the ancient sacred sites for
posterity.
Hera
Hera's name was sometimes rendered "Lady," and may have meant
He Era, the Earth. An earlier version was Rhea, the pre-Hellenic Great Mother mythologized as the mother of the Greeks' Hera. Both were
forms of the Great Goddess of early Aegean civilization, who predated the appearance of gods on the scene. 1 Hera's name could also have been a cognate of Hiera, "Holy
One," a title of ancient goddess-queens who ruled in her name. An Amazon queen named Hiera of Mysia led her army against the Greeks in defense of matriarchal Troy. Philostratus said Homer refused to mention Hiera in the Iliad because she was so great as to outshine Homer's heroine, Helen. 2
There were many other, more far-flung cognates and counterparts of Hera. In Babylon she was "Erua, the queen, who controls birth." 3
She chose kings, gave them sovereignty by marrying them, and deposed them. As the eponymous Goddess of ancient Ireland she was "the
Lady Eire," or Eriu. 4 Like Hera, the Lady Eire controlled the western
apple-garden of immortality. Hera was the Mother of the Gods, even of the Olympian gods, to
whom she gave the ambrosia of eternal life. Hellenic writers tried to
make her subordinate to Zeus, though she was much older than he, and
had married him against her will. Their constant mythological quar
rels reflected conflicts between early patriarchal and matriarchal cults.
As the primordial feminine trinity, Hera appeared as Hebe, Hera, and Hecate new moon, full moon, old moon otherwise personified as
the Virgin of spring, the Mother of summer, and the destroying Crone of autumn. Pausanias said Hera was worshipped as Child, Bride,
and Widow. 5 In her Argive temple, she passed through endless cycles as her virginity was annually renewed, like that of Aphrodite, by immersion in a holy spring.6
Hera received sacrifices of "heroes," or "Hera-sacred men,"
whose myths dated from a primitive time when men were slain as her martyr-bridegrooms. In ancient Greece the term "hero" was synonymous with "ghost" one who had gone to the Goddess. 7 Herodotus
told the story of two of these heroes, Cleobis and Biton, chosen to draw
the Mother's chariot in a procession. Afterward they "fell asleep" in
her temple and never woke again. This holy death reflected great honor on their family; Solon called Cleobis and Biton "the happiest of men." 8 Like Christian martyrs, they achieved the "crown."
Hera's cult spread at an early date throughout pagan Europe, the whole continent having been named after one of her incarnations,
Europa. Saxons worshipped her at Heresburg (Hera's Mount), where the phallic "column of the world" called Hermeseul was planted in
the Earth-goddess's yoni.9 Late in the 8th century a.d., the temple was destroyed and the phallic pillar overthrown by the armies of Charle
magne. However, the sanctuary was not forgotten. The Salic Law referred to "witches" called hereburgium or herburgium, those who
392



worship at the Heresburg. 10 They were equated with those who "carried the cauldron" to religious meetings in honor of the God
desssuch meetings as the clergy styled witches' sabbats. Legends of
Hera's magic garden in the west, where the apples of immortality grew, passed into the medieval lore of Fairyland.

Heracles
Heracles
Greek savior, the earthly incarnation of either Zeus or Apollo, the
sun; born of the moon-virgin Alcmene ("Power of the Moon"), whose consort didn't lie with her until after her Divine Child was born.
His name meant "Glory of Hera," and he was nursed by the Great Goddess herself on the same milk that spurted from her breasts to
form the Milky Way. His Twelve Labors symbolized the sun's passage
through the twelve houses of the zodiac, the heavenly "way" indicat
ed for him by the same river of celestial milk. After his course was
finished, he was clothed in the scarlet robe of the sacred king and
killed, to be resurrected as his own divine father, to ascend to heaven, to
marry the virgin form of the Goddess all over again, and to dwell
among the stars, where he is still found.
Pausanias said Heracles's surname was Soter (Savior).
1 Julian said of him, "All the elements obey the demiurgic and perfective power of this pure and unmixed spirit, whom the great Zeus has begotten to be the Savior of the Universe." He was worshipped everywhere as the
savior who "died" and rose again like the sun, which is why a solar
eclipse was supposed to have attended his death the same mythic
eclipse appended to the deaths of Krishna, Buddha, Osiris, and Jesus. 2 The influence of Heracles's cult on early Christianity can hardly
be overestimated. St. Paul's home town of Tarsus regularly re
enacted the sacred drama of Heracles's death by fire, which is why Paul
assumed there was great saving virtue in giving one's body to be
burned, like the Heracles-martyrs (1 Corinthians 13:3). Heracles was called Prince of Peace, Sun of Righteousness, Light of the World. He was the same sun greeted daily by Persians and Essenes with the
ritual phrase, "He is risen."' The same formula announced Jesus's
return from the underworld (Mark 16:6). Heracles also entered the underworld and "harrowed hell," the
fructifying function of the King of Glory who "came in" to the
womb of the Earth-goddess (Hera). She gave him his second birth and
made him a god hence his title, dedicated to her glory.4 He was
sacrificed at the spring equinox (Easter), the New Year festival by the
old reckoning. He was born at the winter solstice (Christmas), when the sun reaches his nadir and the constellation of the Virgin rises in the
east. 5 As Albert the Great put it centuries later, "The sign of the
Julian (Flavius Claudius Julianus) Roman emperor from 361 to 363 a.d., the
only pagan to rule Rome after the time of
Constantine; nicknamed "the
Apostate" by Christian historians because he tried to re-institute the old
Roman religion. His
death was mysterious; some claimed he was assassinated by a Christian.
393



Heracles celestial virgin rises above the horizon, at the moment we find fixed for
the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ." 6
^ ^_ The celestial virgin to whom Heracles ascended was sometimes
Hebe, or Hera-as-Maiden, or Eve as she was called in the Middle
East. Like Isis, she said the fruit of her womb became the sun. 7 Often
she was confused with Cyprian Aphrodite, who was really the same celestial virgin incarnate in the attendant Horae who followed the god
through his risings and settings on the wheel of time: "In twelve months the silent pacing Horae follow him from the nether-world to
that above, the dwelling of the Cyprian Goddess, and then he declines again to Acheron." 8 In Lydia, Heracles was bound to the cosmic wheel of Queen
Omphale, the Goddess incarnate, representing the hub of the universe (omphalos). He was one in a succession of her sacred kings. His
predecessor was the oak-crowned Tmolus, who died by impalement after coupling with the high priestess. Another earlier model of the
wheel-kings was Ixion of the Lapiths, who died on a fiery wheel
signifying the revolutions of the sun. Such a sacrificial custom probably underlay the myth of Heracles bound to the wheel and made
to spin for a year that is, to turn through the signs of the zodiac
which decorated the wheel.9 Hellenic writers re-interpreted the myth to
mean Heracles spent a year as a slave among Omphale's women,
spinning flax on a spinning wheel, wearing female dress, a story invented to explain the early stage in the evolution of sacred kingship
when a man could be the queen's deputy only when wearing her robes. 10 Priests of Heracles wore female garments up to a fairly late
date.
Another myth said Heracles's predecessor was the centaur Nessus, who engaged in combat with Heracles for possession of the priestess Deianira. Heracles won, and married Deianira. Nessus died, bequeath
ing his blood-red ceremonial robe to the conqueror. Later, when his
priestess-wife ordained that he must wear the robe, Heracles put it on
and burned as if "wrapped in flames." His pyre was lighted by the next king, Philoctetes, who inherited his emblems of office. 11
An Egyptian version of the same dying-and-reborn "hero" was Horus, or Heru, firstborn of Isis-Hathor. 12 In his dying aspect he was
the enfeebled form of Ra, named Harakhti, declining toward his burning pyre in the west, to be devoured by the Mother's under
ground womb. Greeks called his holy city Herakleopolis, "City of
Heracles." n The same sun-and-fire god was known in the Far East
as one of the Ten Knowledge-Holding Deities, still remembered as "the
most Supreme Heruka." H Egypt continued to celebrate the fiery death and rebirth of a mock
king up to the 19th century a.d., on the first day of each year by
Coptic reckoning. The god-man was placed on a throne for three days, crowned with a tall pointed miter like that of pharaohs, May Kings,
Carnival Kings, Lords of Misrule, and other pagan savior figures. Then
394



I he was burned in effigy and crept forth "reborn" from the ashes of his
royal garment. Frazer says, "The custom points to an old practice of
I burning a real king in grim earnest." 15 According to Tertullian, as
late as the 3rd century a.d. the people of Carthage were still annually
burning "men who were gods of light." 16
Having died a martyr's death, Heracles ascended to heaven with! out delay and received a place on the right hand of the Crone, or
Crown Corona Borealis, the constellation of the martyr's reward. i\ Christian martyrs were promised the same "crown" in heaven.
j
Meanwhile, Heracles's reward on earth was claimed by Christian
priests: that is, tithes, from the Roman military custom of donating to
I
Heracles's temple a tenth part of the spoils of victory. 17
As another underworld Lord of Death, Heracles was credited with 1 the same power to reveal buried treasure that was later inherited by
the Christian devil. 18

Hermes
Hermes
Greek god of magic, letters, medicine, and occult wisdom, identified with Thoth in Egypt, Mercury in Rome. He was really older than
Greece, one of the Aegean Great Mother's primal serpent-consorts, [partaking of her wisdom because he was once a part of her. Like India's Ardhanarisvara Kali and Shiva united in one body Hermes was
the original "hermaphrodite" united in one body with Aphrodite. Priests of Hermes wore artificial breasts and female garments to
preside over Aphrodite's Cyprian temple in the guise of the god
[Hermaphroditus. 1 Hermes was a universal Indo-European god. An Enlightened One born of the virgin Maia, he was the same as the Enlightened One (Buddha) born of the same virgin Maya in India. The Mahanirvanatan
tra said Buddha was the same as Mercury (Hermes), the son of the
Moon (Maya).2 Greeks called Hermes the Psychopomp, Conductor of Souls, the
same title everywhere given to the Lord of Death in his union with
the Lady of Life. Hermes had greater power over rebirth and reincarna
tion than the heavenly father Zeus. It was Hermes who transferred
Dionysus from the womb of the Moon-goddess to Zeus's "thigh" (penis) so he could be born from a male; apparently Zeus couldn't
accomplish this miracle for himself.* His feminine wisdom credited Hermes with the invention of
civilized arts usually attributed to the Goddess: measuring and weigh
ing, astronomy and astrology, music, divination by knucklebones. He
395



Hermes helped the three Fates compose the alphabet. 4 He could control the elements. His caduceus could transform whatever it touched into gold,
n^H^^Hi^ which is why Hermes became the patron of alchemists. 5
Ovid said Hermes was married to the lunar priestess of a sacred fountain in Caria, the Land of the Goddess Car. He was also part of a
trinity with Mother Earth and Father Hades, and a phallic god of the
orgiastic Cabiri who worshipped Demeter Cabiria in the Mysteries of Phrygia and Samothrace. 6
Hermes's phallic spirit protected crossroads throughout the GrecoRoman world, in the form of herms, which were either stone phalli or short pillars with Hermes's head at the top and an erect penis on the
front. During the Christian era, the herms were replaced by roadside
crosses, but the idea of setting these votive erections at crossroads was
pagan rather than Christian.
Saxons worshipped Hermes as the phallic spirit of the Hermeseul, or Irminsul, planted in the earth at the Mother-mount of Heresburg
(Hera's Mount). It is now known as Eresburg, and a church of St. Petei stands where Hermes's ancient sanctuary united the phallic principle with Mother Earth. Other Germanic tribes worshipped Hermes under the name of Thot or Teutatis, "Father of Teutons." 7 Hermes
Mercury was the same as the Germanic father-god Woden, which is
why the Hermetic day, Wednesday, is Woden's Day in English but Mercury's Day in Latin languages. The Cross of Woden also represented Hermes as "the only
fourfold god." The sign of the cross traced by Christians on their
heads and breasts originated as one of the crosses of Hermes, the Arabic
numeral 4, often appearing upside down or backward as the Chris
tians' gesture drew it. 8 The medieval legend that witches made the sign
of the cross upside down or backward may have begun with worship
pers of Hermes; actually, Christians had reversed the cross-sign made by the pagans instead of vice versa.
The cross marked Hermes a god of four-way crossroads, the four
quarters of the earth, the four elements, the four divisions of the
sacred year, the four winds, and the solstices and equinoxes represented
by their zodiacal totems Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius the
bull, lion, serpent, and man-angel symbols adopted by Christians to represent the four evangelists.9 Sometimes, the cross of Hermes was an ankh, standing on a crescent that signified his mother the moon. This
evolved into the conventional sign of Mercury, a circle with a cross
Sign of Mercury (Hermes) below and a crescent above. 10
Hermes was also represented by the Gnostic "world" sign, a Maltese cross with a circle at the end of each arm. 11 This seems to
have referred to the four solstitial and equinoctial suns. Gnostics viewed
Hermes as a personification of the World Serpent, ruler of time, who
coiled around the terrestrial egg. 12 According to Gnostic Gospels, Jesus i
told Mary that the serpent surrounded the world, with his tail in his
mouth, his body containing the twelve zodiacal halls that is, he was
396



identified with the Egyptian Tuat (Thoth) and the druidic ouroboros, also known as the Wise Serpent Hermes. 13
Neoplatonic philosophers called Hermes the Logos, or Word of
|
God made flesh. 14 Christian images of Jesus as the Logos were | borrowed from the older deity, whose hymns addressed him in terms I similar to those used in the Gospels:
Lord of Creation, the All and One. . . .He is the light ofmy spirit; his be
the blessing ofmy powers. . . . Hymn, O Truth, the Truth, O Goodness, the Good, Life, and Light, from you comes as to you returns our
thanksgiving. I give thee thanks O Father, thou potency ofmy powers;
I give thee thanks O God, the power ofmy potencies. Thine own Word
through me hymns thee. . . . Thou pleroma in us, O Life, save us; O
Light, enlighten us; O God, make us spiritual. The Spirit guards thy Word. . . . From the Eternal I received blessing and what I seek. By thy will have I found rest. 1S
Naturally, Hermes became the "god within" sought by all
religious philosophers of the Gnostic period. (See Antinomianism.)
His traditional bisexuality was interpreted as self-love; some said he invented the ritual of self-love, that is, masturbation. His caduceus was
jcalled a masturbatory symbol, a rod massaged by the serpents that embraced it. 16 Masturbation was said to be the hermit's typical act of
self-contemplation, which some claimed would lead to comprehenision of the God, just as sexual intercourse led to comprehension of the
ilGoddess. A "herm-e\" was literally a little Hermes, with a divine
I spirit dwelling in the phallus. Hermes lived on through the Middle Ages in a new disguise as Hermes Trismegistus, Hermes the Thrice-Great One, founder of
(systems of Hermetic magic, astrology, alchemy, and other blends of [mysticism with natural science. Lazzarelli's Calix Christi et Crater
iHermetis (Chalice of Christ and Cup of Hermes) said all learning came
from Hermes, who gave it to Moses in Egypt. Agrippa von Nette
j
>heim often cited the authority of Hermes, whom he took for a
U'randson of Abraham. Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy listed Her
Ines as one of the great philosophers, along with Socrates, Plato,
Plotinus, Seneca, Epictetus, the Magi, and the druids. 17 A 16thcentury treatise said the Hermetic vessel was "a uterus for the spiritual
renewal or rebirth of the individual . . . more to be sought than
Icripture." 18 Hermetic magic was extensively cultivated by the Arabs, who based much of their numerical and alchemical systems on Hermetic
lore. 19 Sufi mystics and eastern alchemists both claimed Hermes as an
Initiate of their craft. 20 After the crusades, Europeans developed a new
ninterest in what they regarded as the ancient wisdom of the east, and
[became greatly impressed by any philosophy attributable to classical
lantiquity. About 1460 a Greek manuscript of the eastern Corpus Hermetifum was presented to Cosimo de' Medici by a monk named
Hermes
397



Hermes
Sir Thomas
Browne (1605-1682)
English physician, author of the famous Religio Medici and other works.
Leonardo da Pistoia. Other texts were added later to the growing body of semi-secret "devilish arts" which commanded more and more of
the attention of European intellectuals. Sir Thomas Browne called
Hermetism "the mystical method of Moses bred up in the Hiero
glyphical Schools of the Egyptians," stating that the Egyptians worshipped Hermes as Mercurius or Anubis, "the Scribe of Saturn,
and Counsellor of Osiris, the great inventor of their religious rites, and Promoter of good unto Egypt." Hermes ascended to heaven in the
form of Sirius, the Great Dog. He was so revered in Italy that the mosaics of Siena Cathedral portrayed him with the inscription,
"Hermes Mercury Trismegistus, Contemporary of Moses." 21 The Christian mythological figure most often assimilated to Her
mes was the archangel Michael, Angel of Death, with a function resembling that of the ancient Psychopomp. "On the ruins of ancient
temples of Mercury, built generally on a hill, rose chapels dedicated to St. Michael." A hill formerly sacred to Hermes-Mercury in France still bears the name of Saint Michael-Mont-Mercure. It lies opposite another "Michael's Mount" located across the channel in England. 22
Spirits of the two mounts were both called Mercurius in pre
Christian times, perhaps representing the twin serpents that expressed Hermes's dual function as lord of death and rebirth. The twin serpents
had many incarnations in alchemy and magic. Of them Flamel wrote: "These are snakes and dragons, which the ancient Egyptians
painted in the form of a circle, each biting the other's tail, in order to
teach that they spring of and from one thing. These are dragons that the
old poets represent as guarding sleeplessly the golden apples of the Hesperian maidens. . . . These are the two serpents that are fastened
around the herald's staff and the rod of Mercury." 25
Hermetic mysticism usually called the serpents male and female, for the real secret of Hermetic power was androgyny. Like that of
Oriental gods, Hermes's efficacy depended on his union with the
female soul of the world, like the Aphrodite of his archaic duality. In medieval texts she was called the Anima Mercury, a naked woman
surrounded by oval mandorla designs like the World card of the
Tarot pack. 24 This card was the last of the Tarot trumps, and the
Magician, identified with Hermes, was the first numbered trump. A
Mantegna Tarot showed the Magician as a classic Mercury with
serpent-twined caduceus, winged helmet, and flute, stepping over a severed head symbol of oracles toward a cock, the symbol of annunciation. 25

Hero Hero
Greek word for a man sacrificed to Hera, possibly from Sanskrit Hesperides
Heruka, a Knowledge-Holding Deity, via Egyptian Heru or Harakhti, ^^^hmh^mmb
Horus-Osiris as a dying god. 1 The Greek May Day festival was the
Heroantheia, "Hero-flowering." 2 The "flower" was the hero's fructify
ing blood, represented by red or purple flowers, and described by the same word applied in the Bible to menstrual blood (Leviticus 1 5:24).
The May Day hero was therefore a flower-god: Narcissus, Hyacinthus, Adonis, or Antheus, who were all the same deity, sometimes called Naaman, "Darling," because he was Aphrodite's beloved. 3

Herodias
Biblical "consort of Herod," literally the Great Lady, whose story was so extensively revised that she was not even the consort of Herod any more but the consort of Herod's brother Philip (Matthew 14:3). The
Gospel story says Herodias demanded the head of John the Baptist and had her dancing daughter obtain it from Herod. This made her a
prime religious villainess, and about the 10th century a.d. her name began to be taken as a synonym for Hecate, Queen of Witches. Yet
the classic belief that Hecate was that third of the Triple Goddess who
ruled the underworld, while her other personae Hebe and Hera ruled heaven and earth, came to be applied to Herodias as the new Hecate. In
936 a bishop of Verona formally denounced "those who believe that Herodias rules one-third of the world." !

Hesione
"Queen of Asia," a Syrian title of Atargatis, or Meri-Yamm, the Great Goddess of the sea in conjunction with her serpent. Greeks
claimed Hesione was rescued from a sea serpent by Heracles, another
version of the Perseus-Andromeda myth. The original fight probably was the one between Baal and the sea serpent Yamm for the sexual
favors of the Asian Goddess. (See Kingship.)
Hesperides
Garden of immortality in the Far West, belonging to Mother Hera who sometimes took the form of Hespera, the Evening Star (Venus).
Apples of eternal life grew on the Hesperian apple tree, guarded by Hera's sacred serpent. Like most versions of the earthly paradise or
Eden, this one was located beyond the Pillars of Heracles (Gibraltar).

Hestia The Pillars were not only the straits leading to the western sea, but also
Hex the phallic shafts that stood in front of the ancient temples, the
l^^^mt^ammmmamm Garden being the temple itself, symbol of Hera's regenerative womb.
Hestia
Greek "Hearth," one of the oldest matriarchal Goddesses, in Latin,
Vesta. She represented the home place, every man's "center of the
world." When the matriarchs ruled, "The hearth was in the midst of
the dwelling; that hearth was to each member of the household, as it
were, an umbilicum orbis, or navel of the earth . . . [h]earth being
only another form of earth, as in the German erde and herde." Pythagoras said the fire of Hestia was the center of the earth. 1
Romans had the same idea about the altar of Vesta, with its
perpetual fire tended by the mystic Vestal Virgins. Cicero said the
power of Vesta extends over all altars and hearths, therefore all prayers
and offerings begin and end with her, "because she is the guardian of the innermost things." 2
Hestia never had a consort, for no god could share her strictly
matriarchal province, the Prytaneum or public hearth of every town. It was said of her that "seated in the midst of the celestial dwelling-place
she receives the richest part of sacrifices, and among men she is of all the deities the most venerated." i

Hetaera
"Companion," Greek title of a courtesan, the only kind of woman to retain full equality with men in the male-dominated Hellenic period. Like Christian nuns of the early medieval period, Greek hetaerae
remained unmarried to protect their property rights from the depreda
tions of patriarchal marriage laws. Unlike wives, they were free to attend schools, establish salons, and take a vital part in social and
intellectual life of the time.
Their title may have been related to Egyptian heter, "friendship,' whose hieroglyphic sign was two women grasping each other's hands. 1

Hex
This word for a witch's spell had a long history associated with connotations of the number six Greek hex, Latin sex, cognate with
Egyptian sexen, "to embrace, to copulate." Six was everywhere the
400



I number of sex, representing the union between the Triple Goddess and Hexagram
I her trident-bearing consort, which is why Christian authorities called
six "the number of sin." ' Pythagoreans on the contrary called six the ^^_^^_^_^_
perfect number, or The Mother. One of its Egyptian forms seshemu,
j
"sexual intercourse" shown in hieroglyphics by male and female
j
genitals in conjunction survived in the Sufi love-charm designed to
iopen
the "cave" of the Goddess: Open, Sesame. 2
To this day, hex signs are hexagonal like the six-pointed Tantric , yantra of love (see Hexagram). The name of the sign is from German Hexen, "witches," who may have been so named because they "made the six."
A triple six, 666, was the magic number of Triple Aphrodite (or Ishtar) in the guise of the Fates. The Book of Revelation called it
"the number of the Beast" (Revelation 13:18), apparently the Beast
with Two Backs, the androgyne of carnal love. Solomon the wizardking made a sacred marriage with the Goddess and acquired a mystic
666 talents of gold (1 Kings 10:14). Christians usually called it
Satan's number, yet the recurrences of this number in esoteric traditions
are often surprising. For example, the maze at Chartres Cathedral
was planned so as to be exactly 666 feet long. 5 Egyptians considered 3, 6, and 7 the most sacred numbers. Three
stood for the Triple Goddess; six meant her union with the God;
seven meant the Seven Hathors, seven planetary spheres, seven-gated
holy city, seven-year reigns of kings, etc. Egyptians had an abiding conviction that the total number of all deities must be exactly 37,
because of this number's magic properties. Not only did it combine
the sacred 3 and 7, but 37 multiplied by any multiple of 3 gave a triple digit or "trinity": 111, 222, 333, 444, 555, etc. The miraculous
number 666 is a product of 3 X 6 X 37.4

Hexagram
The familiar design of two interlocked triangles is generally supposed to have represented the Jewish faith since the time of David, or
Solomon; therefore this hexagram is known as Magen David (Shield of David), or the Star of David, or Solomon's Seal. Actually, the hexagram had nothing to do with either David or Solomon. It was
not mentioned in Jewish literature until the 12th century a.d., and was
not adopted as a Jewish emblem until the 17th century. 1 Hexagram
The real history of the hexagram began with Tantric Hinduism,
where it represented union of the sexes. 2 The downward-pointing triangle was the Female Primordial Image or Yoni Yantra, existing
fore the universe. In the course of infinite time, the Goddess
nceived a spark of life within her triangle, the bindu, which was
#
401



Hexagram eventually born and developed into a male, symbolized by the upward-pointing triangle. He united with his Mother to form the Primal
^^h^^^^^mhm Androgyne. 3 The sign of this union was the hexagram, called Sri Yantra or Great Yantra. "The downward-pointing triangle is a female
symbol corresponding to the yoni; it is called 'shakti.' The upward
pointing triangle is the male, the lingam, and is called 'the fire'
(vahni)." 4 A personification of the Great Yantra was Bindumati, "Mother of the Bindu," described in myth as a divine harlot. She ruled the forces
of nature. She could command storms by the power of her magic and
halt rivers in their tracks, a miracle copied by several holy men in
Egyptian myth, and later by Moses. From the Tantric image of the sexual hexagram arose a Jewish
system of sex worship connected with the medieval Cabala, and a
rabbinical tradition that "a picture is supposed to be placed in the ark of
the covenant alongside of the tables of the laws, which shows a man
and a woman in intimate embrace, in the form of a hexagram." 5
The Cabala was developed by the Jews of Moorish Spain after the
crusades brought eastern Goddess worship into their ken. Cabalists
used the hexagram as Tantric yogis used it, to represent the union of
God with his Female Power, Shekina, the Jewish form of Shakti-Kali. As Shakti was the essential soul of any Hindu god, so Shekina was the
essential soul of the Cabalistic God. As in all religions of the Divine
Marriage, Cabalistic Judaism discovered man and woman to be earthly images of God and Goddess; and sexual union of mortals naturally
encouraged its like in the supernatural realm. Therefore sexual intercourse was "a sacramental act in the service of a God and his consort
(or perhaps vice versa: a Goddess and her consort)." 6
The Zohar identified Shekina with Torah, "the law," as the older Gnostic Goddess was identified with her own virgin form Maat, "the law" or "Truth." A man aspiring to mystic wisdom had to become a
"bridegroom of Torah," for the law was embodied in a maiden, like
the enlightening lady-love of contemporary bardic romance, which was
also inspired by eastern Goddess-worship.
For the Torah resembles a beautiful and stately damsel, who is hidden in a secluded chamber ofher palace. . . . She opens the door ofher hidden chamber ever so little, and for a moment reveals her face to her lover, but hides it again forthwith. . . . He alone sees it and he is drawn to her with his heart and soul and his whole being. . . . When he comes to her, she begins from behind a curtain to speak words in keeping with his
understanding, until very slowly insight comes to him. 7
The hexagram stood for the complete union of the sage with
Shekina-Torah. Attribution of the hexagram to Solomon as the magic
"Solomon's Seal" probably arose from the popular view of Solomon,
402



s enlightened by a sacred marriage, suggested by the erotic love poetry Hierophant
If Solomon's Song in the Bible.

"Hind of Hinds," the Koreshite queen overthrown by soldiers of Mohammed (see Arabia). The Great Hind she personified was KoreDiana, Mother of Animals, ancestral Goddess of her tribe.
Hippolytus, Saint
One of the pseudo-saints, based on a pagan god worshipped in both
Greece and Rome as a dying-and-resurrected savior. Originally he died as a surrogate for King Theseus, who retained his throne by sacrific
ing "sons" who received the title of Hippolytus, "Torn by Horses." The
manner of sacrifice was that the victim was dragged to death by
chariot horses, a rite apparently initiated in Athens by Theseus's Cretan
queen, Phaedra. Myth says Hippolytus's horses were frightened into their fatal stampede by a Bull from the Sea, actually a title of the Cretan high priest whose totemic form was the Minotaur. Hippolytus was called the son of the Amazon queen, who embod
ied the spirit of Artemis-Diana. The Roman Hippolytus was slain and
resurrected in Diana's sacred grove of Nemi. He was apotheosized and
raised to heaven as the constellation Auriga, the Charioteer. 1 He
married the Goddess's virgin aspect, the nymph Egeria. He was reborn
like all cyclic gods as his own son, Virbius, "the Virile One." Virbius
too was slain by horses in his turn.
"We can hardly doubt," says Frazer, "that the Saint Hippolytus of the Roman Calendar, who was dragged by horses to death on the thirteenth of August, Diana's own day, is no other than the Greek hero
of the same name, who, after dying twice over as a heathen sinner,
has been happily resuscitated as a Christian saint." 2
A number of theological writings were brought forth under the
signature of St. Hippolytus, whose "life" was assigned to the 3rd century a.d. The likelihood is that all these works were forged at a later 1
date and arbitrarily given a canonical authorship, as was the custom of
the early church. 3

Hiranyagarbha
"Firstborn of the Womb," a title claimed by nearly all Hindu gods,
each of whom insisted on being the eldest son of the primal Creatress.
Modern scholars tend to conceal the true meaning of the word by
404



avoiding its feminine connotation. A commentator on the Upanishads Hocus Pocus
said any god may be called Hiranyagarbha "when associated with the Hokmah power called Maya the power to evolve the empirical universe." 1 ^^^^__^^^_
This effectively withholds the information that "the power called
Maya" is the Great Goddess, and the "association" between her and the god is that of mother and child. See Firstborn.

Hocus Pocus
Magic phrase evolved from the medieval practice of intoning liturgical words as invocations and charms. Hocus pocus is a corruption of hoc

Eucharist. 1 See Magic.

Hod
Norse "blind god" who killed the youthful savior Balder with a thrust
of a spear or arrow of mistletoe. Afterward, Hod took Balder's bride
Nanna. Some myths say Hod was really another name for Odin, who was blind or half-blind; for Odin contrived the death of his divine son
Balder, much as Yahweh contrived that of his divine son Jesus.
Christians claimed Jesus was pierced by a spear wielded by a blind man,
St. Longinus. Probably Hod was a title of the high priest in charge of sacrificial killings, embodying Odin's spirit.
1 He may even have been
blindfolded or put into an eyeless mask, the Helmet of Darkness
(Tarnhelm), to enact the sacred drama as a deadly game of Blind Man's
Buff.

charge of religious rites up to the 1 1th century a.d., when Christian

Hokmah
'Wisdom," the Hebrew version of the Gnostic Goddess known in
Latin as Sapientia, in Greek as Sophia. Her name was only a title of the Great Mother who actively helped God create the world, according
405



Holly to Proverbs 8, and whose symbol was the Aphroditean dove later
adopted by Christians as a sign of the Holy Ghost. Much of the
mmmmm|^mm Jewish "Wisdom literature" owed its origin to ancient Oriental and
Egyptian sources in which the Goddess was supposed to have
inspired clear thinking on all matters of morality and religion.
1 There
fore Hokmah closely resembled Isis. Her praises were inserted into
the mouth of Solomon, one of her most renowned lovers, by the author of the Wisdom of Solomon:
Her bright shining is never laid to sleep. But with her there came to me all
good things together. . . . And I rejoiced over them all because [Hokmah]leadeth them; though Iknew not that she was the mother ofthem. . . .
She that is the artificer ofall things . . . there is in her a spirit quick of
understanding, holy, alone in kind, manifold, subtle, freely moving . . . all
powerful, all-surveying, and penetrating through all spirits. . . . Yea, she pervadeth and penetrateth all things. . . . And she, though but one, hath power to do all things; and remaining in herself, reneweth all things. . . . For she is fairer than the sun, and above all the constellations ofthe stars;
being compared with light, she is found to be before it. . . . She reacheth out from one end of the world to the other with full strength, and
ordereth all things well. 2
It may be that the Hebrew name of Hokmah was also of
Egyptian origin, after an ancient title of Isis as Heq-Maa, Mother of
Magical Knowledge, dating back to the heq or tribal wise-woman of
pre-dynastic times. The Goddess as Heqit, Hekat, and the Greek derivative Hecate (the Wise Crone) can be traced to the same
sources.

Holly
To the druids, holly was the plant of death and regeneration, sacred to Mother Holle, or Hel, the underworld Goddess. 1 Germanic witches
who worshipped her favored holly wood for magic wands. Red holly
berries showed the female blood-of-life color, corresponding to white mistletoe berries associated with male elements of semen and death.
In the divine marriage celebrated at Yule, they were displayed together.
The "holy" holly was linguistically linked with Hel's yonic "hole" (Germanic Hohle, a cave or grave). It was the most sacred of trees,
according to a carol sung by medieval pagans at Yuletide, saying holly "bears the crown." 2
In the Dionysian cult, female holly was paired with the god's male
symbol, ivy.
? Green boughs of both were used to adorn doorways at
the solstitial festival. Tertullian condemned the custom, saying any Christian who has "renounced temples" should not make a temple of
his own house door. 4 Nevertheless, house-decorating with holly, ivy, or mistletoe at the solstitial festival went serenely on. The Council of
406



Bracara ruled that no Christian should bring holly into his house for Christmas, because it was a custom of "heathen people." 5 Heathen
jor not, it was inextricably linked with Yuletide celebrations and could not be eradicated.
Even the sexual symbolism of the holly was remembered, in a way, up to the 17th century. Christmas games included a mock battle of
the sexes, in which the master and mistress of the house engaged: "Great is the contention of holly and ivy, whether master or dame
wears the breeches." 6 The kiss under the mistletoe originally represent
ed sexual union, a peaceful resolution of the battle.

Honey
Honey
Being one of the few preservatives the ancients knew, along with salt,
loney was widely regarded as a substance of resurrection-magic. In Asia Minor from 3500 to 1750 b.c. the dead were embalmed in honey
and placed in fetal position in burial vases or pithoi, ready for rebirth.
'To fall into a jar of honey" became a common metaphor for "to lie." ' The pithos represented the womb of the Goddess under her
lame of Pandora, "All-giver," and honey became her sacred essence.
Myths present many symbolic assurances that the Goddess would
estore life to the dead through her magic "bee-balm." Worshippers )f Demeter called her "the pure mother bee," and at her Thesmo
Dhoria festivals displayed honey-cakes shaped like female genitals. The symbol of Aphrodite at Eryx was a golden honeycomb. 2 Her )riestess bore the name of Melissa, "Queen Bee," the same as the
ewish Queen Deborah, priestess of Asherah, whose name also meant *bee." 3
The bee was rightly looked upon as a symbol ofthe feminine potency of
nature. . . . In the Syracusan Thesmophoria, the participants carried mylloi, cakes made ofhoney and sesame in the shape ofthe female sex organ. . . . Menzel draws an apt parallel between this custom and the
Hindu usage ofdaubing the woman 's genitals with honey at the marriage feast. 4
Bees are still called hymenoptera, "veil-winged, after the hynen or veil that covered the inner sanctum of the Goddess's temples,
he veil having its physical counterpart in women's bodies. Deflora
ion was a ritual penetration of the veil under the "hymeneal" rules of
he Goddess, herself entitled Hymen in the character of patroness of
he wedding night and "honey-moon." The honeymoon spanned a lunar month, usually in May, the nonth of pairings, named after the Goddess as the Virgin Maya. 5 In
in archaic period, sacred kings seem to have been destroyed after a 28
lay honeymoon with the Goddess, spanning a lunar cycle, as the

which eventually destroyed most of his books.
queen bee destroys her drone-bridegroom by tearing out his genitals.6 As applied to ordinary weddings rather than sacrificial dramas, the honeymoon of a lunar month would include a menstrual period, the
real source of what was euphemistically called moon-honey. A bride
groom contacted the source of life by copulating with his bride during
menstruation, according to the oldest Oriental belief. Even the Great God Shiva was helpless unless his phallus was baptized in blood from
the vagina of Kali-Maya, his Shakti and mother, in the Tantric ritual
known as Maharutti. 7 A combination of honey and menstrual blood was once considered the universal elixir of life, the "nectar" manufactured by
Aphrodite and her sacred bees, which kept the very gods alive. Similarly, the great secret of Norse mythology was that the gods' nectar of
wisdom, inspiration, literacy, magic, and eternal life was a combination of honey and "wise blood" from the great Cauldron in the belly of
Mother Earth though a late patriarchal revision claimed this hydromel or "honey-liquid" was a mixture of honey with the blood of a male
sacrificial victim known as Wisest of Men. 8
Even the most patriarchal cults seemed unable to dispense with the
life-giving feminine fluids. Celibate priests of Mithra, who excluded
women from their temples, nevertheless worshipped the Moon-goddess Diana or Luna who "made the honey which was used in the
purifications." 9 Of course it was the Moon-goddess who also made the
"wise blood" of female lunar cycles. Porphyry reported a popular belief in his day that bees were reincarnations of the lunar nymphs. 10
Finnish myth speaks of the hero Lemminkainen, torn to pieces like a sacrificial victim and sent to Manala, the underground realm of the
death-goddess Mana. His own mother restored him to life with her
magic honey, assisted by her familiar spirit, Mehilainen the Bee. 11
Early Christian Ophites celebrated a Tantric-style "love feast"
which included the tasting of menstrual blood, and it was said of them 1 that they mingled blood with honey. 12 Thus they combined two of the
three substances the third being salt most often associated with
resurrection or rebirth.

Hope, Saint
According to Hesiod's fable of Pandora's Vase (or, as it was later
erroneously called, Pandora's Box), the spirit called Hope stood for the refined cruelty of Father Zeus toward helpless mortals. Zeus sent the
vase full of Spites to plague humanity with vice, madness, sickness, hard labor, war, famine, and every other ill; he also enclosed Hope, whose i
408



function was to prevent men from killing themselves in despair, to kscape the miseries Zeus decreed for them. 1
Hope was thus presented as a spirit of delusion; her ultimate purpose was to make men suffer. In Christian scriptures however, she
Ivas combined with Faith and Charity (or Love) as one of the three
essential virtues. Some excessively naive hagiographers even canon
ized these three virtues as three fictitious virgin martyrs, all daughters of
he equally fictitious St. Sophia. 2 St. Hope is still listed in the Roman
panon of saints even though scholars have shown that she never existed.

Horae Horns
Horae
Kphrodite's celestial nymphs, who performed the Dances of the Hours, acted as midwives to the gods, and inspired earthly horae (harlotpriestesses) to train men in the sexual Mysteries. The dance still
pilled hora was based on the priestesses' imitation of the zodiacal
(circling of "hours." Time-keeping is horology because of the systems Devised by these ancient priestesses of the Goddess. See Prostitution.
iThe Horae were called "fair ones, begetters of all things, who in
Appointed order bring on day and night, summer and winter, so as to Jnake months and years grow full." '
1. Jonas, 258.
In Egypt they were "Ladies of the Hour," in Persia houris, in
Babylon harines; among Semites they were the "whores" called hor (a hole), ancestresses of the Horites.
Horns
Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of a divine being used to be a lorned head. Masks and crowns of incarnate deities were often those of
lorned animals bulls, goats, stags. Horns were connected with the
Bldest Tantric belief concerning male vitality: that by suppression of
jjaculation, mystic energy mounts up the spine to the head and /ers forth in wisdom and magic power, made visible by horns.
Outgrowths from the head are specially significant. The horned animals are the most sacred, because they carry about upon them visible evidence that their "head-stuff' is developed to the point ofextrusion. Bulls, rams and he-goats are especially well-endowed. So too are deer. There is ample linguistic evidence in the West for the association between horns and male sexuality. In Indian miniatures and ivories ofthe seventeenth and eighteenth century A.D. horned deer are frequently used as symbols for the desire ofa lovely girl in the forest. '
The Bible says Yahweh's altar was horned, and he was some
Imes addressed as a phallic stone, "the Rock that begat thee," as well as
lie phallic "horn of my salvation, my high tower" (2 Samuel 22:3). lahweh was identified with El, "supreme god of the Semitic pantheon"

who wore bull-horns as consort of Mari-Asherah the divine cow.2
Like Zeus and Apis, he could take the form of the white moon-bull, probably copied from totemic incarnations of Shiva as the white bull
Nandi (Blessed One). The white moon-bull seems to have been one of the forms of the
moon god Sin, whose holy Mount Sinai Moses climbed, and came down "wearing horns" in token of his encounter with the god of the
mountain. The standard biblical translation says Moses came down
from Sin's mountain with his head "shining," but in Hebrew, the same word signifies a "horned" or a "radiated" head. 5 The Vulgate says
cornuta fuit fades ejus, he (Moses) wore horns. Michelangelo's famous
figure of Moses is horned like a satyr. 4 The Horned God was as old as the Stone Age. Primitive sacred art
everywhere shows men wearing the horns of bulls, stags, rams, or
goats, which distinguished the shaman, sacred king, priest, or victim. 5 Horned animals were frequently associated with Mother Goddess
figures.6 Myths of all later periods also combined the Goddess with the Horned God, who was Actaeon the stag, Pan the goat, Dionysus or Zeus the bull, Amen the ram, and innumerable combinations of these
with human images. The Teutonic hero Sigurd or Siegfried was sometimes a man, sometimes a hart, consort of the White Hind who led men on mysterious adventures. He found his mother-bride in the
form of a Valkyrie sleeping in her secret place, Hinderfjall (HindMountain). 7 Later he died in the forest as a hunted stag, pierced by arrows, like Actaeon the Lord of the Hunt and his medieval counter
part, the witches' Horned God.
Medieval folk thought it might be possible for human beings to
grow real horns on their heads for a variety of reasons, from telling
lies (through identification with the devil as Father of Lies) to becoming
a cuckold. Agrippa von Nettesheim offered a pseudo-scientific
explanation for the alleged overnight horning of Cyprus, king of Italy. The king dreamed all night of a battle of bulls, which stimulated "the
vegetative power, being stirred up by a vehement imagination, elevating comific humors into his head and producing horns." 8
Of course the principal Horned God was the devil, a composite of all the Horned Gods of paganism. Sir Thomas Browne said the
"devils" of holy scripture were Fauns, Satyrs, and sons of Pan; but the original Hebrew word for them was "goats." 9 In Scotland, the devil was known as Ould Hornie. His notorious lustfulness gave rise to the
modern slang term "horny." The so-called sign of the devil
forefinger and little finger extended was originally a gesture-symbol of a horned animal head, copied from a sacred mudra of the Great Goddess in India. 10

Horse Horse
In the 1 5th century a.d., Pope Calixtus III decreed that no more
religious ceremonies should be held in "the cave with the horse- MH^n^^
pictures."
' Ancient pagan horse-worship was still common and
acceptable, co-existing with Christianity, only three centuries earlier when kings of Ireland still underwent symbolic rebirth from the
White Mare. 2 She was Epona, the Celtic version of Cretan Leukippe
("White Mare"), one of many relics of the Amazonian horse-cult
throughout Europe. The divine horse still stands on a hillside at Uffington (in Berk
shire, England), 370 feet long, carved in the chalk by pre-Christian
votaries of Epona, now serving as a notable tourist attraction. 3
Horses were sacred to the Jutes who invaded Kent; their king and
queen bore the titles of Hengist and Horsa, "Stallion and Mare."
Their daughter became the wife of Vortigern. Out of a Christian
prejudice against queens, the Venerable Bede insisted that the
Stallion and Mare were really two brothers ruling jointly, but he never
explained how they managed to become joint parents. 4 Symbolic of the equine deities was a double-headed androgynous
horse still used to decorate the double projecting rafters of old houses
in Jutland, the original home of the Jutes. Such figures are known as Hengist and Horsa and are put up for "luck." 5
Another relic of pre-Christian horse worship is the Morris dancer's
traditional horse-headed stick, or "hobby horse" otherwise the cock-horse ridden to Banbury Cross to see the Goddess make her ritual
ride as Lady Codiva. Similar horse-headed sticks were ridden by central Asian shamans. "The 'horse' enables the shaman to fly through
the air, to reach the heavens. The dominant aspect of the mythology
of the horse is not infernal but funerary; the horse is a mythical image of
death and hence is incorporated into the ideologies and techniques of ecstasy." 6 Death symbolism figured in the dream of riding a black
horse, interpreted as a portent of "loss and sorrow." 7 Northern Europeans considered horses essential to the funeral
rites of great warriors. The riderless horse led in a pagan or Christian
military officer's funeral procession dated back to primitive belief that his
ghost needed to ride to heaven. His empty boots were often fixed
backward in the stirrups because it was thought ghosts wore their feet
backward. In ancient times, the horse was usually sacrificed at the
funeral and buried with the dead hero, just as boats were buried with
Egyptian mummies to carry them over afterworld waters. 8
Death was the significance of Father Odin's eight-legged gray horse Sleipnir, symbol of the gallows tree, where human sacrifices
were hung in Odin's sacred groves. Skalds called the gallows "high
chested rope-Sleipnir," the horse on which men rode to the land of
death, Heljar. Recounting Odin's own death-and-resurrectiop drama,
the original nine-day wonder, the Elder Edda said: "In the Norn's
411



Horse seat nine days sat I, thence was I mounted on a horse; there the
giantess's sun shone grimly through the dripping clouds of heaven. ^hh^^^^h^^h Without and within, I seemed to traverse all the seven nether worlds." 9
Old Norse drasil meant both "horse" and "gallows tree." 10 There
fore the World Tree Yggdrasil, on which Odin hung and bled, was both the Horse of Yggr and the Gallows of Yggr, as well as the axis mundial the earth's hub. Yggr was another name for Odin as Lord of
Death. When Christians diabolized him, he became the great devil
rider leading the hosts of the dead through the sky on their
cloud-colored horses, and Yggr evolved into the English "ogre." " The horse cult of Odin's Aesir was rooted in Vedic India. Hind
dying gods often assumed horse shape. Hindu queens impersonated the Goddess as Mare-mother, Saranyu, by inserting the dead horse's penis between their legs at the end of the sacrificial ceremony, calling upon "the vigorous male" to "lay seed" for the benefit of the land and
its people. 12 This ancient ceremony explains one of Odin's more puzzling titles, Volsi, meaning both "Son of God" and "Horse's Penis." 13
The penis was the "son" worshipped by Iron Age equestrian tribes calling themselves Volsungs, descendants of Volsi. The cult was not
confined to Scandinavia. The Welsh had the same ancestral horse-goc
Waelsi or Waels. Slavs also worshipped him as Volos, a sacrificed
horse whose entrails and blood were supposed to produce the water of
life. In a Russian folk tale, Volos directed the hero to use him for
resurrection magic: "Open my body, take out my entrails, rub the dead
man with my blood." H This was supposed to restore life to the dead.
Volos was still incarnated in a ritually castrated and slaughtered
stallion every spring, up to the 18th century a.d. 15 Since the people
insisted on worshipping him, he was converted into a Christian saint,
Vlas, who had no real existence except as a pagan horse-god. Ancient Rome knew him as the October Horse, or curtus equus
("cut horse"). By an elaborate ritual, the animal was divided into
three sections by sacred women known as the Three Queens. After
slaughtering, the horse's amputated tail was carried hastily to the temple of Vesta the earth's yoni, by Roman reckoning so its bloo could drip on the altar. 16 In earlier times it probably was the horse's
penis that donated its blood to the Goddess, as in the rites of Saranyu I
and Volsi. Castrated stallions were offered to all equine forms of the Goddess. The Taurians sacrificed to Artemis horses from whom "the j member was cut off." I7
The blood-wedding of the Earth Mother and the Horse's Penis
produced the race of horse-gods known in the Aegean as centaurs, in India as Asvins or Gandharvas. 18 They were great wizards, skilled in
music and dancing, expert healers, lusty lovers of women. They often stole brides from their bridegrooms, a legend reminiscent of the ancien
412



Driental custom of having brides deflowered by priests or god-penises Horse
nstead of by their husbands (see Firstborn). 19 Western centaurs were similar, born of Mare-headed Demeter in ^^^^^^^^^^^
Mycenae, or of Leukippe the White Mare in Crete. 20 Priests of this
goddess were castrated and wore female dress. 21 Sometimes they were
ailed Magnetes, "Great Ones." One of their leaders was the magic
lorse Arion, born of Demeter's union as a mare with the sea god in the
:orm of a stallion. 22 A sacred grove in Chios called Tripotamara
"Three Streams) is said to be still haunted by ghostly centaur-wizards. 23
Greeks called Corinthian horse-priestesses "man-eating mares," ilso known as the horse-masked Pegae guarding the sacred fountain
jf Pirene, home of Pegasus another name for Arion, the horse who
:arried heroes to heaven. The Pegae-priestesses killed Bellerophon md his father, a typical father-son combination of the reborn deity.
Diodorus compared the orgies of the Pegae to those of the Egyptian
>ull-god Apis, whose priestesses tore him apart and directed his spurting Jood onto their genitals to fertilize themselves on behalf of their
Goddess, the ea>th. 24
Customs of the Cretan horse cult produced the myth of Hippoly
tus (He Who is Torn by Horses), dragged to death by his chariot
porses after receiving a curse from his father Theseus. The myth
concealed a primitive sacrifice, though Hippolytus was eventually canonized as a Christian saint. 25 In his Christian form, Hippolytus was
Bragged to death by horses on the Goddess's holy day in August. 26
borne said Demeter's Cretan lover Iasion was similarly torn to pieces by
norses. 27
Ancient kings of Sweden were torn to pieces by horse-Valkyries or lorse-masked priestesses of Freya, known as volvas. 28 Medieval
olklore redefined a volva as a witch able to transform herself into a
nare. She embodied the spirit of the Scandinavian death-goddess vho rode a winged black horse known as the Valraven (Raven-ridden
y-Valkyries). 29 Slavs used to pray to her as the virgin battle-queen Diana, Athene, Bellona, etc.) before setting forth to war: "Unsheathe,
p Virgin, the sacred sword of thy father, take up the breastplate of
tiy ancestors, thy doughty helmet, bring out thy black horse." 30 The myth of King Midas and his ass-ears was dressed in Celtic
hrb for transposition to an Irish horse cult centering on King Lavra
p. 3rd century a.d.). The king was said to have horse's ears, a fact
mown only to his barber until the barber whispered the secret to a
J/illow tree. The willow was cut down and made into a harp, and the
larp sang the truth about the king's ears. 31
Horse sacrifices were performed in Norway in the 10th century
Ld. despite the efforts of newly converted Christian kings to discon
Inue
them. King Haakon's rebellious subjects not only continued the
agan feasts of horsemeat but forced the king himself to take part in
413



Horse! them and drink toasts to the old gods meanwhile. 32
Horseshoe Traces of the horse sacrifice persisted in England up to the 16th ^^^^^^^^m^m century, when it was still customary for all horses to be bled on St.
Stephen's Day, the day after Christmas, for "luck." " The New Year
sacrifice of a white horse-image known as Old Hob was the same
"hobby-horse" as Germany's Schimmel, made of a horse head animat
ed by young men covered by white cloths. In Pomerania the New
Year hobby-horse performer Schimmeheiter pantomimed ancient sacrificial dances. 34 Christian opposition to pagan horse sacrifices probably
gave rise to the strong prejudice against eating horsemeat. 35

Horsel
Teutonic Moon-goddess, Venus of the Horselberg; also called Ursel or Ercel. Her many lovers included Tannhauser in Germany and
Thomas Rhymer (Thomas of Ercel's Down) in England. According to the Thuringian Chronicle, she appeared as a fiery trinity in 1 398, as "three great fires in the air" descending to rest in the Horselberg. 1
Eventually the Goddess Horsel was canonized as the apocryphal St. Ursula, with her "eleven thousand virgins" transformations of the Moon-mother and her daughter stars.
1. Baring-Gould, C.M.M.A., 211.
Horseshoe
Hindus, Arabs, and Celts regarded the yonic shape of the horseshoe as a symbol of the Goddess's "Great Gate," thus it was always esteemed as a prophylactic door charm. Druidic temples were constructed in
the shape of a horseshoe. 1 So were some Hindu temples, with the frank intention of representing the yoni. The horseshoe arch of Arabic sacred architecture developed from the same tradition. 2
Greeks assigned the yonic shape to the last letter of their sacred
alphabet, Omega, literally, "Great Om," the Word of Creation
beginning the next cycle of becoming. The implication of the horseshoe symbol was that, having entered the yonic Door at the end of life
(Omega), man would be reborn as a new child (Alpha) through the
414



same Door. It was everywhere represented as "a horseshoe, the very Hortus Conclusus figure that is nailed to so many doors in various parts of the world, as an Horus emblem of luck. Mighty few of those who live in such houses know ^^^^^^^^^^^
that the horseshoe is only a symbol of the yoni and that by nailing it to
their doors, they follow out a custom older than the history of their
race." 3
The Christian God who claimed to be the "Alpha and Omega"
(Revelation 1:8) was only copying one version of this very ancient symbolism, whose meaning seems not to have been understood by the
biblical writer.
1. Graves, W.G., 315-16. 2. de Lys, 113. 3. Goldberg, 102.
Hortus Conclusus
"Enclosed Garden," a symbol of the Virgin, whose garden was called
Paradise and mythologically related to the womb. Virginity meant the
feminine "gate of paradise" was not yet opened. In the erotic
metaphors of Solomon's wedding song, the virgin bride as yet undeflowered is not only a hortus conclusus but "a spring shut up, a
fountain sealed" (Song of Solomon 4:12). In medieval art, the virgin
Mary was mystically depicted inside a walled garden representing her
virginity.

Horus
Egyptian Divine Child, or reborn sun; a son-reincarnation of either
Ra or Osiris, or both. Horus was depicted as a child with a long lock of
nair curled to one side of his head and a finger in his mouth, signifying
:hildlike dependence. 1 Yet he was also a warrior, avenging his father" or elder-self Osiris by castrating and killing Set, the god of the
barren half of the year.
Some said there was a Horus the Elder, born of Isis immediately
ifter her own birth, for he was conceived by the coupling of Isis and
ler twin-brother-spouse Osiris while they were still in the womb of their
nother Mut. Other myths said Horus was the world's firstborn sun,
vho arose from the primal Mother's lotus-yoni at the beginning of ime. 2
Horus might be traced to the Far East, as the "Lotus-born"
peruka, or hero; the original Egyptian form of his name was Hem. Jreek Gnostics of the philosophical age called him Harpocrates. What
ver his name, he was another variation on the usual theme of the
ying-and-reborn god, father-killing son and son-killing father.

Host Host
Hubris Latin hostia, "victim," became the Host of the Eucharist, indicating
the dead and cannibalized god whose worshippers devoured his flesh
and blood literally in the earliest religious systems, symbolically in the later Mysteries such as Mithraism, Orphism, and Christianity. Bread played "host" to the visiting spirit of the deity, and became one with
the body of the worshipper upon being eaten. See Cannibalism; Transubstantiation. Another derivative of hostia was "hostage," a
surrogate; and if not ransomed, a victim.
Houri
Persian-Arabian heavenly nymph, sexual angel, or temple prostitute;
cognate with the Greek hora, Babylonian harine, Semitic harlot, or
"whore." Houris were dancing "Ladies of the Hour" who kept time in heaven and tended the star-souls. See Angel; Prostitution.
Hsi Wang Mu
"Lady-Queen of the West," Chinese Great Mother who kept the
fruit of immortality in a magic orchard in the Far West, as did Idun,
Pomona, Hera, Morgan, etc. Instead of apples, Hsi Wang Mu raised
peaches, the Chinese symbol of the yoni. Once every 3000 years she gave the gods peaches from her Tree of Life. ' See Peach.
1. Larousse, 382.
Hubris
Greek "lechery," or "pride," both words associated with penile
erection; said to be the sin of Lucifer. Patriarchal gods especially
punished hubris, the sin of any upstart who became in both senses "too big for his breeches." '
The original Hubristika was an Argive "Feast of Lechery" featur
ing orgies and transvestism. Men broke a specific taboo by wearing
women's veils and assuming women's magic power. 2 Christianity later
condemned as devil-worship all forms of transvestism, because of its
implication that men acquired power through connection with women, whether it was a sexual connection or a masquerade.
From hubrizein, lecherous behavior, came the Roman word
hybrid, describing a child of a Roman father and a foreign mother. A trace of the old law of matrilineal inheritance dictated that a child was a
slave or a freeman according to the status of his mother, slave or free;
the father's status was irrelevant. Similarly among the Jews, in the case
416



of mixed marriages or hybridization, a child was Jewish only if the
Tiother was the Jewish parent, but gentile if only the father was Jewish. 3

Hudigamma Husband
Hudigamma
rlindu Mother Goddess served by eunuch priests dressed in women's
lothes. 1 Her western counterparts had similar customs; transvestite
;unuch priests served Cybele, Artemis, Heracles as the consort of ydian Omphale, and Adonis as the consort of Syrian Aphrodite. All he savior-gods in these cults were castrated. See Castration; Transvestism.
l.Gaster,317.
-luppah
iebrew "tent," the marriage canopy held above the heads of a bride
nd groom in a Jewish wedding, a custom derived from the ancient temitic matriarchate when women owned their tents, and a wedding
eremony was in effect a solemnization of the man's permission to enter
le tent of his beloved. 1 The tent and the land it occupied were
embolic of the woman herself. Before the development of patriarchal Jes, she had complete control of her property. An Arabian wife
ould divorce her husband without speaking a word, simply by turning
er tent to face the other direction, which let him know he was
>rbidden to enter the door again. 2
When Absalom tried to establish a right to rule Israel, he raised
an awning on a housetop" and beneath its shade he copulated with
!ing David's royal concubines "in the sight of all Israel" (2 Samuel
6:22). Without this rite of sacred marriage, no man could be a king,
bsalom's followers erected the customary phallic pillar in his name, to
anor his virility after he died as a surrogate for the king (2 Samuel
8:18). The huppah was not unknown as an accompaniment to Gentile
carriages. Anglo-Saxon weddings similarly took place "under a veil
'
square piece of cloth, held at each corner by a tall man, over the
idegroom and bride." 4 The veil seems to have symbolized the
Oman's dwelling place, for early Anglo-Saxon marriages were atrilocal.

usband
)ne bonded to the house (hus)" a steward or majordomo chosen tend a woman's property, under the old Saxon matriarchate when
Egyptians preserved from their own matriarchal period the same symbol of the marriage tent, called senti, the canopy under which a pharaoh received his bride and his crown at the same time. Mar
riage with the queen gave him formal
right to rule her land, and the senti like the huppah was a symbol of permission. 5
417



Husband property rights were matrilineal. A husband was not considered an
integral part of the maternal clan but remained a "stranger" in the ^^^^^^^^^^ house, as in early Greece where the men's god Zeus was "god of
strangers." ' Pre-Islamic Arabian husbands didn't even have names in the
matrilineal clan until they begot children; then a man could call himself abu, "father of. . ." So-and-so. This part of an Arab's name is
still considered the most important part. 2
In southeast India, a husband was regarded as a more or less
permanent guest in the wife's home, constrained to remain on his
good behavior according to the rules governing guests. In archaic Japan, husbands were not residents in the wife's home at all, but only
visitors. The old word for "marriage" meant "to slip into the house by
night." 5 Patrilocal marriage was unknown in Japan until 1400 a.d. 4 The position of a husband in the ancient world was often tempo
rary, subject to summary divorce. An Arabian wife could dismiss her
husband by turning her tent to face the west for three nights in
succession. 5 After the introduction of Islamic patriarchy, the system was reversed in favor of men. A husband could turn his wife out of her
home simply by saying "I divorce thee" three times.
Early Latin tribes followed the same rules as Arabians; a woman
could divorce her husband by shutting him out of her house for three consecutive nights. 6 Even in imperial times, a Roman wife could
maintain her own property free of husbandly claims by passing three
nights of each year away from his residence.7
Ancient Egypt had several varieties of marriage existing side by
side. Some, probably the oldest, were governed by premarital agreements that spelled out the wife's property rights and the husband's
comparative powerlessness under the law. For example:
/ bow before thy rights as a wife. From this day on, I shall never oppose thy claims with a single word. I recognize thee before all others as my
wife, though I do not have the right to say thou must be my wife. Only I
am thy husband and mate. Thou alone hast the right ofdeparture. From this day on that I have become thy husband, I cannot oppose thy wish, wherever thou desirest to go. ... I have no power to interfere in
any ofthy transactions. I hereby cede to thee any rights deeded to me in any document that has been made out in my favor. Thou keepest me
obligated to recognize all these cessions. 8
Egyptian priests advised husbands to remain in their wives' good I
graces, much as Christian priests later advised wives to make themselves! subservient to husbands:
Keep thy house, love thy wife, and do not dispute with her. She will withdraw herselfbefore violence. Feed her, adorn her, massage her.
Caress her and make her heart to rejoice as long as thou livest. . . . Attend] to that which is her desire and to that which occupies her mind. For in
such manner thou persuadest her to remain with thee. Ifthou opposest her, it will be thy ruin. 9
418



An Egyptian husband was counseled to make glad his wife's Hvov heart "during the time that thou hast," which might have meant a Hyacinthus lifetime on earth, or else a shorter period implying a temporary ^^^^^^^^^^^
marriage. 10 In the matrilocal household, husbands often entered a
period of trial servitude to win their brides, as did the biblical Jacob to
win the hand of Rachel (Genesis 29). Hence Sophocles's remark that
"Egyptian men sit indoors all day long, weaving; the women go out
and attend to business." n
Similarly among Anglo-Saxon tribes, "husbandry" meant farm work as it still does because a husband was usually bonded to
work on his wife's land. Such an agricultural matriarchate is still found
in some areas. Among the Zuni, husbands worked in the fields, but the land and its harvest belonged to their wives. 12 The old custom of
providing work in compensation for marriage gave rise to the word bridegroom, literally "the bride's servant." The Koran tells men, "your wives are your tillage," because by ancient Arabian law a wifeless man was also landless. 13 See Matrilineal Inheritance.
Tantric sages considered "husbandship" (bhavanan) essential for
still another reason: it was indispensable to a man's spiritual development. The same notion was found among Aryan Celts. The ancient
Irish said a true bard could have power over poetry and magic only if
he had "purity of husbandship," that is, fidelity to his wife. 14

Hvov
"The Earth," an Iranian form of Eve. Followers of Zoroaster
pretended that she was the wife of their prophet, not a Goddess but only
a mortal woman; yet, like writers of the Bible, they inadvertently gave away the secret by calling her Mother of All Living. Zoroaster "went into" her three times, and each time "his seed entered the ground,"
indicating that he impersonated the god who fertilized the Earth. 1
1. Campbell, Oc.M., 210.
Hyacinthus
Spring-flower god worshipped in Crete, Sparta, Rhodes, and Mycenae; another name for Narcissus or Antheus or Adonis. In Lacedaemon
his flowers represented phalli, carried at the annual festival of the
Hyacinthia. Classical myth made him a homosexual lover of the god
Apollo, another instance of Apollo's usurpation of the role of his sister
Artemis, whose priestesses the Hyacinthides ruled the archaic rites of the flower god. 1

Hygeia Hygeia
Hyperboreans "Health," title of Mother Rhea Coronis at her healing shrine of
^^^^^^^^^m Titane. The name was applied to one of the Goddess's milk-giving breasts. The other was Panacea. Later worshippers of the doctor-god
Asclepius made Hygeia and Panacea his "daughters."
Hymen
Veil of the Temple; the anatomical definition descended from a
concept of the vagina as a sanctuary of Aphrodite, virgin Goddess presiding over defloration. The veil of her temple was "rent in the
midst" (Luke 23:45) by the Passion of her doomed bridegroom, at the moment when he entered her chthonian womb, and the sun (male principle) was darkened all elements borrowed by the Christian cruci
fixion myth. (See Honey.) At the sacred marriage as well as at secular
marriages, the Goddess was invoked with the cry O Hymen Hymenaie: possible origin of the word "hymn." !

Hypatia
Alexandrian Neoplatonist philosopher, victim of 5th-century Christian persecution of intellectual women. While she was driving to the
academy where she taught, a gang of monks dragged her from her
chariot, carried her into a church, stripped her, scraped the flesh from her bones with oyster shells, then burned what was left: all by order of
St. Cyril, the city Patriarch. By making judicious gifts to civil authorities,
Cyril and his monks managed to halt official investigation of Hypatia's murder. 1 Cyril attained sainthood in 1882 when Pope Leo XIII canonized him as a "doctor of the church." 2
Hypatia's teachings had been famous throughout the land of Egypt, and her death signaled the end of pagan learning in that
country. 3 1. Gibbon 2, 816-17. 2. Attwater, 100. 3. Seligmann, 82.
Hyperboreans
Greek name for the tribes of northern Europe and the British isles,
literally "dwellers at the Back of the North Wind." They were supposed to have miraculous knowledge of the movements of the stars, the
seasons, fate, and reincarnation. Their observatory-temples, such as Stonehenge, probably contributed to this view.

j "Womb," the orgiastic religious festival of Aphrodite in Argos, where
the Womb of the World was adored and symbolically fructified. 1 ^mmmhm
Hysteria was given its present meaning by Renaissance doctors who explained women's diseases with a theory that the womb sometimes became detached from its place and wandered about inside the body, causing uncontrolled behavior.

The name kore meant the Goddess throughout the ancient Middle East. The word means a virgin or maiden, often one in the service of Athene, as this one. Polychromed marble, probably from an island of Ionian
Greece, although found near the Pantheon; ca. 5th century B.C.
The kiss is a limestone
carving by Constants Brancusi (1912).
This graven image comes from the preHellenic era of pagan idolatry. Nearly three feet high, stylized yet with intricate detail;
probably made to hang on the wall of a tomb.

bo lao
Idea One of the most common and most revered "secret names of God"
for use in spells, charms, and invocations, adopted from Neoplatonic mystics who called it the essence of the (pagan) Logos. Apparently its
occult meaning was the deity invoking him- or herself, as "I, the Alpha
and-Omega." See Name. Orphics said lao was the same as Dionysus, or else the bisexual
Phanes (Eros), firstborn of the gods. 1 Christians of the Middle Ages
claimed lao was Jesus.
1. Graves, W.G., 463.
Iblis
Arabic name for Satan, or Shaytan, the angel who rebelled against Allah and refused to worship Allah's creation, Man. 1 Iblis was the leader
of the djinn, spirits older than Allah. His name seems to have been a
corruption of Greek diabolos. 2
l.Keightley, 289. 2. Jonas, 210.
Ichor
Homer's word for the mystic "blue blood" of gods, which kept them immortal and gave them a blue skin color such as characterized gods
depicted in the sacred art of India. As the gods were diabolized in the
Middle Ages, so was their magic blood. Ichor now means a watery
purulent discharge, such as medieval churchmen postulated in the veins of devils; the word has also been applied to the blood of insects.
See Quintessence.
Idea
"Inner-Goddess." Occult tradition said an idea emanated from the
Female Soul of the World (Shakti, Shekina, Psyche, Sophia, etc.). Her "ideas" were like personal Muses, "which forms she did in the
Heavens above the Stars frame to herself." ' Medieval theologians disliked the Idea's feminine connotations
and turned away from the ancient theory of the eide to the astral
theology of Aristotle, that is, to astrological determination of thoughts. 2 Feminine "idea" was replaced by masculine "concept," which used
to mean the same as conception, from Latin concipere semina, a
gathering-up of semen. 3 Early Christian Gnostics however regarded God the Creator as a mere demiurge, child of the Mother who created in his mind all the
424



"ideas" he used to make things in the material world. His sin was that he
arrogantly claimed all these ideas to be his own, because "he was ignorant of the ideas of whatever he created and of the Mother
herself." 4 This notion that God was guilty of the sin of hubris against
the Goddess recurred again and again among early Gnostic sects, until the orthodox church declared the notion heretical and forcibly changed the minds of its adherents.

Idolatry
Idolatry
The pagan habit of making graven images of deities and heroes was copied by the Catholic church and never abandoned, despite God's
many prohibitions of idolatry in the Bible (Exodus 20:4, Leviticus 19:4, etc.). St. Thomas Aquinas defended the church against the biblical tradition, and laid down a rule that the same reverence must
be paid to Christ's image as to the deity himself. 1
The issue of idolatry became crucial in the Protestant Reforma
tion, when heretic sects broke off from Catholicism, claiming that
papal Rome no longer followed the biblical magisterium in this matter or any other.
John Wyclif declared that holy images were of no use except as firewood. For this reason, among others, the church insisted on
digging up his heretic bones 30 years after his death and burning them. 2
Some Protestant sects, like the Socinians, argued that if Catholics could be saved despite their disobedience of God's clear command
against idolatry, then Protestants could be saved also, though they denied other papal doctrines such as the trinity and the eternity of
damnation. In renouncing idolatry, they claimed to be following the letter of biblical law more closely than the Roman church did. 3
One reason for renunciation of idols was the fear that people
would cease to be suitably impressed by them, for after the decline of
Roman culture holy images became less and less impressive. Lacking
the artistic skill and training that had flourished under paganism,
Christian image-makers were unable to produce anything comparable to the classical sculptures and paintings. They created only the crudest sort of painted wooden figures or icons. 4
Images, no matter how venerable, failed to arouse the proper
reverence when their cracks showed, their paint chipped, or the
awkward technique of a mediocre artist too obviously proclaimed a
man-made artifact devoid of inspiration. As the Chinese proverb said,
No image-maker worships the gods he knows what stuff they are made of." 5 So did everyone else know, in the case of crudely
:nceived idols. Some, however, succeeded in fooling the credulous
faithful for a long time. Boxley Monastery near Maidstone attracted
John Wyclif (ca. 1330-1384) English reforming theologian who inspired John Huss, the Lollards, and other leaders of the Protestant Reformation. Wyclif served as rector of
Fillingham, prebend of Aust, warden of
Canterbury, and rector of Ludgershall in Buckinghamshire.

Idolatry many pilgrimages to its famous Rood of Grace, an idol of Christ that
could "come alive": its eyes and lips moved. Cromwell's officers
^^^^^^^^^^m disclosed the deception in 1 536, publicly displaying the wires and rods
inside the statue that created the "miracle." 6
Similarly "miraculous" idols, in effect, were the many pagan tombcarvings and statues taken over by Christian churches and
re-christened martyrs and saints. Where pagan folk were used to visiting
shrines of heroes and demigods for petitions or healing, churches simply moved into the shrine and created a new tale of martyrdom for
an old god, using his faked "relics" for healing magic. Especially with medieval monks, "the manufacture of martyrs became a thriving industry." Even the bones of ordinary Roman citizens dug out of ancient
tombs or catacombs became "idols" in that they were worshipped as
divine containers for the spirits of saints. 7 This kind of idolatry was
not a new Christian invention, but a copy of pagan practice. The
writings of Pliny show magical recipes in classical times using the
relics of slain gladiators, or hair, or pieces of garments, or nails from a cross on which a man had been executed. 8
The Catholic church changed its collective mind several times
about idols before settling down to permit them. Certainly early sects, such as the Iconoclasts, adopted a typically Semitic horror of idols and devoted themselves to smashing every metal or marble god or
goddess. At the Council of Constantinople, the bishops unanimously decreed that images were inventions of the devil and must be kept out of Christian churches. Three decades later, the Council of Nicaea reversed this decision and even anathematized those who refused to
worship images. Two more councils contradicted each other's decisions
on the matter, until in 843 the images were reinstated in the churches
once for all.9 One way in which the church excused its own idolatry was to
claim that its idols were not real idols but only "symbols." Whatever
this may have meant, the churchmen knew perfectly well that the
average worshipper made no such distinction. The images were as
thoroughly idolized as any African fetish or Phidian Athene:
The instant we ascribe to an image . . . real power to act, we make ofit an
inspired being in itself, and all the sophistry in the world as to its being a means offaith, or a symbol, or causing a higher power to act on the suppliant, is rubbish. The devotee believes tout bonnement that the
image works the cure, and ifhe did not, any other image of the Virgin or Saint would answer the same purpose. This chaffhas been thrashed out
a thousand times. . . . And it will last, while one fetish endures, that the
hierophant will call it a mere "symbol,
" and the ignorant worshipper, absolutely unable to comprehend him, will worship the symbol as the
thing itself as he is really expected to do. w

Idun Idun
Norse Goddess called "the Renewing One." ' In her western garden Coition
she grew the apples of immortality, which gave the gods eternal life. 2
When her apples were stolen, the gods began to wither and grow old, ^^m
like mortals. 3
Idun's name, possibly a feminine forerunner of "Odin," could have been derived from Greece's mountain-shrine Ida, sacred to
Rhea, or her alter ego Hera, who kept the apples of immortality that gave the Olympian gods eternal life. Idun was also said to have
invented the runic alphabet. Her consort Bragi became the greatest of
bards, because she engraved the magic runes on his tongue.

Ignatius, Saint
Also called Theophorus, "God-bearer," Ignatius starred in a triumphal procession of Trajan's time, from Antioch to Rome where he was killed. 1 As his name meant Holy Fire, the cult hero whose spirit he carried to immolation seems to have been Heracles. Or he may have
been one of the god's idols, carried to Rome with other booty to be
displayed at Trajan's triumph. 2 His canonization was only a later myth on an old title.

Ilithyia
Surname of many forms of the Goddess Diana, Aphrodite, Arte
mis, etc. in the role of divine midwife. Women in childbirth prayed to
Ilithyia Eleutho, the Goddess as "Liberator," who freed the infant from the womb. This mythic personage was even canonized as a (male)
Christian saint, St. Eleutherius. Similarly a church devoted to Mary
as Panaghia Blastike, "Virgin of Fecundity," was built on an old shrine
of Aphrodite Ilithyia, "Mother of Fecundity." ' The Greeks applied
the name Ilithyia to many Egyptian goddesses as well, including Isis, Buto, Hathor, and Nephthys.

Immaculate Conception
Often erroneously thought to refer to the conception of Christ, the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception actually was invented to absolve
the virgin Mary of original sin from the moment of her own conception. Early fathers of the church said Mary couldn't be Theoto
kos (God-bearer) if she was human, therefore tainted with the sin of
427



Immanuel Inanna
Eve; it was heresy to worship her as divine. 1 Nevertheless, people
insisted on worshipping her. 2 By the 1 2th century, Mariolatry even overshadowed the worship of God and Christ; so the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception was invented to make her uniquely holy.
Many churchmen opposed the doctrine, which was heatedly
argued for the next 700 years. Finally it was adopted as an article of faith by Pope Pius IX in 1854. 3 Every Catholic was commanded to
believe henceforth that Mary "at the first instant of her conception,
was preserved immaculate from all stain of original sin, by the singular
grace and privilege granted to her by Almighty God." 4 A certain unnamed medieval holy man had been informed by a
divine source that Mary's birthday was September 8, precisely nine months after the December festival which originally represented the conception of the Virgin Goddess Kore. 5 Apparently the date was
chosen to celebrate Epiphany and the Immaculate Conception at the
same time.
These events being equally devoid of documentation, their invention and promulgation sometimes aroused scorn among
non-Catholics. Hazlitt scoffed: "We hear of her immaculate conception
as an afterthought, on the part of the Romanists. . . . [T]he whole
narrative touching her [Mary] is evidently fabulous, and . . . the immac
ulate conception by her mother, her own purification ... are absurdities." 6
How Mary's conception took place was a problem that aroused some ingenious theological nonsense. Mary's father was not God or a spirit but a living man, and if he had sexual intercourse with Mary's
mother it would mean using the medium of transmission of original
sin, by the church's own teaching. Some theologians would have it that
his seed was carried magically, as if he were an incubus.

var. Emanuel Immanuel
Persian title of "the god Immani," or E-mani, venerated in Elam as
a sacred king-martyr. 1 One of his later incarnations was the savior
Mani, allegedly born of a virgin named Mary. 2 Isaiah 7:14 quoted a Persian scripture: "Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel."
Matthew 1:22-23 insisted this was a prophecy of Christ, who was
therefore "Immanuel"; but the name never really stuck.

var. Ininni Inanna
Sumerian name of the Goddess as queen of the land who made every
king her bridegroom. Wedding hymns for the hieros gamos said, "Oh
428



my queen, queen of the universe, the queen who encompasses the Incest
universe, may he [the king] enjoy long days at your holy lap." Sometimes she turned her power against the king's enemies: "My queen, _^_^__^_^__
the foreign lands cower at your cry My queen, you are all-devour
ing in your power My queen, the great gods fled before you like fluttering bats." Tradition said the city of Agade was completely destroyed because Inanna abandoned its temple: "Holy Inanna forsook the shrine Agade . . . ; she went forth against the city in battle." '
Inanna was the source of the earth's life blood. She filled the wells,
rivers, and springs with her "blood." As a fertility deity, like her
Babylonian counterpart Ishtar, she annually descended into the underworld to rescue her consort Dumuzi [Tammuz]. As Nanna, Nana, or
Anna she became the holy virgin mother of Attis, the bride of Balder, and the elder Virgin Mother whom Christians called "God's Grandmother." 2
Hittites called her Inaras. In the land of Hatti she renewed her
virginity each year to become the bride of the sacred king at the Purulli
festival, which later passed into the Jewish Purim. The chosen man was
isolated in a royal castle or tower, and slain at the appointed time so his
blood would help the Goddess fertilize the land. Certain writings of
lamentation suggest that the king-martyr regretted his brief glory. 3

Incest
Thanks to Freud, King Oedipus is one of the most misinterpreted
figures in mythology. His mother-marrying, father-killing legend arose not from a wish-fulfillment fantasy but from the ancient system of
succession of sacred kings, whereby every previous king was slain by his successor, chosen to be the queen's new bridegroom. The killer was always described as a "son" of the deceased because he was the same
god reincarnated in another consort of the same mother-bride. Such
sacred incest can still be traced even in the Christian image of the divine
Son who is indistinguishable from his Father, who impregnated his own Mother (i.e., Mother of God) to beget himself.
When patriarchal invaders overthrew the Theban matriarchate,
they purposely misinterpreted the sacred icons that told the story of its royal succession. The name of the deceased "father," Laius, simply meant "King," and that of the widowed "mother" was the same as
the title of the Moon Goddess. The replacement, Oedipus, was depict
ed as a stranger from a distant land. To make him the king's true son,
improbable details were added to show he was sent away in infancy and
brought up among foreigners. Freud's rather subjective notion that all men secretly want to kill their fathers the so-called Oedipus complex may have had more to do with Freud's own experience of
a repressive father than with any mythic archetype. 1
429



Incest Sacred incest between father-son and mother-bride was usual
among ancient god-kings. It was considered necessary for the god
^^^^^^^^^^_ dess-queen to be periodically supplied with a young, virile consort who
embodied the same god again as the older consort. Thus Egyptian
gods like Amon and Osiris were respectfully entitled, "Husband of thy mother." 2 The reborn Savior appeared as Min, or Menu, the Moonbull who mated with his sacred Cow-mother. In human form, he was
shown with an abnormally long erect phallus, as an ithyphallic sex god like Eros or Kama, the Bull "from whom spring the delights of
love." 3
Throughout Egypt generally the company ofgods ofa town or city were three in number . . . ; two members ofsuch a triad were gods, one old
and one young, and the third was a goddess, who was, naturally, the wife, or female counterpart, ofthe older god. The younger god was the son ofthe older god and goddess, and he was supposed to possess all the
attributes and powers which belonged to his father. . . . [I]t was assumed that he would succeed to his rank and throne when the older god
had passed away. *
Here was the basis of trinities consisting of Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit (or, Goddess: the third member of the trinity was female, as she was even in Gnostic Christianity under the name of Sophia). The
same trinity occurs in almost all mythologies, without ever developing
into a complete family: there is no daughter, only a son. That is, man
as-youth and man-as-man have their separate projections into divinity; but woman is always the same.
Unlike Freud, Jung said the meaning of the mother-son incest in
religions was not based on simple eroticism but on the idea of rebirth. "To get back to the mother again in order to be born again by the
mother. . . . One of the simplest ways was to fructify the mother and
procreate oneself again. ... It is not incestuous cohabitation that is
sought, but rebirth. . . . The neurotic who cannot leave his mother
has good reason; fear of death holds him there. It appears that there is
no concept and no word strong enough to express the meaning of this conflict. Whole religions are built to give value to the magnitude of
this conflict." 5
Though the myth of Oedipus was not about true "Oedipal" father-son rivalry but rather about sacred kingship, the theme of male
jealousy was amply demonstrated elsewhere in myths. Rank says, "It is
not necessary to explore the heavens for some process into which this
trait might be laboriously fitted . . . ; in reality, a certain tension is
frequently, if not regularly, revealed between father and son . . . related to the competition for the tender devotion and love of the
mother." 6 It might be a fruitful avenue for psychological investiga
tion to determine why mother-son love in mythology was nearly always transmuted into the realm of the erotic.

Incubus
The pagan incubus was a special priest embodying a prophetic spirit who could come in dreams or visions to those who "incubated" over
night in the earth-womb or Pit of a temple (see Abaddon). Greeks
practiced incubation especially in the healing temples of Asclepius and Hygeia. Egyptians' favorite incubus appeared in temples of Imhotep. 1 Undoubtedly, the appearance of the incubus was often carefully staged,
when the sleeper was a figure of political importance, to issue the "right" prophecies and advice that would benefit the temple.
Christians copied the custom of incubation, which became
"watching" or "keeping vigil." It was recommended in a time of troublesome decision to "watch and pray" overnight in a church, to
court a vision of guidance. The incubus, however, was diabolized. He
was no longer the same as a guiding angel. The reason for his fall from
grace was the ancient tradition of midnight sexual relationships between
incubating women and priests, or incubating men and priestesses. Incubi thus became spirits of lust.
Certain churchmen said incubi were demon lovers of women, able
to beget children in a demonic version of the Virgin Birth. Father
Ludovico Sinistrari said hedging his bets like every well-trained cler
ic "Subject to correction by our Holy Mother Church, and as a mere
expression of private opinion, I say that the Incubus, when having intercourse with a woman, begets the human fetus from his own seed."
As a "well-known" example of a demon-begotten man, Sinistrari cited
"that damnable heresiarch Martin Luther." 2 As for the opinion of the
damnable heresiarch himself, Luther said all odd-looking children
should be destroyed at birth, for they were clearly the offspring of demons. 3
Other authorities, like St. Thomas Aquinas, insisted that demons must be sterile. Therefore an incubus could impregnate a woman only by carrying semen from a man with whom the demon previously copulated in the form of a succubus or she-demon for demons were
thought to change their sex at will. 4 Aquinas also asserted that a demon could use semen lost in a wet dream so a man could be "at one and the
same time both a virgin and a father." 5
Here Aquinas contradicted both the biblical tradition and
St. Augustine, who cited Genesis 6:4 to prove that fallen angels begot children on mortal women: "The sons of God came in unto the
daughters of men, and they bare children to them." Pope Benedict XIV
announced, "This passage has reference to devils known as incubi and
succubi." The pope declined to decide the question of demonic
conception, however; he simply mentioned both schools of thought: "Some writers deny that there can be offspring. . . . Others, however,
asserting that coitus is possible, maintain that children may result." On this theory, a woman was burned at Carcassonne in 1275 for bearing a
child to the devil.6
Churchmen with some classical education pointed out that the

Incubus
Pierre de Lancre
(1553-1601) Trial judge
for the Inquisition, who boasted of burning hundreds of witches and charged the entire
population of Pays de Labourd some
30,000 persons with witchcraft. He wrote several books
on witchcraft, which were accepted as authoritative.
gods of the heathen devils, by the church's definition were fa
thers. 7 Many legends accepted by the church attributed demonic
parentage to such historical figures as Robert of Normandy, Alexan
der the Great, Plato, Scipio Africanus, all the Huns, and all the Cypriots. 8 A 6th-century History of the Goths declared that the Huns were descended from the offspring of women and incubi.9 Neverthe
less, the opinion of Aquinas generally overruled both classical and
biblical precedent. Whatever the incubus's reproductive potential, his sexual capacity inspired ill-concealed male envy in an age when nearly all men were
so sexually naive as to confuse penis size with lovemaking skills. Father
Sinistrari said women who lay with incubi found afterward that the
lovemaking of mere men was "paltry and unable to arouse them to any degree." 10 Pico della Mirandola explained why: incubi were hand
some and notable for "the extraordinary largeness of their members. . . .
The devils can even agitate the thing when it is inside, wherefore the women derive more pleasure than they do with men." De Lancre
quoted the testimony of an accused witch, who said her devil "had a
member like a mule's ... as long and as thick as an arm. ... He always
exposed his instrument, of such beautiful shape and measurements."
Despite these unwieldy proportions, incubi were said to seduce very young children. The Chancellor of Wiirzburg declared in August, 1629, that "There are some 300 children of three or four years who
have had intercourse with devils." ' '
Satyrs, fauns, and the Gaulish dusii (from deus, "god") were cited in an official Inquisition handbook as incubi who had intercourse with
witches in front of witnesses. St. Augustine called the Gaulish Dusius
an incubus who lay with mortal women; and later churchmen
earnestly supported Augustine with what they conceived to be proof. 12 Women seemed unaccountably willing to copulate with their demons under the eyes of "bystanders"; the latter reported that, while the
demon remained invisible, "it has been apparent from the disposition of those limbs and members which pertain to the venereal act and
orgasm, [that] . . . they have been copulating with Incubus devils." B
Nuns appeared especially vulnerable to the attentions of incubi. 14
Authorities said nuns often awoke in the morning "to find themselves
polluted as if they had slept with men." 15 Some nuns claimed they slept
with Christ, but this was condemned as blasphemy resulting from demonic possession, even though the church taught them to think of
themselves as Christ's wives.
There were some Christian saints who functioned as incubi
themselves. At shrines of St. Giles in Normandy and St. Rene in
Anjou, women would lie all night with the saints' ithyphallic images
hoping to conceive children. 16 Christians used to incubate in the
temple of Isis at Canopis, following local custom; so the bishops moved some bones into the temple and called them relics of two martyrs,
Cyrus of Alexandria and John of Edessa. Incubations continued as
432



before, and any subsequent miracles were credited to the martyrs Indulgence instead of to Isis. 17
On occasion, women who consorted with incubi seemed to inspire ^^^^^^^^^^
more fear than the demons themselves. An Anglo-Saxon Leechbook
prescribed magic salves for protection, not against incubi but against
"women with whom the Devil had sexual intercourse." At Toulouse
in 1275, a 56-year-old woman of means was robbed of her worldly
goods by ecclesiastical confiscation, and tortured until she confessed that she had intercourse with an incubus every night for years and gave
birth to the demon's child, which was half wolf and half snake. 18
Perhaps the ultimate irony was the church's official opinion that all
the activities of incubi were performed "with the permission of God." 19 But what God allowed, men punished.

Indulgence
Catholic doctrine most often equated with the sin of simony. By
selling indulgence, the church reaped enormous profit with no material investment only a promise that the purchaser would be absolved of
his sins and admitted to heaven after death. No customer ever returned
to complain of being cheated. It became the rule for popes to promise plenary indulgence (absolute remission of all sins) to military leaders who fought the
church's crusades. Bills of indulgence became the spiritual carrot
corresponding to the stick of excommunication, which was thought to sentence the sinner irrevocably to hellfire.
Bills of indulgence were peddled by Renaissance popes to earn
money for their expensive lifestyle. Pope Alexander VI made a
commercial empire out of selling pardons. Pope Leo X sent a Domini
can, Johann Tetzel, into Germany to sell indulgences for varying numbers of days' worth of release from purgatory, depending on price. Tetzel's announcements read:
/ have here the passports . . . to lead the human sou] into Paradise. Inasmuch as for a single one ofthe mortal sins, several of which are
committed every day after confession, seven years ofexpiation either on earth or in Purgatory are imposed who, for the sake ofa quarter ofa florin, would hesitate to secure one ofthese letters which will admit your
divine, immortal soul to the celestial joys ofParadise? '
One observer wrote in the 1 5th century: "Sinners say nowa
lays, I care not what or how many evils I do before God, for I can get at
Mice, without the least difficulty, plenary remission of any guilt or sin

Infallibility whatever through an indulgence granted me by the Pope, whose written grant I have bought for fourpence . . . , for these grantors of
^^^^^^^^^^^ Indulgence run about from place to place and sometimes give a letter
for twopence, sometimes for a good drink of wine and beer, some
times to pay their losses at a game of ball, sometimes for the hire of a
prostitute, sometimes for fleshly love." 2
Reginald Scot thought the peddling of indulgences showed the trivial nature of Catholic doctrine, especially when coupled with the
church's idolatry. He wrote of "the folly of some papists, who seeing and confessing the pope's absurd religion, in the erection and
maintenance of idolatry and superstition, specially in images, pardons, and relics of saints, will persevere to think, that the rest of his doctrine
and trumpery is holy and good." 3 But not all Catholics approved of the sale of indulgence. In
Prague, papal bulls of indulgence were publicly burned at the pillory, having been carried there strung around the neck of a whore, who
enlivened the proceedings with lascivious capering. 4 Minstrels and
other popular entertainers throughout Europe made fun of the doctrine
of indulgence with a satiric couplet:
As soon as the coin in the coffer rings, The soul from out of the fire springs. 5

Infallibility
The doctrine of papal infallibility stated that anything the pope said
was invariably true, and anything he did was invariably right, because God could not permit his pope to speak or act erroneously. The doctrine first took shape in the 1 5 th century. It was set forth by
implication in the writings of Torquemada. Cardinal Cajetano openly proclaimed it, inspiring the pope to issue the bull Pastor eternus, which made the doctrine of infallibility part of canon law. 1
In the 19th-century Age of Enlightenment, one scientific discovery after another demonstrated that the statements of popes on
matters like the solar system, biology, botany, geology, and other earth
sciences to say nothing of witchcraft, diabolism, and the Bible had been patently fallible. In fact, wrong. So the church decided that the
pope was still certainly infallible but only when he spoke officially, ex cathedra, for then God protected his words from error if not at other
times. Unfortunately this served for only a short time. It was soon
found that popes were wrong in numerous statements officially en
shrined in bulls and encyclicals.
The doctrine of infallibility had to be revised again, this time to
state that the pope is infallible only when speaking "on matters of
434



jiith and morals." Still another revision of the doctrine may be due in Infernus

The Christian version of the slaughter of the innocents occurs
only in the Gospel of Matthew. Other Gospels say nothing of it. Marl
and John make no mention of Jesus's early years. As far as Luke is
concerned, Jesus grew up quietly in Galilee after presentation in the
temple of Jerusalem after his birth; there was no king threatening his life. Matthew's "slaughter" seems to have been included only to provi
an excuse to locate the holy child in Egypt, to create fulfillment of a
prophecy, "Out of Egypt have I called my son" (Matthew 2:1 5). Therefore Herod's attack on the children probably was invented to
provide a link between Jesus and his Egyptian counterpart Osiris. The infants supposedly slain by King Herod were canonized en
masse, though there are no scriptural records of any of their names, nor even of their number. A modern Catholic scholar notes that enormous numbers have been postulated in the past, but "it is unlikely that there were more than about twenty of them at the most.' Yet this statement has no more foundation than a statement that
there were two hundred, or two thousand, or none at all perhaps tht
most likely possibility, since this was a universal, not a specific, myth. The entire unknown, unnamed group became patrons of childre

Inquisition
Until the advent of Nazism in modern Germany, Europe knew no
system of organized terrorism to rival the 500-year reign of the Inquis: tion. Historian Henry Charles Lea, recognized as the leading expert on the medieval period, called the Inquisition "a standing mockery of
justice perhaps the most iniquitous that the arbitrary cruelty of man has ever devised. . . . Fanatic zeal, arbitrary cruelty, and insatiable cupj
ity rivalled each other in building up a system unspeakably atrocious. It was a system which might well seem the invention of
demons." (See Torture.)
436



It was invented primarily to force public acceptance of a church
[he public didn't want. According to a contemporary aphorism, the bhurch had not ten commandments but only one: "Bring hither the
money." 2 St. Bernard deplored the church's greed: "Whom can you know me among the prelates who does not seek rather to empty the pockets of his flock than to subdue their vices?" 3
Bulgarian writers said the priests of Rome were given to drunkenness and robbery, and "there is none to forbid them." The local
presbyter Cosmas didn't deny it but only insisted that Christians must
honor even wicked priests.4 This was an accepted doctrine. Pilichdorf
bid, "The worst man, if he be a priest, is more worthy than the holiest
pf layman." 5 Priests were a privileged class, but their privileges were more and bore resented. In the 12th century, monasteries made themselves
Into wineshops and gambling houses; nunneries became private whorenouses for the clergy; priests used a confessional to seduce female
parishioners. Episcopal collectors were depicted in popular stories as the worst of all sinners.6 "The sale of Church offices was constant and
unblushing." 7 Even the pope observed that "those charged with divine
race . . . participate in rapine and despoliation, even in the shedding )f blood." 8
Pierre de Bruys was burned in 1126 for declaring openly that
'God is no more in the church than in the market-place; the forms
|nd ceremonies which to so many folk replace true religion are utterly
iseless; the Cross should not be prayed to. . . . The priests lie in
jretending that they made Christ's body and give it to the people for
heir salvation." 9 According to Tyndale, common folk said of any
hing that went wrong, "the bishop has blessed it." If the dinner burned,
hey said the bishop has put his foot in it, "because the bishops burn
yho they list and whosoever displeaseth them." 10 Would-be reformers within the church were usually silenced,
frere Raymond Jean was executed for preaching against the church's
Ibuses. He said bitterly, "The enemies of the faith are among ourselves,
fhe Church which governs us is symbolled by the Great Whore of
he Apocalypse, who persecutes the poor and the ministers of Christ." n
Nicholas de Clamanges, rector of the University of Paris, declared
h an open letter that the popes were ravishers, not pastors, of their
locks: "The priesthood has become a misery reduced to profaning its
ailing. . . . Who do you think can endure, among so many other
puses, your mercenary appointments, your multiple sale of benefices, bur elevation of men without honesty or virtue to the most eminent
fositions?"
n Pope Alexander VI, one of the men so described, was
pedited with the cynical remark, "It is not God's wish that a sinner
hould die, but that he should live and pay." n
A Franciscan splinter group, the Fraticelli, withdrew from their

inquisition
Waldenses Also called Valdenses or Vaudois, this heretic sect was founded in southern France during the 1 2th century by Peter Waldo, or
Valdes, who preached a
life of simplicity and poverty in imitation of
Christ.
God, for ignoring Christ's vow of poverty. They called the pope an
Antichrist. 14 These heretics were soon exterminated. One of their
centers, the village of Magnalata, was leveled by order of Pope Martin V and every resident slain. 15
In 1325 Pope John issued the bull Cum inter nonnullos, which
"infallibly" declared it was heresy to say Jesus and his apostles owned no property. Inquisitors were ordered to prosecute those who believed
Jesus was a poor man. The group called Spiritual Franciscans, who did so believe, were taught an immediate lesson when the pope had 1 14 of their number burned alive. 16 The offenses of the Waldenses included many "wrong" opinions.
They said laymen and women had the right to preach; masses, votive
offerings, and prayers for the dead were useless; purgatory did not exist; one could pray to God without setting foot in a church; and a bad priest should be forbidden to administer sacraments "a proposition
which does no less than deny lasting grace to the sacrament of Orders, and thus destroys the fundamental privilege of the Church." The Waldenses said priests who demand money for administering communion are lower than Judas, "for they sell for one denarius that body for which he demanded thirty." 17
Along with public disgust at the church's avarice, there was a
growing suspicion sparked by Gnostic philosophies from the east that the church's myths of the garden of Eden, the fall, original sin,
heaven and hell, the virgin birth, the meaning of salvation, and so on, were literally untrue. Because people refused to believe the eucharistic
bread and wine were literally flesh and blood, the papacy lost all of
Bohemia, which after many wars and crusades founded its separate
Moravian church. Tenets of the Roman church were widely ques
tioned. Priests were forbidden to "dispute concerning the faith against
such astute heretics" in public, lest they expose themselves to ridicule. 18 As Becker said, "This is neurosis in a nutshell: the miscarriag<
of clumsy lies about reality." 19 Despite the church's efforts to keep the populace in ignorance, even among the peasantry there were individuals astute enough to
recognize theology's clumsy lies. Even the 12th-century passion for building cathedrals seems to have represented a last-ditch effort to
hold the wandering attention of the people by giving them splendid
temples of the "Lady," to replace the Mother-shrines previously destroyed. At length not even the Notre Dames sufficed. The Church
had to fall back on its traditional propensity to maintain a reign of
terror. 20
Guignebert says Christianity was "given to warfare; exclusive,
violently intolerant, to the Jews especially menacing; bristling with peremptory dogmas which set reason at defiance; marked by complex elaborate rites . . . kept up to the mark by a formidable army of monks
and kept in check by a quibbling troop of acute theologians." 21 The violence of the Inquisition was its ultimate weapon.
438



Violence could be invoked under this system by nothing more Inquisition
han ordinary living, just as the doctrine of original sin was invoked by lothing more than being born. Not only sexual impulses, which were ^^^^^^^^^^^
always labeled corrupt, but almost every other natural impulse was /iewed as evidence of anti-Christian perversity. 22
Modern apologists say the Inquisition served some good purposes, ike helping secular courts bring criminals to justice. 23 Only a few
lecades ago, even Catholic manuals mendaciously claimed the Inquisi
ion was a purely civil tribunal. 24 Actually, the Inquisition was
ininterested in secular crimes, except insofar as they could provide a
>asis for a charge of heresy or witchcraft. The Inquisition was created o win the war between the church and a disillusioned public. Coulton
ays, "The so-called Ages of Faith were only Ages of Acquiescence"; put even the acquiescence was wearing thin. 25 The power of the Inquisition was established and enlarged by a ieries of papal bulls. Ad extirpanda of Pope Innocent IV, issued May
[5, 1252, was "a terrible measure against heretics in Italy, authorizing
eizure of their goods, imprisonment, torture, and, on conviction, leath, all on minimal evidence." 26
The Inquisition was the most elaborate extortion racket ever
ievised, primarily developed for profit. 27 After the arrest, the property if the accused was instantly confiscated. Nothing seems to have been
^turned. The popes publicly praised the rule of confiscation as a
brime weapon against heresy. 28 Confiscation was the organization's hison d'etre; when the rule of confiscation was not applied, "the
lusiness of defending the faith languished lamentably." Affluent Italy
pade its inquisitors incredibly rich in the 14th century. Within two rears, the inquisitor of Florence amassed "more than seven thousand lorins, an enormous sum." 29 As the inquisitor Heinrich von Schulth
jis complacently wrote, "When I have you tortured, and by the severe
neans afforded by the law I bring you to confession, then I perform a
Lork pleasing in God's sight; and it profiteth me." 30 Confiscation took place before conviction, because it was taken for
ranted that no one escaped. "Officials considered themselves safe in
jcting upon the presumption" of guilt. Sometimes confiscation took [lace even before confession. In 1 300 a nobleman named Jean
laudier was arrested and first examined on January 20. He refused to
pnfess for a long time but finally was broken down by torture and
jonfessed on February 5. He was condemned on March 7. However,
is impounded property had been sold on January 29, before the jonfession. Similarly, Guillem Garric was arrested at Carcassonne in
284 but not sentenced until 1319. Nevertheless, officials were
barreling over his castle in 1301. 31
Accused persons were expected to pay the expenses of their own Imprisonment, even of their own torture. This continental custom
[as followed in Scotland where, for example, torturers charged their
ictims 6 shillings and 8 pence for branding on the cheek. In
439



Inquisition England, accused witches were sometimes acquitted; yet they were kept in prison until they paid the expenses of their unlawful
^^^^^^^^^^^ imprisonment.32
The Inquisition's prisoners had to pay for their own food in prison. Without money they starved. Pope Gregory XI noted that too many were starving to death before they could be brought to the stake, but it seems not to have occurred to him to feed them on church funds.
Instead, he offered indulgences to all who would donate food to the
"many heretics and those defamed for heresy, who in consequence of
their poverty cannot be sustained in prison unless the pious liberality of
the faithful shall assist them as a work of charity." Thus the church
bent its own rules, which said anyone who helped a heretic was to be
suspected of heresy also. Lea commented:
There is something so appallingly grotesque in tearing honest, industrious folk from their homes by the thousand, in thrusting them into dun
geons to rot and starve, and then evading the cost offeeding them by
presenting them to the faithful as objects ofcharity, that the proclamation which Gregory issued August 15th, 1376, is perhaps the most
shameless monument ofa shameless age. n
When an arrested heretic had unpaid debts, the judges simply canceled the debts on the ground that no heretic could engage in legal
transactions. Thus, "creditors were shamelessly cheated." The entire
financial network of European society was strained by its religious
masters. "In addition to the misery inflicted by these wholesale
confiscations on the thousands of innocent and helpless women and
children thus stripped of everything. ... All safeguards were withdrawn from every transaction. No creditor or purchaser could be sure of
the orthodoxy of him with whom he was dealing. . . . The practice of proceeding against the memory of the dead after an interval virtually unlimited, rendered it impossible for any man to feel secure in the
possession of property, whether it had descended in his family for
generations, or had been acquired within an ordinary lifetime." 34 Property could be seized from the dead, whose bones might be
dug up from their graves and burned as post-mortem heretics; then
the property was taken away from legal heirs. 35 If a person knowing he was about to be arrested tried to sell or give away his property, or to
commit suicide before the torturers got to him, his property was seized,
because a heretic was forbidden to make any legal transaction, and a
suicide could bequeathe property to no one; it was taken by the church.
If the accused fled the country, he was tried and convicted in
absentia. Families of the accused were left destitute, and no one dared
help them for fear of falling under suspicion. The Inquisition established the law of property seizure for suicides, which remained the rule
in most European countries and the British Isles until 1870. 36
Inquisitors could also impose heavy fines. Sometimes it was argued
that fines were useless, since all the property of the accused heretic
disappeared in confiscation anyway; but the inquisitors invented a class
440



f unwitting miscreants called "defenders," whose heresy might Inquisition
:onsist only of a single thoughtless word overheard or spoken. These ould be fined for their oversight. 37 ^^^^^^^^^^^
The system of fines often developed into a protection racket,
nquisitors could "exchange the punishment of the body with the >unishment of the purse," as Scot put it, and there were many who
iaid annual fees to escape persecution. 38
A person who opposed or impeded the inquisitors in any way iecame at once excommunicate, and after a year in this condition t-as "handed over without further ceremony to the secular arm for
>urning, without trial and without forgiveness." No one was acquired. If a confession could not be obtained which was extremely rare,
banks to the use of torture the sentence was "not proven." Even
ben, the prisoner could be kept indefinitely in prison in case new vidence should arise, or fresh tortures prove effective. 39 Should a
ictim resist all tortures and survive, which was virtually unheard of, he
till was not released. He could be sentenced to life imprisonment for
obduracy." The witch's or heretic's trial was a mockery. The accused had no
iwyer; Pope Boniface directed that trials must be conducted "simply,
without the noise and form of lawyers." 40 Evidence was accepted from
'itnesses who could not legally testify in any other kind of trial, such
s condemned criminals, other heretics, and children, even as young as le age of two. The inquisitor Bodin "valued child witnesses because
[ their tender age they could easily be persuaded or forced to in
>rm." 41 A witness who withdrew adverse testimony was punished
>r perjury, but his testimony remained on the record. 42 Inquisitorial Jes for a trial were as follows:
1 . The procedure was kept secret.
2. "Common report" and hearsay were accepted as proof of guilt. 3. Accused was not told of the nature of the charges nor allowed
legal counsel.
4. Witnesses were kept concealed.
5. Perjurers, excommunicates, or children could give evidence against witches.
6. No favorable evidence or character witnesses were permitted.
In any case, one who spoke for an accused heretic would be
arrested as an accomplice. 7. Torture was used always, without limit of duration or severity.
Even if the accused confessed before torture, the torture was
applied anyway, to "validate" the confession. If the accused
died under torture, the record stated that the devil broke his
neck in prison. 8. Accused was forced to confirm under torture the names of
"accomplices" suggested to him by the judges. 9. No accused person was found innocent.43
Officially, the rule was that torture could be applied only once.
441



Inquisition But, by a semantic quibble, it could be "continued" any number of
times, even over a period of years, each pause being considered a ^^^im "suspension," not an end. There are records of some victims tortured
over fifty times. 44 The Inquisition's handbook, Malleus Maleficarum, said the accused witch must be "often and frequently exposed to torture. If after being fittingly tortured she refuses to confess the
truth, he [the inquisitor] should have other engines of torture brought before her, and tell her that she will have to endure these if she does
not confess. If then she is not induced by terror to confess, the torture
must be continued." If she remained obdurate, "she is not to be
altogether released, but must be sent to the squalor of prison for a year,
and be tortured, and be examined very often, especially on the more
Holy Days." 45 Another official rule was that the church did not shed blood.
Therefore, victims were handed over to the secular arm (civil courts)
for execution. This was called relaxing or abandoning them. It was
accompanied by a token plea for mercy: "We cast you forth from this our ecclesiastical Court, and leave you to be delivered to the secular
arm. But we earnestly pray that the said secular court may temper its justice with mercy, that there be no bloodshed or danger of death." 46
This plea was the emptiest of formalities, designed only to absolve the church of responsibility for bloodshed. In fact, "to be delivered to
the secular arm" was an irrevocable death sentence, which the secular
court was compelled to carry out. To temper justice with "mercy" meant permission to strangle the victim before she was burned, but this was not often done. 47
History was written to order by church historians who claimed the
church "took no part in the corporal punishment of heretics."
Ecclesiastical euphemism forced on civil authorities a guilt that be
longed at the church's door. Magistrates were commanded to carry out the death penalty by the dire threat of excommunication and
consequent arrest. "The remorseless logic of St. Thomas Aquinas
rendered it self-evident that the secular power could not escape the duty
of putting the heretic to death. . . . [T]he only punishment recognized by the Church as sufficient for heresy was burning alive. Even if
the ruler was excommunicated and incapable of legally performing
any other function, he was not relieved from the obligation of this
supreme duty, with which nothing was allowed to interfere. . . . The
fact is, the Church not only defined the guilt and forced its punishment, but created the crime itself." 48
The fiction of the church's innocence was exposed by a bull of
Pope Leo X in 1 521. The Senate of Venice had refused to sanction the numerous executions ordered by the Inquisition. The Pope wrote to
his legate, "We declare and order you to exhort and command the
aforesaid Senate of Venice, their Doge and his officials, to intervene no
more in this kind of trial, but promptly, without changing or inspecting the sentences made by the ecclesiastical judges, to execute the
442



sentences which they are enjoined to carry out. And if they neglect or Inquisition refuse, you are to compel them with the Church's censure and other appropriate legal measures. From this order there is no appeal." 49 A ^^^^^^^^^^
directive published in 1 599 said judges were bound under pain of
mortal sin to execute witches; anyone who objected to the death
sentence was suspected of complicity. 50 Inquisitors "jealously guarded their records from all outsiders." 51
On one occasion, magistrates of Brescia objected to burning a number of condemned witches without having examined records of
their trials. But the inquisitors kept their records sequestered, and the pope declared the magistrates' reluctance a scandal to the faith. "He
ordered the excommunication of the magistrates if within six days
they did not execute the convicts ... a decision which was held to give
the secular courts six days in which to carry out the sentence of condemnation." 52
Even when kept hidden, records were often falsified. Inquisitors
had special terms for everything they did. For example, torturers said
their victims were "laughing" when they contorted their faces with pain;
or "sleeping" when they fainted. Those who died under torture
either "committed suicide" or were slain by the devil. Having confessed
under torture, the accused was compelled to repeat the confession
outside the torture chamber, knowing he would be returned thereto if
he didn't obey; nevertheless, this was recorded as a confession given
"freely and spontaneously, without the pressure of force or fear," and court documents often claimed the accused had confessed without
[torture. Sometimes confessions were described as "voluntary" if they
jwere obtained after the first degree of torture binding and racking. 53
L\n episcopal scribe at Pamiers naively wrote that a prisoner confessed of
[his own accord "after he was taken down from the torture." 54
Some victims were listed as "confessed without torture" after
exposure to only one instrument, a spiked iron press that crushed the legs. Friedrich von Spee, a Jesuit who acted as confessor for condemned
pitches and developed some compassion for them, wrote of this practice: "And they call that 'Confessed without torture' ! What kind of
insight can those have who lack all understanding of such pains? How tan outstandingly learned men judge and discriminate when they
cannot understand the language, the specialists' jargon, of the inquisi
tors? " In his Cautio Criminalis, von Spee wrote:
Why do you search so diligently for sorcerers? I will show you at once
where they are. Take the Capuchins, the Jesuits, all the religious orders, and torture them they will confess. Ifsome deny, repeat it a few
times they will confess. Should a few still be obstinate, exorcise them,
shave them, only keep on torturing they will give in. Ifyou want more, take the Canons, the Doctors, the Bishops ofthe Church they will
confess. s$
Another unusual churchman, Bernard Delicieux, was excom

municated, arrested, tortured, and burned alive for expressing the
opinion that St. Peter and St. Paul, if tried by the Inquisition's
methods, would certainly be convicted of heresy. 56 Inquisitors were placed entirely above the law by Pope Innocent IV in his bull of 1252, Ad extirpanda. 57 Every ruler and citizen must assist them on pain of excommunication. Resistance could place the
whole community under interdict, or force payment of heavy fines.
Any individual fined by the Inquisition could be held in prison until he paid, or died. Torture was officially sanctioned in 1257 and remained
a legal recourse of the church for five and a half centuries until it was
abolished by Pope Pius VII in 1816. 58
The victims in those five and a half centuries were literally
countless. Official burnings were only a beginning. There were also
the disrupted, starving families; unrecorded suicides; unofficial lynch
ings; hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, who died unnoticed in the papal crusades against heretical groups. There were late-Renais
sance witch hunts in Protestant countries, which had no formal
connection with the Inquisition but certainly took their impetus from it.
The chronicler of Treves reported that in the year 1 586, the entire
female population of two villages was wiped out by the inquisitors, except for only two women left alive. 59 Two other villages were
destroyed completely and erased from the map.60 A hundred and
thirty-three persons were burned in a single day at Quedlinburg in 1589, out of a town of 12,000. Henri Boguet said Germany in 1590
was "almost entirely occupied with building fires (for witches); and Switzerland has been compelled to wipe out many of her villages on their account. Travelers in Lorraine may see thousands and thousands
of the stakes to which witches are bound." 61 In 1 524, one thousand witches died at Como.62 Strasbourg burned
five thousand in a period of 20 years.63 The Senate of Savoy condemned 800 witches at one time. Parame stated that over thirty thousand were executed in the 1 5 th century. 64 Nicholas Remy said he personally sentenced 800 witches in 1 5 years and in one year alone
forced sixteen witches to suicide. A bishop of Bamberg claimed 600
witches in 10 years; a bishop of Nancy, 800 in 16 years; a bishop of Wurtzburg, 1900 in 5 years. Five hundred were executed within three months at Geneva and 400 in a single day at Toulouse. The city of Treves burned 7,000 witches. The Lutheran prelate Benedict
Carpzov, who claimed to have read the Bible 53 times, sentenced
20,000 devil-worshippers. Even relatively permissive England killed 30,000 witches between 1542 and 1736. The slaughter went on
throughout Christian Europe for nearly five centuries. 65
Mass burnings on the Iberian peninsula were known as autos-de-fe
(acts of faith). They were held once a month on the average, usually
on a Sunday or holiday so all could attend; to stay away was thought
suspicious. Sometimes the spectators were invited to participate, as in the diversion genially known as "shaving the new Christians." This
444



meant setting fire to the hair or beards of those waiting their turn at Inquisition
the stake.66
Wholesale burnings in Germany are suggested by the observation ^^^^^^^^^^
of a visitor to Wolfenbuttel in 1 590: there were so many stakes to
burn the witches that the place of execution resembled a small forest. The executioner of Neisse in Silesia invented an oven in which he
roasted to death forty-two women and young girls in one year. Within
nine years he had roasted over a thousand persons, including children j two to four years old. 67
Inquisitors were empowered to absolve each other, their offi
cers, torturers, and executioners, of blood guilt for their victims' deaths, whether in the prison, in the torture chamber, or at the stake. 68 They
also forced the condemned witches to recite: "I free all men, especially
the ministers and magistrates, of the guilt of my blood; I take it wholly upon myself, my blood be upon my own head." Some witches even
were made to repudiate the more impossible confessions extorted by
torture, as a suicidal device: "Through the temptation of the devil I
made up that confession on purpose to destroy my own life, being
weary of it, and choosing rather to die than live." These abject
recitations preceded the trip to the stake, for it was common practice
|
to silence witches on their way to execution, either by wooden gags, or
by cutting out their tongues, to prevent communication with the crowd. 69
Inquisitors didn't want to give witches a chance to reveal that they
had been raped in prison, the usual practice of torturers and their
assistants during preliminary "stripping." 70 By the curious morality of
the day, outrage could be excited by sexual "irregularities" although spectacles of hideous torment were received without serious objection.
The people of Toulouse gathered evidence against an inquisitor named Foulques de Saint-George to prove he arrested women for the
sole purpose of abusing them sexually. 71 Apparently this was considered worse than torturing them.
Some records hint that executioners could indulge their lusts as
long as they were circumspect. The day in 1 589 at Quedlinburg, 133 witches were burned and four inexplicably disappeared. "Four beautiful
girls were spared by the executioner, who gave out that the devil had spirited them away." 72 They were never seen again. One can well
imagine who this "devil" was and what happened to the poor girls before they were finally murdered.
It can hardly be doubted that a major driving force of all witch
hunts was sadistic sexual perversion. Torturers liked to attack wom
en's breasts and genitals with pincers, pliers, and red-hot irons. Under
the Inquisition's rules, little girls were prosecuted and tortured for I witchcraft a year earlier than little boys at 9 1
/2, as opposed to 10 Vi for
wys. Witch hunting generally was directed against the female sex, and the abject helplessness of imprisoned and tortured women invari
ably encouraged sexual abuse along with every other kind of abuse.
445



Inquisition Late in the 14th century it became a rule that prisoners in solitary confinement (usually women) could be visited in their cells by ^^^m^^^^mm "zealous Catholics" (always men; female visitors were not allowed).73
One inquisitorial judge, Dietrich Flade, experienced a revulsion for his lifework and dared to say openly that the confessions wrung
from his victims were false, due only to their agony. His archbishop had Flade arrested and put on the rack himself until he admitted having
sold his soul to Satan; then he was burned. 74
Another who ran into trouble for speaking too freely was Peter the
Precentor of Paris, who said the Inquisition blackmailed rich people and falsely accused and arrested "certain honest matrons" who "refused
to consent to the lasciviousness of priests." 75 Civil magistrates who
criticized the Inquisition often found themselves in its dungeons. When
the governor of Albi defended his people against the inquisitors in 1306, letters were forged and "discovered" in church records to remove
him from office on the ground that his grandfather was a convicted
heretic. 76
Predictably, inquisitors often went in fear of their own lives, appearing in public with escorts of armed guards. Some were attend
ed by small armies of toughs whose disruptive behavior was absolved by
their masters, so they could literally get away with murder, robbery, and rape; they were "above the law." 77 Many inquisitors wore armor
under their habits and tested all their food for poison. Torquemada's
chief protege Pedro Arbues was assassinated by relatives of some of his
victims in a church in Aragon as he left his guards and went alone to
the altar to receive the sacrament. During the 19th century, Pedro Arbues was canonized as a saint by Pope Pius IX.78
Another inquisitor-saint was Peter Martyr (Piero da Verona), whose case has never been adequately explained. He was so zealous
in Lombardy as to embarrass even the church; apparently it was decided that he would be more useful dead than alive. In 1252 he was
assassinated, and within a year he was canonized the fastest creation of
a saint on record. His killers were captured but not prosecuted. One of them later became an inquisitor himself. Another entered the
Dominican order, died in old age, and was canonized as St. Acerinus;
his portrait appeared in a stall of Peter Martyr's own church in 1505. A
third conspirator was arrested and imprisoned by the Inquisition 43 years after the murder, possibly because he was beginning to talk too much. 79
Another curious case was that of the heretic who nearly became a j
saint, Armanno Pongilupo, a high-ranking official of the Catharan
sect at Ferrara in the 1 3th century. Pretending devout Catholicism,
Pongilupo secretly gave aid to imprisoned heretics. He played the part of piety so well that after his death, altars and images were dedicated i
to him; he received a magnificent tomb in the cathedral; stories were told of his miraculous cures of the sick, the lame, and the blind.
Ferrara's citizens demanded his canonization, but the church re
446



fused, ordering that his remains be exhumed and burned for his heresy. Inquisition Ferrara would not comply. The cathedral was placed under interdict and its chapter was excommunicated. Arguments about Pongilupo ^^^^^^^^^^^
dragged on for 33 years. Finally, the inquisitor Guido da Vincenza
ended the matter by having Pongilupo's bones burned, his altars
destroyed, and his heirs deprived of their property which naturally reverted to the church. Guido was rewarded with the episcopate of
Ferrara. 80
The Inquisition was not organized to administer justice; it was organized to enrich the church and silence its critics. Lea says, "All
the safeguards which human experience had shown to be necessary in judicial proceedings of the most trivial character were deliberately cast
aside in these cases, where life and reputation and property through three generations were involved. Every doubtful point was decided
'in favor of the faith'. . . . Had the proceedings been public, there might
have been some check upon this hideous system, but the Inquisition
shrouded itself in the awful mystery of secrecy until after sentence had
been awarded and it was ready to impress the multitude with the fearful solemnities of the auto da fe." 81
The Inquisition remained active until 1834, especially in Central and South America, where "heathen" natives were tortured and
burned for crimes against the true faith, such as not believing in it. 82
Mayan scribes in Central America wrote: "Before the coming of the
Spaniards, there was no robbery or violence. The Spanish invasion was
the beginning of tribute, the beginning of church dues, the beginning of strife." 83 Catholic fathers of the mission of San Francisco burned
many Indian "witches" before the tribes were sufficiently subdued to accept God's word. 84 Lea said, "An inquisitor seems to have been
regarded as a necessary portion of the missionary outfit." 85 Even in the present century, Catholic authorities have tried to
present the Inquisition in an undeservedly flattering light. Cardinal Lepicier, expressly supported by Pope Pius X, declared the church's reign of terror was right, just because the church did it. "The naked
fact that the Church, of her own authority, has tried heretics and
condemned them to be delivered to death, shows that she truly has
pie right of killing. . . . [W]ho dares to say that the Church has erred in a
blatter so grave as this?" 86
In fact, many have dared to say so. Leland wrote: "When people
believe, or make believe, in a thing so very much as to torture like
devils and put to death hundreds of thousands of fellow-beings, mostly
helpless and poor old women, not to mention many children, it secomes a matter of very serious import to all humanity to determine
:>nce for all whether the system or code according to which this was
done was absolutely right for ever, or not." 87 Anthropologist Jules Henry said, "Organized religion, which likes to fancy itself the Tiother of compassion, long ago lost its right to that claim by its
jrganized support of organized cruelty." 88 Coulton said of the
447



Inquisition Inquisition, "History affords few plainer examples of the demoralizing effects of absolute power upon fairly ordinary men." 89 And Vetter
^
wmmm pointed out that the system that created such horrors may be still
dangerous:
Have religious institutions been any more humane in the process of
consolidating their power than has secular machinery similarly occupied? The taste for slaughter exhibited by the sons ofthe Prophet was more than matched by that of Christians who liquidated heathen and
heretic. . . . The cultural backgrounds ofthe past and current generation
ofpolitical dictators provides interesting material for speculation. Mussolini, Franco, Salazar, Hitler, Peron and almost without exception the Latin-American dictators were or are Roman Catholics, at least in their
education and upbringing. And Stalin had considerable training for the priesthood ofan equally dictatorial church. Confronted with such facts one is compelled at least to ask himself what kind ofcausal sequences are
here suggested. . . . In both Islam and Christendom the naive believers have over long
periods been taught that it was their duty to slaughter the unbeliever, or whoever refused to accept their particular version ofdivine guidance. They have not had a change ofheart; they have just been shorn of the
powers for mischief. *
It is unsettling to realize that such powers for mischief could yet
be revived. The edicts that established the Inquisition have never been
repealed. They are "officially still part of the Catholic faith, and were
used as justification for certain practices as recently as 1969." 91 Julian Huxley deplored the "pestilent doctrine on which all the churches have insisted, that honest disbelief in their more or less
astonishing creeds is a moral offense . . . deserving and involving the
same future retribution as murder and robbery." In his opinion, the
worst visions of hell would seem pale beside a comprehensive vision of
Christianity's gory history.92 Such history should be remembered, on the old principle that those who cannot remember their history are
condemned to repeat it.

"Moon," the white Cow-goddess who mothered the Ionians. Hers
was another name for "Cow-Eyed" Hera, as Homer called her, al
though classic mythographers portrayed her as a separate entity, one of Zeus's many paramours. Io represented the horned, milk-giving, lunar Triple Goddess, as shown by her sacred colors. She turned
herself from white to red to black, the hues of the Virgin, Mother, and
Crone (see Gunas). 1
The apocryphal story that Hera sent a gadfly to sting Io, to send Jher wandering all over the world, was a Hellenic myth invented to
explain the universality of the worship of the white Moon-cow. Since Hera was herself the same Goddess, her alleged jealousy of Io was a
patriarchal fiction. Some said Hera placed Io under the guardianship of
hundred-eyed Argus Panoptes ("All-Eyes"), an allegory of the moon traveling under the many-eyed gaze of the starry sky. 2

Iphigeneia
'Mother of Strong Ones," high priestess of Artemis at Taurus, where all strangers were sacrificed to the Goddess and their severed heads
nailed to crosses. The myth that Iphigeneia was Agamemnon's
daughter, sacrificed to the sea by her cruel father, has been called a
result of "the mythographers' anxiety to conceal certain barbarous
traditions." ' One of Iphigeneia's other names was Hecate.

Irene, Saint
'Peace," the third of Aphrodite's three Horae; the Dove who mnounced the coming of death. She also associated with the "peace" to
)e won by ritual castration, even as late as the 14th century a.d. when
( nun or priestess bearing her name was linked to the heretical sect of
Mount Athos monks who emasculated themselves. 1 (See
pastration.) The pagan temple of Irene on the acropolis of Constantinople was aken over by Christians and renamed the Church of Holy Irene. 2

Iris
Greek Goddess of the rainbow, personifying like the Hindu Maya
the many-colored veils of the world's appearances behind which the
spirit of the Goddess worked unseen. In many mythologies she
personified the bridge between earth and heaven, the Rainbow Bridge of Norse paganism, the Necklace of Ishtar in Mesopotamia, the Road
of the Gods in Japan, the Kinvad Bridge in Persia. 1 Greeks said the rainbow symbolized the Goddess Iris, "Source of the waters from on high," mother of Love. 2 Like the part of the eye named after her, she was the Kore, Virgin, or Female Soul, a form of
the Great Shakti who was both the organ of sight and the visible
world that it saw. Her spectrum spanned all possible colors. The same
seven-color spectrum was shown on the seven-stage ziggurats of
Mesopotamia, signifying the seven planetary spheres, with a symbolic ascent to the Seventh Heaven as part of the initiatory pilgrimage. 3

Isolde Iseult
"White Lady" of Welsh romance, a pagan queen who abandoned one husband in order to take another. With Tristan, her "true-love," she became a popular heroine of the typical bardic romance of starcrossed lovers. The bards maintained that even married ladies should be
free to take lovers, as under the old pagan system. Because King
Mark of Cornwall, Iseult's jealous husband, imprisoned his wife's lover and tried to kill him, poets branded King Mark a "felon" and a "traitor." 1 See Romance.

Ishtar
Babylonian "Star," the Great Goddess who appears in the Bible as
Ashtoreth, Anath, Asherah, or Esther, the Queen of Heaven (Jeremiah 44:19). She was also the Great Whore, described in Revelation 17:5
as Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots. Another of her titles was
the Goddess Har, who called herself the compassionate prostitute. Men communed with her through the sexual rites of her harlot
priestesses.
1 See Prostitution.
Babylonian scriptures called Ishtar the Light of the World, Leader
of Hosts, Opener of the Womb, Righteous Judge, Lawgiver, Goddess
450



of Goddesses, Bestower of Strength, Framer of All Decrees, Lady of Ishtar
Victory, Forgiver of Sins, etc. 2 Much of the liturgical flattery addressed
to God in the Old Testament was plagiarized from Babylonian prayers ^^^^^^^^^^m
to Ishtar. One example:
Who dost make the green herb to spring up, mistress ofmankind! Who
hast created everything, who dost guide aright all creatures! Mother
Ishtar, whose power no god can approach! A prayer will I utter; may she
do unto me what seems good unto her O my mistress, make me to
know my deed, establish for me a place ofrest! Absolve my sins, lift up my face! 3
A Babylonian prayer that obviously prefigured the prayers and psalms of biblical writers, even the biblical theology, said to the Goddess:
"0 Thou art adorable, who givest salvation, life, and justice, vivify my name." 4 Like the Old Testament God, Ishtar was the Mighty One, winner of battles and overthrower of mountains. 5 She said:
In the brilliant heavens, to give omens in abundance, I appear, I appear in perfection. With exultation in my supremacy, with exultation do I, a
Goddess, walk supreme; Ishtar, the Goddess ofevening, am I; Ishtar, the Goddess ofmorning, am I; Ishtar, who opens the portals ofheaven, in
my supremacy. The heavens I destroy, the earth I devastate, in my
supremacy. Who rises resplendent on the firmament ofheaven, invoked above and below, in my supremacy. The mountain I sweep away
altogether, in my supremacy. The great wall ofthe mountain am I, their great foundation am I, in my supremacy. 6
A long Babylonian prayer presents numerous metaphors and
liturgical phrases later copied by Jewish priests on behalf of their god:
I beseech thee, Lady ofladies, Goddess ofgoddesses, Ishtar, queen ofall cities, leader ofall men. Thou art the light ofthe world, thou art the
light ofheaven . . . .Supreme is thy might, O Lady, exalted art thou above
all gods. Thou renderest judgment and thy decision is righteous; unto thee are subject the laws ofthe earth and the laws ofheaven, the laws of
the temple and ofthe shrine, and the laws ofthe private apartment and ofthe secret chamber. Where is the place where thy name is not, and where is the spot where thy commandments are not known? At thy name the earth and the heavens shake, and the gods they tremble; the spirits ofheaven tremble at thy name and the men hold it in awe. Thou
art great, thou art exalted; all the men ofSumer, and all creatures, and all
mankind glorify thy name. With righteousness dost thou judge the deeds ofmen, even thou; thou lookest upon the oppressed and to the
downtrodden thou bringest justice every day. How long, Queen of Heaven and Earth, how long, how long, Shepherdess ofpale-faced men,
wilt thou tarry? How long, O Queen whose feet are not weary and
whose knees make haste? How long, Lady ofHosts, Lady ofBattles? Glorious one whom all the spirits ofheaven fear, who subduest all
angry gods; mighty above all rulers, who holdest the reins ofkings. Opener ofthe womb ofall women, great is thy light. Shining light of
heaven, light ofthe world, enlightener ofall the places where men dwell, whogatherest together the hosts of the nations. Goddess ofmen,
451



Ishtar divinity of women, thy counsel passeth understanding. Where thou glancest the dead come to life, and the sick rise and walk; and the mind
^^_^^____^^_ that is distressed is healed when it looks upon thy face. How long, O Lady,
shall mine enemy triumph over me? Command, and at thy command
the angry god will turn back. Ishtar is great! Ishtar is Queen! My Lady is
exalted, my Lady is Queen. 7
Akkadian sources show that Ishtar was the same Great Goddess
revered all over the Near East under such names as Dea Syria, Astarte,
Cybele, Aphrodite, Kore, Mari, etc.:
Praise Ishtar, the most awesome of the Goddesses, revere the queen of
women, the greatest ofthe deities. She is clothed with pleasure and
love. She is laden with vitality, charm, and voluptuousness. In lips she is
sweet; life is in her mouth. At her appearance rejoicing becomes full.
She is glorious The fate ofeverything she holds in her hand. . . .
Ishtar to her greatness who can be equal? Strong, exalted, splendid are her decrees. . . . Ishtar among the gods, extraordinary is her station.
Respected is her word; it is supreme over them. She is their queen; they continually cause her commands to be executed. All of them bow down before her. 8
The powers of the underworld bowed down before her when she went underground to rescue her son-lover Tammuz, as her Sumeri
an forerunner Inanna rescued the same son-lover, Dumuzi. She said
to the seven gatekeepers: "If thou openest not the gate so that I cannot
enter, I will smash the door, I will shatter the bolt, I will smash the
doorpost, I will move the doors, I will raise up the dead, eating the living, so that the dead will outnumber the living." 9 This threat was
typical of Ishtar's dark underworld twin, Eresh-kigal, the Death-goddess who had power to deprive the heavenly gods of their sacrificial
food. 10 Ishtar's temporary departure caused sterility and suspension of sexual activities over the whole earth: "After the Lady Ishtar has
descended, the bull no longer mounts the cow, the ass no longer bends over the she-ass, and the man no longer bends over the woman in the
street: the man slept in his place, the woman slept alone." n
This Descent into Hell was a perilous but necessary part of the
sacred drama, lasting three days and culminating in the Day of Joy, when the god was restored to life. 12 This inaugurated a new year after
penitential atonement and sacrifice. "It is on New Year's Day that
Ishtar lies with Tammuz, and the king reproduces this mythical hiero
gamy by consummating the ritual union with the Goddess [i.e., with
the hierodule who represents her on earth] in a secret chamber of the
temple, where the nuptial bed of the Goddess stands." n
Gilgamesh said the Goddess was cruel to her lovers, since each in
turn personified the dying god who refreshed the earth's fertility with his blood. 14 When the god was incarnate in bulls, the animals were emasculated and their severed genitals thrown to the Goddess's
image, a rite "probably derived from the rite of self-emasculation which
had been practiced in honor of Ishtar." 15 Ishtar's priestesses apparently
452



performed some version of the rite each year in the temple of Jerusa
lem, where the virgin form of the Goddess was called Mari, Mari-Anna,
or Miriam, and her holy women annually wailed for the sacrificial death
of Tammuz (Ezekiel 8:14). See Salome; Mary Magdalene.

Isis
Egyptian scriptures said, "In the beginning there was Isis, Oldest of the Old. She was the Goddess from whom all becoming arose." ' As the
Creatress, she gave birth to the sun "when he rose upon this earth for
the first time." 2 Her title, "Giver of Life," was applied also to the queen mother of Egypt. 5
In her Roman mysteries, Isis was addressed as "the One Who is
All." Lucius's hymn to her said:
O Thou holy and eternal Savior ofthe human race. . . . Thou bestowest a mother's tender affections on the misfortunes ofunhappy mortals. . . .
Thou dispellest the storms oflife and stretchest forth thy right hand of
salvation, by which Thou unravellest even the inextricably tangled web ofFate. . . . Thou turnest the earth in its orb; Thou givest light to the sun; Thou rulest the world; Thou treadest Death underfoot. To Thee the stars are responsive; by Thee the seasons turn and the gods rejoice and the elements are in subjection. . . . lam too feeble to render Thee suffi
cient praise. . . . But, a pious though poor worshipper, 1 shall essay to do all within my power; Thy divine countenance and most holy deity I shall guard and keep forever hidden in the secret place ofmy heart. *
Another devout Roman Isis-worshipper, Apuleius, quoted her response to him, when he addressed her under several other Goddessnames:
lam Nature, the parent ofthings, the sovereign ofthe elements, the primary progeny oftime, the most exalted ofthe deities, the first of the
heavenly gods and goddesses, the queen ofthe dead, the uniform countenance; manifested alone and under one form. . . .At my will the planets ofthe sky, the wholesome winds ofthe seas, and the mournful
silences ofhell are disposed; my name, my divinity is adored throughout the world, in divers manners, in variable customs, and by many names.
For the Phrygians that are the first ofall men call me the Mother of
the gods ofPessinus; the Athenians, which are sprung from their own soil, Cecropian Minerva; the Cyprians, which are girt about by the sea, Paphian Venus; the Cretans, which bear arrows, Dictynian Diana; the Sicilians, which speak three tongues, infernal Proserpine; the Eleusinians, their ancient goddess Ceres; some Juno, others Bellona, others Hecate,
others Ramnusie . . . the Egyptians, skilled in ancient lore, worship me
with proper ceremonies, and call me by my true name, Queen Isis. s
Lucius of Patrae Author of a lost
Metamorphoses which furnished a
precedent and basic material for the
Metamorphoses of Lucius Apuleius, a devotee of Isis and
Platonic philosopher of the 2nd century a.d.

Isis Aristides also was initiated into the Mysteries of Isis, and spoke
of a mystical experience during which he saw, coming from Isis, "a
_^m^m^BB Light and other unutterable things conducing to salvation." To be
initiated into her cult brought a privileged status after death (an idea
copied later by Christians): "Isis, the 'eternal savior of the race of
men,' promises her votary: Thou shalt live in blessedness; thou shalt live glorious under my protection. And when thou hast finished thy life-course and goest down to the underworld, even there in that lower
world thou shalt see me shedding light in the gloom of Acheron and reigning in the inmost regions of Styx; thou thyself shalt inhabit the
Elysian Fields and shalt continually offer worship to me, ever
gracious.'" 6 Egyptians addressed her as "Mistress of the gods, thou bearer of
wings, thou lady of the red apparel, queen of the crowns of the South
and North, only One . . . superior to whom the gods cannot be, thou mighty one of enchantments (or, Words of Power) . . . thou who art
pre-eminent, mistress and lady of the tomb, Mother in the horizon of
heaven . . . Praise be unto thee, O Lady, who art mightier than the gods, words of adoration rise unto thee from the Eight Gods of
Hermopolis. The living souls who are in their hidden places praise
the mystery of thee, O thou who art their mother, thou source from which they sprang, who makest for them a place in the hidden Underworld, who makest sound their bones and preservest them from
terror, who makest them strong in the abode of everlastingness." Her name may have come from Ashesh, meaning both "pouring out" and
"supporting," an implication that her divine essence (blood or milk) kept the gods and all other creatures alive. 7
Isis was the Egyptian throne. Pharaohs sat on her lap, protected by her arms or wings. 8 The symbol she carried on her crown was the
mu'at, "foundation of the throne," which also represented her alter ego
Maat, the motherhood-principle called Right, Justice, Truth, or the All-seeing Eye.9 An Egyptian hymn was copied into the Bible: "Right and justice are the foundation of thy throne" (Psalms 89:14).
Hermetic texts said Isis revealed the mysteries of the stars to God, who was her son. 10 She also provided a model for Moses's miracle of
Sign of his stopping the waters, which she did quite casually on her way to Byblos; and Joshua's miracle of stopping the sun, which she did while bringing Horus back to life. 11 Since Horus was the sun Ra or Osiris in
the form of Isis's infant an interruption of his life would naturally
have caused the sun to stand still in heaven.
Isis and her dark twin sister Nephthys were Egyptian versions of
the familiar creating-and-destroying Goddess, Mother of Life and Crone of Death. Egyptians called her by many names: Mut, Hathor,
Bast, Maat, Heqit, Sekhmet, Sati, Neith, etc. Some of her destructive functions were described in the Book of the Dead:
Terrible one, lady ofthe rain-storm, destroyer ofthe souls ofmen, devourer ofthe bodies ofmen, orderer, producer, and maker of
454



slaughter . . . Hewer-in-pieces in blood, Ahibit, lady ofhair. . . . Fire-lover, pure one, lover ofslaughterings, cutter offofheads, devoted one, lady ofthe Great House . . . her name is Clother, hider ofher creations, conqueror ofhearts, swallower ofthem Knife which cutteth when
its name is uttered, slayer ofthose who approach thy flame. 12
Isis swallowed Osiris the savior and brought him back to life.
He was reincarnated as the child Horus, or else as the ithvphallic moon
god Min, or Menu, "He who impregnates his mother." n He was
annually torn to pieces and reassembled except for his lost penis. Isis
made him a new penis of clay, then gave it and him new life by
invoking her own holy names as life-giver and death-giver: "Behold, I
have found thee lying there. Weary is the great one . . . . O Osiris,
live, stand up thou unfortunate one that liest there! I am Isis. I am
Nephthys." H So Osiris stood up, and lived, and mated with his Goddess, and life went on. Osiris-Min's counterpart Adonis was similar
ly reborn from the Goddess as Priapus and was similarly associated with spring floods. 15
Some said the annual Nile flood was caused by a teardrop from
Isis's eye as she raised her lament for the dead god. The Nile festival
took place on the "Night of the Tear-Drop," unwittingly preserved by Moslems as the June festival of Lelat al-Nuktah, "Night of the
Drop." Worshippers said to the Goddess: "Thou givest life unto the flocks and herds, all the land drinks thee when thou descendest . . .
when thou comest the whole land rejoices. Thou art the bringer of food,
thou art the mighty one of meat and drink, thou art the creator of all
good things. Thou fillest the storehouses, thou heapest high with corn the granaries, and thou hast care for the poor and needy." 16
Isis was worshipped throughout the Greco-Roman world, "from Alexandria to Aries, from the outskirts of the Sahara to the isle of
Britain, from the mountains of Asturias to the mouths of the Danube." 17 Prevalence of the fairy tale "The Witch in the Stone Boat"
shows how widely Isis's cult traveled, for the "witch" was none other than she; each of her temples featured a carved stone moon-boat
containing her figure, which Christians called a witch or demoness. In
pagan times, Isis's boat had its own special holiday on the 5th of
March, the Navigium Isidis, Blessing of the Vessel of Isis. 18 Isis's cult came to Rome about 80 B.C., attained great popularity in
the reign of Vespasian, and flourished throughout the empire until it was ousted by Christianity four centuries later. The Goddess herself was
not so much ousted as absorbed. Her identification with the virgin
Mary was part of the syncretic development of the Madonna cult. Some
early Christians in Rome called themselves Pastophori, a title of
"shepherds" or "servants of Isis," which evolved intopa5tors. 19 The story of Mary's Egyptian journey with her child seems to have
been devised not only to fulfill the scripture, "Out of Egypt have I
called my son" (Matthew 2:1 5), but also to justify the extensive
identifications between Isis and Mary. One legend said Mary and
Isis
Book ofthe Dead. Common name for the
collection of
Egyptian funerary papyri written between 1500 and 1350
B.C., including Vignettes, Hymns, Chapters, and descriptive Rubrics. Among the best
preserved, and most typical, copies of the Theban Recension of the Book ofthe Dead is the muchstudied Papyrus of Ani.

Isra-EI Jesus took refuge in the holy tree at Mataria, the sycamore of Isis
Hathor, Goddess of Dendera, the Shrine of the Tree. 20 Isis was
"Destiny," and so was Mary the triple Moerae. "The tree is a symbol of destiny because it is rooted in the depths. But what is more
important is that it grows into time, ramifies its branches like a family
tree." 21 Mataria was long known as an Egyptian name of the Goddess who was also Mata-Meri, or Mari. 22
Pictures and sculptures wherein [Isis] is represented in the act ofsuckling her child Horus formed the foundation for the Christian figures and paintings ofthe Madonna and Child. Several ofthe incidents oHhe wanderings ofthe Virgin with the Child in Egypt as recorded in the
Apocryphal Gospels reflect scenes in the life ofIsis as described in the texts found on the Metternich Stele, and many ofthe attributes ofIsis,
the God-mother, the mother ofHorus, andofNeith, the goddess ofSais, are identical with those ofMary the Mother of Christ. 23
An Egyptian amulet in the British Museum shows the Goddess
seated under her holy tree, giving birth to her divine child, and holding the ankh in one hand. On the reverse is another ankh and the legend,
"One God in heaven." Some suggest that the picture might represent the birth of Buddha, but it is usually interpreted as the birth of
Christ though its original was certainly a picture of Isis. 24

Philo Judaeus (ca. 30 B.a-40 a.d.) Alexandrian
Jewish philosopher, strongly influenced by Hellenistic Platonism,
Pythagoreanism, and Stoicism; author of biblical commentaries, tracts, and histories.
Isra-EI
Philo said Isra-EI was a Jewish king in Phoenicia, who dressed his
only-begotten son Jeud in royal robes and sacrificed him as a surrogate for himself. 1 The Bible said Isra-EI was the royal name taken by
Jacob after he battled all night with a man who was God (Genesis 32)
which meant not an angel, as the story is usually interpreted, but an incumbent sacred king embodying the divinity. Jacob was the "supplanter" who next took the name of the same divinity. The suffix El
meant "a deity," male or female though Bible translators invariably
rendered it "God" and Is-Ra may have originated as an androgynous combination of Isis and Ra, or else a father-and-son combination
of Osiris and Ra. In any event, it was a god-name much older than
the story of Jacob.

Istadevata Istadevata
Patron Goddess of the Self: a Tantric name of the spiritual Shakti or ,zana8' and '"nami
individual guardian angel of the enlightened sage; corresponding to the mbb^^^^^mm Greek Psyche, Roman Anima, and other manifestations of man's "female soul."
lus Naturale
"Natural Law," Latin term for the Law of Aphrodite, or of Juno, or
of Demeter: the legal system of the ancient matriarchate. It was related
to "the Aphroditean law which permeates matter and causes it to be
fertilized. It is Aphrodite who fills the two sexes with the urge for
generation, who implants solicitude for the offspring, who forges the bond between mother and child and secures the freedom and equality
of all the progeny. All special privilege is odious to this goddess. Hence the equal right of all to the sea, the seashore, the air; and the
communis omnium possessio (common property) may be traced back to the ius naturale." ' Laws of the matriarchate were not hierarchical,
but democratic; and the authority of women was "natural" because it
was based on archetypal dependence on the moral instruction of the Mother. See Motherhood.
l.Bachofen, 189.
Ixion
"Strong Moon-man," sacred king of the Lapiths, "wielders of stone weapons." Ixion married the Sky-goddess Dia, and afterward died
spread-eagled on a fiery wheel, symbol of the sun endlessly rolling through the heavens. Hellenic myth interpreted this as punishment for a
sin against Zeus, but the original story was one of sacred-king sacrifice, related to "the burning wheels rolled downhill at European
midsummer festivities, as a sign that the sun has reached its zenith
and must now decline again." x Ixion's name was akin to axis, the same as the Hindu Akshivan who was an emanation of Shiva personifying the Axle of the World {aksha). 1 Thus Ixion was another of the gods whose death took place at
the hub of the universe, the axis mundi later assimilated to the cross
of Christ.

Izanagi and Izanami
Japanese male-female creators, representing the uterine Deep and the phallic lightning bolt supposed to have churned it into movement,
457



Jack and Jill so the primal womb went "curdlecurdle" (koworokoworo) and gave birth to solid matter. One version said the male twin, Izanagi, reached ^^^^^^^^^^_ down from heaven and stirred the Deep with his spear. 1
The pair were known as the Male Who Invites and the Female
Who Invites. Their myth told how they discovered sex and used it to
work their creation magic:
His Augustness, the Male Who Invites, inquired ofHer Augustness, the Female Who Invites, "In what manner is your body made?" She replied, "My body in its thriving grows, but there is one part that does not grow together. "And His Augustness the Male who Invites said to her:
"My body in its thriving also grows, but there is one part that grows in excess. Therefore, would it not seem proper that I should introduce the part ofmy body in excess into the part ofyour body that does not grow to
gether, and so procreate territories?"
Her Augustness the Female Who Invites said: "It would be well. " And His Augustness, the Male Who Invites, said to her: "Let us go
round this August Heavenly Pillar, I and you, and when we shall have
come together let us in august union join our august parts.
" She
agreed . . . and where they met, Her Augustness the Female Who Invites
said: "Ah! What a fair and lovely youth! Whereupon His Augustness the Male Who Invites said: "Ah! What a fair and lovely maiden!" 2
The earlier myths said Izanami gave birth to all things; but at a
later date, an imaginative revisionist took the initiative away from her.
The next installment said she was burned to death while giving birth to Fire; then she went into the underworld and became a Tiamat-like
sea monster. Izanagi followed her, but she couldn't return to the upper world with him because she had eaten underworld fruit (the same
theme familiar in Greek myths of Persephone and Eurydice).
Izanagi fled, horrified at his female twin's changed appearance. She pursued him with an army of storm-demons, whom he foiled by
throwing them peaches, the yonic fruit of life, which they couldn't resist
stopping to pick up. Then Izanagi performed magical purifications and developed the ability to give birth to beings. Amaterasu the sun
goddess was born from his left eye, a moon god from his right eye, and the dragon-slaying hero Susa-no-wo from his nose. The former
Creatress Izanami, left behind in the underworld, also gave birth to
more deities but they were all evil spirits.

Jack and Jill
Heavenly Twins of Norse mythology, originally Hjuki and Bil, a boy and girl taken "up the hill" to heaven by their Moon-mother Mana.
They drew the Water of Life "from the well Byrgir, in the bucket
Soegr, suspended from the pole Simul, which they bore on their shoulders." Hjuki was derived from jakka, to assemble, to increase; Bil from bila, to break up or dissolve. Thus the twins signified forces of
458



creation and destruction. 1 It was said their faces could be seen forever Jael
in the markings on the moon. Bil's voice could be heard in the singing Jahi the Whore
wind, and Hjuki sends moonlight to help night-bound skiers find their ^^^^^^^^^^^
way down safely to valley towns. 2 An event reported in 1633 suggests that an esoteric meaning of the
Jack and Jill myth might have been embedded in a ritual recognized
as heresy. A 20-year-old girl named Mary Spencer was convicted of witchcraft because "on her way to the well for water, she often rolled
her pail down the hill, running before it and in fun calling it to follow
her." 3 That such apparently trivial actions invited serious charges,
even death sentences, suggests that they must have been understood in some way other than mere play.

primal Goddess Jahi, adopted by tribal queens of the preatriarchal period. Jael sacrificed Sisera in a strange way, nailing his

Persian patriarchal epithet for the Great Mother who brought forth,

icriptures said Jahi brought menstruation into the world, for she men
itruated for the first time after mating with her serpent. Hence she
personified the moon, which was everywhere supposed to be the >riginal source of menstruation. Jahi also brought sex into the world
>y seducing the first man in the primal garden. Jewish patriarchs >robably derived their notions of the sinfulness of women (by virtue

were "whores" because they were descendants of Jahi.

Jains
James of Compostela
Oddly enough, some of the earliest forms of the name of the Jewish God seem to have been masculinized versions of the name of
Jahi. Variations included Jahu, Jah, Yahu, Yahweh, Iau, Jaho. Some
myths indicate that this God like Ahriman once had a serpent form
and may have played the part of the Great Mother's serpent.
Jains
Ascetic sect of Buddhist hermit-yogis who attempted to develop magical and miraculous powers by severe self-denial. The founder of
Jainism (ca. 6th century B.C.) was Jina, also called Mahavira (Great Hero, or Great Man). He had the usual virgin mother, Devananda, the "Blessed Goddess." * He performed the usual miracles. He walked on water, healed the sick, turned water into wine, exorcised demons, made
the blind see, etc. These powers were supposed to have come to him
because he renounced all sensual pleasures and retired to a life of
constant meditation in a forest hermitage. From the time of Alexander the Great, Jain monks traveled
westward to impress and influence Persians, Jewish Essenes, and
later, Christians. See Asceticism.

The scallop remained the emblem
of St. James although it was hardly suitable for
a male saint. Scallop was derived from the
Norse skalpr, "a sheath."' The same word in Latin was vulva* Medieval artists knew the scallop was a kteis and a symbol of the Goddess. Botticelli's famous Venus was born from the same kteis.
Jambu Island
Land of the Rose-Apple Tree, a Tantric paradise likened to the
body of a maternal Shakti, identical with western pagan images of the
Blessed Isles in the west, or Fairyland, or the original Eden with its
apple-bearing Tree of Life. The shape of Jambu Island is like a yoni, t Chariot or Throne of Shiva. In its center is the Diamond Seat
(vajrasana) or clitoris, where the Way of Awakening is demonstrated to
the sexually and spiritually enlightened. 1 l.Tatz&Kent,84.
James of Compostela, Saint
Compostela on the northwestern corner of Spain was one of the most
popular pilgrimage centers of pre-Christian times, later assimilated to
Christianity via the rather silly legend that the dead apostle James miraculously journeyed there by floating, all alone, in a stone coffin. The legend was first heard in the 7th century a.d., when the church took over the Compostelan shrine from the Brigantine Sea
goddess, Brigit. The sanctuary was formerly named Brigantium. 1 The Goddess's symbol, a kteis or vulva in the form of a scallop shell or
cowrie, was adopted by the cult of the new saint. 2

because Compostela brings in a great deal of money annually from the faithful, most Catholic scholars now agree that St. James was and is
entirely spurious. 5

janua Coeli
'Gate of Heaven," title of the sanctuary screen in Christian
hurches, derived from the yonic "gate" of Juno (Uni, or yoni) veiled y the hymen in the Goddess's own temples. As a personification of the Gate, Juno had two faces looking in both directions the outward
passage of the Gate at birth, the reverse passage at death. At her
Festival in early January she was addressed as Antevorta and Postvorta,
the Goddess Who Looks Forward and Backward, for January was the
(gate"
of the year, when the god of the Aeon died and was reborn from lotherTime. 1
As Roman religion became more patriarchal, Juno's gate-keeping persona became an androgynous Janua-Janus, later was wholly masculinized as the two-faced god Janus to whom all gateways were sacred.
We was another form of the Petra, Pater, or Peter, keeper of the keys :o the Goddess's "Pearly Gate."
The Christian version of the janua coeli depicted heaven on one
;ide, hell on the other. The "wrong" or "death" side of the Gate
became known as janua diaboli, "the gate by which the Devil enters."
Since the whole image was that of a yoni to begin with, it was almost
nevitable that Christian fathers used janua diaboli as a common
synonym for "woman." 2
1. Graves, W.G., 184. 2. J.B. Russell, 283.
januarius, Saint Canonized version of the Roman god of gateways, Janus of the two
pees. His old shrine at Naples was converted into a saint's church,
vhere a bottle of dried blood was reverently preserved and said to be he blood of the saint. This blood would turn liquid when placed beside
he skull of a genuine martyr. Pope Pius II himself "infallibly" I ttested to the reality of this miracle. 1
Naturally there was no real St. Januarius; he was only another form
if Peter, the "Petra" who guarded the heavenly gate (see Peter,
laint). As guardian of door and gateways he became the janitor
neaning "doorkeeper" of heaven. 2 1. Brewster, 415. 2. Dumezil, 328.

jar-Bearer Jar-Bearer
A mysterious man bearing a vessel of water preceded Jesus on his
mmmmmmmmmKmm triumphal promenade to the house of the Last Supper (Luke 22:10).
The meaning of this detail is revealed by the Babylonian cult of the
savior-god Nabu, or Nebo, who also promenaded to the sacred drama of his immolation in the Goddess's grove on the third day of the month
of Iyyar, when priests consecrated the god's nuptial couch, and "the god
will enter the bedchamber (or tomb). On the fourth day will take
place the return of Nabu." The man representing the god was always
preceded by a jar-bearer, carrying the vessel of water that stood for the god's seminal spirit, the medium of his union with the dread
Goddess. 1 In Egypt, the jar was the menat or moon-charm, represented in hieroglyphics as fluid pouring from a narrow phallic vessel into a
wider, female pot or vase. As early as the 6th dynasty, the menat
signified the restoration of sexual capacities after rebirth. 2 Unlike
Christians, who denied sexual activity in heaven (Matthew 22:30, Mark
12:25, Luke 20:35), Egyptians believed there could be no heavenly bliss without sex. Even the Savior Osiris, reborn as "impregnator of his
Mother," followed the menat to his love-death. It was water in a
"male vessel," the phallic jar.
3
Both Osiris and Isis were represented by vessels of water, to merge
in their mating as completely as two waters in a single jar. The concept was the same as the Tantric image of sexual union blessed by
the god of love: a merging of bliss and the void, "like the pouring of
water into water." 4
Similar imagery underlay creation myths like that of Ashurbani
pal's Twelve Tablets, where the male celestial sea Apsu rained down
fructifying waters into the sea-womb of Mother Tiamat, the nether sea. 5
Because the ancients thought rain a kind of celestial semen, mytho
logical heavenly fathers tended to be rain gods (e.g., Jupiter Pluvius). Since they weren't sure whether this fertile fluid from heaven should
be called semen or urine, the heavenly father sometimes made "golden
rain," like the urine with which Zeus impregnated Danae, the Earth.6 Uranus or "Father Heaven" was an archaic producer of
fertilizing urine. In India the spirit of love is still represented by a jar of water
serving "in the place of a sacred image. The water is regarded, for the
period of the worship, as a residence or seat (pitha) of the god." 7 The
Sanskrit word pitha recalls the Greek pithos or jar signifying rebirth in Demeter's Eleusinian Mysteries, when she was Mistress of Earth and Sea and absorbed the substance of gods. 8
Mysteries of the Cabiri in Phrygia and Samothrace worshipped Demeter Cabiria in conjunction with the Young God (Ganymede,
Dionysus, or Cabirius) in the form of a male jar-bearer, shown pouring water into a maternal Pot, Vase, Cauldron, or Grail. He was the
universal ephebe; the larger vessel was the universal mother.9 Similar
462



I mysteries of the two vessels were dramatized throughout the Middle
j East, so the jar-bearer became the symbol of any dying savior-god enroute to his Fate.

Jehovah Jesus ben Pandera
Jehovah
Name of God, artificially constructed from the vowels oiAdonai, "the Lord," with the Hebrew consonants JHVH, yod-he-vau-he, the
Tetragrammaton. At first the artificial construct was used to avoid
speaking the "real" name of God, which carried a curse. Actually there
were many variations of the name, in many Semitic dialects: Yahu,
Jah, Jeud, leu, Yahweh, Jahveh, Yaho, Iao. 1 Another variation was Jesus, a Latin form of Yeshua, Joshua, or Jeud. (See Yahweh.)
1. Albright, 262.
Jesus ben Pandera
Celsus and the Talmudic tradition mentioned Jesus, son of Pandera
or Panthera, begotten by a Roman soldier on a Jewish prostitute, I Miriam of Magdala (Mary Magdalene), whose husband was a car
penter. 1 The word for carpenter, najjar, was applied to a sacred brotherhood, the Nazarites or Nazorenes, who supported themselves
by woodworking. 2 Jesus ben Pandera was called a najjar, a holy man. He
|
worked miracles, healed the sick, foretold the world's end. 3 Eventual
ly he was executed, perhaps by hanging, through his own wish. Some said this ben Pandera or Bar-Panther was the grandfather of
the Virgin Mary. 4 Other Christian authorities, like Epiphanius, said he was the paternal grandfather of the Christian Jesus which, obviously, contradicted the Virgin Birth myth. "Son of Pandera" was a title
so firmly attached to Jesus that many Christian writers accepted it and tried to explain it. The name of Pandera as Jesus's father is traceable
I back to the time of the Gospels and has "an equal claim to reliability." 5
Later Christians said the name was used by the Jews to discredit their savior by calling him a whore's son who was executed as a criminal. The "whore" called Miriam of Magdala seems to have been a
sacred hierodule or Virgin Bride of God, dedicated to the temple
{magdala). Since the oldest traditions associated Mary Magdalene with
the Holy Vase that represented Pandora, the Great Goddess entitled
"All-Giver," some suggest that Pandera was a corrupt form of this title.6 Another theory said Jesus ben Pandera really meant Jesus, son of the
Virgin (Parthenos), the latter being the usual title of a temple hierodule. 7 Or again, Pan-Thera could have meant Dionysus the son of
Pan, whose totem animal was a panther, or "all-beast." Jesus was
var. Panthera
463



Jesus Christ assimilated to the Dionysian savior. The story of his miracle at Cana
was directly modeled on a Dionysian rite of sacred marriage celebrated
at Sidon; even the Gospels' wording was copied from the festival of the older god. 8
These few garbled hints of Jesus's pagan background may have been greatly clarified by the hundreds of diverse Gospels extant in the
first few centuries a.d., had not the early church seen fit to destroy them
all. 9

Other versions of the name were Jaho, Iao, or Ieuw, sometimes titles of Zeus-Sabazius as the nocturnal sun and Lord of Death in the underworld. 7 The same god was
Sabaoth, the Jews' "Lord of Hosts." The Latin name for this Heavenly Father came from the same root: Iu-piter, Father leu. 8
Book of Enoch
Consisting of three extant books and a
lost fourth, the Enochian works were written probably between the Maccabean age and the first century B.C. The chief subject is the coming world's end
and the reappearance of the Messianic Son of Man, who resembles
the predicted final avatar of Buddha
appearing before doomsday.
Jesus Christ
The Jesus who was called Christos, "Anointed," took his title from Middle-Eastern savior-gods like Adonis and Tammuz, born of the
Virgin Sea-goddess Aphrodite-Maria (Myrrha), or Ishtar-Mari (Hebrew Mariamne). Earlier biblical versions of the same hero were Joshua
son of Nun (Exodus 33:11), Jehu son of Nimshi, whom Elijah anointed as a sacred king (1 Kings 19:16), and Yeshua son of Marah.
The Book of Enoch said in the 2nd century B.C. that Yeshua or Jesus
was the secret name given by God to the Son of Man (a Persian title), and that it meant "Yahweh saves." '
In northern Israel the name was written leu. 2 It was the same as
Ieud or Jeud, the "only-begotten son" dressed in royal robes and sacrificed by the god-king Isra-El. 3 Greek versions of the name were
Iasion, Jason, or Iasus the name of one of Demeter's sacrificed
consorts, killed by Father Zeus after the fertility rite that coupled him
with his Mother. 4 Iasus signified a healer or Therapeuta, as the
Greeks called the Essenes, whose cult groups always included a man
with the title of Christos. 5 The literal meaning of the name was
"healing moon-man," fitting the Hebrew version of Jesus as a son of Mary, the almah or "moon-maiden." 6 (See Virgin Birth.)
It seems Jesus was not one person but a composite of many. He played the role of sacred king of the Jews who periodically died in an
atonement ceremony as surrogate for the real king. "The Semitic
religions practiced human immolations longer than any other reli
gion, sacrificing children and grown men in order to please sanguinary
gods. In spite of Hadrian's prohibition of those murderous offerings, they were maintained in certain clandestine rites." 9 The priesthood of
the Jewish God insisted that "one man should die for the people . . . that the whole nation perish not" (John 1 1:50). Yahweh forgave no sins without bloodshed: "without shedding blood is no remission" (He
brews 9:22). Middle-Eastern traditions presented a long line of slain and canni
balized Saviors extending back to prehistory. At first kings, they became
king-surrogates or "sacred" kings as the power of real monarchies
464



developed. The Gospels' Jesus was certainly not the first of them, Jesus Christ though he may have been one of the last. One passage hints at a
holy man's understandable fear of such brief, doomed eminence: ^^^^^^^^
"When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him
by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone" (John 6:15).
This Jesus seems to have made little or no impression on his
contemporaries. No literate person of his own time mentioned him in
any known writing. The Gospels were not written in his own time, nor were they written by anyone who ever saw him in the flesh. The names of the apostles attached to these books were fraudulent. The books were composed after the establishment of the church, some as
late as the 2nd century a.d. or later, according to the church's require
ments for a manufactured tradition. 10 Most scholars believe the
earliest book of the New Testament was 1 Thessalonians, written
perhaps 5 1 a.d. by Paul, who never saw Jesus in person and knew no
details of his life story. 11
The details were accumulated through later adoption of the myths
attached to every savior-god throughout the Roman empire. Like Adonis, Jesus was born of a consecrated temple maiden in the sacred cave of Bethlehem, "The House of Bread." 12 He was eaten in the
form of bread, as were Adonis, Osiris, Dionysus, and others; he called
himself the bread of God (John 6:33). Like worshippers of Osiris, those of Jesus made him part of themselves by eating him, so as to
participate in his resurrection: "He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh
my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him" (John 6:56).
Like Attis, Jesus was sacrificed at the spring equinox and rose again from the dead on the third day, when he became God and ascended
to heaven. Like Orpheus and Heracles, he "harrowed hell" and brought
a secret of eternal life, promising to draw all men with him up to glory (John 12:32). Like Mithra and all the other solar gods, he celebrated a
birthday nine months later at the winter solstice, because the day of
his death was also the day of his cyclic re-conception. See Attis.
From the elder gods, Jesus acquired not only his title of Christos
but all his other titles as well. Osiris and Tammuz were called Good
Shepherd. Sarapis was Lord of Death and King of Glory. Mithra and Heracles were Light of the World, Sun of Righteousness, Helios the Rising Sun. Dionysus was King of Kings, God of Gods. Hermes was the Enlightened One and the Logos. Vishnu and Mithra were Son of Man and Messiah. Adonis was the Lord and the Bridegroom. Mot
Aleyin was the Lamb of God. "Savior" (Soter) was applied to all of them.
Mystery cults everywhere taught that ordinary men could be possessed by the spirits of such gods, and identified with them as
"sons" or alter egos, as Jesus was. It was the commonly accepted way to
acquire supernatural powers, as shown by some of the charms used by magicians: "Whatever I say must happen For I have taken to

Jesus Christ

century a.d., who wrote at length on the subjects of medicine,
agriculture, philosophy, jurisprudence, and religion.
myself the power of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and of the great goddemon Iao Ablanathanalba ... for 1 am the Son, I surpass the limit. . . . I am he who is in the seven heavens, who standeth in the seven
sanctuaries; for I am the son of the living God. ... I have been united
with thy sacred form. I have been empowered by thy sacred name. I
have received the effluence of goodness, Lord, God of gods, King,
Demon . . . having attained that nature equal to the God's." n
The skeptical Celsus noted that beggars and vagabonds throughout the Empire were pretending to work miracles and become gods,
throwing fits, prophesying the end of the world, and aspiring to the status of saviors:
Each has the convenient and customary spiel, "I am the god,
" or "a son of
God, " or "a divine spirit,
" and "I have come. For the world is about to
be destroyed, and you, men, because ofyour injustice, will go (with it). But I wish to save, and you shall see me again coming back with
heavenly power. Blessed is he who worships me now! On all others, both cities and countrysides, I shall cast eternal fire. And men who (now)
ignore their punishments shall repent in vain and groan, but those who
believed in me I shall preserve immortal. " M
Of course this "conspicuously false" doctrine was the central
message of the Gospels too. Persian eschatology passing through a Jewish-Essenic filter predicted "the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory" (Luke 9:27, 21:27). Jesus promised the end of the world in his own generation. The rest of the Gospel material
was largely devoted to the miracles supposed to demonstrate his divine
power, since religions generally "adduce revelations, apparitions,
prophecies, miracles, prodigies and sacred mysteries that they may get themselves valued and accepted." 1S Even these miracles were deriva
tive. Turning water into wine at Cana was copied from a Dionysian
ritual practiced at Sidon and other places. 16 In Alexandria the same
Dionysian miracle was regularly shown before crowds of the faithful,
assisted by an ingenious system of vessels and siphons, invented by a
clever engineer named Heron. 17 Many centuries earlier, priestesses at Nineveh cured the blind with spittle, and the story was repeated of
many different gods and their incarnations. 18 Demeter of Eleusis
multiplied loaves and fishes in her role of Mistress of Earth and Sea.
Healing the sick, raising the dead, casting out devils, handling poisonous serpents (Mark 16:18), etc., were so commonplace that Celsus scorned these "Christian" miracles as "nothing more than the common
works of those enchanters who, for a few oboli, will perform greater
deeds in the midst of the Forum. . . . The magicians of Egypt cast out
evil spirits, cure diseases by a breath, and so influence some uncul
tured men, that they produce in them whatever sights and sounds they please. But because they do such things shall we consider them the sons of God?" 19
Magicians often claimed that their prayers could bring flocks of
supernatural beings to their assistance. 20 Thus Jesus declared that his
466



1
prayer could summon twelve legions (72,000) of guardian angels (Matthew 26:53). Magicians also communed with their followers by the standard mystery-cult sacrament of bread-flesh and wine-blood. In
I texts on magic, "a magician-god gives his own body and blood to a recipient who, by eating it, will be united with him in love." 21 The ability to walk on water was claimed by Far-Eastern holy men
J
ever since Buddhist monks praised it as the mark of the true ascetic. 22
j
The Magic Papyri said almost anyone could walk on water with the
I help of "a powerful demon." 23 Impossibilities have always been the props of religious credulity, as Tertullian admitted: "It is believable
because it is absurd; it is certain because it is impossible." 24
However, repetitive miracles were not so believable as original
ones. Therefore early Christians insisted that all the older deities and
their miracle-tales were invented by the devil, out of his foreknowledge
of the true religion, so the faithful would be confused by past
"imitations." 25 Pagan thinkers countered with the observation that
"The Christian religion contains nothing but what Christians hold in
common with heathens; nothing new, nor truly great." Even St. Augustine, finding the hypothesis of the devil's inventions hard to swallow, admitted that "the true religion" was known to the ancients, and had
existed from the beginning of time, but it began to be called Christian after "Christ came in the flesh." 26
Nevertheless, adherents of the true religion violently disagreed as to the circumstances of its foundation. In the first few centuries a.d.
there were many mutually hostile Christian sects, and many mutually
contradictory Gospels. As late as 450, Bishop Theodore of Cyrrhus said there were at least 200 different Gospels revered by the churches of
his own diocese, until he destroyed all but the canonical four. 27 The
other Gospels were lost as stronger sects overwhelmed the weaker, wrecked their churches, and burned their books. 28
One scripture, later thrown out of the canon, said Jesus was not
crucified. Simon of Cyrene suffered on the cross in his place, while
Jesus stood by laughing at the executioners, saying, "It was another . . . who drank the gall and vinegar; it was not I ... it was another,
Simon, who bore the cross on his shoulder. It was another upon whom
they placed the crown of thorns. But I was rejoicing in the height. . . .
And I was laughing at their ignorance." 29 Believers in this scripture
were persecuted and forced to sign an abjuration reading: "I anathematize those who say that Our Lord suffered only in appearance, and that there was a man on the cross and another at a distance who
laughed." 30 Some Christians interpreted Jesus's noli me tangere ("Touch me not") to mean he came back from death as an incorporeal spirit, after the manner of other apotheosized heroes, such as the Irish hero
Laegaire, who also told his people not to touch him. 31 Later, an
unknown Gospel writer inserted the story of doubting Thomas, who
insisted on touching Jesus. This was to combat the heretical idea that

Jesus Christ there was no resurrection in the flesh, and also to subordinate Jerusa
lem's municipal god Tammuz (Thomas) to the new savior (see
^
m ^^^ Thomas, Saint). Actually, the most likely source of primary Christian
mythology was the Tammuz cult in Jerusalem. Like Tammuz, Jesus was the Bridegroom of the Daughter of Zion (John 12:1 5). Therefore
his bride was Anath, "Virgin Wisdom Dwelling in Zion," who was also the Mother of God. 32 Her dove descended on him at his baptism,
signifying (in the old religion) that she chose him for the love-death.
Anath broke her bridegroom's reed scepter, scourged him and pierced him for fructifying blood. She pronounced his death curse, Maranatha (1 Corinthians 16:22). As the Gospels said of Jesus, Anath's
bridegroom was "forsaken" by El, his heavenly father. 35 Jesus's cry to El, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" seems to have
been a line written for the second act of the sacred drama, the pathos
or Passion (Mark 15:34). Of course this Passion was originally a sexual one. Jesus's last
words "It is consummated" (consummatum est) were interpreted as a
sign that his work was finished, but could equally apply to his marriage
(John 19:30). As a cross or pillar represented the divine phallus, so a temple represented the body of the Goddess, whose "veil" (hymen) was "rent in the midst" as Jesus passed into death (Luke 23:45). As usual
when the god disappeared into the underworld, the sun was eclipsed (Luke 23:44). In their ignorance of astronomical phenonema, Christians claimed that the moon was full at the same time Easter is still a
full-moon festival though an eclipse of the sun can only occur at
the dark of the moon. 34 The full moon really meant impregnation of the Goddess.
The parting of Jesus's garment recalls the unwrapping of Osiris when he emerged from the tomb as the ithyphallic Min, "Husband
of his Mother." If Jesus was one with his heavenly father, then he also
married his mother and begot himself. A 4th-century scripture said in
the underworld he confronted his mother as Death, Mu} s She was also
the Bride disguised as Venus, the evening star, presiding over the death of the sun. Jews still recall her in a ritual greeting to the evening
star, "Come, O friend, let us welcome the Bride." 36
Like pagans, early Christians identified the Bride with the Mother.
They said Jesus "consummated on the cross" his union with Mary
Ecclesia, his bride the church. Augustine wrote: "Like a bridegroom
Christ went forth from his chamber, he went out with a presage of his
nuptials. ... He came to the marriage bed of the cross, and there, in
mounting it, he consummated his marriage . . . , he lovingly gave himself up to the torment in place of his bride, and he joined himself to
the woman for ever." 37 John 19:41 says, "In the place where he was
crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid." A garden was the conventional
symbol for the body of the mother/bride; and a new tomb was the virgin womb, whence the god would be born again. On the third day, Jesus
468



rose from the tomb/womb like Attis, whose resurrection was the Hilaria, Jesus Christ or Day of Joy. 38 Jesus's resurrection day was named after Eostre, the same Goddess as Astarte, whom the Syrians called Mother Mari. 39 ^ -^_^__^__
Three incarnations of Mari, or Mary, stood at the foot of Jesus's i cross, like the Moerae of Greece. One was his virgin mother. The
second was his "dearly beloved" (see Mary Magdalene). The third
Mary must have represented the Crone (the fatal Moera), so the tableau resembled that of the three Norns at the foot of Odin's sacrificial
tree. The Fates were present at the sacrifices decreed by Heavenly
Fathers, whose victims hung on trees or pillars "between heaven and I earth." Up to Hadrian's time, victims offered to Zeus at Salamis were
I anointed with sacred ointments thus becoming "Anointed Ones" or
"Christs" then hung up and stabbed through the side with a
spear. 40 Nothing in Jesus's myth occurred at random; every detail was part of a formal sacrificial tradition, even to the "procession of palms"
which glorified sacred kings in ancient Babylon.41 Far-Eastern traditions were utilized too. The Roman empire was
well aware of the teachings and myths of Buddhism. Buddha images
in classic Greek style were made in Pakistan and Afghanistan in the first
century a.d. 42 Buddhist ideas like the "footprints of Buddha" ap
peared among Christians. Bishop Sulpicius of Jerusalem reported that, as in India, "In the dust where Christ trod the marks of His step can
|
still be seen, and the earth still bears the print of His feet." 43 Buddhist
metaphors and phrasing also appeared in the Gospels. Jesus's formula, "Dearly Beloved," was the conventional way for Tantric deities to
address their teachings to Devi, their Goddess. 44
Scholars' efforts to eliminate paganism from the Gospels in order
to find a historical Jesus have proved as hopeless as searching for a
core in an onion. 45 Like a mirage, the Jesus figure looks clear at a
distance but lacks approachable solidity. "His" sayings and parables came from elsewhere; "his" miracles were old twice-told tales. Even the
Lord's Prayer was a collection of sayings from the Talmud, many
derived from earlier Egyptian prayers to Osiris. 46 The Sermon on the
Mount, sometimes said to contain the essence of Christianity, had no
original material; it was made up of fragments from Psalms, Ecclesiastes, Isaiah, Secrets of Enoch, and the Shemone Esreh. 47 Moreover, it was
unknown to the author of the oldest Gospel, pseudo-Mark. 48
The discovery that the Gospels were forged, centuries later than
the events they described, is still not widely known even though the
Catholic Encyclopedia admits, "The idea of a complete and clear-cut canon of the New Testament existing from the beginning . . . has no
foundation in history." No extant manuscript can be dated earlier than
the 4th century a.d.; most were written even later.49 The oldest
manuscripts contradict one another, as also do even the present canon
of synoptic Gospels. The church owed its canon to the Gnostic teacher Marcion, who
first collected Pauline epistles about the middle of the 2nd century.

Julius Wellhausen
(1844-1918) German Old Testament scholar, a leader of the "higher criticism" movement.
Later he was excommunicated as a heretic because he denied that the
scriptures were mystical allegories full of magic words of power. The epistles he collected were already over a century old, if indeed they were written by Paul; much of their material was made up of forged
interpolations. 50 The most "historical" figure in the Gospels was Pontius Pilate, to
whom Jesus was presented as "king" of the Jews and simultaneously as a criminal deserving the death penalty for "blasphemy" because he
called himself Christ, Son of the Blessed (Luke 23:3; Mark 14:6164). This alleged crime was no real crime. Eastern provinces swarmed
with self-styled Christs and Messiahs, calling themselves Sons of God and announcing the end of the world. None of them was executed for
"blasphemy." 51 The beginning of the story probably lay in the tradition of sacred-king sacrifice in Jerusalem long before Pilate's admin
istration, when Rome was trying to discourage such barbarisms.
From 103 to 76 B.C., Jerusalem was governed by Alexander Janneaus, called the Aeon, who defended his throne by fighting
challengers. One year, on the Day of Atonement, his people attacked him at the altar, waving palm branches to signify that he should die
for the earth's fertility. Alexander declined the honor and instituted a
persecution of his own subjects. Another king of Jerusalem took the name of Menelaus, "Moon-king," and practiced the rite of sacred marriage in the temple. 52 Herod also made a sacred marriage, and
had John the Baptist slain as a surrogate for himself.
If there was a Jesus cult in Jerusalem after 30 a.d., it completely
disappeared forty years later when Titus conquered the city and outlawed many local customs, including human sacrifice. Jerusalem was wholly Romanized under Hadrian. It was newly named Aelia Capitolina and rededicated to the Goddess. The temple became a shrine of
Venus. 53 Tacitus described the siege of Jerusalem, but his writing is
abruptly cut off at the moment when Roman forces entered the city as
if the final chapters were deliberately destroyed so no one knows what the Romans found there. However, Romans did express disap
proval of the Jews' or Christians' cannibalistic sacraments. Porphyry
called it "absurd beyond all absurdity, and bestial beyond every sort of
bestiality, that a man should taste human flesh and drink the blood of
men of his own genus and species, and by doing should have eternal
life." 54
From the Christians' viewpoint, a real historical Jesus was essential
to the basic premise of the faith: the possibility of immortality through identification with his own death and resurrection. Wellhausen rightly
said Jesus would have no place in history unless he died and returned
exactly as the Gospels said. 55 "If Christ hath not been raised, your faith
is vain" (1 Corinthians 15:17). Still, despite centuries of research, no historical Jesus has come to light. It seems his story was not merely
overlaid with myth; it was mythic to the core.
Like all myths, it revealed much about the collective psychology
that created it. In earlier pagan religions, the Mother and Son
470



periodically ousted the Father from his heavenly throne. The divine son Jesus Christ
bf Christianity no longer challenged the heavenly king, but tamely submitted to his fatal command: "Not my will, but thine, be done" ^^^^^^^^^^
([Luke 22:42). Some early sects said the Father who demanded his kon's blood was cruel, even demonic. 56 These were suppressed, but
Scholars have discerned in Christianity "an original attitude of hostil
ity toward the father figure, which was changed in the first two Christian penturies into an attitude of passive masochistic docility." 57
If orthodox Christianity demanded subordination of the Son, it was feven more determined to subordinate the Mother. The Gospels'
jlesus showed little respect for his mother, which troubled the church in
Its Renaissance efforts to attract women to the cult of Mary. "Any
hero who speaks to his mother only twice, and on both occasions
Addresses her as 'Woman,' is a difficult figure for the sentimental
biographers." 58 Together with Jesus's avowed opposition to marriage ind the family (Matthew 22:30; Luke 14:26), women's primary
concerns, New Testament sexism tended to disgust educated women of
[he pagan world. But the Jesus who emulated Buddha in advocating poverty and
humility eventually became the mythic figurehead for one of the
world's pre-eminent money-making organizations. The cynical Pope
Leo X exclaimed, "What profit has not that fable of Christ brought
Is!" 59
Modern theologians tend to sidestep the question of whether Jesus (vas in fact a fable or a real person. In view of the complete dearth of
hard evidence, and the dubious nature of the soft evidence, it seems
Christianity is based on the ubiquitous social phenomena of credulity:
An idea is able to gain and retain the aura ofessentia] truth through telling and retelling. This process endows a cherished notion with more
veracity than a library offacts. . . . [DJocumentation plays only a small role in contrast to the act ofre-confirmation by each generation ofscholars. In addition, the further removed one gets from the period in question, the greater is the strength of the conviction. Initial incredulousness is soon
converted into beliefin a probability and eventually smug assurance. 60

l.Rawson, E.A.,151.
Jews, Persecution of
Illogically, Christians justified persecutions of Jews by calling them
"Christ-killers," though their own theology said God had decreed Christ's death; therefore the Jews only obeyed the will of God.
Gospel passages interpolated after the church's rise to power in Rome absolved Pilate of guilt because he represented the Holy City. The Jews were condemned by the ancient liturgical phrase copied into the
Gospel, which used to invoke the fertilizing power of a god's blood
but was later interpreted as an acceptance of blood guilt: "His blood be
on us, and on our children" (Matthew 27:23-25). This pious forgery became the foundation for centuries of persecu
tions, culminating even in the present century with the extermination of millions of Jews under the Nazi regime, the latest in a two-thousand
year history of pogroms. Up to the middle of the 14th century the free city of Cologne remained a haven for Jewish merchants, weavers' guilds, and other commercial enterprises, resisting domination by the church. Then Catholic forces moved in; Jewish merchants were burned alive in
their houses with their wives and children; those who escaped the immolation were banished. Their property remained in Christian
hands, with 50 percent going to the victorious archbishop. 1 The great plagues of the 14th century were usually attributed to
the Jews, said to cause the pestilence by poisoning wells and streams with a combination of holy wafers stolen from the churches and the
menstrual blood of Jewish women. Each wave of plague brought a wave of massacre of Jewish communities. In 1382, rioters looted and
vandalized the Jewish quarter in Paris. 2 In 1 391 , the Archdeacon of
Seville instigated a "Holy War against the Jews." Mobs stormed the ghetto, tore down synagogues, and murdered an estimated 41,000 persons. 5 Twelve thousand Jews perished in Bavaria at the time of the ]
Black Death; two thousand were burned at Strasbourg for causing the '
472



plague of 1 348; at Chinon an immense trench was dug and filled with Jews, Persecution of
blazing wood to burn 160 Jews in a single day. 4 The church encouraged persecution of Jews to divert attention ^^^^^^^^^^^
from the developing idea that these terrible plagues, which killed
about half of Europe's population before the end of the century, were caused by a malicious God. The pope himself referred in a bull to
"the pestilence with which God is afflicting the Christian people." The horrors of the plague revived Gnostic opinions of the evil Jehovah.
One professor wrote: "The hostility of God is stronger than the hostility of man." 5
The real cause of the plagues was the Christian commerce with
the Holy Land. Crusaders' ships carried millions of Oriental black
rats, with their fleas, the true carriers of the plague bacillus. 6 Being
ignorant of this, Christian authorities made no effort to control the
rats but tried to exterminate Jews instead. Jew-killing probably served to
Ivent some of the popular resentment of clergymen, who behaved
padly during the plagues. Most deserted their flocks in haste to leave
plague-stricken areas. Churchmen generally were accused of "panic
fear and neglect." 7 Persecutions were supported by many made-to-order myths. In [Spain, the popular myth of the ritual murder was combined with the
jmyth of plague-magic to give Torquemada his excuse to expel the Jews from the country in 1490 and take their property for the enrichment
pf the church. Some Jews were arrested and tortured until they
confessed having stolen a consecrated host and kidnapped a four
vear-old boy called Santo Nino (Holy Child) from the doorway of a
church. They gave the child five thousand lashes, crowned him with
thorns, and extracted his heart to make anti-Christian magic. All Jewry
was involved in this plot to destroy Christendom by black magic, the
confessions said. Jews planned to kidnap Christian children and use
meir hearts or blood or ashes to make charms which, thrown into
rivers and wells, would make all Christians sick.
It was said Santo Nino bore his sufferings with great serenity, and
pen directed the Jews in the removal of his heart. The child's blind
pother miraculously recovered her sight at the moment of his death (an
Interpolated allegory of Judaism receiving enlightenment by the Heath of Christ, perhaps). The Holy Child went directly to heaven, which accounted for the authorities' inability to find his remains
where the Jews said they were buried. 8
This mythic porridge started the expulsion of thousands of Jews from Spain and Christian seizure of their assets. In 1260 the Jewish
population of Toledo had built "the largest and most beautiful syna
gogue in Spain." In the 1 5th century the Jews of Toledo were
massacred and the synagogue appropriated by the church. It now bears
Ihe name of the Church of Santa Maria la Blanca.9 According to
Contemporary theologians, persecution and seizure of property was a
legitimate activity of Catholic powers. In their view, "no illegitimate
473



Jews, Persecution of violence was being done to the Jews, infidels, and heretics put to the sword at the behest of the Church: these people had no rights to be
^mmmmmamm^^^^ violated. " '
The legend of Santo Nino was not even an original invention of
the Spanish Inquisition. The same legend had been used two centuries earlier to stimulate a persecution of Jews in the Rhineland.
The German child-martyr's name was Werner. He was kidnapped,
tortured, and sacrificed to the Jewish God. His mutilated body was
found in a river, and a church was built over his tomb at Bacharach. 1 '
In 1322, eighteen Swabian Jews were slain at Ehingen for stealing a consecrated host from a church. Later it was discovered that the Jews
were innocent, and the real culprit was a Christian woman who was
subsequently burned for witchcraft. 12 Jews and women were almost equally serviceable as scapegoats for the evils of medieval life; but women were more detested than Jews, according to a decree of Orvieto in 1 350. This law said if a man and
woman became involved in a love affair, one of them Christian and
the other Jewish, the woman in the case, of whichever faith, must be beheaded or burned alive. 13
Often, anti-Semitism went to such lengths that Christian authori
ties even denied the origin of their own religion from a Jewish matrix.
Opposing a papal aspirant of Jewish ancestry, St. Bernard wrote: "It would be an insult to Christ if the offspring of a Jew occupied the
throne of Peter." H Bernard seems to have wholly forgotten his own
church's teaching that Peter himself was a Jew, as were all the other
apostles and Jesus as well. The Jews didn't press the point, since the former Jewishness of Christ or Peter made no difference in the
political situation.
Anti-Semitism reached an apogee under the rule of Adolf Hitler in
our own century. Hitler made the Jews wear yellow badges, like medieval heretics. A German Christian organization announced in
1937, "Hitler's word is God's law." 15 Hitler said:
My feeling as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. It
points me to the man who once, in loneliness, surrounded by only a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who, God's truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love, as a Christian and as a man, I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord rose at last in His might and seized the scourge to drive out ofthe Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was the fight for the world against the
Jewish poison. '6
Evidently Hitler was not much of a reader. He never got to the
part that designated Jesus the Bridegroom of Zion; nor did he seem to know who owned the Temple.

Joan of the Bow" Joan the Huntress also called La Pucelle, "the
Liaid," a traditional title of a priestess in the fairy-religion.
1 Joan herself
pted that she received her mission "at the tree of the Fairy-ladies," a
enter of the Dianic cult at Domremy. 2 In 1429, ecclesiastical judges
Examined her and announced that holy angels had appointed her to
ave France. 3 Later, the Bishop of Beauvais reversed this decision. In
43 1, aged only 19, she was burned as a witch at Rouen, wearing a
lacard that said: "Relapsed, Heretic, Apostate, Idolator." 4 Ecclesiasti
al authorities never did explain the nature of her "idols." The
xecutioner pretended to find her heart unburned in the ashes, to sell it
p a holy relic. 5
For 500 years Joan remained a popular national heroine until she
[as finally canonized by Pope Benedict XV in 1920. To the church
if her own time this would have been unthinkable. "The Church,
[alous of her pagan authority over pagan soldiers; and jealous, too, of er success-based popularity with the masses; needed no urging by the
Inglish to see Joan as 'dispensable.' It was the Church which tried [nd condemned her; the Church which regarded her rightly, of
purse as an enemy; and the Church was glad to get rid of her." 6
pnically, the same church that pronounced Joan a witch and had her
|lled, now claims her as a saint.

ban, Pope
Catholic scholars now deny that there was ever a female pope, but
lie legend of Pope Joan persists. Even the church accepted Joan's ipntificate as historical fact, up to the beginning of the 17th century. ler portrait appeared in a row of papal busts in Siena Cathedral, labeled
lAannes VIII, femina ex Anglia: John VIII, an Englishwoman. 1
Pope Joan was first mentioned by her contemporary, Anastasius
je Librarian (d. 886). Scotus's chronicle of the popes listed her:
luD. 854, Lotharii 14, Joanna, a woman, succeeded Leo, and reigned wo years, five months, and four days." De Gemblours's chronicle
475



Joan, Pope said, "It is reported that this John was a female, and that she conceived
by one of her servants. The Pope, becoming pregnant, gave birth to a ^^^^^^^^^^_ child, wherefor some do not number her among the Pontiffs." Thomas
de Elmham's official list of the popes said: "a.d. 855, Joannes. This
one doesn't count; she was a woman." 2 Papal historian and Vatican librarian Platina wrote in The Lives of
the Popes that Joan was English, that she knew more of the scriptures than any man, and that she was elected pope by disguising herself in
men's clothes and making herself a "monk" noted for scholarship. Her deception was revealed when her labor pains came on her, and she died in a street between the Lateran and St. Clement's church. 3 She was dragged into the street and stoned to death and buried there in an
unmarked grave. 4 Martin Polonus said the street was ever afterward
avoided by papal processions, "out of detestation for what happened
there. Nor on that account is she placed in the catalogue of Holy Pontiffs, not only on account of her sex, but also because of the
horribleness of the circumstances." 5
Joan (or John) was the only pope ever stricken from papal records, although her pontificate was better documented than many others,
especially the popes before the 4th or 5 th centuries, many of whom had no contemporary documentation at all but were mere names inserted
into later chronicles to create an illusion of unbroken succession.
The official story now is that there was an "antipope" named John,
enthroned by popular demand against the will of the clergy, and soon overthrown.6 But church historians were seldom trustworthy. In 1 886,
Emmanuel Royidis published Joan's biography, Papissa Joanna, stating in his introduction: "Every sentence in my book and almost every
phrase is based on the testimony of contemporary authors." The church immediately banned his book and excommunicated him. 7
Pope Joan may not have been so apocryphal as she is now
portrayed. Part of the church's most carefully hidden history shows
that there were women in high ecclesiastical positions up to the 12th
century, when they began to be deposed. Abbesses in Germany and France once held episcopal powers and the title of Sacerdos Maxima:
High Priestess. At Quedlinburg, the scene of particularly intense witch persecutions, the abbesses once controlled all religious orders and
the whole town, having titles of Superior Canoness of the Cathedral,
Metropolitana (Mayor), and Matriarch. 8 In Milan during early Renaissance times, dual cathedrals of the monks of St. John and the canonesses of St. Maria Maggiore seem to
have been devoted to worship of the female principle after the manner
j
of the Order of Fontevrault, whose monks "took vows of obedience
to the abbess in imitation of the obedience of Jesus to his mother." The Milanese nuns bore the title of Sancta Dei Genetrix Holy Mother of God.9 From Milan came a sect devoted to an unofficial papess named
Guglielma, whose followers "believed she was incarnation of the
476



j Holy Spirit." Her Second Coming was predicted, and she was reincar- Joan, Pope l nated in a lady named Manfreda or Maifreda, whose votaries said "the male dominated Papacy would pass away, yielding to a line of ^^^^^^^^_^_ female Popes. In preparation for this event they elected Sister
|
Manfreda the first of the Popesses, and several wealthy families of
Lombardy provided at great cost the sacred vessels they expected her to use when she said Mass in Rome at the Church of Santa Maria
Maggiore." But the sect was exterminated by the Inquisition, and Manfreda was burned at the stake in the year 1300. 10 Some die-hards
I claimed she was later reincarnated as the Fairy Queen. 11
There were other women in history close to the papal office who
I may have contributed to the legends of the Papess. Gibbon suggested I the period in the 1 Oth century when Rome was ruled by two women of
the house of Theophylact, Theodora and her daughter Marozia, both queens and sacred harlots, bearing the title oisenatrix. "The most strenuous of their lovers were rewarded with the Roman mitre, and
their reign may have suggested to darker ages the fable of a female pope. The bastard son, the grandson, and the great grandson of Marozia
a rare genealogy were seated on the Chair of St. Peter."
Liudprand, bishop of Cremona, said it differently: "A certain |shameless strumpet called Theodora at one time was sole monarch of
Rome and shame though it is to write it exercised power like a man. She had two daughters, Marozia and Theodora, who were not only
her equals but could surpass her in the exercises that Venus loves."
Theodora's lover, Bishop John of Ravenna, was given the papacy: "Theodora, like a harlot fearing that she would have few opportunities
lof bedding with her sweetheart, forced him to abandon his bishopric end take for himself O, monstrous crime! the Papacy of Rome."12
florin didn't seem to need forcing. He became Pope John X in 914, put Marozia deposed him in 928 and threw him into a dungeon in the
Icastle of Sant' Angelo, where he died. Three years later she gave the
papal throne to the son she had borne to Pope Sergius. 13
From time to time, other women exerted significant influence on
the papacy. Pope John XXII had so many mistresses that it was said
pe turned the Lateran palace into a brothel. He made his favorite one of
the most powerful feudal baronesses in Italy, "for he was so blindly in
; love with her that he made her governor of cities and even gave to her
the golden crosses and cups of St. Peter himself." When Pope
[Klexander VI (Rodrigo Borgia) left Rome to visit his son Cesare, he left | pis daughter Lucretia Borgia in charge. Another woman who comjfnanded popes was Catherine Benincasa of Siena, who convinced Pope
Cregory XI that she had a mandate from God to order his papacy moved from Avignon back to Rome. 14
But the real papess, if there was one, belonged to an earlier era
han these an era of untrustworthy, disconnected records, often
Destroyed by social upheavals and wars. A popular fairy tale, "The
[Flounder in the Sea," began as a hostile allegory of the papess. A
477



Jocasta Jonah
magic flounder granted the wishes of the ambitious wife of a fisherman; first she wished to become wealthy, then noble; she wanted to be a king, then a pope. Finally she wanted to become God, and hubris
caused her downfall. The fisherman in the story was naturally St.
Peter, bridegroom of the church (Lady Ecclesia); the miraculous fish
with the power to create popes but not God represented Christ. 15 The moral of the story was the common anti-feminist opinion that
women were more easily corrupted by political power than men.
Seventeenth-century England freely circulated the original story of
Pope Joan to cast opprobrium on the "papists." A London pamphlet showed her in papal robes and tiara, her child appearing from beneath
her skirt, with the verse:
A Woman Pope (as History doth tell) In High Procession, She in Labour fell, And was Delivered ofa Bastard Son; Thence, Rome some call the Whore ofBabylon. '6
The Papess of the Tarot cards was often called Pope Joan.
When the first Tarot decks were being produced, Joan's pontificate was
universally accepted as historical fact. The card-Papess's three-tiered tiara was the same as the headdress shown on engravings of Pope
Joan. 17 However, less than a century later, French card painters were
afraid to set a woman on the papal throne even symbolically. They
changed the Papess to Juno in a classic chlamys. A Belgian Tarot even transformed her into a man, labeled "the Spaniard." 18 Whether Pope Joan really existed or not, a curious Vatican custom
arose in the wake of her legend. Candidates for the papacy had to seat
themselves naked on an open stool, to be viewed through a hole in the floor by cardinals in the room below. The committee had to make its
official announcement: Testiculos habet et bene pendentes, "he has
testicles, and they hang all right." 19 It seemed important that "Holy Mother Church" must never be governed by a Holy Mother.

ie Gospel of Mark, oldest of the synoptic Gospels, never men>ned Joseph. Jesus is "the son of Mary" (Mark 6:3), and of Mary only.
The Gospel of Matthew gives a long genealogy of paternal icestors to prove Jesus a descendant of David through his father
| Joseph. Then, the verses immediately following make nonsense of the
whole genealogy by declaring that Jesus was not Joseph's son at all. An early translation of the New Testament however, the Codex
Sinaiticus, stated: "Joseph begat Jesus." ' The Gospel of Luke calls Joseph a son of Heli, i.e., of Helios, the
sun (Luke 3:23). Jesus called Eli, or Elias, his "father" who forsook
him when he was crucified (Matthew 27:46; Mark 1 5:34). Jesus was later identified with the same "father." A sect of Gaulish Christians
worshipped Christ as Helios, calling themselves Heliognosti. 2 The solar
eclipse at Jesus's death, his titles of Light of the World and Sun of
Righteousness, were taken from cults of the solar hero, as were his
virgin birth and his mortal pseudo-father who didn't lie with his wife
until she brought forth her Divine Child, son of the sun. ?
The Christian legend of Joseph's rod said he was chosen to be
Mary's husband, out of a group of suitors, by a symbolic test of
fertility. All candidates laid their (phallic) rods on the (female-symbolic) altar. Joseph's rod alone burst into bloom, a proof of magical potency. The sacred dove of Aphrodite came down from heaven and perched on
Joseph's rod, signifying that the Goddess accepted him. 4 The same dove appeared later over the head of Jesus at his baptism, with the same
I implication of acceptance.
479



Joseph
Protoevangelium, also known as the Revelation of James: a Gospel written in the
second century A.D., valued by early church fathers as authentic
but eventually eliminated from the
The story of the flowering rod (virility) was common in Middle
Eastern mythologies; rods were also interchangeable with serpents,
because of the phallic significance of both (Exodus 7:12). The flowering rod was also a magic talisman for Tannhauser, who proved the
validity of his pagan faith against the pope with a rod that burst into bloom. This rod came from the mountain sanctuary of the Goddess Venus and represented Tannhauser as her lover. 5 The Goddess was incarnate in a queen in Tannhauser's case,
"Queen Sybil"; in the parallel case of Thomas Rhymer, the Fairy Queen; in the case of the biblical Joseph, Mariamne, Queen of Jerusalem, embodiment of the Goddess Mari. There was a Joseph
who espoused temple maidens at Herod's court, but was slain after he
lay with the queen, Mariamne, or Miriam, or Mary.6 The priestly name of Joseph may have been bestowed on Jewish
counterparts of the priests known in Egypt as "fathers of the god." 7 The function of such holy men was to beget, on the temple maidens, children who would be sacer: firstborn "sons of God" dedicated to
the service of the deity. The Protoevangelium says the virgin Mary was such a temple maiden; she also bore the name of the Queen and the
Goddess, as well as the holy harlot who was high priestess of the sacred
drama. 8 The mythic proliferation of Marys and Josephs indicates that these were not personal names but characters in the drama: the chosen
husband who was yet not a husband; the father-of-God who was yet
not a father; the virgin-mother-Goddess-priestess-queen who was also a kadesha or "Bride of God." 9 It can be shown that Joseph was indeed a divine name in Israel.
The Egyptian form was Djoser or Tcheser, a deified pharaoh long associated in both Egyptian and Hebrew tradition with the seven-year
famine along the Nile. 10 Palestine had a town dedicated to Joseph-El,
or "Joseph the God," possibly the same Egyptian god-king. 11 Certainly the Old Testament Joseph was "chosen" by the Goddess who
inspired divinatory interpretation of dreams, called Nanshe by the
Babylonians. 12 Dream interpretation was the specialty of the Old Testament Joseph in his role of Egyptian wizard-priest associated, like
Djoser, with the seven-year famine. A multicolored vestment was the
mark of oneiromantic wizard-priests in Babylon, which probably ex
plains Joseph's celebrated coat of many colors (Genesis 37:23).
Joseph's sojourn in the Pit would naturally have taken place before, not after, he was awarded the coat. His "brothers" (fellow priests?) lowered him into the abaton for a death-and-rebirth ritual, such
as Assyrian and Babylonian priests underwent before they emerged from the Pit reborn into a holy life. 13 After such an initiation, Joseph
was inspired not only to interpret dreams; he also practiced divination
|
with the aid of a silver cup (Genesis 44:5), the vessel of the Goddess, made of moon-metal. (See Abaddon.) Another biblical Joseph associated with the Christian sacred drama,
and a divine cup, was Joseph of Arimathea, literally "a Joseph
480



belonging to the Goddess-mother Ari," or Mari, she who made men Jove
(arya) out of clay. 14 This Joseph was a "counselor" of Jerusalem, that Judas
is, a priest; he supervised Jesus's burial. Later myths said the same ^ ^^^^_.^__
Joseph carried to England the divine sexual symbols of a (male)
flowering rod and a (female) cup or Grail of sacred blood. Several women named Mary accompanied him. The holy articles were
enshrined at Glastonbury, formerly named Caer Wydyr, an omphalic seat of the union between pagan God and Goddess. 15 Rod and cup
were reinterpreted in a Christian context by the legends of the Holy
Grail at Glastonbury. However, mystical systems such as the Tarot suits of rods and cups suggest that these were none other than male
female elemental symbols given a Christian gloss (see Grail, Holy).

Jove
"The Youth," a title of the god Jupiter as a replacement for Juventas,
"The Maiden," in the originally all-female Capitoline Triad, a VirginMother-Crone personification of the Etruscan Goddess. Juno the
Mother and Minerva the wise Crone remained; but Juventas the Virgin
gave way to a young god, just as Hebe the virgin form of the Greek
Triple Goddess gave way to the youth Ganymede. See Trinity.
Judas
As the Christian figure of the Betrayer, Judas was poorly understood.
Formerly, Judas was an ancestral god, father of the nation of Judah and
of Jews (Judaei). As Jude, or Jeud, he was the "only-begotten son" of the Divine Father Isra-El. 1 Judas was a dynastic name for priest-kings of
Judea for a hundred years after Judas Maccabeus restored ancient
sacrificial customs to the temple of Jerusalem in 165 B.C. 2 Thus the
kingly name of Judas was commonly given victims sacrificed as
surrogates for a reigning monarch.
Judas's legend parallels those of many Other sacred kings. He was
born of a holy woman named Cyboread, a prophetess or priestess. He was sent out to sea in a chest (cista), which washed up on the isle of
Scariot hence his name, Judas Iscariot. The queen of the island
raised him, as the princess of Egypt raised Moses. When he came of
age, Judas returned home to take service at Pilate's court. Like
Oedipus, he killed his father and married his mother. Early Christians
said Judas joined the disciples of Jesus in order to be cleansed of this
sin. 3
The Syrian Acts of Thomas declares however that Judas was
481



Judas Jesus's twin brother, whose full name was Judas Thomas, i.e., "Judas the Tammuz." Passages of the Koran insist that Judas had the same face
m^mt^^^^mi^mm as J esus an<^ v/as crucified in his stead.4 Judas's qualifications as a
sacrificial Savior hint that he might have combined with Jesus at some
point in early Christianity as an alternate seasonal god, like Horus and
Set in Egypt. The Gospels are vague and contradictory about Judas's death. Matthew says he hanged himself (27:5). Acts 1:18 says he died of a fall, which made him "burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels
gushed out." Hanging and disemboweling were both common forms
of ritual killing; but the ritualistic nature of Judas's death is most strongly
suggested by its location: Aceldama, the Field of Blood, dedicated to
"the Potter in the House of the Lord," who received Judas's blood
money. The Gospel writer naively admitted that the detail about the
money that bought Jesus was inserted only to fulfill a "prophecy" in Zechariah 11: "So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. And the Lord said unto me, Cast it unto the potter And I took the
thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord." The Potter in the temple was an image of the Great Goddess
Arum, "The Potter," a title of Ishtar or Astarte or Ninhursag who made mankind of clay moistened with blood. The Potter's Field was clay, periodically soaked with blood to restore to the Goddess some of the
life-essence she bestowed. 5
Gospel stories contradict each other concerning this field. One
writer said Judas purchased the field with his thirty pieces of silver
(Acts 1:18). Another said he "repented" and took the money back to
the temple, where he flung it down, and the priests used it to buy
"the potter's field, to bury strangers in" (Matthew 27:7).
The story of Judas's "betrayal" of Jesus is particularly confusing;
why would anyone need to point Jesus out, when he had already
entered the city as the central figure in a triumphal procession, playing the part of the Bridegroom of Zion, calling himself the son of God,
publicly conversing with angels, and publicly promising all men a share in his imminent resurrection (John 12: 15, 29, 32)? In fact the
monetary payment and the "betrayal" seem to have been necessary parts of the traditional drama, devices to absolve the executioners of
guilt. It might be supposed that when Jesus received Judas's kiss, he
became a sacred king of the Judaei. He was "betrayed" by the spirit of the eleventh hour, who in the solar cults announced the coming
death of the Light of the World in the twelfth hour which is why
the eleventh hour still presages something dire. Because of the kiss, it was sometimes assumed that Judas was "the disciple whom Jesus loved" though Gospels later removed from the canon said Jesus loved
Mary Magdalene more than any of his male followers. 6 The much
discussed passage in John 2 1 was a remnant of sun worship, with which
the Gospel of John was generally permeated:
482



Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; Juggernaut which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he
that betrayeth thee? Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall ^^^^^^^^^^^^
this man do? Jesus saith unto him, IfI will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?
Twelve disciples signified the twelve hours of the day: "Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he
stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of the world" (John 1 1:9).
The disciple of the last hour, who leaned on the breast of the sun at his
setting, was the evening star, often called Shalem or Shalom,
"peace," because he betrayed the solar deity into his nightly death and spoke the Word of Farewell to him: salaam, Peace. The Jews' solar king died at Jerusalem, "the House of Peace." The ancients knew the evening star and morning star were one and the same, the planet Venus. So the same "disciple" who betrayed the sun god into the land of death was also the one who tarried
until he rose again in the morning, the last star whose light still shone
as the sun was ascending to heaven. Thus the betrayer was the spirit
closest to the deity; the hour that "loved" him. Hellenization of Israel
converted the dual morning-star and evening-star god into the Dioscuri
or heavenly twins. Mithraic icons showed them turning the torch of
life downward on one side of the sun, upward on the other.7
There was another interpretation of the mysterious passage embedded in the famous legend of the Wandering Jew. Ignoring the two accounts of Judas's death, medieval interpreters said Jesus meant that Judas, for his crime, was condemned never to die until Jesus
"came again" at the end of the world. So Judas wandered through time,
weary but deathless, living many lifetimes in bitterness and regret. Perhaps this tale of Wandering Jew was intended to mock the pagans'
idea of many reincarnations on earth.
Yet another Christianization of Judas transformed him into St.
Jude, adopted into the Christian canon because the ancient cult of
Judas continued in Judea and couldn't be eradicated. The fictitious St.
Jude became very popular in the Middle Ages. True to his Judaic character, the saint was called "a powerful intercessor for those in
desperate straits." 8

Christianized version of the god of travelers and those who served
travelers: innkeepers, ferrymen, strolling entertainers. He was called

both, assuming he had caught his wife with her lover. Instead, the murdered pair proved to be Julian's own father and mother. 2 As
penance for his error, Julian took his wife and went to live by a ford,
where they gave shelter and assistance to travelers. The legend seems
to have been concocted from nothing more substantial than a votive
figure of the emperor Julian at a roadside shrine, where travelers left
offerings so as to have good fortune on the road. Many of the gods thus
honored by pagan pilgrims were arbitrarily declared saints in order to
provide a Christian motive for the worship given them.

S^ Juno
^^X Roman Great Mother, derived from Sabine-Etruscan Uni, the Three-in-One deity cognate with "yoni" and "Uni-verse." Juno had dozens of attributes or emanations which are sometimes erroneously viewed as separate Goddesses. Juno Fortuna was the Goddess of Fate.
Sign of Juno Juno Sospita was the Preserver. Juno Regina was Queen of Heaven. Juno Lucina was Goddess of Celestial Light. Juno Moneta was the Advisor and Admonisher. Juno Martialis was the virgin mother of
Mars. Juno Caprotina, or Februa, was the Goddess of erotic love. Juno
Populonia was Mother of the People. And so on, through many other Junos. 1 Every Roman woman embodied a bit of Goddess's spirit, her own
soul a juno, corresponding to the genius of a man. 2 Later patriarchal vocabularies dropped the word juno but retained genius, thus depriving women of their souls which may be why church councils of the early Middle Ages sometimes maintained that women are soulless.
Juno's sacred month of June honored her as patroness of marriages and the family, which is why June is still the traditional time for
weddings.
484



Juno had her formidable aspects too. As a battle-goddess she Jupiter
represented the fighting spirit of a mother defending her offspring, Justice the epitome of bravery by Roman definition. Therefore Juno Seispitei ^^^^^^^^^^^ Matri Reginae (Juno the Preserver, Queen of the Mothers) was regarded as the spirit of war. 3 Her title was the same as that of the Hindu
war-goddess Durga the Preserver, Leader of the Mothers. 4 Like all
Indo-European forms of the Goddess, Juno was only another local manifestation of the same all-encompassing deity.
Among Juno's sacred symbols were the peacock, the cowrie shell, and of course the lily, or lotus, universal yonic emblem. With her
sacred lily, Juno conceived the god Mars without any assistance from
her consort, Jupiter; thus she became the Blessed Virgin Juno. 5 The
three-lobed lily that used to represent her parthenogenetic power was inherited by the virgin Mary, who still retains it.
Justice
The spirit of justice was female in classic paganism. Ulpian said justice depended on "the feminine nature principle, which has a
profounder kinship with the natura iustum (that which is just by
nature) than does the male sex, with its greater susceptibility to the
principle of domination." Pythagoreans taught that iusticia and aequitas (justice and equity) are "innate attributes of the feminine nature
principle." '
The Roman praetor or judge "gave expression to justice as the organ and viva vox of Bona Dea-Fauna-Fatua. Through this tie with the material primordial mother he was enabled to observe the practical

Jupiter
Roman Heavenly Father, from Sanskrit Dyauspitar, the basic Father Heaven mated to Mother Earth. Zeus Pater, the Greek Heavenly
Father, was another incarnation of the same Aryan deity, whose
worship spread westward with migrations and invasions of Indo-Euro- Sign of Jupiter
pean patriarchal tribes. Like his counterparts in other nations, Jupiter was primarily a rain god: hisjnn ctinn was to fertilize the soil with seminal moisture. Thus he was connected also with thunder and
lightning his voice and his weapon. He was commonly known as
Jupiter Pluvius, "the Heavenly- Father-Who- Rains."
Jupiter was added to the originally female Capitoline Triad by
ousting the Virgin form of the Goddess, Juventas, leaving Juno and Minerva as Jupiter's two female partners. 1 Juno was said to be his wife,
though like Hera she was much older than her spouse.

opposition to the strictly formal logic of the civil law. As 'feminine

ies the worship of the feminine kteis, the sporium muliebre (womb),

maternal fertility but the maternal mystery of justice." 2
1. Bachofen, 189, 186. 2. Bachofen, 193.
Ka
One of an Egyptian's seven souls, often believed to be a spirit-twin resident in the afterbirth. 1 The Shilluks of the upper Nile, who in the
present century still worshipped the Cow-mother Hathor as bestower
of the souls, buried afterbirths of their sacred kings in the same tombs where the kings themselves would be laid on the theory that a man
needed his ka in order to become a god after death. 2 In ancient Egypt,
prayers were addressed to the ka of Osiris and other gods. India knew the same concept, even the same word. Brahma had a soul-twin named Ka, which was translated "Who?" 5
The hieroglyphic sign of the ka was a pair of upraised arms with bent elbows.4 This arm position evidently invoked the Goddess, and
was connected with the idea of the ka as a mother-given entity, each
baby's unformed twin, made of blood. 5 A Paleolithic painting from
Algeria shows a hunter stalking an ostrich while a full-hipped female
figure, larger than he, raises her arms in the position of the ka. The
female figure was either a mother or a sexual partner, as shown by a
serpentine connective line running from the hunter's crotch to hers. 6
Evidently, she made magic to help the hunter in his efforts, even
though she may have been far away.
A vase figure from Amratian times showed a similar /ra-invocation
performed by a priestess, assisted by two men who helped hold her arms aloft when she became tired. 7 The same magical /ra-invocation was
performed by Moses at the battle between Israelites and Amalekites.
The Israelites won because Moses, with the help of Aaron and Hur,
held up his arms in the Jte-position all day until the battle ended at
sunset (Exodus 17:12).
Egyptians thought the Jta-soul was immortal and dwelt in or near
j
the tomb where the body rested. The same notion was common
among Christians, who said a ghost lived in or near the grave. There is
j
in existence a letter written by an ancient Egyptian to his deceased
wife, three years after her death. He attached the letter to the portrait
statue in her tomb, confident that her ka would read the letter. 8
Among northern Aryans the idea of the ka was transposed into the
Doppelganger (double-goer), a hidden twin-soul thought to reside in
486



the placenta or umbilical cord, though sometimes it could develop into a Kaaba
full-grown twin. Germanic folklore has many examples of the soul Kala-Nath
preserved in a safer location than the body e.g., the giant who kept his ... soul in an egg, and so on. German and French peasants used to treat
an umbilical cord or afterbirth with great care, to give magical assistance
to the child's future health or longevity. Sometimes, as in Greek
myth, mothers preserved their children's umbilical cords in a secret

Kaaba
Shrine of the sacred stone in Mecca, formerly dedicated to the pre
Islamic Triple Goddess Manat, Al-Lat (Allah), and Al-Uzza, the "Old Woman" worshipped by Mohammed's tribesmen the Koreshites.
The stone was also called Kubaba, Kuba, or Kube, and has been linked with the name of Cybele (Kybela), the Great Mother of the Gods. 1 The stone bore the emblem of the yoni, like the Black Stone wor
shipped by votaries of Artemis. 2 Now it is regarded as the holy center
of patriarchal Islam, and its feminine symbolism has been lost, though priests of the Kaaba are still known as Sons of the Old Woman. See
Arabia; Cybele.

Kadi
Babylonian Goddess of Der, a serpent with a woman's head and
breasts. Her name was the root oikadishtu, Hebrew kadesha, a temple
harlot known as a Holy One, or Virgin Bride of God (see Prostitution; Virgin Birth). She may have descended from the Vedic Goddess
Kadru, mother of all Nagas or sacred serpents, who attained immor
tality through the magic blood she gave them to drink. 1

Kala-Nath
Title of the Goddess Kali as the Primordial Abyss or womb of creation. 1
Possible origin of the Middle-Eastern Goddess Anath, worshipped in
Libya as Neith, in Canaan as Anat, who was once the spouse of Jehovah. See Anath.

Kalanemi Kalanemi
Kali Ma "Rim of the Wheel of Time," a pre-Vedic spirit of the zodiac or Milky Way, viewed as the great star-wheel at the rim of the universe, also sometimes envisioned as the World Serpent encircling the earth with its tail in its mouth. Men had to study Kalanemi in order to learn
kalends, the proper order of seasons, sabbaths, and festivals. Kalanemi
was probably an aspect of Kali Ma as the Crone of Time; it is interesting that the second part of the name, nemi, meant the Moon-grove in Greco-Roman culture, and according to ancient astrologers the zodiac
was the moon's grove through which she passed in the night (see Grove, Sacred). Later Vedic priests diabolized Kalanemi as a "demon" who begot Balarama and Krishna in the underworld before the
beginning of time. 1

Kalenderees
Wandering dervishes from medieval Hindustan who taught Tantric
doctrines in Persia and Arabia. 1 Their cult of the Goddess Kali may
have been the origin of the female-centered Sufi sect which revered the same feminine Word of Creation (Om, Umm: the Matrix or
Mother-belly), and believed that religious fulfillment for men or women could be found only in sexual love. 2 See Kali Ma.
l.Keightley,20. 2. Shah, 29, 175.
Kali Ma
"Dark Mother," the Hindu Triple Goddess of creation, preservation,
and destruction; now most commonly known in her Destroyer aspect, squatting over her dead consort Shiva and devouring his entrails,
while her yoni sexually devours his lingam (penis). Kali is "The hungry earth, which devours its own children and fattens on their corpses. . . .
It is in India that the experience of the Terrible Mother has been given
its most grandiose form as Kali. But all this and it should not be
forgotten is an image not only of the Feminine but particularly and specifically of the Maternal. For in a profound way life and birth are
always bound up with death and destruction." '
Kali was the basic archetypal image of the birth-and-death Mother,
simultaneously womb and tomb, giver of life and devourer of her children: the same image portrayed in a thousand ancient religions.
Even modern psychologists face this image with uneasy acknowledg
ment of its power. It seems the image of the angry, punishing, castrating Father is somehow less threatening than that of the destructive
Mother perhaps because she symbolized the inexorable reality of
death, whereas he only postulated a problematic post-mortem
judgment. 2
488



Tantric worshippers of Kali thought it essential to face her Curse,
the terror of death, as willingly as they accepted Blessings from her
beautiful, nurturing, maternal aspect. For them, wisdom meant learning that no coin has only one side: as death can't exist without life, so also
life can't exist without death. Kali's sages communed with her in the
grisly atmosphere of the cremation ground, to become familiar with
images of death. They said: "His Goddess, his loving Mother in time, who gives him birth and loves him in the flesh, also destroys him in
the flesh. His image of Her is incomplete if he does not know Her as his tearer and devourer." 3
Few western scholars understood the profound philosophy behind
the hideous images of Kali the Destroyer. The London Museum
displayed such an image with a label saying only, "Kali Destroying Demon." 4 The Encyclopaedia Britannica devoted five columns to
Christian interpretations of the Logos without ever mentioning its
origin in Kali's Om or Creative Word; Kali herself was dismissed in a
brief paragraph as the wife of Shiva and "a goddess of disease." 5
Certainly, as the Kalika or Crone she governed every form of death
including disease; but she also ruled every form of life.
Kali stood for Existence, which meant Becoming because all her
world was an eternal living flux from which all things rose and
disappeared again, in endless cycles. The gods, whom she bore and devoured, addressed her thus:
Thou art the Original ofall the manifestations; Thou art the birthplace of even Us; Thou knowest the whole world, yet none know Thee. . . . Thou art both Subtle and Gross, Manifested and Veiled, Formless, yet with form. Who can understand Thee?. . . . It is Thou who art the
Supreme Primordial Kalika. . . . Resuming after dissolution Thine own form, dark and formless, Thou alone remainest as One ineffable and inconceivable . . . though Thy self without beginning, multiform by the
power ofMaya, Thou art the Beginning ofall, Creatrix, Protectress, and Destructress. 6
Brahmans assigned Kali's three functions to three male gods,
lling them Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver, and Kali's
archaic consort Shiva the destroyer; but many scriptures opposed this
male trinity as offensively artificial. A prayer in the Tantrasara said: "O
vlother! Cause and Mother of the World! Thou art the One 'rimordial Being, Mother of innumerable creatures, Creatrix of the
ry gods; even of Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, and
Shiva the Destroyer! O Mother, in hymning Thy praise I purify my h!" 7 The Nirvana Tantra treated the claims of male gods with
contempt:
Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesvara [Shiva], and other gods are born of the body ofthat beginningless and eternal Kalika, and at the time ofdissolution
they again disappear in Her. O Devi, for this reason, so long as the living man does not know the supreme truth in regard to Her . . . his desire
for liberation can only give rise to ridicule. From a part only ofKalika, the
primordial Shakti, arises Brahma, from a part only arises Vishnu, and
Kali Ma
Tantrasara, Nirvana Tantra, etc.. Tantras are
basic scriptures of Tantrism, many of which have yet to be translated from Sanskrit
or other original languages into English. Extant texts date back to ca. 600 a.d., though the material was much older. Among the most popular Hindu Tantras are the
Shaktisamgama, Kularnava, Mahanirvanatantra, and Tantraraja.
489



Kali Ma from a part only arises Shiva. O fair-eyed Devi, just as rivers and lakes are unable to traverse a vast sea, so Brahma and other gods lose their separate existence on entering the uncrossable and infinite being of Great
^^^"^^^^^ Kali. Compared with the vast sea ofthe being ofKali, the existence of
Brahma and the other gods is nothing but such a little water as is
contained in the hollow made by a cow's hoof. Just as it is impossible for a hollow made by a cow's hoof to form a notion ofthe unfathomable
depths ofa sea, so it is impossible for Brahma and other gods to have a
knowledge of the nature ofKali. 8
Even the arrogant Vishnu, who claimed to have brought the
whole earth out of the primal abyss, received the grace of enlightenment concerning Kali and wrote a poem about her: "Material cause of all
change, manifestation and destruction ... the whole Universe
rests upon Her, rises out of Her and melts away into Her. From Her are
crystallized the original elements and qualities which construct the apparent worlds. She is both mother and grave The gods
themselves are merely constructs out of Her maternal substance,
which is both consciousness and potential joy." 9
The Yogini Tantra said of Kali, "Whatever power anything possesses, that is the Goddess." 10 Shakti, "Power," was one of her important names. Without her, neither man nor god could act at all:
It is She as Power (Shakti) who takes the active and changeful part in
generation, as also in conceiving, bearing, and giving birth to the World-Child. All this is the function ofthe divine, as it is of the human, mother. . . . It is thus to the Mother that man owes the World ofForms
or Universe. Without Her as material cause, Being cannot display itself. It
is but a corpse . . . primacy is given to the Mother, and it is said, "What care I for the Father ifI but be on the lap of the Mother?" ' '
A Tantric scholar points out that "the poets have found much
more intimate cries of the heart when they spoke of the Deity as their 'Mother' than when they addressed themselves to God as Father."
Kali's poets approached her through love: "By feeling is She known. How then can lack of feeling find Her?" In their view, "All is the Mother and She is reality herself. 'Sa'ham' (She I Am) the Sakta says,
and all that he senses is She in the form in which he perceives her. It is She who in, and as, him drinks the consecrated wine, and She is the wine." She feeds him as a mother feeds her child, and he becomes
immortal: "Deathless are those who have fed at the breast of the
Mother of the Universe." The Yoginihrdaya Tantra says, "Obei
sance to Her who is pure Being-Consciousness-Bliss, as Power, who exists in the form of Time and Space and all that is therein, and who
is the radiant Illuminatrix in all beings." n
As a Mother, Kali was called Treasure-House of Compassion
(karuna), Giver of Life to the world, the Life of all lives. Contrary to
the west's idea of her as a purely destructive Goddess, she was the fount
of every kind of love, which flowed into the world only through her
agents on earth, women. Thus it was said a male worshipper of Kali
490



"bows down at the feet of women," regarding them as his rightful
teachers. 13
The name of Eve may have originated with Kali's leva or Jiva, the
primordial female principle of manifestation; she gave birth to her "first manifested form" and called him Idam (Adam). She also bore the
same title given to Eve in the Old Testament: Mother of All Living
(Jaganmata). 17 As the primal Deep, or menstrual Ocean of Blood at creation, Kali
was certainly the same as the biblical tehom, Tiamat, or tohu bohu, the "flux" representing her state of formlessness between manifested
universes. As Mahanila-Sarasvati the great blue River-Goddess, she
was probably the original namesake of the River Nile. As Kundalini the
Female Serpent, she resembled the archaic Egyptian serpent-mother said to have created the world. It was said of Kundalini that at the
beginning of the universe, she starts to uncoil in "a spiral line movement which is the movement of creation." 18 This spiral line was
vitally important in late Paleolithic and Neolithic religious symbolism, representing death and rebirth as movement into the disappearing-point
of formlessness, and out of it again, to a new world of form. Spirals
therefore appeared on tombs, as one of the world's first mystical
symbols.
Lunar priests of Sinai, formerly priestesses of the Moon-goddess, called themselves kafa. 22 Similar priestesses of prehistoric Ireland
were kelles, origin of the name Kelly, which meant a hierophantic clan devoted to "the Goddess Kele" (see Kelle). 23 This was cognate with
the Saxon Kale, or Cale, whose lunar calendar or kalends included the
spring month of Sproutkale, when Mother Earth (Kale) put forth
new shoots. 24 In antiquity the Phoenicians referred to the strait of
Gibraltar as Calpe, because it was considered the passage to the western paradise of the Mother. 25
Indo-European languages branched from the root of Sanskrit, said to be Kali's invention. She created the magic letters of the Sanskrit
alphabet and inscribed them on the rosary of skulls around her neck. 27
The letters were magic because they stood for primordial creative
energy expressed in sound Kali's mantras brought into being the very
things whose names she spoke for the first time, in her holy language.
In short, Kali's worshippers originated the doctrine of the Logos or creative Word, which Christians later adopted and pretended it was
their own idea. Kali's letters magically combined the elements, which
were previously separate as fiery-airy (male) or watery-earthy (female) forces. The former were "cruel"; the latter "benevolent." 28 This
distinction seemed to reflect the Tantric view of Kali as Lady of Life
and her spouse as Lord of Death.
Though called "the One," Kali was always a trinity: the same
Virgin-Mother-Crone triad established perhaps nine or ten millenia
ago, giving the Celts their triple Morrigan; the Greeks their triple Moerae and all other manifestations of the Threefold Goddess; the
Kali Ma
Western scholars
erroneously viewed the various manifestations and incarnations of Kali as many different Goddesses, particularly isolating those primitive matrikadevis (mother
goddesses) grouped together as "Dravidian
she-ogres." H Yet Kali's worshippers plainly stated that she had hundreds of different names, but they were all the same Goddess:
Sarasvati, Lakshmi, Gayatri, Durga, Annapurna, Sati, Uma, Parvati, Gauri,
Bagala, Matangini, Dhumavati, Tara, Bhairavi, Kundalini, Bharga, Devata, etc. All were Kali Mahadevi, the "Great Goddess" the same title she bore among western pagans. ' 5 Some of Kali's older names found their way into the Bible.
As Tara, the earth, she became Terah, mother of the Hebrew ancestral spirits
called teraphim. The same Kali-Tara became the Celts'
Tara, Gauls' Taranis, Etruscans' Turan, and the Latin Terra, "Mother Earth," said to be
interchangeable with Venus. 16
491



Kali Ma
Variations of Kali's basic name occurred
throughout the ancient world. The Greeks had a word Kalli, meaning "beautiful," but applied to things that were not particularly beautiful such as the demonic centaurs
called kallikantzari, relatives of Kali's Asvins. Their city of
Kallipolis, the
modern Gallipoli, was centered in Amazon
country formerly ruled by Artemis Kalliste. 19 The annual birth festival at Eleusis was
Kalligeneia, translatable as "coming forth from the Beautiful
One," or "coming forth from Kali." 20 The temple of the Great Mother of the Gods at Pergamum stood on Mount Mamurt-Kaleh,
easily transposed into Mount Mother- Kali. 21
Kali's title Devi
(Goddess) was similarly widespread in IndoEuropean languages. She was the Latin diva (Goddess) and Minoan diwi or Diwija, the "Goddess" associated with Zeus at Knossos. 26 Dia, Dea, and Diana were alternate forms of the
same title.
Norsemen their triple Norns; the Romans their triple Fates and triadic
Uni Quno); the Egyptians their triple Mut; the Arabs their triple Moon-goddess she was the same everywhere. Even Christians mod
eled their threefold God on her archetypal trinity. 29 Her three forms were manifested in many ways: in the three
divisions of the year, the three phases of the moon, the three sections
of the cosmos (heaven, earth, and the underworld), the three stages of
life, the three trimesters of pregnancy, and so on. Women repre
sented her spirit in mortal flesh. "The Divine Mother first appears in
and as Her worshipper's earthly mother, then as his wife; thirdly as Kalika, She reveals Herself in old age, disease and death." 50
Three kinds of priestesses tended her shrines: Yoginis or Shaktis,
the "Maidens"; Matri, the "Mothers"; and Dakinis, the
"Skywalkers" who attended the dying, governed funerary rites and acted as angels of death. All had their counterparts in the spirit world. To this day, Tantric Buddhism relates the three mortal forms of woman
to the divine female trinity called Three Most Precious Ones. 31
Kali's three forms appeared in the sacred colors known as Gunas:
white for the Virgin, red for the Mother, black for the Crone,
symbolizing birth, life, death. 52 Black was Kali's fundamental color as
the Destroyer, for it meant the formless condition she assumed
between creations, when all the elements were dissolved in her primor
dial substance. "As white, yellow, and other colors all disappear in
black, in the same way ... all beings enter Kali." 53 The Black Goddess was known in Finland as Kalma (Kali Ma), a haunter of tombs and an eater of the dead. 54 European "witches"
worshipped her in the same funereal places, for the same reasons, that
Tantric yogis and dakinis worshipped her in cremation grounds, as Smashana-Kali, Lady of the Dead. 55 Their ceremonies were held in the
places of ghosts where ordinary folk feared to go. 56 So were the ceremonies of western "witches" that is, pagans. They adored the Black Mother Earth in cemeteries, where Roman tombstones invoked her with the phrase Mater genuit, Mater recepit the Mother bore me, the Mother took me back. 57
Sometimes Kali the Destroyer wore red, suggesting the blood of life that she gave and took back: "As She devours all existence, as She chews all things existing with Her fierce teeth, therefore a mass of blood
is imagined to be the apparel of the Queen of the Gods at the final
dissolution." 58 The gypsies, who worshipped Kalika as a disease-causing Goddess they called "the Aunt," clothed her in red, the proper color
for gypsy funerals. 59
Blood was as much a part of Kali's worship as it was of the
worship of the biblical God who said blood must be poured on his altars
to bring remission of sins (Hebrews 9:22). The difference between
the western God's demand for blood and Kali's was that Jewish priests
took away the meat and ate it themselves (Numbers 18:9), whereas
devotees of Kali were permitted to eat their own offerings, as in
Calcutta:
492



The temple serves simply as a slaughterhouse, for those performing the sacrifice retain their animals, leaving only the head in the temple as a symbolic gift, while the blood flows to the Goddess. For to the Goddess is due the lifeblood ofall creatures since it is she who has bestowed it
and that is why the beast must be slaughtered in her temple; that is why
temple and slaughterhouse are one. This rite is performed amid gruesome filth; in the mud compounded ofblood and earth, the heads ofthe animals are heaped up like trophies before the statue ofthe Goddess, while those sacrificing return home for a family banquet ofthe bodies of their animals. The Goddess desires only
the blood ofthe offerings, hence beheading is the form ofsacrifice, since the blood drains quickly from the beheaded beasts . . . ; the head
signifies the whole, the total sacrifice. *
Beheading or throat-cutting were common methods of sacrifi
cial killing in the western world, too. "Kosher" killing for Yahweh
consisted, and still consists, of draining the animal's blood, because blood was the special food of deities. Kali demanded sacrifice of male
animals only, for they were expendable a custom harking back to
the primitive belief that males had no part in the cycles of generation. Shiva himself, as Kali's sacrificial spouse, commanded that female
animals must never be slain at the altar.41
Kali was the Ocean of Blood at the beginning and end of the
world, and her ultimate destruction of the universe was prefigured by
destruction of each individual, though her karmic wheel always brought
reincarnation. After death came nothing-at-all, which Tantric sages
called the third of the three states of being; to experience it was like the
experience of Dreamless Sleep. This state was also called "the
Generative Womb of All, the Beginning and End of Beings."42 Kali devoured Time itself. At the end of Time, she resumed her "dark
formlessness," which appeared in all the myths of before-creation and after-doomsday as elemental Chaos. 43
The mystical experience of Kali was often described as a preview of formlessness beyond the veil of death: a psychic return to the
womb, to be united with Kali's oceanic being. Thus Ramakrishna
described it:
/ was suffering from excruciating pain because I had not been blessed with a vision ofthe Mother. . . . I feared that it might not be my lot to realize
her in this life. I could not bear the separation any longer; life did not seem to be worth living. Then my eyes fell on the sword that was kept in the Mother's temple. Determined to put an end to my life, I jumped up and seized it, when suddenly the blessed Mother revealed herselfto me.
. . . the temple and all vanished, leaving no trace; instead there was a
limitless, infinite, shining ocean ofconsciousness or spirit. As far as the eye could see, its billows were rushing towards me from all sides . . . to swallow me up. I was panting for breath. I was caught in the billows
and fell down senseless. H
Ramakrishna revitalized the worship of the Mother, as his pupil /ivekananda said; "It was no new truths that Ramakrishna came to
>reach, though his advent brought old truths to light."45 Vivekananda

Kama-Mara predicted the resurgence of the Mother into the consciousness of the
Kamsa world's population, after patriarchal religions had forced her into ^^mmt^mim^^^^ concealment in the unconscious: "One vision I see clear as life before
me, that the ancient mother has awakened once more, sitting on her
throne rejuvenated, more glorious than ever. Proclaim her to all the
world with the voice of peace and benediction."46 Clearly, this Goddess was much more than the London Museum's "Destroying Demon."

Kama-Mara
"Erotic-desire" plus "Fear-of-death," a dual spirit who tempted Buddha during his solitary meditation. The Upanishads said KamaMara was the Self, source of both desire and fear. 1 But Mara was once the mother of the Maruts or nature-spirits; Kama was the Vedic
equivalent of Eros; it seems likely that they were combined in an archaic period as a sexual androgyne. The "demonic" combination
expressed the ascetics' belief that eroticism drew the flesh of men
toward destruction.
A Buddhist legend said the Blessed One met the challenge of
Kama-Mara by touching the earth with his fingers, thus invoking the
irresistible power of the universal Mother, who protected him. 2

Kamsa
Vedic prototype of King Herod. Kamsa, King of the Bhojas, initiated a Slaughter of Innocents when trying to kill the infant Krishna, his
future conqueror. Kamsa killed only boy babies until Devaki brought
forth a girl. The girl was killed too, and rose to heaven to become a
Goddess. She visited Kamsa and told him, "Kamsa, Kamsa, since you attacked me to destroy me ... I will smash your body with my own hands and drink your warm blood." Kamsa realized that she had
become his Death. 1 The myth was intended to support the taboo
against killing females.

Kara
Valkyrie swan-queen who defeated her enemies with magic songs, flying above them in her dress of swan feathers. Another name for the
Aryan Great Goddess, also rendered Kauri, Cara, Kari, etc., as
mother of the heavenly swan-nymphs or Apsaras. See Swan.
Kara Karuna
Karezza
Coitus reservatus; Tantric maithuna; probably the same as drudaria in medieval poems of courtly love: sexual intercourse without male or
gasm. The object was to increase a man's spiritual powers by keeping seminal secretions in his body and also absorb the power engendered by
his partner's multiple orgasms. See Tantrism.
Kari
Malay variation of the Triple Goddess Kali, sometimes identified with "three grandmothers under the earth" who cause floods that is,
bring about the doomsday-by-water and subsequent re-creation. Kari
was also a primordial creatress, perhaps androgynous, who conceived
the first human beings by means of magic flowers (the yonic lotus) and gave birth to the human race. 1 Kari's voice spoke in the thunder.
1. Hays, 352.
Karma
Hindu concept of Fate, perhaps derived from Kauri-Ma, i.e., Kali Ma. The usual symbol was a wheel, representing endless cycles of becoming, every force or entity in the universe begetting equal and opposite reactions to its own action, all forces maintaining balance. The Goddess's law was that any individual evolution must be worked out
by a series of reincarnations through the turnings of the great wheel of
time. Evil actions resulted in rebirth to a more evil life; good actions
brought lives of increasing virtue and happiness. Ascetic yogis of early Buddhism instituted the idea that one could take short cuts through
the cycles of time and escape altogether from the inexorable karmic
wheel into a state of Nirvana or cosmic not-being, the individual
dissolved in the infinite.
iruna
rantric term for the basic quality of mother-love, directly experilced in infancy and ramified in adulthood to embrace all forms of love:
aching, tenderness, compassion, sensual enjoyment, and eroticism.
495



Kanjna Many centuries before Freudian psychology recognized "infantile sexu
ality," Tantric sages called karuna the essence of religion: a gut
___________ feeling of loving-kindness, as opposed to the often cruel or useless
verbalizing of theological principles. 1 It was understood that karuna must be learned through physical and sexual contact comfort, by adults
and children alike. Thus the identity of infantile, sexual, warmly
loving, and religious behavior patterns was perceived long ago and is just now being rediscovered by western civilization.
The ancients well knew the experience of being in love recapitu
lates the mother-child relationship in its intimate physical attachment,
trust, and dependence. Recognition of one particular other as a love object surely evolved from the instinctive mechanism that binds
together individual mothers and offspring. It has been shown even in
the animal realm that adequate sexual functioning in adulthood
depends on satisfactory relations with the mother in infancy. 2 In ancient times the Goddess's sacred whores were special teachers
of karuna, which may have been the root of modern Italian carogna, "whore." Pagan Rome gave the Great Goddess the title of Mater Cara, "Mother Beloved." 3 She combined all the qualities of sexuality,
motherhood, marital bliss, friendship, generosity and mercy, or caritas, which the Christian church later purged of its sensual implications
and transformed into "charity," the giving of money to earn points in the after-life. The Greek version of karuna was embodied in the
Charites or Graces, the naked Triple Goddess, whose quality of "grace" was also altered in the Christian context. In Babylon, the Great Mother under the name of Ishtar was also the Great Whore and the
lover of all men, expressing karuna in her self-description, "A
prostitute compassionate am I." 4 The Christian derivative of Mari-Ishtar was Mary Magdalene,
the sacred harlot who said harlots are "compassionate of all the
race of mankind." 5 Gnostic Gospels mentioned Mary Magdalene as the
original female pope, embodying the true Christian spirit kept secret
from male apostles, while it passed directly from Jesus through
his surpassing love for Mary.6 Significantly, Christian iconographers often confused Mary the harlot and Mary the mother. See
Prostitution.
Motherhood, sensual satisfactions, and kindly feelings were associated with the spirit of the Goddess under all her names, and especially
with women as her earthly representatives. The integrated idea of karuna with all its ramifications has virtually disappeared from mod
ern western society, where it is even difficult to explain its older
meanings. Yet "those modes of perceiving the world and organizing behavior which are more distinctly 'female' can't be thought of as
having sprung into being in the context of the world we now inhabit.
. . . We must think in terms of patterns of behaving that developed over untold centuries, and which were keyed to survival of the human group in the primitive environment. Such a way of being would have
496



been predicated upon powerful social bonds, 'bonds of love,' which Kauri would serve to keep otherwise more vulnerable individuals in close
proximity to protectors." Every individual was to some extent in need ^^^^^^^^^^^
of protectors: "It may be that we feel loneliness to be so potentially
annihilating because, to the lone human and above all, the lone human infant or child being alone was death." 7
Western culture began to lose sight of the close relationship
between sensuality and loving-kindness when its theology followed St. Augustine to his conclusion that every child is born tainted with sin
because of its necessarily sexual conception. 8 Nearly all manifesta
tions of love fell under theological suspicion because nearly all involved
the feminine principle in some way. (See Romance.) "Men's sexual drive was unacceptable to them and so it was projected onto women. It was women whose lust was said to be insatiable. . . . [V]iewing wom
an as seductress and temptress is still evident, as can be seen by the fact
that prostitutes, but seldom their customers, are arraigned, and the fact that the rape victim is often seen as having 'asked for' her attack by
dressing or behaving seductively." 9 In a society that lacks any coherent articulation of the concept of
karuna, women as mothers, lovers, and caretakers "learn early that
they should be ashamed of the very set of qualities which are particularly
theirs. Ironically, at the same time, they are constantly threatened by the prospect that if they are not affectionate enough and as close and
loving to others as they ought to be, they will have failed in their own
and others' eyes." The result is "a noxious social climate which fosters
too little feeling in men and too much in women." 10
Loss of this all-important concept may create social evils of the
most pervasive sort. "Male public culture gets caught up with machines and puts emphasis on things that are not alive. The decision
making of males in power tends to happen in a vacuum with little
reference to the needs of life. Paradoxically, the public leaders who are
supposed to help us deny death become increasingly oblivious to life
and show increasing contempt for it. We have a civilization in which
males in high places imitate a male god in heaven both think
themselves above the petty concerns of simple nurture and delight in
generative life." 11

Kelle all over the world as a symbol of the female genital and its curative
Keres and generative properties.
^^^t^m^^^m^^^^^m 1. Larousse, 375.
var. Kelly Kelle
Irish-druidic priest-name, derived from pre-Christian holy harlots of
the Goddess Kelle, Kale, or Kali. Irish writings described the divine
harlot Mary Magdalene as a kelle. 1 The medieval term Kele-De was
considered somewhat mysterious, translated "Bride of God" if a wom
an, "Servant of God" if a man. 2 These translations were inaccurate.
Kele-De meant literally the spirit of the Goddess Kele, evidently identical with the Goddess Kali of the original Indo-European Celts.
Votaries of the Goddess Kele stressed the search for inward
perfection through meditation, yogic style.
5 Her gods assumed the
lotus position like eastern yogis. Her primitive Grail hero, Peredur, experienced her as the "most beautiful woman in the world,"
represented by the three colors of the Divine Prakriti, still known as the
Gunas, standing for her powers of creation, preservation, and destruction. 4
The mythical "St. Kilda" seems to have been another version of
the Goddess Kele, dwelling on a remote rocky islet once identified
with the western paradise of the dead. St. Kilda's Isle still exists, but the
origin of its name has been forgotten. The ubiquitous Irish word kill, a cell or cave, once meant a shrine of Kele, whose holy men called
themselves Culdees, Colidees, Cele-De, Keledio, etc. Some were described in Christian histories as monks, though they were obviously
married. 5
Kildare was a major shrine of the Goddess Kilda- Kele, or Brigit,
identified with the virgin Mary after Christian monks appropriated
the site. But the guardianship of the sacred fire at Kildare had long been
a prerogative of priestesses; the shrine was forbidden to men.6
Confusion of Kilda-Kele-Brigit with Mary was not too far-fetched, as they had been aspects of the same Goddess for thousands of years in India as Kali-Mari or Kel-Mari, the Pot Goddess who made human forms out of clay.7 (See Kali Ma.)

Khepera
Scarabaeus or dung-beetle god, one of Egypt's sillier attempts at a male creator without a Goddess. Khepera was adopted by the solar
priesthood because of a belief that all dung-beetles were male,
reproducing through eggs incubated in their dung balls without the he!
of females. 1 The scarab's dung ball was identified with the sun, which
Khepera rolled daily across the sky. Some priests said Khepera achieved male motherhood by mastur
bation. "I had union with my hand, and ... I poured seed into my
own mouth, and I sent forth from myself issue in the form of . . . Shu
and Tefnut." Khepera insisted he was the sole creator; "there was no other being who worked with me." Yet like all gods he was forced to
depend on a mother-symbol. He said, "I laid a foundation in Maa," the Goddess as primal matter. 2
Finally the mother-symbol re-absorbed him. Some said Khepera had no reproductive power until he received an eye of the female
moon, which could give birth to plants and animals. He became just
another child of the Goddess: "Tem-Khepera who produced himself on the thighs of his divine mother." 3 He was shown emerging from a
yonic lotus between the Goddess's two aspects, Isis and Nephthys. 4

Kiakra
jVedic name of the so-called Celtic cross, with a wheel in its center,
[signifying union of male and female principles. When displayed by
iVishnu, this emblem meant the phallic god's "power to penetrate jheaven and earth." ' The word was probably related to chakra, the
jmagic circle of men and women alternating in Tantric worship.
Kiakra was one of the original combinations of cross and circle (wheel or
jegg) that gave rise to the so-called Cross of Wotan, ankh of Osiris,
and other male-female symbols of divine union.

Kingship
iln early Asiatic civilizations, kingship depended on the choices of women. There was no law of primogeniture. Kings were rarely suc
ceeded by their sons. Kings of Sumeria and Assyria were of unknown
fatherhood. King Esakkuruna was called "the son of Nobody." '
Women were the kingmakers in the lands he ruled. 2
Marriage with the earthly representative of the Goddess, in the form of the queen, was essential to the position of kingship; this was
fthe original meaning of "holy matrimony" (hieros gamos). Akkadian
kings apparently went on military expeditions chiefly to prove themselves worthy of the sacred marriage. 3
Ashurbanipal said he ruled by the grace of the Goddess Ishtar; he was the king "whom her hands created." Shamash-shum-ukin of ipabylon said he was chosen for kingship by the same Goddess under
tier title of Erua, Queen of the Gods. King Esarhaddon of Assyria
said he was "beloved of Queen Ishtar, the goddess of everything, the unsparing weapon, who brings destruction to the land of the
enemy." 4 Ishme-Dagan, king of Isin in 1860 B.C., said he was "he whom Inanna, queen of heaven and earth, has chosen for her t>eloved husband." 5 The Bronze Age king Ixion of Thessalian Lapiths
jmarried the Mother of the Gods after killing her former mate,
flescribed as his father-in-law, because each king's successor was supiposed to call his defeated rival "father." 6 The queens were the same
|s Goddess, or Mother of God. The pharaoh Amenhotep III built a
i temple for his wife Ti, who was worshipped as the Goddess. 7
The goddess-queen's choice largely depended on the candidate's
501



Kingship sex appeal. If she tired of the king's lovemaking, he could be deposed or killed, for the queen's sexual acceptance of him determined the
^^^^^^^^^^^ fertility of the land. In many early societies the old king was killed by
the new king, usually called a "son" though he was no blood relative. Hence the unbroken chain of Oedipal murders that puzzled modern scholars before it was known that the words "father" and "son" were
used in a different sense. A Babylonian tablet says:
Haharni laid claim for himselfto lordship over Dunnu. Earth raised her
face to her son Amakandu. "Come let me make love to you " she said to him. Amakandu took his mother (for a wife) and Haharni his father he
killed; in Dunnu, which he loved, they laid him forest. And Amakandu
took over his father's lordship and Nether Sea, his sister, he took (as wife). Lahar, son ofAmakandu, came and Amakandu he killed, and in Dunnu, in the (tomb) ofhis father he caused him to rest. Nether Sea, his
mother, he took (as wife). 8
After this, Lahar's son killed Lahar and took his sister River as
wife; he in turn was killed by his son, who married his sister Ningeshtinna, "Lady of the Vine of Heaven," a shortened name of the
Goddess Nin-gest-inanna. Sovereignty passed from mother to daughter, beginning with Earth, the Goddess Dunnu herself, foundress of the
line the same as Crete's Danuna, Anatolia's Danu, Greece's Danae,
the Gaulish Diana. Kings were expected to kill their predecessors or
pseudo-fathers. "Son" meant "successor," and "sister" was synonymous with "wife." 9
The length of a king's reign was often predetermined, because people thought the Goddess needed the refreshment of a new lover
at stated intervals. Up to 1810 a.d., kings of Zimbabwe were ceremoni
ally strangled to death by their wives at the moon temple every four
years. 10 Kings of ancient Thebes reigned for seven years; so did kings of
Canaan. Myths suggest a similar seven-year period for each king of Crete. Cretan kings were never allowed to grow old; they always died in
the full bloom of youth. 11 More recently, Nigerian kings were strangled after the queen's pregnancy was established, which meant
each king fulfilled his role in life by begetting one royal offspring. 12
White explorers in Africa spoke of tribal "kings," but rarely mentioned that the real rulers of the tribes were queens. "In the
oldest times there were no reigning princes in Africa, but the negroes
had large kingdoms [sic] which were ruled by goddesses." 1? Ghana was governed by kings of a matrilineal succession whose divine right
passed through sisters' sons. The Lovedu were ruled by a female
"king" who took a series of lovers but always left the government to one
of the royal princesses. 14 Angola was ruled by women until the
Portuguese invasions. Ashanti was ruled by queens until the British
Protectorate in 1895. Its kings were subject to the queen mother; its
princesses took no husbands but kept a series of lovers. Similar customs
obtained in Loango, Daura, the country of the Abrons, and other
502



\frican nations. The queen of Ubemba was called Mamfumer, Kingship
'Mother of Kings," and did all the governing. 15
The Gospels' "Candace queen of the Ethiopians" (Acts 8:27) was ^^^^^^^^^^^
lot a single individual but the hereditary title of queen mothers who
{governed the Nubian states. 16 Ethiopian kings were ritually slain from he earliest times. Regicide was still the custom of Nubian Kassites of
he Upper Nile in the 1st century b.c. Diodorus said only one Ethiopian
Tionarch escaped this kingly fate because he was educated in Greece
nd dared to disobey tribal law. He led a party of soldiers into the
sanctuary and killed all the priests before they could kill him. 17
The Javanese Singasari dynasty had matriarchal queens similar to Candace, typified by Queen Dedes whose statues show her as a peautiful Shakti of wisdom. She married a number of new kings after
[hey killed her previous consorts, each apparently holding office for a
lieven-year period. 18 Legends consistently associate kingship with ceremonial death. A
teal from Lagash shows the Goddess taking her new king by the
land, while he raises a weapon to slay the old king, prostrate under the queen's feet. 19 King Sennacherib of Assyria was "beaten to death
vith statuettes of the gods" in the temple at Nineveh. Perpetrators of [he deed were his "sons," one of whom succeeded him as King
Esarhaddon. Upon his accession, Esarhaddon proclaimed: "I am power
ful, I am omnipotent, I am a hero, I am gigantic, I am colossal! " 20 Sometimes, kings had to proclaim they were embodiments of the Goddess herself so as to rule with the same authority as queens. Kntiochus of Commagene announced that he could rule because he
Ue5 the Goddess. 21 A king's investiture used to mean putting on
female robes, so the king could be displayed as a transvestite Goddess
[see Transvestism). In the ancient Middle East generally, kings were not so much
governing figures as ceremonial ones, primarily concerned with
Dedication of temples and other religious responsibilities. 22 Sometimes [hey were also war leaders, able to preserve their lives in time of
danger by convincing the people that no one else could defeat the
pnemy. In such a case, a surrogate victim might be found a real or
adopted son, a prophet, a condemned criminal, or a divine animal. A war leader of Carthage "clothed his best and most beloved son
n royal robes and crucified him as a sacrifice" to secure the blessing
pf Baal on his military campaigns. 23 Similarly, the god-king Isra-El
clothed his only-begotten son Ieud in royal robes and sacrificed him
['according to the custom of the Jews," as Philo said. 24 This king
became Jesus, "king" of the Jews (John 18:33). Since a king was God, any king's real or adopted son was naturally the Son of God; and pahweh himself was embodied in the Jewish king. "In the early
period of the Hebrew monarchy the central element of the annual New
pear festival was the ritual enthronement of Jahveh as King." 25
Son-killing was a habit, not only of the Jewish god-king but of
503



Kingship many other god-kings who modified the old custom by shedding the
blood of someone else in the proper season. A Swedish king named
^H^^^^^H Aun managed to extend his reign for nine years by sacrificing one of
his nine sons each year to ransom his own life. 26 Another Swedish king named Gunnar Helming simply ran away.
After wrestling with the god Frey, incarnate in the previous king as biblical Jacob wrestled with "a man who was God" and later received
the king-name of Isra-El Gunnar Helming took the king's place in
the bed of the high priestess (or Goddess). Evidently he pleased her, for with her help he gathered up all the gold and silver treasures of kingly
office and escaped, taking her with him. 27 A similar story was told of
Theseus's escape from the Minoan sacred king's fate with the help of
the priestess Ariadne, the incarnate Moon-goddess, who had taken a fancy to him. 28
Seleucus Nicator of Antioch, formerly one of Alexander's generals, became king of Syria but was forced to abdicate in favor of his
"son" Antiochus, because the queen fell in love with the younger man
and cast off her old spouse. 29 As late as 97 a.d., kings of Antioch were
"chosen for merit" and deposed when their "merit" failed. This "merit'
seemed to have to do with their sexual capacity. 30 That is, it was virtu,
"virility," from vir, "man."
A common method of choosing a king was to test his virility by having him look on the Goddess's nakedness during the ritual bath that
magically restored her virginity each year. Actaeon, Teiresias, and lovers of the Germanic Earth Goddess were chosen by so viewing her. 51 Gyges was chosen by the queen of Lydia, who bore the name of the
Goddess Omphale, upon her display of her naked body to him; he was
told to kill the incumbent king and marry her. 32 Bath-Sheba, whose name meant she was the daughter of Arabian queens, married King David after he saw her naked in her bath, and killed her previous
husband, Uriah the Hittite (2 Samuel, 1 1). The Goddess Ishtar pre
sented herself naked to her would-be lovers, saying, "Let us enjoy thy
manly strength. Let thy hand [or, phallus] come forth and take away my
virginity." 33 Such legends point to a custom of choosing a king by the promptness of his erection upon the sight of the naked Goddess.
People would follow only a leader of proven sexual potency, as shown
by the transparent sexual metaphors of the 1 10th Psalm: "The Lord
shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of
thine enemies. Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in I
the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning; thou hast the
dew of thy youth." Dew was the biblical word for semen, rod meant
phallus, Zion was the Holy Mount, otherwise the body of the Virgin
Israel.
When the king's youth and dew deserted him, so did his people,
who considered it dangerous to keep an impotent king in office. A
504
*m



[declining birth rate or a poor growing season could bring on a king- Kingship
ailing. Proverbs 14 says, "In the multitude of people is the king's
nonor; but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince."
Northern Europeans believed in killing kings at the failure of their ^^^^^"^
%aefa or heill (virility, divine force), made manifest through failure of
die land's fertility. Crops went bad in the reign of Domaldi; his subjects
:ried sacrificing oxen, then men, to no avail; finally they fell on the Bang and butchered him. As late as the 9th century a.d., King Halfdan
bf Norway was slain for the sake of the crops. 34 Writings falsely attributed to St. Patrick expressed the Celtic conviction that the reign of
a potent king would be distinguished by fine weather, calm seas, abundant grain, and trees laden with fruit. 35
Ceremonial killing of kings was an ancient Latin custom, dating
}ack to the obscure period of Roman history that is now virtually
unknown, because later priesthoods destroyed its records. 36 Early Roman kings usually met death by "assassination" in the month of
March, beginning the sacred year. 37 King Tatius was slain at the altar
ivith sacred knives: a suspiciously stylized death. Julius Caesar met a
Similarly ritualistic death at the fatal time, the Ides of March, in the
t>acred inner chamber of the senate, on the very dais of the altar, in
Fulfillment of a prophetic announcement by his wife.
There is some doubt as to whether Caesar's wife was considered a portal woman or an embodiment of the Goddess whom Caesar wor
shipped for the sake of his victories in battle: Venus Genetrix. After
defeating Pompey, he built her a marble and gold temple in the Forum and had his own statue placed before her as her consort. The drama of his life and death contained elements common to other
sacred kings who were consorts of the Goddess.
At the beginning of his career, Caesar dreamed of copulating with
his own mother, and the seers prophesied from this that he would
rule the earth (Mother). On the eve of his assassination he attended a
Feast or Last Supper and was asked, "What is the best kind of death?"
He replied, "The kind that is least expected." On the following day he received the kind of death he had chosen. Later, during the funerary
games in honor of Venus Genetrix, a comet was identified as the soul of
Paesar enroute to the company of the gods. 38
Julius Caesar's successor Augustus received his title by marrying
Livia Augusta, who planned the rebuilding programs in Rome and also revitalized the worship of her Goddess, Juno Augusta. Though Livia's contributions to the glories of the Augustan Age have been
jelittled by Christian historians, there is no doubt that she was a full co
"uler and the real author of many of Augustus's legal reforms and
municipal projects. There was a vague understanding, never fully nvestigated, that like the previous Caesar's wife, Livia somehow 'hastened her husband's end." 39
By Roman law of matrilineal succession, Augustus was succeeded
505



Kingship by Tiberius, Livia's firstborn son by another man. The title of
Augustus passed through the female line even up to the time of
mmmmmmmm^^^mm Constantine, who received his throne through a marriage with the
princess Fausta.40
The title of Caesar (Kaiser, Czar) passed on to Germanic emperors in the Dark Ages when legends of heroes and sacred kings usually
included the ritual death. Siegfried suffered a typical Caesar's death,
brought on by his wife's prophetic dream. His wife personally embroidered on his robe the cross marking the spot where the slayer's
spear must strike. 41
St. Caesarius, whose name meant "king," was another fictitious
saint based on the old custom of king-killing. He was the Kaiser slain
as an embodiment of Apollo at Terracina. The man impersonating the
king would run through lines of spectators and leap from a cliff, as the mythical saint was said to have done. 42 The festival of "St. Caesarius"
was All Hallows, the pagan holy day of ancestral ghosts (see Halloween). Similar deification or sainthood seems to have been the purpose ol
the mysterious Liebestod (Love-Death) of Attila the Hun, who appears in the Germanic Nibelungen saga under the name of Atli or
Etzel, in the company of other heroes such as Siegfried. Attila's last bride bore the name of Germanic death-goddess, Grimhild or Kriem
hild. According to Marcellinus, Grimhild killed Attila in their
marriage bed on their wedding night. 43 Other sources more euphemisti cally said he died suddenly in the arms of his bride, smothered by "an effusion of blood." That his killing might have been deliberately
planned, to make him a god, is suggested by his burial with all the
trappings of a sacred Caesar: a triple coffin of sun, moon, and earth
metals gold, silver, and iron. His gravediggers were all slain so his
tomb would be kept secret. 44 His funeral rites consisted of a brief period
of extravagant mourning, followed by a joyful feast representing his apotheosis. His future Second Coming was expected.
Men who played the fatal role of the king in classic sacred dramas
were often deified (canonized) to induce them to serve as surrogates
for the real king. Like Christian martyrs, they believed that once past th
"veil," they would enjoy blissful immortality, identified like the ruler
with the supreme god himself. Thus, many stories show men willingly
assuming the fatal role. Antinous, a favorite of the emperor Hadrian, sacrificed himself in a magical ceremony to preserve the emperor's life. 45 Each winter, the Roman festival of the Saturnalia featured a
man who played the part of the Lord of Death, identified with both the
emperor and the god Saturn. 46 The latter was the Heavenly Father in
his underground, "slain" aspect, as Shava the Corpse stood for Father Shiva in the same attitude of death. See Shiva.
The Roman word for a king, rex or reg, descended from Sanskrit
raj, as did the Celtic rig.*7 Not only the word but the concept of the
506



office migrated all over the Eurasian continent, making a king's sover- Kingship
eignty dependent on his acceptance by the land, which was always embodied in women. The idea is still discernible in a Tartar custom: a ^^^^^^^^^^
chief's son must be carried about to every village and suckled by
every nursing mother to validate his later claim to leadership.48 The land
was a king's eternal mother-bride. King James I of England referred
to a tradition of immemorial antiquity when he said, "I am the husband and the whole island is my lawful wife." 49 The Welsh long believed
the British isles were annexed to Rome only through a sacred marriage
between the Roman emperor and the British queen, the Lily Maid Elen. Welsh bards also said their own Llefelys became king of France
by marrying the queen and gaining "the crown of the kingdom along with her." 50
Like early kings of Egypt, Babylon, Assyria, Greece, and Rome,
pre-Christian British kings became stewards of the country through a hieros gamos with the queen. The Danish historian Saxo Grammati
cus said of Hermutrude, queen of Scotland, that "whomsoever she
thought worthy of her bed was at once a king, and she yielded her
kingdom with herself." 51 Pictish kings were selected by the royal
women from a matrilineal blood line. Early Saxon queens governed
their land, and a king could govern only by marrying them. 52 That is why King Canute married the widow of his predecessor; and Ethelbald, king of the West Saxons, married his father's widow. Another
Ethelbald, king of Kent, married his stepmother after his father's death. 53
British romances show kings unable to rule unless they possessed
the queen, whose name was often given as Guinevere also ren
dered Cunneware, Gwenhwyfar, Jennifer, Ginevra, or Genevieve. Some early sources say there were three of her (the Triple Goddess). King Arthur married all three. 54 Repeated abductions of her by Melea
gant, by Lancelot, by Melwas, by Arthur, and by Mordred signified many would-be kings' claim to sovereignty. 55 The collapse of Arthur's
kingdom was intimately related to his loss of the queen.
In pagan Ireland a king's inaugural greeting announced that he was wedded to (literally, had copulated with) his land, in the person of the queen. The legendary Irish Queen Mab, famous in folklore as
the Fairy Queen, chose and invested her kings and changed her
lovers often. 56
Rivalries between kings ruler and tanist, father and son, royal
"dragon" and his dragonslayer preserve in mythology the archetypal sexual jealousy that related male power to acceptance by the
female, and male powerlessness to sexual rejection. The myth of Finn and Diarmuid plainly shows the chieftains' jealous counter-claims to Queen Grianne (Ygraine), another form of Guinevere. King Arthur's death scene was prefigured by the story of Finn's three trips to
bring healing waters to the wounded Diarmuid; but each time he
507



Kingu deliberately let the water trickle through his fingers, so Diarmuid died.
Kiss Finn said smugly to his younger, handsomer rival: "Well it pleases
^m^mf^ me, O Diarmuid, to see you in this plight, and it grieves me only that all
the women of Erin are not now gazing on you; for your extraordinary
beauty is now ugliness, and your choice form a deformity." 57 An old English custom of "lifting" the king at Easter time suggests
the former importance of women in every aspect of the king's career,
including his selection, approval, love-death, and apotheosis. The king was heaved up into the air each year by a group of court ladies.
Though piously called an imitation of "our Savior's resurrection," the
custom was obviously older than Christianity; it was pagan, not Christian, theology that made gods and kings one and the same, both subject to the magic of women. 58

Kingu
Firstborn son of the Sumerian creatress Tiamat. She gave him the
Tablets of Destiny and the authority to rule over all the other gods. But
he was slain by Marduk, Babylon's municipal god, and his blood made the earth's "living waters."
Kismet
Turkish variant of Qis-Mah, the Arabic "Fate" bestowed by
the Moon-goddess Mah. The meaning was similar to Hindu karma, Roman fortuna, Greek dike (destiny). See Ma.
Kiss
Like most forms of affectionate contact, the kiss was an adaptation of
primitive mother-child behavior. The original Sanskrit word was cusati,
"he sucks." Gestures of embrace, of clutching to the bosom, began as
508



imitations of the nursing mother. Scholars believe kissing originated Knighthood
with mouth-to-mouth feeding, practiced among ancient Greeks and Knights Templar others as a form of love play. In Germany and Austria even up to the ^^^^^^^^^^^
19th century a.d. it was common for mothers to premasticate food
and feed it to their infants by "kissing." l Kissing was most common in
European countries, where it was supposed to create a bond among
all members of a clan (hence, "kissing cousins"). It was virtually unknown in northern Asia (Japan, China, Mongolia). Amerindians and Eskimos did not kiss but rather inhaled the breath of a loved one by
"rubbing noses."
l.Wickler, 191, 237-38.
Knighthood; Ceremony of
In the Middle Ages, a knight was created by a symbolic imitation of
the ritual that used to make a man into a god: beheading him. Touching first one shoulder then the other with a sword implied that the sword
had passed through the neck. Celtic tribes especially revered man-gods who were preserved in the form of severed heads, which were
believed to give oracles. In Greece also, savior-gods like Orpheus spoke to their followers of the after-life through the mouths of their own
mummified heads. Symbolic beheading also "knighted" men dedicated to the Goddess Artemis in her Spartan shrines, where the man so
dedicated received a slight cut in his neck from the edge of a sword. 1
1. Graves, CM. 2, 79.
Knights Templar
The Order of Knights of the Temple was founded in the Holy Land
in 1118 a.d. by a Burgundian knight, Hugues de Payens or Payns, that is, "Hugh of the Pagans." ' Its organization was based on that of the
Saracen fraternity of hashishim, "hashish-takers," whom Christians
called Assassins (see Aladdin). 2 The Templars' first headquarters was a wing of the royal palace of Jerusalem next to the al-Aqsa mosque, revered by the Shi'ites as the central shrine of the Goddess Fatima. 5
Western romances, inspired by Moorish Shi'ite poets, transformed
this Mother-shrine into the Temple of the Holy Grail, where certain
legendary knights called Templars gathered to offer their service to the Goddess, to uphold the female principle of divinity and to defend
women. (See Grail, Holy.) These knights became more widely known
as Galahad, Perceval, Lohengrin, etc.
The real Knights Templar, however, professed Christianity and assumed the duty of protecting Christian pilgrims and merchants
traveling through the Holy Land. They also undertook to protect the travelers' lands, castles, and other properties back home, where
509



Knights Templar Templars from Jerusalem arrived to take charge. When pilgrims failed to return from their journeys, the property could pass into the
^^^^^^^^^^m Templars' permanent possession. As a result, like other holy orders
founded on a vow of poverty, the Templars soon became very rich.
At first the Knights Templar had difficulty getting papal sanction
for their military order. The papacy refused to recognize them until a
vindication of their aims was written by St. Bernard, whose uncle joined
the order and became a Grand Master. The Templars' original
charter, signed by Pope Innocent II, granted them freedom from papal claims on their property, even from church taxation. This financial
independence was to prove their downfall.
Having acquired estates and treasure houses throughout France,
Spain, Portugal, and the Levant, the Templars were leading bankers and moneylenders of the 13 th century. They served kings and merchant princes. Their own treasure ships plied the eastern Mediterranean coasts. Their reputation for honesty was such that even
Moslems trusted them. Eventually, Pope Clement V and King Philip
IV of France, whose government was nearly bankrupt, joined forces to deprive the Templars of their money and their lives.
Early in the 14th century, the Templars were accused of organized heresy, devil worship, ritual sodomy, and blasphemy. It was claimed they adored an androgynous idol named Baphomet, "having sometimes three faces, sometimes two, or only one, and sometimes a
bare skull, which they called their savior, and believed its influence to be
exerted in making them rich, and in making flowers grow and the
earth germinate." 4 The rumor-mongers claimed the Templars' secret rites involved
denial of Christ, treading on the cross, forcing initiates into homosex
ual acts, kissing the devil's genitals, and similar charges that were to
become monotonously familiar in witch persecutions. Grand Master Jacques de Molay and other dignitaries of the order were arrested and
confessed under torture that they had indeed done such things, with
the aim of teaching newly initiated Knights unquestioning obedience to their superiors' commands. Later, Molay and his associates publicly
renounced their confessions, saying they had been forced by torture. In
13l4 they proclaimed their innocence before a large crowd of people and were burned at the stake as relapsed heretics the same afternoon. 5
The order was suppressed with great cruelty. With the church's
blessing, local barons in France, Cyprus, Castile, and other areas
simply murdered the Knights and took their properties. Captured Templars were forced to confess to every sort of crime, most
apparently invented by their judges. It was found that each Templar
confessed to one set of sins when tortured by one judge and a
completely different set when tortured by a different judge. 6 Trials were
transparently rigged. During the trial of Templars at Paris, the court repeatedly refused to hear depositions from no fewer than 573 witnesses
for the defense. 7
510



A few Templars managed to flee to England, where torture was Knot i not legal. This made it impossible to obtain what Pope Clement called "true evidence," meaning evidence extorted by torture. The ^^^^^^^^^^^
I pope wrote to King Edward II, demanding that the Templars be
;
arrested and tortured. Otherwise, Edward and his court would be
excommunicated as impeders of the Inquisition. As a bribe, Edward
was offered a Plenary Indulgence for all his past sins. Finally he
j permitted papal judges to torture the Templars, changing the English I law "out of reverence for the Holy See." 8 The indispensable utility of
Itorture was thus established, and "the success of the extermination of
the Templars set the patterns for the subsequent persecution of I witches." 9
Scholars have tried to determine the truth, if any, of the charges
jagainst the Templars. Most agree that the Templars "had adopted some of the mysterious tenets of the eastern Gnostics." 10 Their alleged
idol Baphomet may have been the Triple Head of Wisdom pictured ion the arms of the order's founder, in the form of three black Saracen
heads. 11 On the other hand, no idol of Baphomet was ever found in
khe Templars' houses or shrines, though these were seized and sealed
immediately. 12 Templars were accused of "making a fig" at the crucifix with their
pands; but this derisive sexual symbol was not a mockery by eastern
standards. Orientals called it a knowledge sign, the feminine counterpart
pf the phallic cross; in India it was a lingam-yoni. 1? If the Templars trampled a crucifix, they may have copied the custom of Arab dervishes Ivho ceremonially rejected a cross with the words, "You may have the
Cross, but we have the meaning of the Cross." H As for the charge of
Bodomy, no monastic order was free of that. Men cut off from
Lvomen were no less prone to homosexual behavior in the 13th century
man in the prisons, barracks, lumber and mining camps, and boys' Schools of the 20th.

Knot
HThe Fate-goddess wove and tied together the threads of life, accord
ing to the ancients. Marriage is still called "tying the knot" because it
used to be viewed as a binding of two life-threads by the Goddess
Aphrodite, or Juno. Egyptians' Isis-Hathor bound or loosed the lives of
men with Tat, the Knot of Fate, and taught the art of making magic
Inots. Sometimes she bore the title of the knot itself, Tait. High-ranking
Egyptians were promised she would personally weave their cere
ments, including "bandages from the hand of Tait." l In Egypt, holy
mysteries in general were shetat, "she-knots." 2
511



Knot The Knot of Fate came into Greek myth as the famous Gordian
Knot severed by the sword of Alexander, in fulfillment of the ^^^^^^^^^^m prophecy that whoever could "unravel" the knot would become lord of
all Asia. The original knot was the marriage tie of Phrygia's sacred
king, alternately Gordius or Midas, sons and bridegrooms of the Magna Mater. The knot was fastened to the yoke of the oxcart on which
Gordius entered into his kingdom, as the oracle announced in terms
similar to the Bible's description of Jesus's triumphal entry into
Jerusalem: "Phrygians, your new king is approaching with his bride, seated in an ox-cart!" 3
Pagan religions related the art of knotting to "binding" and "loosing" the forces of creation and destruction, the same power
claimed by the papacy for the alleged heirs of St. Peter (Matthew
16:19). (See Peter, Saint.) The windings of Fate and the mysteries of Nature were often symbolized by elaborate knotwork, as in the intricate knot-patterns of Scandinavian and Saracenic monuments. Witches of Finland, Lapland, and the northern islands bound the
winds in magic knots and sold them to credulous sailors, who would
use the knots to try to control the winds at sea, as Odysseus's sailors did
with Aeolus's bag of winds. Such magic was still common in the late
16th century.4 Scottish witches were said to raise winds and storms by
soaking a knotted rag in water and beating it on a stone to make drops
fly like rain, saying:
Iknok this rag upone this stane To raise the wind in the divellis name
It sail not lye till I please againe. 5
In 1814 Sir Walter Scott found one Bessie Millie selling "winds
by the devil's help" to sailors in the form of knotted cords.6 British
witches claimed to stop nosebleeds by tying knots in red thread, the
classic Fate-weaver's blood symbol. 7 Weaver's thread was also thought to cure "diseases of the groin" when knotted with a widow's name
pronounced at each knot.8 On the other hand, witches could make men
impotent with a magic knot called "ligature." Predictably, men said this was a "detestable impiety" deserving the death penalty. According
to a canon of the church, God's opinion was self-contradictory. Ligature could occur only with God's permission and could be cured only "with God's help." 9
The Jews so feared magic knots that rabbinic law forbade tying any
knots on the Sabbath; though one rabbi said it was legal to tie a knot
that could be untied with one hand. 10 Moslems said Mohammed nearly
died of a sickness prepared by Jewish witches with a "cord of knots,"
which was discovered in time to save his life. The knots were loosened
by speaking verses of the Koran. Moslems still believe that Surah CXIII of the Koran will stop "the evil of women who are blowers on
knots." 11
Knot magic is performed by the Mexican recibidora (midwife) in
512



complicated tyings of umbilical cords. 12 Greeks still remember the Kobolds life-knots of the Moerae, saying of a dead man, "his thread is cut." ,J Koran The same triple Fates govern the "Nordic Knot" of three interlock- ^^^^^^^^^^^
ing triangles, known as the Knot of the Vala. 14 Formed of three
female-genital symbols, this invoked the Great Vala (Freya) who wove the fates of men.

Kobolds
Germanic earth-gnomes inhabiting caves and mines, ruled by the dwarf-king Alberich (British Oberon). Their name descended from
Greek kaballoi, horse-riders, which formerly referred to "Amazonian" tribes led by the Goddess. She was called Oberon's spouse,
Titania, queen of the Titans who were, of course, the earth-giants
worshipped by pre-Hellenic Pelasgian peoples, who resisted the Olympian gods. 1 Similarly the kobolds lived underground, and resisted the
rule of new celestial deities.
l.deGivry, 315.
Koran
Mohammedan scriptures, often erroneously thought to have been written by Mohammed. Moslems don't believe this. 1 But many don't
I know the Koran was an enlarged, revised version of the ancient
I Word of the Goddess Kore, revered by Mohammed's tribe, the
Koreshites (Children of Kore), who guarded her shrine at Mecca.
The original writing was done long before Mohammed's time by holy imams, a word related to Semitic ima, "mother." 2 Like the
(original mahatmas or "great mothers" in India, the original imams were Iprobably priestesses of the old Arabian matriarchate. It was said they
(took the scriptures from a prototype that existed in heaven from the
(beginning of eternity, "Mother of the Book" i.e., the Goddess (herself, wearing the Book of Fate on her breast as Mother Tiamat wore
the Tablets of Destiny. Sometimes the celestial Koran was called the [(Preserved Tablet. 3 There was some resemblance between this and other
legendary books of divine origin, such as the Ur-text, the Book of Irhoth, and the Emerald Tablet of Hermes.
As in the case of the Judeo-Christian Bible, the Koran was much
liewritten to support new patriarchal laws and to obliterate the figures
|)f the Goddess and her priestesses. See Arabia.

Kore
Neolithic Asia knew
a mysterious Goddess Ker, or Car, ancestress of the Carians. 1 Her city in the Chersonese was
Cardia, "the Goddess Car." Kardia became the Greek word for "heart," as cor became the Latin; both descended from the Goddess who was the world-heart.
The same syllable is found in words for maternal blood
relationships: Gaelic cairdean, kinship; Turkish kardes,
maternal siblings. 2 The Goddess became Kardia ton kosmos: "Heart of the World." 5
Kore
Greek Holy Virgin, inner soul of Mother Earth (Demeter); a name
so widespread, that it must have been one of the earliest designations of the World Shakti or female spirit of the universe. Variations include
Ker, Car, Q're, Cara, Kher, Ceres, Core, Sanskrit Kaur or Kauri, alternate names for the Goddess Kali.
Shrines of Karnak in Egypt and Carnac in Brittany were sites of
gigantic temples and funerary complexes over 5000 years ago, dedicated to Kar or Kore. France had similar shrines in similarly-named
locations, Kerlescan, Kercado, Kermario.4 The last name combined
the pagan Virgin with the Goddess Mari, who was sometimes her
daughter, her mother, or herself, like Kali embodied in Kel-Mari. 5 Inhabitants of Carnac, and of Carnuntum on the Danube, called
themselves in Roman times the Carnutes, "people born of the Goddess Car." 6
In Egypt's early dynastic period there was a place called Kerma
(Mother Ker) in Nubia, where mass sacrifices took place. A similar
name, Kara, was held in reverence by several early Egyptian rulers.
Egyptians spoke of an eastern land called Kher, and called Palestine
the country of Kharu. 7 Car or Carna was known to the Romans as "a Goddess of the olden time," whose archaic worship was connected with Karneia
festivals of Sparta and the classic Roman Carnival. 8 Sometimes she was
Carmenta, "the Mind of Car," who invented the Roman alphabet.9
An extremely old temple on the Caelian Hill was dedicated to her. 10 A
later variation of her name was Ceres, origin of such words as cereal,
corn, kernel, core, carnal, cardiac. In the east this ancient Goddess was everywhere. Some said she
was Artemis Caryatis, mother of the Caryatides of the Laconian
temple of Caryae. 11 The Tyrian seaport of Caraalis (modern Cagliari) was sacred to her. 12 One of Israel's oldest shrines, the "garden" called Mount Carmel, was her place and that of her baalim (gods). 13
Kore was a great power in Coptic religion, with a flourishing cult at Alexandria in the 4th century a.d. Her festival, the Koreion, was held
each January 6, later assimilated to Christianity as the feast of Epiphany.
Kore's festival celebrated the birth of the new year god Aeon to the Virgin, whose naked image was carried seven times around the temple,
decorated with gold stars and the sign of the cross. The priests announced to the public that the Virgin had brought forth the Aeon. 14
The Koreion passed into British tradition as the Kirn, or Feast of
Ingathering, which the church later changed to the Feast of Our Lady of Mercy. Kirn was a cognate of the Greek kern or sacred womb
vase in which the grain god was reborn. 15 Here again the Kore or Ker
was a virgin mother. The Goddess's harvest instrument, a moon-sickle,
represented even the Christian version of the festival. 16 The classic myth of Kore's abduction by Pluto was another
514



instance of a god's usurpation of the Goddess's power, according to Gnostic sources. "Plutonius Zeus . . . does not possess the nourishment
for all mortal living creatures, for it is Kore who bears the fruit." 17 Kore's resurrection represented the seasonal return of vegetation. She
was also the World Soul animating each human soul, and looking out of the eyes. Reflection in the pupil of an eye was known as the Kore or
"Maiden" in the eye. To the Arabs, it was the "baby" in the eye.
The Bible calls either a daughter or a soul "the apple of thine eye"
(Proverbs 7:2); and of course, every apple had a Kore.

Krishna
Popular incarnation of Shiva, born of Devaki, "the Goddess"; an
nounced by a star and by angelic voices; presented with gifts by shepherds and wise men; hailed as Redeemer, Firstborn, Sin Bearer, Liberator, Universal Word; survivor of a Slaughter of the Innocents,
probably the original one on which the myths of Sargon, Moses, Nimrod, Cronus, Mordred, and Jesus were based. 1 Unlike the western Christos, however, Krishna was an erotic god.
His adventures with the Gopis (Milkmaids) present a classic of
religious pornography. His favorite mistress was the insatiable Radha,
"Elephant-woman," another form of Maya as the consort of the
elephant-god Ganesha. Krishna met the sacred king's usual sacrificial death, hanging

Kris Kringle
"Christ of the Wheel," title of the Norse year-god born at the winter
solstice (Christmas) as the sun god born again. His title seems to have
applied to a sacrificial victim on a fiery wheel. Today he is identified
with Santa Claus. See Nicholas, Saint.
Krittikas
"Cutters" or "razors," Hindu name for the seven Pleiadic sisters called
Mothers of the World, who chose, judged, castrated, and killed sacred
kings. Their title gave rise to Greek kritikos, "judge." See Pleiades.
Kteis
Greek word for a comb, cowrie, scallop, or vulva; symbol of the feminine Gate of Life. Pilgrims to Aphrodite's shrines carried a kteis in token of a state of grace (chads). The custom continued in the name
of St. James of Compostela.
Kula
Hindu "flower" or "nectar," euphemism for menstrual blood,
corresponding to biblical "flowers" (Leviticus 15). A girl "bore the Kula flower" at first menstruation, which assimilated her to the clan spirit
dwelling in maternal bloodlines. 1 In Fiji, the same word described a
newly circumcised adolescent boy, whose flow of genital blood was
supposed to connect him to the tribe and give him fertility magic like
that of the kula girl.

Kumarbi
Hittite god who made himself pregnant by biting off the genitals of his predecessor, Father Heaven. Having no vagina, Kumarbi had to be
cut open to deliver his offspring, as in the biblical myth of Adam's
birth-giving. Like Kumarbi, the Chinese ancestor-god Kun managed to
516



become pregnant but his belly had to be opened to give birth. 1 Many Kundalini
similar myths suggest constant male experimentation in primitive times, Kupparu to find a way for envious men or gods to copy the female magic of re- ^^^^^^^^^^^
production. See Birth-Giving, Male.
l.Hallet, 180.
Kundalini
Tantric image of the female serpent coiled in the lowest chakra of
the human body, in the pelvis. An aim of Tantric yoga was to "realize
Kundalini" by certain exercises and meditations, such as yoni-mudra:
contraction of the perineal muscles, training men to suppress ejaculation. If Kundalini could be induced to uncoil and mount through the
spinal chakras to the brain, the adept would experience the bliss of her
emergence as the "thousand-petaled lotus" from the top of the head, which meant union of the self with the infinite. Tibetan lamas still
consider the most secret, sacred mantra the one that wakens the sleeping Kundalini and causes her to rise. 1
1. BardoThodol, 221.
I Kupala
Slavonic "Water-Mother" derived from the springtime Aphrodite who annually renewed her virginity and the vitality of nature with
baptism. Worshippers of Kupala bathed themselves in rivers and
purified their souls with the "dew of Kupala" gathered during the night of her festival. They would pray: "I come to thee, little water-mother,
with head bowed and repentant. Forgive me, pardon me and ye, too, ancestors and forefathers of the water." Kupala was also connected
with the mystic Fire-flower of the fern, supposed to bloom exactly at
midnight once a year, on the night of the Goddess's festival. It was guarded by demons, but if someone wise and bold enough to outsmart the demons managed to seize the flower, he would understand the
language of trees. 1 This was a typical shaman's myth of the prize of
secret knowledge, obtained at great risk, in the talismanic form of a
female symbol.

Kupparu

Kurukulla
Dravidian "Goddess of Caverns," one of the primeval matrikadevis

Kvaen
"Queen" in Old Norse; title of a Scandinavian tribal ruler, according to Roman writers, who called northern Europe the "Land of Women" because of the authority of women in the homes and temples. 1 The
Kvaen of Faeroisland (the Faroe Islands, or the western paradise)
became the Lady of Ancestral Spirits, or Queen of the Ghostworld, who entered medieval romantic literature as the Fairy Queen.

Kvasir
"Wisest of all men" in Scandinavian myth, a sacrificial victim created
by the gods of Asgard for the sole purpose of adding his blood to
the symbolic uterus, the great Triple Cauldron under the earth. Kvasir represented a masculine effort to take over the "wise blood" of
women, which was thought to create children out of female internal
essence. See Cauldron; Menstrual Blood. Once Kvasir's magic
blood was in the cauldron, Odin stole it from the Earth-giantess and
gave it to the male gods. 1

cross that Constantine saw in the sky. The earliest descriptions contradict this. The labarum was not the sign of the cross; it didn't
appear in the sky; it was not even a Christian symbol. W% Lactantius said the emperor was "directed in a dream to cause a

in fact the emblem of the soldiers' god Mithra, whose worship was

Labarum sign claimed it was formed of the letters chi and rho, for Christos.
However, a series of holy signs from Philae show that the labarum
evolved from the Egyptian ankh. 2 Pious hagiographers of the Middle Ages paid no attention to Lactantius. They declared that Constantine saw in the sky "the
image of a cross described in shining light; and above the image was
written in letters of gold the legend: 'In this sign shalt thou conquer!'" 3 This was the orthodox Christian myth, which survived. There were other forms of the labarum or Chrismon (Christ
monogram). Most common today is the combination of letters IHS,
often with a cross surmounting the H. This is called a signum dei,
supposed to mean Iesus Hominum Salvator, "Jesus, Savior of Man."
Taylor said the same letters had a mystic meaning in Orphic resurrec
tion cults, where they were not Latin but Greek letters: iota, eta,
sigma.
IHS are Greek characters, by ignorance taken for Roman letters; and Yes, which is the proper reading ofthose letters, is none other than the very identical name ofBacchus, that is, ofthe Sun, of which Bacchus
was one of the most distinguished personifications; and Yes, or IES, with the Latin termination US added to it, is Jesus. The surrounding rays
ofglory, as expressive ofthe sun 's light, make the identity ofChrist and Bacchus as clear as the sun. *
According to another interpretation, confusing Constantine's biography with the Mithraic-Christian labarum, the letters meant in hoc
signo (in this sign), and the cross was a magical command: "Conquer!" Yet another tradition confused the labarum with the
Alpha-and-Omega cross, with the Greek letters of creation and
destruction on its right and left arms. 5 This was a further adaptation of
very ancient matriarchal symbols; for Omega was the letter of the
destroying Moon-goddess, and Alpha was the sacred river of her blood
that gave birth to all things. (See Styx.)

Labrys
i The double-bladed ax wielded as a scepter by the ancient Amazonian
: Goddess under her various names of Gaea, Rhea, Demeter, or Artemis.
I It was a ceremonial weapon, though perhaps originally used as a battle-ax by Scythian female warriors. When a male priesthood took
j
over the Goddess's shrine at Delphi, founded by Cretan "Amazons,"
j they adopted the labrys also and gave themselves the title of Labryadae,
I "ax-bearers." The title was still used in classical times. 1 It may have
< been based on a traditional male scepter-bearer in the Goddess's
I processions in earlier centuries, perhaps even the sacred youth
himself, consecrated to the hieros gamos, and displaying a "phallic" ! symbol of his imminent union and sacrifice.
In modern times the labrys has been adopted by lesbians as a
I symbol of reminiscence, in jewelry or art, of the all-female com
munity of Lesbos and its founding mothers who worshipped only the j Goddess in nature and in each other.

Labyrinth
Labyrinth
"House of the Double Ax," from labrys, the ceremonial ax used to
sacrifice bulls to the Cretan Moon-goddess. The classic Labyrinth was
the palace of Minos, "Moon-king," whose spirit dwelt in the sacred bull, the Minotaur or Moon-bull, a Cretan form of Apis, who was
similarly sacrificed in Egypt. 1 Minos was a Lord of Death and an underworld judge, a western counterpart of the Hindu Moon-bull Yama, who functioned in the same way. 2
The mystic meaning of a labyrinthine design was a journey into the otherworld and out again, like the sacred king's cyclic journeys
into death and rebirth. Early labyrinthine designs on coins, caves, tombs, etc. referred to the earth-womb. The classic labyrinth was not a maze
to get lost in; it had only one path, traversing all parts of the figure. Such labyrinths were meant for ceremonial walking, "almost always con
nected with a cave. ... In those cases where the ritual has been
preserved, the labyrinth itself, or a drawing of it, is invariably situated at the entrance of the cave or dwelling." 5
Labyrinth-games were played by witches for ceremonial purposes. Some descended to the nursery level, like the game Troy Town still
played by children on a pattern of seven labyrinthine circles cut in sod.4
Some labyrinths were taken over by Christian churches and
incorporated into floor patterns, gardens, or hedges. Some were insinuated into church designs by masonic brotherhoods as secret
Gnostic symbols. Chartres Cathedral had a labyrinth with the six
lobed device of Aphrodite at its center. The path of the labyrinth was
exactly 666 feet long, Aphrodite's sacred number. 5 (See Hexagram.) The central lotus once bore the names of the master builders, who

Lachesis
"The Measurer," second of the three Fates or Moerae in Greek
religion; corresponding to the second person of Kali as the Preserver.
She who measured out the life-span of every creature was the same as the Goddess who preserved life up to the time when it must end, and Atropos the Cutter took over from Lachesis.
LaDama
"The Lady," worshipped by Basque witches in a sacred cave of the Amboto mountains. 1 In Semitic languages, Dama also meant "bloodmother."

Book ofthe Dead Common name for the
collection of
Egyptian funerary papyri written between 1500 and 1350
B.C., including Vignettes, Hymns, Chapters, and descriptive Rubrics. Among the best
preserved, and most
typical, copies of the Theban Recension of the Book ofthe Dead is the muchstudied Papyrus of Ani.
Ladder
Jacob's Ladder was a copy of the Egyptian "Ladder of Set," whereby a king or prophet might climb up to heaven "when he hath made use ol the words of power of Ra." The Book ofthe Dead said a pharaoh
might become Lord of the Ladder, assisted into heaven by a prayer that
he was taught: "Homage to thee, O divine Ladder. Homage to thee,
O Ladder of Set! Stand thou upright, O divine Ladder. Stand thou
upright, O Ladder of Set! Stand thou upright, O Ladder of Horus,
whereby Osiris appeared in heaven when he used the words of power o Ra." 1
The dead king's subjects were assured that "the gods made a ladder
for (him) that he might ascend to heaven on it." The king's funerary
inscriptions said, "I set up a ladder to heaven among the gods." 2 The ladder to heaven was a relic of shamanistic death-rebirth
ceremonies. It was ascended by kings, prophets, sages, bodhisattvas, anc other Enlightened Ones, the "angels" on the ladder in Jacob's dream (Genesis 28:12). Among central Asian tribes the "soul ladder" was a
post fixed on the grave, with fourteen notches representing the "steps"
or days of the moon in ascent. A similar Heavenly Ladder was made in !
India with wooden sword blades, which the priest must climb to perforrj sacramental decapitation of a white cock at the top. Chinese shamans ol
high priests ascended a ladder of knives, walking barefoot on the edges as an initiatory ordeal. 3
Priest-kings in antiquity climbed soul-ladders to meet the Goddess)
524
j&T:



bn the occasion of their hieros gamos and also after death, when their fcouls returned to the Mother who bore them. Sometimes the ladder was
berceived as a familiar passageway between the Goddess in heaven and
per consort the king on earth. Kosingas of Thrace controlled his subjects
py threatening to ascend his special wooden ladder to the Great Goddess Hera, to complain to her of their conduct and invoke her Lvrath on them. 4
As a rule the soul-ladder passed through the seven heavens, like
me axis rnundi in Gnostic cosmology. Celsus said initiates into the
Mithraic Mysteries climbed a klimaxox ladder of seven rungs. 5 The first
[ung was lead for Saturn, the second tin for Venus, the third bronze for
lupiter, the fourth iron for Mercury, the fifth "monetary alloy" for Mars, the sixth silver for the moon, and the seventh gold for the sun. At
the top, a platform represented the sphere of the fixed stars, the Empyrean. 6 As a symbol of ecstatic initiatory ascents in the sacred Mysteries,
[he ladder was carried over into Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
Mohammed's vision like Jacob's was "a ladder rising from the temple in
Jerusalem (pre-eminently the 'Center') to heaven, with angels to right pnd left; on this ladder the souls of the righteous mounted to God." 7
Both Jacob's ladder and Mohammed's were based on much earlier
Egyptian representations of the pharaoh being welcomed into heaven by the gods, who helped him up the last rungs of his ascent. 8 Like the
ladders of Set, Osiris, and Buddha, the ladder of the pharaoh had 14
[tteps, alluding to the waxing days of the lunar cycle. Another 14 steps
[represented the descending part of the cycle, into the underworld and
Ipack. There were many "ladder-saints" in Syria and Persia during the
ffth century a.d., when ladder-sitting or pillar-sitting became a fad [among holy hermits. St. Simeon Stylites was a famous Christian pillar
laint, glorified for remaining motionless so long that his living limbs Developed gangrene. One of his followers and admirers was named St.
Badoth (Persian Schiadurte). The legend of this saint said he saw a
i'ision of Simeon at the top of heaven-reaching ladder, calling down to
liim, "Mount up, Sadoth; fear not! I mounted yesterday; it is your turn
|oday." Shortly afterward, Sadoth was martyred and climbed up to
|ieaven. 10 The sacred klimax was so popular in Byzantine and Gnostic
conography that it was even canonized as a bogus saint, John Clima
us. A mystical book supposed to have been written by him appeared at
Vlt. Sinai in the 7th century a.d., the Ladder to Paradise." This St.
ohn was said to have been an abbot at the Sinai monastery, but his
urname suggested a Tantric adept. The klimax was more than a ladder;
is its modern usage suggests, it was also an ascent to sexual bliss through
narriage with the Goddess. Some Gnostic sects were still using the
adder as a symbol of the soul's marriage in the Middle Ages.

Lamb
Lady
Anglo-Saxon hkf-dige, "the Giver of Bread." 1 In ancient matriarchal
societies, women had charge of food storehouses and of doling out
harvests to members of their clan. "Lord" came from hlaf-ward, the
guardian of the bread; for the husband of the tribal mother had the job of protecting food stores against vandalism or unauthorized removal. 2
Thus the God who gave daily bread, as in the Lord's Prayer,
usurped ancient feminine prerogatives. In a way his spouse remained the "giver," for the Latin Madonna, like "my lady," retained the same
implication of My-Mother-Who-Gives.
1. Brewster, 349. 2. Funk, 257.
Laius
"The King," who preceded Oedipus. He was called the father of his
killer, because kings who were slain by their successors were commonly
given the title of father to the killer-son, to indicate that the divine
spirit of the god passed from one to the other. See Kingship.
Lakshmi
Hindu Goddess of Sovereignty, by whose authority Indra claimed to be king of the gods. Lakshmi gave him a drink of Soma or "wise blood"
from her own body, so he could produce the illusion of birth-giving
and wear the many-colored veils of Maya. 1 All the oldest Indo
European gods had similar claims to sovereignty through feminine essences. See Menstrual Blood.
l.Rees,75.
Lamb
Totemic symbol of Christ, based on the Jewish custom of sacrificing a firstborn lamb to Yahweh at Passover, as a substitute for the primitive
sacrifices of firstborn sons that Yahweh originally demanded (Exodus
13:2). As the Lamb of God (agnus dei), Jesus was supposed to redeem the firstborn son Adam, and through him the whole human race, which must be "washed in the blood of the Lamb," as the church
taught. Throughout the Middle Ages, orthodox theology insisted that
526



Adam was buried on Golgotha at the exact spot where Jesus's cross Lamhussu stood, so the blood of the Lamb-savior ran down into the earth and Lammas brought salvation to Adam's remains. 1 Eve was not buried there,
however; theologians said nothing whatever about her salvation. The medieval name of Agnus Dei was given to cakes of wax
stamped with the figure of a lamb and sold by the papacy, which preserved an exclusive monopoly on their sale by a papal bull of 1471. This charm was in great demand, as it was advertised as sure
protection against all kinds of destructive storms the "acts of God" as
defined by theologians. 2 In effect, the power of the Son was invoked to protect humanity against the wrath of his Father.
l.Eliade,S.,268. 2. H. Smith, 276.
Lamhussu
Dark-red royal garment of Babylonian kings, the blood-color assumed by their surrogate sacrificial victims in the Sacaea festival; the same
"scarlet" (Matthew 27:28) or "purple" (Mark 15:17) color worn by Jesus as sacred king. See Menstrual Blood; Purple.
Lamia
[ Greek name for the Libyan serpent-goddess Medusa, Neith, I Athene, Anatha, or Buto. 1 Lamia was probably a variant of Babylonian I Lamashtu, "Mother of Gods" worshipped at Der as a serpent with a | woman's head. Though Lamashtu was feared as a Kali-like Destroyer,
H yet she was also revered as a supreme Goddess, called Daughter of
| Heaven and Great Lady. 2 Greek myth made her another rival of Hera.
The Latin Vulgate Bible gave "Lamia" as a translation of Hebrew
I Lilith, Adam's recalcitrant first wife. The Authorized Version ren
I dered lamia as a screech owl. The Revised Version translated the same
I word as "night monster." During the Middle Ages, lamia became a
I general term for a witch. A 1 5th-century German professor of theology I stated authoritatively that lamiae were "demons in the shape of old I women." ? See Vagina Dentata.

>axon Hlaf-mass, the Feast of Bread, was a major summertime
estival of the Great Goddess of the grain: Ceres, Ops, Demeter or
Juno Augusta, ruler of the harvest month of August. Lammas was the "Eve" of this month of ripening, often classified with May Eve and
r
Halloween as a festival of witches, because the church didn't succeed
eradicating its pagan significance. 1 Sometimes Lammas was identified

527



Lancelot with the Celtic midsummer festival of Lugnasad, celebrating the
death and resurrection of Lug as grain god. Churchmen said Lammas
mmaammmmmmmm^mm was one or
" me witches' four annual Great Sabbaths, based on the
four seasonal festivals of the pagan year.
1. Brewster, 349.
Lancelot
Arthurian hero based on early Celtic conceptions of the phallic
lightning god Lanceor, the Golden Lance, mated to Colombe, the Dove, a northern version of Aphrodite Columba. 1 Like the Oriental
vajra, meaning phallus, jewel, or lightning, Lanceor descended into the Goddess's abyssal womb to fertilize the world. Thus Plutarch stated
that Lightning was the impregnator of the Waters. 2
Though anthropomorphized in romance as a knight of the Round
Table, Lancelot showed signs of his pagan origin: he was still the lover of the Mother, and the reincarnation of his own elder self. He lay
with Elaine, or Elen, or Helen, or Eileen, or Hel-Aine, the same Goddess worshipped at the Celtic lunar shrine of Cnoc Aine. 3 She was the Weaver of Fate, and she made Lancelot invincible with her gift
of a vaginal fetish, a red silk sleeve. She was also Lancelot's queen
mother Elaine, who christened him Galahad, the same name given his younger reincarnation or "son." The elder hero received the name
Lancelot when he was initiated by the Lady of the Lake in her magic
Land of Women.4
Like Osiris-Horus, Apollo-Heracles, Zeus-Zagreus, God-Jesus, and other versions of the ubiquitous father-son deity, Lancelot
became a Lord of Death and a keeper of the paradise-castle, which
appeared in the romances as Joyous Gard, the "Happy World." Lancelot stole Arthur's queen, living symbol of the land of Britain, after rescuing her from a fiery death at the stake, on a conviction of witchcraft. It was she who announced that Lancelot came from Jesus
Christ in the 8th generation, while Galahad was of the 9th genera
tion. 5 Though medieval churchmen insisted that Jesus never begot
children, the heathen bards continued to popularize the contrary
belief because it was the best way to account for the old concept of
successive reincarnations.
Like many other figures of Celtic romance, Lancelot seems to
have developed out of Oriental Tantric traditions. He resembled the
Tantric saint Padma-sambhava, the Lake-Born Vajra, i.e., a phallic lightning-bolt reborn from the Water-Mother as Lady of the Lake. 6
The Dove of the Sea was his mother-bride, symbol of the Abyss (Maria). Lancelot's name, "Big Lance," might be compared to the other primitive Tantric-Celtic hero Peredur Paladrhir, "Spearman with a Long Shaft," which described the ithyphallic god in union with his
Goddess. 7
528



Lancelot's origin in Meidelant, "Land of Maidens," also suggests Lapis Manalis an early date and an Oriental root of his basic myth. 8 He suggested Lat
Krishna who was raised by "holy women" in a sacred grove, and grew ^^^^^^^^^^^m
up to be an eminently sexual god.9 Lancelot was not a solar deity but
the rival of the sun god, represented by Gawain, with whom Lancelot
fought a great battle, defeating him when his strength ebbed at the end of the solar day.

Lapis Manalis
"Stone of the Underworld," or of the dead, the sacred stone covering the pit of the manes on Rome's Palatine Hill. At the annual festival of
Mania, the Ancestral Moon-mother, the stone was removed and her
children the manes or ghosts-of-ancestors were invited to join the feast.
Sometimes the festival was called Parentalia, since the ghosts in the
underworld were the same as the diparentes or "parent-gods" from past
ages.
1
Northern Europeans celebrated the same kind of festival at Hal
loween or Samhain, also a feast to which ancestral ghosts were
invited.
1. Lamusse, 213.
Lara
Short name of the Roman Goddess Acca Larentia, mother of the lares or household spirits. She was honored at the annual Larentalia, a
festival inherited from pre-Roman times. See Akka.
Lat
Italian latte, "milk," descended from the milk-giving Goddess Lat,
eponymous Mother of pre-Roman Latium. She was also Latona, or Leto, mother of the World Egg and the sun. 1 Arabs knew her as Al
Lat, the Moon, later masculinized as the Islamic Allah. She was well
known in pre-dynastic Egypt. Herodotus called her "an archaic queen of the Lower Kingdom." Hers was one of Egypt's oldest oracular
shrines, which the Greeks knew as Latopolis. 2 To the Egyptians, this place was Menhet, "House of the Moon." 5 Lat was the Moon because the ancient world regarded the moon
the universal source of nourishment: a celestial Breast that pro
duced the Milky Way. From the moon came water, milk, blood, plant
sap, and all other life-supporting fluids.
529



Leda Lat was the foundress of Latin matriarchal culture. The old word
Left Hand latifundia meant parcels of land allotted to clan matriarchs by the
^^^^^i^^ Goddess herself.4 See Matrilineal Inheritance. The island of Malta
was once Ma Lata, "Mother Lat."
In 1428, the church totally destroyed an Italian town whose
residents were suspected of heretical opinions. Oddly enough, the town was named Magnalata: "Great Lat."
1. Graves, W.G., 318. 2. Larousse, 29. 3. Budge, G.E. 2, 50. 4. Cumont, M.M., 74.
Leda
"Lady" or "Woman," another name of the Goddess Lat, who laid the World Egg and hatched Castor and Pollux, the morning and
evening stars; and Helen, the earthly incarnation of the Moon
goddess; and Clytemnestra, who was to Mycenae as Helen was to Troy. Mythographers confused Leda with Nemesis, who coupled with Zeus when he took the form of a swan-king. Thus she became the famous Goose that Laid the Golden Egg (the sun, Apollo) under her other name, Leto. 1 To the Egyptians, this was the Nile Goose, Hathor. A favorite theme of medieval artists was the coupling of Leda with
the swan-god, which permitted an erotic subject to be shown without involvement of a human male figure.
1. Graves, G.M. 1,207.
Left Hand
Latin sinister, "left," came to mean diabolic, witchlike; dexter,
"right," yielded dextrous, meaning skilful or clever. Ambidextrous is
literally "two right hands." Right-ness is associated with righteous
ness, rectitude, rectification, good right hand, adroitness (from French a
droite, "to the right"). Left is gauche, clumsy or stupid, with its English derivatives gawk, gawky. Italian mancino, "left," means deceit
ful. German link, "left," means wrong, backward, perverse. Anglo-Saxon lyft meant weak or worthless. The evil eye was said to be
the left one. 1 According to the Brahmans, left-handedness goes
against the grain of decency. 2 Jewish mystics said God's left hand is the
hand that destroys. Satanael or Sammael the death-god personifies God's left side. 3 The Gospel of Nicodemus said the thief crucified at
Jesus's right hand received the kingdom of heaven; the thief crucified
at his left hand was damned.4 Superstitious folk still believe it's lucky to
see the new moon over one's right shoulder but disastrous to see it
over the left. 5
Sagan asks, "In the worldwide associations of the words 'right' and
'left' there is evidence of a rancorous conflict early in the history of mankind. What could arouse such powerful emotions?" 6
530



What else, indeed, but patriarchs' battle of the sexes?
All myths agree that the right side was male, the left side female.
Wherever the deity was an androgyne, this arrangement was fol
owed. Typical was the Hindu bisexual deity Bhava, "Existence," with a woman's left side and a man's right, signifying "man together with Mature" and showing that all Existence is made up of two sexes.
\ndrogynous idols of Kali and Shiva showed the same arrangement. 7 Greek Pelopids tattooed themselves with a female symbol on the left shoulder in honor of maternal ancestry, a male symbol on
the right shoulder for paternal ancestors. Egyptians said the left hand
^represented the Goddess Maat, the right hand her consort Thoth.
Babylonians prayed: "Let my goddess stand at my left hand! Let my god istand at my right hand!" 8
The Jews said the seed of female children emanated from a father's left testicle, while that of male children emanated from his right
testicle. 9 This ancient belief persisted among Christians even up to the
present century. In 1891 a book entitled Essentials of Conception
said a man could "progenate a male or female child at will, by putting
an elastic band around the testicle not required. Semen from the right
testicle progenates male, whilst that from the left female children." 10
According to some rabbinical traditions, the left hand of God was
1
{female, which may have been why patriarchs thought it necessary not |to let "thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth" (Matthew 6:3).
Rabbis taught that "A wise man's heart is at his right hand: but a
(fool's heart is at his left" (Ecclesiastes 10:2). Matriarchal societies
believed the menstrual blood that made a child in a mother's womb
was her heart's blood, engendered on the left side of the body; but the
patriarchs displaced the heart to the right. In a sense, modern research has found some physical basis for
pelief in the left/female, right/male imagery of the ancients. The left hemisphere of the brain, which controls the right side of the body, is said
to evolve logical thought sequences and suppress sensory input that might interfere with problem solving. The right hemisphere, governing
the left side of the body, is called the intuitive, creative, or imaginative
part of the brain. It is supposed to generate the more sensitive, broader
awareness and response made manifest in feelings, empathy, fantasy,
art, visual imagery, and inspiration: many of its qualities were belittled by
patriarchal thinkers as incomprehensible "women's intuition." n This
is an over-simplification, since both hemispheres work together in both fexes, and their functions are not neatly divisible. One half of a brain
could hardly exist without the other.
India prized intuitive thinking somewhat more than logical think
ing, and recognized two Ways to religious revelation: the male, solar,
ascetic "way to the gods" known as the Right-Hand Path; and the female, lunar, sensual way of the Goddess, known as Varna Marg or the Left-Hand Path literally, the Female Way. 12 Tantric yogis recog
nized the left side of the body as the seat of every man's "female
soul" or shakti, with whom he would be united after death. In token of
Left Hand
Pelopids Tribes claiming descent from
Pelops, a legendary sacred king sacrificed, partly devoured, and resurrected by Mother Demeter; inhabitants
of the Peloponnese.
531



Left Hand reverence for the indwelling female soul, the yogis always entered a
place of worship with the left foot forward. 13
mm^^^mm^^^^m Europe's pagan customs, embodied in "witchcraft," maintained
the virtues of left-sidedness against prevailing patriarchal opinion. Witches said itching or burning of the left ear betokened joy in the near future, while the same sensations of the right ear meant sorrow. 14
Witches' dances circled to the left, counterclockwise, moonwise, or "widdershins" as folk dances still do following the retrograde
motion of the moon instead of the clockwise motion of the sun. The
medieval church said dancing, turning, or circumambulating in this direction was heresy. During the centuries of persecution, countless
people were burned alive for dancing widdershins, especially if they turned their backs to the center of the circle. Back-to-back dancing was
evidently considered indecent, though widely practiced. 15 The pagans were firmly in favor of the widdershins direction. Pre
Christian kings in Scandinavia were expected to lay magic circles of
protection around their cities by circumambulating them widdershins. Irish druidic law insisted on the same counterclockwise movement
around the holy omphalos at Tara, shrine of Mother Earth: "Thou shalt
not go righthandwise around Tara." 16 Tantric influence also directed
Middle-Eastern Sufis to circumambulate their shrines in the widder
shins direction. 17
The Christians reversed the direction of all turning charms, such
as the divinatory magic of St. Andrew's Well on the isle of Lewis.
Sick pilgrims were told to float a wooden bowl on the waters. If the bowl
turned sunwise, the patient understood that he would get well. If it turned moonwise, he would die. 18 Witches were said to make the sign of the cross with their left
hands: another proof of heresy. The left-handed cross in graphic
symbolism was the Oriental moon-swastika, with arms pointing counter
clockwise, an emblem of Kali, as opposed to the sun-swastika, which represented male gods. 19 See Swastika.
The Scottish rite of handfasting was derived from a pagan-Oriental
marriage custom, incorporating the figure-eight Infinity sign that represented union of Kali and Shiva among Tantric yogis and yoginis. The couple joined right hands to unite their "male" souls, then
joined left hands to unite their "female" souls, forming the Infinity sign
with their arms thus crossed. 20 The sign itself is still used in modern
mathematics, but handshakes are now exclusively and significantly
right-handed. Another Tantric sign of male-and-female unity was pressing the
palms of the hands together, fingers upward: this meant two bodies
joined as one. The gesture is still one of greeting and blessing among Indians. During the 12th and 13th centuries when Hindu religious
customs were penetrating Europe, the gesture was adopted by Catharan heretics as the manibus junctis (hand-joining), which the orthodox
church later took to itself. 21 Now it is the standard gesture of prayer,
both east and west.
532



Classic traditions added still more support to the male-female
images of rightness and leftness. While giving birth to the sun and moon
(Apollo and Artemis), the Goddess Leto grasped a male palm tree with her right hand and a female olive tree with her left. 22 When giving
birth to Zeus, the Goddess Rhea placed her hands on the earth to
cause five female spirits to spring up from her left handprint, and five
male spirits from her right handprint (see Fingers). The matriarchal
magic of Medusa was mythically symbolized: blood from her left side could give rebirth to the dead; blood from her right side instantly
destroyed a human body. 25 The Romans still believed in the benevolence of the left side. Plutarch said it was a good omen to see an
augury, such as a flying eagle, on one's left side; an evil omen to see it on the right. 24
Men placed wedding rings on women's left hands to fetter their
magic power and hold their hearts. From the most ancient times, men believed that a certain vessel or vein ran directly from a woman's
heart to the fourth finger of her left hand. This was a remarkably durable belief; Lemnius mentioned it as late as 1658. 25
According to heraldic symbolism, the bend sinister, a stripe slant
ing to the left, signified bastardy or lack of a father. A warrior bearing the bend sinister on his shield was therefore his mother's son only, after
the fashion of the heathen matrilineal clan. Fatherlessness was not
considered a mark of dishonor until Christianity had established the
patriarchal family system throughout Europe. Related to the symbolism of the left and right hands was the
symbolism of east and west. Rome established the four cardinal points
by a north-south line and an east-west line, decumanus. The eastern
half was familiaris, the area of good omens and of the sun. The western half was hostilis, the area of evil omens and of the moon. 26
Since it was the custom to face the "still point" of the heavens the
north celestial pole for orientation of buildings and towns, the left
hand was to the west, the right hand to the east, as maps are still
made. To the west lay the Moon-land, home of the ancestral dead,
called Westerners by the Chinese, Greeks, Celts, and Egyptians. 27 As long ago as the Stone Age, the dead were buried facing west. "To go
west" has always been a synonym for "to die." Death meant a
journey to the western gate of the Mother. Aztecs called the west "the
place of women," where human beings once crawled out of the
genital hole of Mother Earth, to which all the dead must return. 28
On the other hand literally the east was the place of male solar
gods greeted every morning with the formula, "He is risen." The eastern sun-temple of Borsippa was known as the Temple of the Right Hand. 29 The main avenue of Alexandria ran from the Gate of the Sun on the east to the Gate of the Moon on the west. 30 The eastern abt
of an Egyptian temple was the birthplace of the sun god Ra; the west was the place of his dying. 31 This was probably the origin of the eastern
apse in a Christian church, which like the Egyptian abt was "orient
ed" toward the east, birthplace of the sun.
Left Hand
Borsippa Ancient sister city of Babylon, located about 1 5
miles to the southwest; now known as Birs
Nimrud. Borsippa flourished greatly in the 7th and 6th centuries B.C. It was
destroyed by Xerxes I in the 5th, and partly restored by Antiochus I in the 3rd.

Legba Lemnos
Bruce Papyrus Secondcentury Gnostic
manuscript discovered at Nag Hammadi in Upper Egypt during the 1940s.
Archons Gnostic term for good or evil
angels, especially as world-creating or worldgoverning spirits who controlled the phenomena of the stars, heavens, weather, etc.
JohnHuss(ca. 13701415) Bohemian
religious reformer, founder of the Hussite sect which renounced papal
indulgences and the doctrine of transubstantiation. Huss was promised a safe-conduct to defend his views before a church council, but
the promise was broken; he was declared
heretic, arrested, and burned.
Christians taught that the west was the natural home of "demons."
The Bruce Papyrus depicted Jesus revealing to his disciples the magic words that would make evil Archons "flee away to the West, to the Left
Hand." 32 When the Greek church baptized converts, "they first turned their faces to the west, and so renounced the devil, and then to the east, and made their covenant with Christ."" When John Huss was burned for heresy at Constance in 141 5, he was at first bound to th<
stake facing east; but the error was noticed in time, and he was shifted
to face west, the direction "fitting for a heretic." 54
Superstition still maintains the male-and-female symbolism of east
and west. The bad luck caused by spilling salt (symbol of blood) can
be averted by throwing the salt over the left shoulder, toward the west,
relegating the bad luck to the devils. 35
Gypsies believed they could keep a horse from straying by marking the right fore hoof with a male cross, the left fore hoof with a female
ring. 36 The idea was that the sexual symbols would attract one another
and tangle the horse's feet like a hobble.
It is still customary for rulers to hold the "phallic" scepter in the
right hand, the "yonic" orb in the left. This usage descended from
the king's symbolic display of the hieros gamos between himself and
the Goddess of his land. The original meaning was that the ruler
united male and female principles; but the meaning was lost, and only the symbols remained.

Legba
Voodoo god similar to the Trickster or Hermes of classical myth.
Though an ithyphallic god of lust, Legba was also androgynous. In ceremonial dances his part was taken by a girl wearing an erect wooden phallus. He was considered an embodiment of the Word or
logos of the Goddess Fa, "Fate." 1
Hays, 341.
Lemnos
Island shrine of the Goddess Myrine, served by an ancient female
dominant society appearing in Hellenic myth as a race of Amazons
who massacred all their husbands. Afterward, they kept up their
534



numbers by inviting passing mariners to impregnate them. Jason and Lemures the Argonauts called at Lemnos for this purpose. 1 As a center of pre- Lesbians Hellenic religion, Lemnos was sacred to such deities as Aphrodite and ^^^^^^^^^^^
Hephaestus, to whom Father Zeus was distinctly hostile.
1. Graves, G.M. 2, 223.
Lemures
"Ghosts," Roman term for ancestral spirits who rose from their
graves to attend the annual festival of the Lemuria; a synonym for lares,
larvae, or wanes. 1 The mythic lost continent "Lemuria" literally
meant a ghostworld.
1. Lurousse, 213.
Lent
From Saxon Lenet-monath, the lunar month of "lengthening" (of days). Fasting and abstention of the Lenten period was copied from the
Roman Matronalia or Feast of Mothers, celebrated during the Kalends of March and forbidden to men. 1 The women performed their rites in the sacred grove between the Aventine and Palatine hills,
where Sabine women used to sacrifice their harvest-god Consus each
year. 2 After the Matronalia, Roman women observed a period of
chastity and fasting until the festival of Ceres in April. This custom,
originally intended to insure the fertility and vitality of the crops, was copied by the Christian church and converted into the fast of Lent. 3

Lesbians
Amazons took the isle of Lesbos and made it one of their "isles of
women," a sacred colony dedicated to worship of the female principle, as later Christian monasteries were dedicated to worship of the male. 1
In the 6th century B.C., Lesbos was ruled by a group of women devoted
to the service of Aphrodite and Artemis, and the practice of charis,
"grace," meaning music, art, dancing, poetry, philosophy, and romantic "Lesbian" love.
The most famous colonist was the poet Sappho, whose contemporaries said she was even greater than Homer. Her work didn't survive
the book-burnings of the early Christian era. She was one of the first classic authors to be attacked because of her homosexual orientation
and her devotion to the Goddess. By the 8th century a.d., nothing
survived of her large corpus of poetry except a few fragments quoted by other authors. 2
Female homosexuality was generally regarded as a virtually
535



Lethe unthinkable threat in patriarchal societies. Christian Europe regarded Leto lesbianism as "a crime without a name," and sometimes burned
^a^B^H^a^HH^HI lesbians alive without trial. To this day, female homosexuals are credited
with fearful powers; Frank Caprio said "Lesbianism is capable of
influencing the stability of our social structure." 3 Any phallocentric
society would naturally so regard women indifferent to a phallus.
1. Lurousse, 122. 2. Encyc. Brit., "Sappho." 3. Klaich, 89.
Lethe
"Forgetfulness," the Water of Oblivion in the Greek underworld, a
spring giving rise to the River Lethe. According to Orphics and other
mystery-cultists, the spring of Lethe under a white cypress was the first thing to be seen in the underworld by a newly dead soul; and the
soul would be made very thirsty, and would be tempted to drink. Part
of the mystery-cultists' training was to learn endurance of thirst, for a draught of Lethe would wipe out their memories of their previous
incarnations and leave them no wiser than the rest of humanity, always
born again without remembering previous births. The enlightened one should seek instead the spring of Memory (Mnemosyne). "Thou
shalt find to the left of the house of Hades a spring, and by the side
thereof standing a white cypress. To this spring approach not near. But thou shalt find another, from the lake of Memory cold water flowing
forth, and there are guardians before it." l
The location of Lethe in the underworld, in classical and Gnostic
imagery, derived from the ancient oracular cave of the Earth-deities
(Chthonioi) at Lebadeia, where one made elaborate preparations to go down into the dark pit and learn his fate through "things seen" or
"things heard." Among the preparations, "he has to drink the water
called Lethe, in order to achieve forgetfulness of all that he has
hitherto thought of; and on top of it another water, the water of Mnemosyne, which gives him remembrance of what he sees when he has gone down." 2
Classical writers made Lethe one of the principal rivers of the
underworld, along with Acheron, Cocytus, Phlegethon, and Styx. 3

Leto
Mother of the Sun and Moon (Apollo and Artemis) in Greek myth; a Greek form of the eastern fertility-goddess Lat, who was called Latona
or Queen Lat in pre-Roman Latium, her Italian territory.
1 Her Greek myth was confused; she was the mother of the moon (Artemis),
and yet also the daughter of the moon (Phoebe). She was further

'White Mare," Cretan horse-goddess probably descended from the

me's Father Bacchus was also Liber Pater, consort of the Goddess
:ra, or Libra. Their divine marriage took place at the Liberalia on
irch 17, later Christianized as St. Patrick's Day, since Patrick or
icius was a Celtic form of the same god. 1
His Greek form was Dionysus Liber, annually reborn as the
ine Child laid in a winnowing-basket or manger. This ceremony adopted into the legend of the infant Christ, called a son of the god
ce worshipped as Liber in Jerusalem. 2 When the Roman temple of le Great Mother was converted into the church of Santa Maria
aggiore, the manger ceremony remained an essential part of its istmas observances. Usener claimed the church was founded by
Liberius, possibly a confusion with the name of the pagan god. 3
Dionysus.) Votaries of Liber were "libertines." The modern meaning still

libra Libra
Astrological Lady of the Scales, from the Goddess Libera worshipped
^^^^^^^^ in Carthage as Astroarche, Queen of the Stars. Like the Egyptian
Maat , she represented the balancing process of karmic law. Her
figure-eight glyph of "equilibrium" (now the mathematical symbol of infinity) signified action and reaction under the rule of Fate. 1
In astrology, Libra is still "ruled by Venus," because she was
identified with the Roman Venus-Aphrodite of the ius naturale
natural law, matriarchal justice. 2 The blindfold on today's Goddess of
Justice was unknown in antiquity. She not only held the scales of
every man's fate; she also had the All-Seeing Eye. See Tanit.

Liebestod
"Love-Death," the killing of a Germanic sacred king when he married the Goddess, or a Valkyrie who would bear him to heaven. Like the Oriental sage, the Nordic hero was united in death with his
female soul (Shakti), a Heavenly Vala. Most pagan thinkers said the bes death was mystically connected with love. Ovid wrote that he wanted
to die "in the act of coming to Venus." * Heavenly "bliss" was often
confused with orgasm.
1. Cavendish, RE., 51.
Lif
"Life," the new Eve of the next cycle of existence, according to Norse mythology, after destruction of the present universe. Her name was
essentially the same as Eve's title, "Mother of All Living" (Genesis 3:20). Lif 's consort was a subordinate male, Lifthrasir, "Desirer-of
Life." ' The names indicated a belief that Lif would be the true parent of
the new creation, whereas her mate's only purpose was to fertilize her, as
in the oldest known versions of the Adam and Eve myth.
1. H.R.E. Davidson, G.M.V.A., 234.
Lightning
Heavenly-father gods of most Indo-European religions impregnated Mother Earth, or the sea-womb, with phallic lightning bolts. India's Dyaus Pitar, "Father Heaven," wielded the lightning in token of his union with the Goddess; he foreshadowed Greece's Zeus Pater and
Rome's Jupiter, who did the same. Dumuzi, Dionysus, Leviathan, and many other versions of the "fiery serpent" including Lucifer and
Satan figures, were identified with the descending phallus of Heaven, whom Jesus claimed to have seen "fall as lightning" (Luke 10:18).
538



The lightning god's "fall" was not originally a defeat in a celestial Lightning battle but rather a descent into the womb of the Abyss to fertilize the
world. Plutarch said lightning was the impregnator of the Great God- ^^^mgm^^^^^^
dess of the Waters (Maria), and their union was "the cause of vital
heat." '
Lightning was the cosmic phallus of the Vedic fire god Agni,
mated to Kali as the Primordial Abyss. She was said to "quench a
blazing lingam in her yoni." 2 Through ignorance of its sexual meaning, Christians inadvertently preserved the same image of Maria-theWaters rendered fertile by male fire from heaven. The baptismal font of
a Christian church was likened to the womb of Mary, as the ancient
temples' water-cauldrons called "seas" or "abysses" were likened to the
Goddess's womb (see Cauldron). At the consecration of a Christian
font, the burning paschal candle was quenched in the water like Agni's
lingam, with the words, "May a heavenly offspring, conceived in holiness and reborn into a new creation, come forth from the stainless
womb of this divine font." Mary was said to be igne sacro inBammata: fecundated by the sacred fire. 3 This universal notion of the male-female connotations of fire and
water was based on the Tantric view of the water element as Shakti,
the primal liquid power that produced "all fiery elements" i.e., male
deities and their symbols, the sun, fire, lightning.4 The Jewel in the
Lotus, primary Tantric image of maleness enclosed by femaleness, often used for the male element the word vajra, meaning jewel,
phallus, and lightning. 5 The same combination of meanings occurred in Latin Gemma
Cerauniae, lightning literally the Jewel of Ceraunus, the lightning god. 6 Sometimes the "jewel" was a phallic scepter like the Tantric dorje,
"lightning-bolt" or "thunderbolt," also a phallus. The same word
described a phallic scepter made by Hephaestus, forger of lightning bolts for Father Zeus; it was called doru, a spear. 7 The Indian city of
Darjeeling was named for the dorje-lingam, "lightning-phallus." 8
A lightning-phallus or lightning-scepter was the emblem of sovereignty for Greek and Roman heavenly fathers and for their
son-reincarnations also. Dionysus, born of the Earth- or Moon-mother, became "king of all the gods of the world" when he sat on his father's
throne and wielded the lightning-scepter.9 His father Zeus descended into the "bridal chambers" of the Mother Goddesses on the Acropo
lis at Thebes in the form of lightning; therefore, these shrines were taboo and were called Places of Coming. 10 The sky-god also "came"
as lightning to fertilize the maternal rock, Petra Genetrix, that gave birth
to the Persian savior Mithra. 11
A descent of lightning marked many miraculous impregnations
and virgin births throughout mythology, possibly beginning with the
Assyro-Babylonian Zeus, called Zu the Storm Bird. Zu was a model for
the winged lightning-spirits the Bible called seraphim, or fiery flying serpents. As a Son of God, Zu coveted the Tablets of the Law, wishing to rule the oracles and make himself king of heaven. 12 He was

Lightning
Salmoneus of Elis
Legendary sacred king bearing the Greek version of the same name as Shalmaneser or Solomon. Elis was an ancient city and state in the northwest corner
of the Peloponnese; now called Ilia.
punished for his hubris in the Babylonian myth, but as the Olympian Zeus he successfully defeated older heaven-gods like Uranus, Cronus, Prometheus, and Hephaestus, and successfully defended his throne
against other challengers. King Salmoneus of Elis dared impersonate Zeus the Lightning, seeking to become the beloved of the Goddess Salma (Salome) and control the weather. He dragged brazen cauldrons behind his chariot to
imitate thunder, and threw torches into the air to encourage light
ning. Zeus destroyed him for his hubris. 13 So the later mythographers
said; in fact the sacred kings everywhere were made to become God, or the Son of God, by such magical means before they were sacrificed to the same God.
A Dipylon amphora from the bank of the Ilissos shows a king
wielding the scepter from which issues a lightning bolt. The figure's erect penis also shoots a bolt of lightning toward the Delta-symbol of the
Goddess on an altar. 14 This was a typical image of the god-king, from
northern Europe to central Asia where chieftains impersonated the
lightning god to mate with the divine swan-Valkyrie Kara, a variant of Kali or Kauri. 15 Among the Celts, the Goddess's bird form was Co
lombe, the Dove, bride of Lanceor the "Golden Lance," a lightning god who evolved into Lancelot. 16
A phallic lightning bolt was the original symbol of the Ugaritic sage Atyn, Eytan, or Etana, whom the Bible calls Ethan, a king almost as wise as Solomon (1 Kings 4:3 1). He tried to ascend to Mother Ishtar in
heaven and was cast down like a bolt of lightning by the jealous sun god Shamash. His Hebrew name meant either "perpetual stream" or
"perpetually firm," both hopeful epithets of the phallic god. Ethan, or Eytan, was the answer to the riddle in Proverbs 30: "Who hath ascended up into heaven, and come down?" 17 His totem was the
eagle, symbol of lightning, fire, and the sun. He ascended spread-eagled on the bird's back in the form of a cross, his fingers "upon the
feathers of the wings" like the Greeks' Ganymede and the Hindus' Garuda. 18
Quarrels over possession of the lightning-phallus underlay many stories about god-kings and their rivals. Like God casting down
Lucifer "as lightning," Zeus cast down the older lightning-deity Hephaestus because he defended his Great Mother Hera against a
patriarchal attack. As a god of the conquered matriarchate, Hephaestus was imprisoned in a fire-mountain and set to forging lightning bolts
for the new ruler, Zeus. As the archaic Cretan Velchanos, Etruscan Vulcan, Hephaestus was one of the Amazonian smith gods who
opposed the Olympian patriarchy. 19 The God of Moses copied the ways of other patriarchal deities and
claimed the ability to "cast forth lightning" (Psalms 144:6). In a literal
anthropomorphization this meant he could cast forth the lightning god Lucifer from heaven. Medieval theologians were never quite sure
who threw the lightning bolts God, or his rival Lucifer, who retained
the title of Prince of the Power of the Air.
540



German bishops said in 1783 that despite allegedly infallible With
protections such as processions, hymns, and holy relics, the devil's lightning damaged 400 church towers and killed 1 20 bell-ringers within ^^^^^^^^^^^
33 years. 20 It was difficult to explain why God so often threw
lightning at his own churches; or, if the destructive bolts were thrown by
the devil, why God didn't protect his churches better. Effective
measures had to wait until the arch-infidel Benjamin Franklin invented
the lightning rod. Even then, many churchmen refused to use the
new invention on the ground that it was one of the devil's artifacts.
With the decline of the devil, the damage inflicted by lightning has been once more imputed to God. Modern legal documents still
describe lightning-strikes as "acts of God."

JHth var. Lilit
i\dam's first wife was a relic of an early rabbinical attempt to assimilate
he Sumero-Babylonian Goddess Belit-ili, or Belili, to Jewish myth
alogy. To the Canaanites, Lilith was Baalat, the "Divine Lady." On a ablet from Ur, ca. 2000 B.C., she was addressed as Lillake. 1
Hebraic tradition said Adam married Lilith because he grew tired
af coupling with beasts, a common custom of Middle-Eastern herds
men, though the Old Testament declared it a sin (Deuteronomy
27:21). Adam tried to force Lilith to lie beneath him in the "missionary
Dosition" favored by male-dominant societies. Moslems were so insis
ent on the male-superior sexual position that they said, "Accursed be the man who maketh woman heaven and himself earth." 2 Catholic
authorities said any sexual position other than the male-superior one is
sinful. 3 But Lilith was neither a Moslem nor a Catholic. She sneered at
Adam's sexual crudity, cursed him, and flew away to make her home by
the Red Sea.
God sent angels to fetch Lilith back, but she cursed them too,
ignored God's command, and spent her time coupling with "demons"
(whose lovemaking evidently pleased her better) and giving birth to a hundred children every day. So God had to produce Eve as Lilith's
more docile replacement. Lilith's fecundity and sexual preferences show that she was a Great
Mother of settled agricultural tribes, who resisted the invasions of
nomadic herdsmen, represented by Adam. Early Hebrews disliked the Great Mother who drank the blood of Abel the herdsman, after his
slaying by the elder god of agriculture and smithcraft, Cain (Genesis 4:1 1). Lilith's Red Sea was another version of Kali Ma's Ocean of
541



Lily Blood, which gave birth to all things but needed periodic sacrificial
replenishment. ^mhmm^mmhh^m There may have been a connection between Lilith and the
Etruscan divinity Leinth, who had no face and who waited at the gate
of the underworld along with Eita and Persipnei (Hades and Persephone) to receive the souls of the dead. 4 The underworld gate was a yoni, and also a lily, which had "no face." Admission into the under
world was often mythologized as a sexual union. The lily or lilu
(lotus) was the Great Mother's flower-yoni, whose title formed Lilith 's name.
The story of Lilith disappeared from the canonical Bible, but her
daughters the lilim haunted men for over a thousand years. Well into
the Middle Ages, the Jews were still manufacturing amulets to keep
away the lilim, who were lustful she-demons given to copulating with
men in their dreams, causing nocturnal emissions. 5 Naturally, the lilim
squatted on top of their victims in the position favored by ancient
matriarchs.
Greeks adopted the lilim and called them Lamiae, Empusae
(Forcers-In), or Daughters of Hecate. Christians also adopted them and called them harlots of hell, or succubae, the female counterparts of
incubi. Celibate monks tried to fend them off by sleeping with their
hands crossed over their genitals, clutching a crucifix. It was said that
every time a pious Christian had a wet dream, Lilith laughed. Even if
a male child laughed in his sleep, people said Lilith was fondling him.
To protect baby boys against her, chalk circles were drawn around cradles with the written names of the three angels God sent to fetch
Lilith back to Adam even though these angels had proved incapable of dealing with her. Some said men and babies should not be left
alone in a house or Lilith might seize them.6
Another common name for the Daughters of Lilith was Night
Hag. This term didn't imply that they were ugly; on the contrary, they were supposed to be very beautiful. 7 As with their brothers the
incubi, they were presumed so expert at lovemaking that after an experience with a Night-Hag, a man couldn't be satisfied with the love of a mortal woman.

Lily
The flower of Lilith, Sumero-Babylonian Goddess of creation; the
lilu or "lotus" of her genital magic. The lily often represented the virgin aspect of the Triple Goddess, while the rose represented her maternal aspect. The lily was sacred to Astarte, who was also Lilith; northern Europeans called her Ostara or Eostre, the Goddess of "Easter"
lilies. 1
Because of its pagan associations with virgin motherhood, the lily
542 M



was used to symbolize impregnation of the virgin Mary. Some authorities claimed the lily in Gabriel's hand filtered God's semen which
entered Mary's body through her ear. 2 Mary's cult also inherited the lily of the Blessed Virgin Juno, who conceived her savior-son Mars with her own magic lily, without any
male aid. 3 This myth reflected an early belief in the self-fertilizing
power of the yoni (vulva), which the lily symbolized and Juno
personified. Her name descended from the pre-Roman Uni, a Triple Goddess represented by the three-lobed lily or fleur-de-lis, her name stemming from the Sanskrit yoni, source of the Uni-verse.
In 656 a.d., the 10th Council of Toledo officially adopted the holy
day of Juno's miraculous conception of Mars into the Christian
canon, renaming it the Festival of the Mother of God, or Lady Day,
insisting that it commemorated Mary's miraculous conception of
Jesus with the aid of a lily.
4 Christian artists showed the angel Gabriel
holding out to Mary a scepter surmounted by a fleur-de-lis on a lily
stalk. A scroll usually issued from Gabriel's mouth, with the words Ave
Maria gratia plena, the seminal "Word," which made Mary "full."
Aphrodite's dove, that other yonic symbol, hovered about the scene. 5 Celtic and Gallo-Roman tribes called the virgin mother Lily Maid.
Her yonic emblem appeared not only as the French fleur-de-lis but
also as the Irish shamrock, which was not originally Irish but a sacred
symbol among Indus Valley people some 6000 years before the Christian era. Christianized France identified the Lily Maid with the
virgin Mary, but she was never completely dissociated from the pagan
image of Juno. Among the people, Lady Day was known as Notre Dame de Mars.6
The Easter lily was the medieval pas-flower, from Latin passus, to
step or pass over, cognate oipascha, the Passover. The lily was also
called Pash-flower, Paschal flower, Pasque flower, or Passion flower.
Pagans understood that it represented the spring passion of the god, like Heracles, for union in love-death with the Virgin Queen of
Heaven, Hera-Hebe, or Juno, or Venus, all of whom claimed the lily. When Hera's milk spurted from her breasts to form the Milky Way, the
drops that fell to the ground became lilies. 7

Lingam
Sometimes, the Easter flower was not a white lily but a scarlet or purple anemone, emblem of Adonis's passion and called identical with his bride Venus.8
Lingam
"Penis," Hindu symbol of any god, usually Shiva. The lingam-yoni is still the supreme symbol of the vital principle, representing male and
female genitalia in conjunction. 1 Its verbal equivalent is the Jewel in the Lotus.
Sometimes the lingam appeared as a phallic pillar in the cella or jHoly of Holies, the core of the temple which stands for the Goddess
543

Little Red Riding Hood "Pillar," and was shown emerging from a lingam-pillar with his ^^^^^^^^^^^^ "jewel" or phallic eye displayed in the center of his forehead, a graphic
illustration of the transformation of the whole lingam into a man
shape. 3 It was a Hindu custom to have brides deflowered in the temple by
Shiva's carved lingam to make their firstborn children God-begotten
(see Firstborn). Temple harlots were made "brides of God" by the same ceremony of the lingam, as was also the custom in the ancient
Middle East, Greece, and Rome. 4 Besides these man-sized examples
there were large pillars, which often became objects of pilgrimage. Many miracles were said to have taken place in the vicinity of Shiva's
lingam. 5 1. Rawson, AT., 51. 2. Zimmer, 127. 3. OTlaherty, 195. 4. Rawson, E.A., 29, 88. 5. Mahanirvanatantra, 335.
Lion
Usually a symbol of the sun god in Greece and Rome, the lion was more commonly associated with the Goddess in the Middle East and
Egypt. Ishtar, Astarte, and Cybele rode or drove lions. Bast-Hathor
was the Sphinx-lioness, symbolizing the Destroyer. Sometimes she appeared with two lion heads looking forward and backward, like her
Roman counterpart Janus-Jana. This was a symbol of Time, with the hieroglyph xerefu and akeru, the Lions of Yesterday and Today. 1 The Dark Age kingdom of the Britons was named after the
"Lyonesse," one of its early queens appearing in Arthurian romance as the Lady Lyonors. Merlin's city was Caerleon, the Lion's Place.
Lions were not native to the British isles, therefore the British lion
was an imported totem. Lion and serpent stood for ascending and
declining spirits of the sacred year, the former following the latter in
the pagan zodiac. 2
The British "Lady who ruled lions"may have arrived on Roman
coins, which since the Augustan period showed the Great Mother of the Gods (Cybele) enthroned between two lions, wearing the mural crown that became a Saxon emblem of divinity. She was thus
described in a poem: "The Virgin in her heavenly place rides upon the Lion; bearer of corn, inventor of law, founder of cities, by whose gift
it is man's good lot to know the gods; therefore she is the Mother of the
Gods, Peace, Virtue, Ceres, the Syrian Goddess, weighing life and laws in her balance." 3

Logos
Logos
Greek "Word," a theory of creation that passed from Tantrism
through Neoplatonic philosophy to Christianity. The theory was that a deity could create anything other deities, worlds, creatures by the power of magic words: when the name was spoken, the thing materialized. The Logos, then, was divine essence concentrated in a Word
and made manifest, as Jesus was called "the Word made flesh." The
Gospel of John gave him eternal existence: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (John 1:1).
Judeo-Christian thinkers defined the Logos in so many ways that it became virtually without meaning, and so was relegated to the
status of a "deep mystery." The Logos was Christ, or the Wisdom of
Yahweh, or an archangel, or Truth, or the high priest, or the Law, or the covenant, or the scriptures, or Moses, or the creative power, or
the soul of the world, or the sun, etc. 1 Orphic, Pythagorean, and
Neoplatonic philosophers who expounded the Logos doctrine were not well understood by their Christian followers, who struggled vainly
with the subtle semantics of the pagan philosophers.
The pagans' "Word made flesh" was usually Hermes, representing the Logos spermatikos, seminal Word, proceeding from the mouth of Zeus to beget all things through the power of his agent on earth. 2 The Corpus Hermeticum praised this Word-bearer: "Holy art
thou, who by the Word has created all things that exist! Holy art thou,
of whom all Nature has produced the image!" Justin Martyr's Apologia earnestly tried to assimilate the attributes of Hermes-the-Word
to Jesus, "on account of his wisdom," claiming that Jesus was exactly like Hermes in being the Son, Messenger, and Word of God. 3 One of the reasons for male enthusiasm for the Logos doctrine was
that it provided male gods with a method of creating, formerly the exclusive prerogative of the birth-giving Goddess. Hermes-the-Logos became Hermes-the-Creator, exercising the magic feminine powers he derived from living in androgynous union with Mother Aphrodite.
The Perfect Word addressed Hermes as not only the Light of the life
of man but also "the fruitful Womb of All." 4
Similarly, Hermes's Egyptian counterpart Thoth mastered the Words of Power and assumed the attributes of the Goddess Maat, "whose Word is Truth," sometimes called his spouse. Priests of Thoth's
holy city, which the Greeks called Hermopolis, said Thoth was the
universal demiurge who spoke the Word of creation, met, and "gave
birth" to the first gods. 5

Logos
Among the oldest
Mesopotamian texts there are stories of
deities representing "the Word." In the
Epic of Gilgamesh, Enlil the god of "air" or "breath" was also a
Logos: "The spirit of the Word is Enlil, the spirit of the heart of
Anu (heaven)." Enlil embodied "the word which stilleth the heavens above." 9
The fifty letters of Kali's Sanskrit alphabet
were matrika, "mothers." Hindu
scriptures said: "As from a mother comes birth, so from matrika, or sound, the
world proceeds." 11
Om was the
mantramatrika, Mother of Mantras; and these divine Words spoken by Kali created
and destroyed everything, including all gods. 12
begetting. The Sanskrit word for a father-given or Brahma-given soul
was atman, "air" or "breath," cognate with the German atmen and Greek atmos, "air." A Brahman father still establishes a paternal claim
to a child by breathing its soul-name three times into its face,
pretending to place the soul in the body. 7 The biblical Yahweh also claimed to give life by the power of his breath or "wind," which he used to animate the dry bones of the
dead: "Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live"
(Ezekiel 37:5). This incident was probably copied from the Babylonian Enuma Elish, wherein Marduk established his right to kingship
among the gods by showing he could destroy and re-create by the power of his Word. 8
Though male gods popularized the idea of the Logos, the ability to destroy and re-create by Word-power belonged originally to the Goddess, who created languages, alphabets, and the secret mantras known as Words of Power, Egyptian hekau, creations of Hecate (Maat). Every manifestation of life was brought into being by the Great Goddess Kali with her Word, Om, an invocation of her own
"pregnant belly." This was the primordial Logos, "the supreme syllable, the mother of all sound." 10 Kali's creative voice had its own personifi
cation as a Goddess Vac (Voice), engendered in celestial waters, at the summit of the Cosmic Tree. 13 Vac brought forth the god who called
himself All-father, as well as everything else in the universe. 14 She
reappeared in Greek myth as a disembodied voice, the nymph Echo, who brought the flower-god Narcissus to his doom by trapping his soul
in her water-mirror. In Arabic her Om became Umm, meaning
mother, matrix, source, principle, or prototype: the Logos of the Sufi. 15
Om was a familiar sound. Celts called their Moon-mother Omh,
"She Who Is." Shebans called their Moon-temple at Marib Aum, the Belly of the World. Lydians placed the same Belly of the World in
their own country as an omphalos or navel-stone, hub of the
universe, "made flesh" in their Goddess-queen Omphale. It was not an exclusively Lydian custom; every temple in Greece hid an omphalos.
Om was Alpha, the letter of creation, repeated again as the final
letter of destruction, Omega, which means literally "great Om." Its Greek form is a horseshoe, based on the Hindu symbol of the yonic
Gate. When the biblical prophet proclaimed: "I am the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is yet to come" (Revelation 1 :8), he used words copied from the temple of the Great Mother at Sais, where they were
written on stone many centuries before the Bible was compiled. 16
The Logos idea was virtually identical with the Oriental concept of the Oversoul, which had been an essence of the Great Mother but
was re-defined as an essence of the Great Father or of his son, the
Savior. Origen said, "As our body while consisting of human mem
bers is yet held together by one soul, so the universe is to be thought of
as an immense living being which is held together by one soul, the
546



power of the logos." I7 Christ was only one of many aspirants to the title of Logos. Before him, Attis was hailed as the Logos "who holds the universe together." 18 But before them all was the Great Mother: "The supreme Shakti has the form both of the seed and the sprout of the
revealed coming-together of Shiva and Shakti; subtlest of the subtle, She b contained in all that lies between the first and the last letters of the
alphabet, which contains the original root forms from which the names
of everything in the world are compounded." 19 The Christian idea that Christ was God's "Word made flesh" was
an idea common to all the ancient pagan world. Every king was
literally God manifested in the flesh, whether he was a real ruler or a
sacramental surrogate ruler. Usually he was called Savior, and begot
ten by the god on a temple virgin. He was chosen and invested by holy words and name-souls. Antiochus of Syria, for instance, received the
divine surname of Epiphanes, "God Made Manifest (in the flesh)." 20
Not even Christians, however, managed to purge the Logos of all its original feminine connotations. Clement of Alexandria distorted
his symbolism to the point of absurdity when trying to connect the
Logos with parenthood: "The Word is everything to the child, both father and mother, teacher and nurse. . . . The nutriment is the milk of
the Father . . . and the Word alone supplies us children with the milk
of love. . . . For this reason, seeking is called sucking; to those infants
who seek the Word, the Father's loving breasts supply milk." 21
These odd notions arose from the ancient belief that a mother gave
her child its name-soul along with the first breast milk, as she
breathed a Word that would henceforth define and personify the child.
In the Old Testament, children were named by their mothers, never
by their fathers. 22 Thus a universal Parent would be expected to give
name-souls to all creation along with universal breast milk.
A giver of nourishment was also a giver of Law, derived from the
same root word as Logos. Priest-chieftain of the Icelandic Althing
supreme governing body of the tribes had a title now translated
Lawspeaker. But that is not the literal translation of the Icelandic
word, logsogumathr, which really means Mother-Who-Speaks-theWord. 23
The doctrine of the Logos was so widespread that Christians could
hardly be expected to ignore it. It was one of many pagan ideas that me church eagerly seized. Medieval Schoolmen tried to make it
reconcile faith with reason, insisting that the two must be identical because their root was the same: "that no more than one source of
truth, the Logos, had ever existed, and that everything of any value in
human wisdom, especially in Greek philosophy, flowed from that sole Bource. Plato himself was reputed to have pilfered from Moses." 24
The Schoolmen were ignorant of the ancient logoi, sacred writings
pf the Orphics, mentioned by Plato and other philosophers as a vast
mass of literature amounting to a true "Bible"; these writings had all
been destroyed during the early centuries of Christianity. 25 But there

Lohengrin Loki
Gospel of Truth
Gnostic scripture associated with the early Christian sect of
Valentinians, founded about 1 50 a.d.
were Christian Gnostic writings that had copied the Orphics and
transmitted the idea of the Logos to Christian dogma even after they
were declared "heresies." The Gospel of Truth said, for example, "When the Word appeared, the Word which is in the hearts of those
who pronounced It. . . . It was not only a sound, but It had taken on a
body as well." 26 Christians gave such assertions a rather simplistic
interpretation, assuming the body was Christ's; yet perhaps the more perceptive of the ancient philosophers meant that man, the verbaliz
ing animal, in effect creates all his gods out of his Word.

Lohengrin
Medieval version of Zeus the Swan-king, or the Swan-knight Krishna, beloved of all the Swan-maidens in heaven (seen as little clouds
sailing over the blue). The holy swan, Leda's lover, was transformed into a Knight of the Holy Grail, dedicated to helping women maintain
their legal rights under a patriarchal system. See Swan.
Loki was sometimes Logi, "Flame," the fire god identified with the Celtic Lug, and probably descended
from the Aryan AgniShiva as the
lightning-fire "quenched" by his
marriage to the Goddess of the
watery abyss. Indeed, under the name of Agni, the god was "an
early king of Sweden" married to the Goddess Skialf, or Skadi. 7
Loki
Norse god of complex character and great age. He may have been a
genius loci, "spirit of a place." His name may have descended from Sanskrit Loka, a spirit of the seven celestial planes. He was an archaic
form of the "Luck" envisioned as guardian angel of a clan or family,
often embodied in a fetish object. 1 One story said Loki's lips were
stitched up with a thong, suggesting that his spirit dwelt in a mummified
oracular head. 2 Such heads were also used as clan-spirits by the early
Hebrews, who called them teraphim} To lose them was to lose the
family's "luck." Like many of the oldest gods, Loki was bisexual. He even
succeeded in becoming a mother, though only after he had swal
lowed a woman's heart to acquire the power of birth-giving. The Greek Zeus resorted to the same feminine magic, for the same reason.
Loki's offspring was the eight-legged horse Sleipnir, spirit of death, a symbol of the gallows tree on which Odin rode.4
Loki was also a death spirit in his own right, like Shiva the
Destroyer who often appeared as Shiva the Destroyed, dead under the feet of Kali the Crone, his guts pulled out of his belly and devoured.
The same thing happened to Loki as he was periodically sacrificed to Skadi the Crone. 5 Also like the Oriental god, Loki always came back to
548



life. Though the other Aesir chained him up, as the wolf Fenrir and Longinus, Saint
the troublemaking Prometheus were chained, yet Loki's inevitable Lotus destiny was to break free and initiate the ultimate convulsions of the ^^^^^^^^^^
world's doomsday.6 Aryan belief postulated seven Lokas before the final paradise of Shiva and Shakti; thus it might be assumed that Loki would have seven incarnations before the final death of the gods.

Longinus, Saint
Christian legend made Longinus a blind Roman centurion who
thrust the spear into Jesus's side at the crucifixion. Some of Jesus's blood
fell on his eyes and cured his blindness, whereupon Longinus was converted and spent the rest of his life breaking pagan idols in
Cappadocia. 1 This canonization-story made even less sense than most, as Ro
man centurions were not blind. Possibly in an original version, now
lost, Longinus was stricken blind after delivering the spear-thrust; but this would have allowed no time for his conversion.
The true prototype of the legend seems to have been the blind god
Hod, who slew the Norse savior Balder with the thrust of a spear of
mistletoe. Early-medieval missionaries deliberately confused Jesus with
Balder. Some even declared the cross of Jesus's crucifixion was made
of mistletoe. 2
March 1 5, the "Ides of March" when most pagan saviors died, was the day devoted to Hod by the heathen, and later Christianized as the
feast day of the Blessed Longinus. 3

once a shrine of the Water-goddess. Early in the 19th century, a German writer transformed the Lorelei into the usual maiden disap
pointed in love. She threw herself in the river, and afterward

Lotus
Asia's primary symbol of the yoni (vulva), often personified as the Goddess Padma, "Lotus," also known as Cunti, Lakshmi, or Shakti.
549



Lotus The central phrase of Tantrism, Om manipadme hum, meant the
Jewel (male) in the Lotus (female), with interlocking connotations: the ^^^^^^^^^^__ penis in the vagina, the fetus in the womb, the corpse in the earth,
the God in the Goddess representing all of these. 1 The father-god Brahma claimed to be a universal creator; never
theless, he was styled "Lotus-born," for he arose from the primal Goddess's yoni. Egypt's father-god Ra also claimed to be a creator but owed his existence to the Goddess called "great world lotus flower, out of which rose the sun for the first time at the creation." 2
Virtually all Egyptian Goddess-forms were symbolized by the lotus. 3 Pharaohs were sexually united with the World Lotus to
achieve rebirth after death. The funeral hymn of Unas declared that he "had union with the goddess Mut, Unas hath drawn unto himself the
flame of Isis, Unas hath united himself to the lotus." 4
One way of uniting oneself to the lotus was the custom of ritual
cunnilingus, widely practiced throughout the east as communion with the feminine life-principle.
5 This was probably the true meaning of
the Land of Lotus-Eaters visited by Odysseus and his crew. The
sensual Land of Lotus-Eaters was described as a tropical place beyond the southern sea, which could apply to any land from Egypt to India. 6
Ascetic Jain Buddhism tried to eradicate the lotus symbol because
of its erotic implications. Nevertheless, a few centuries after Buddha's
time, the most prominent figure on Buddhist monuments was again
Padma, openly displaying her genital lotus. 7 A similar resurgence of erotic imagery overtook ascetic Christianity, when "obscene" figures
proliferated in cathedrals and churches, for example the Irish sheila
na-gig. Most Oriental mystics held that spiritual knowledge began with carnal knowledge. The lotus was the Goddess's gate, and sex was the
Way through the gate to her inner mysteries. With proper sexual exercises, a true sage might achieve the final flowering of revelation
described as the thousand-petaled lotus of invisible light emanating from
the top of the head after ascending the spinal chakras from the pelvis. Worshippers of Vishnu sometimes painted their god as the source of the World Lotus, which grew on a long stem from his navel. But since "the primary reference of the lotus in India has always been the
goddess Padma, 'Lotus,' whose body itself is the universe, the long stem from navel to lotus should properly connote an umbilical cord
through which the flow of energy would be running from the goddess to the god, mother to child, not the other way." 8 Some Hindu
cosmogonies saw the whole world as the lotus flower, with seven
petals representing the seven divisions of the heavens where the cities
and palaces of the god were located.9
In the Middle East, the lotus was Hlu, or lily.
10 It was the flower of
Lilith, the Sumero-Babylonian earth mother claimed by the Jews as Adam's first wife. The three-lobed lily or fleur-de-lis, like the shamrock, once stood for the Triple Goddess's three yonis, which is why the lily
550



was sacred to the triune Queen of Heaven. The Blessed Virgin Juno Lotus Position conceived her savior-son Mars by the lily, and the same flower was Lucifer
adopted as a conception-charm of the Blessed Virgin Mary. 11 When Isis ^^^^^^^^^^^
was assimilated to the burgeoning legends of the Virgin, her Egyptian images held the phallic cross in one hand, the female lotus seed-vessel in the other, like the Goddess shown on the Isiac Table. 12

Lucifer
"Light-bringer," Latin title of the Morning Star god who announced the daily birth of the sun. Canaanites called him Shaher. The Jewish
Shaharit (Morning Service) still commemorates him. 1 Shaher's twin
brother Shalem, the Evening Star, announced the daily death of the sun and spoke to him the Word of Peace (Hebrew shahm, Arabic
salaam). 2 Shalem was worshipped along with his brother in Jerusalem, which means "House of Shalem." Shaher and Shalem were the same as the Greeks' Dioscuri or Heavenly Twins, Castor and Pollux, born of
Leda's World Egg. They were also prominent in Persian sun worship as the two torch-bearers, one with his torch ascendant and the other
with his torch directed down. 5 Both Shaher and Shalem were born of the Great Mother Asherah
in her world-womb aspect as Helel, "the Pit." 4 Canaanite myth said
Shaher coveted the superior glory of the sun god and tried to usurp his
throne, but was defeated and cast down from heaven like a lightning
bolt. Pagan scriptures of the 7th century B.C. included a dirge for the
fallen Morning Star:
How hast thou fallen from heaven, Helel's son Shaher! Thou didst say in
thy heart, I will ascend to heaven, above the circumpolar stars I will raise my throne, and I will dwell on the Mount ofCouncil in the back of the north; I will mount on the back ofa cloud, I will be like unto
Elyon. s
Centuries later, a Jewish scribe copied this Canaanite scripture into
the Bible and pretended it was written by Isaiah:
551



Lucifer How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son ofthe morning! . . . For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend to heaven, I will exalt my ^^^^^^^^^^^ throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the
congregation, in the sides of the north: J will ascend above the heights
ofthe clouds; I will be like the most High. (Isaiah 14:12-14)
The biblical writer further told Lucifer: "Thou shalt be brought
down to hell, to the sides of the pit" (Isaiah 14:1 5). This "pit" was the
same as Helel, or Asherah, the god's own Mother-bride; and his descent as a lightning-serpent into her Pit represented fertilization of the
abyss by masculine fire from heaven. In short, the Light-bringer
challenged the supreme solar god by seeking the favors of the Mother. This divine rivalry explains the so-called sin of Lucifer, hubris, which
church fathers translated "pride" but its real meaning was "sexual
passion." 6 Actually, all sacred kings aspired to the same proud position Lucifer or Shaher coveted: to be the spouse of the Goddess, to stand
at the hub of the heavens (carried thence on a cloud), to become one
with the supreme deity. Egyptian pharaohs made almost identical
claims to glory, as shown by Pepi's tomb inscription stating that he "standeth upon the north of heaven with Ra, he becometh lord of the
universe like unto the king of the gods." 7 He also descended into the
earth in the guise of the immortal serpent Sata, father of lightning; and his Hebrew name Satan merged with the image of Lucifer in
Jesus's words: "I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven" (Luke
10:18). Lucifer continued to be linked with both lust and lightning during the Christian era. He became the Prince of the Power of the Air
(Ephesians 2:2) who threw his lightning bolts at church towers. He
wielded the trident, in Eastern symbolism a triple lightning-phallus destined to fertilize the Triple Goddess. 8 Another ancient source of the Lucifer legend was the Assyro
Babylonian lightning god, Zu the Storm Bird, a forerunner of Zeus;
sometimes he was a seraph or "fiery flying serpent," the lightning bolt
personified. Zu was punished for coveting the power-filled Tablets of Destiny that Great Mother Tiamat had given her firstborn son, the
father of gods. Zu said to himself, "I will take the tablet of destiny of
the gods, even I; and I will direct all the oracles of the gods; I will
establish a throne, and dispense commands, I will rule over all the spirits of Heaven!" 9
Egypt called the Morning Star god Bennu, the dying-and-reborn Phoenix bird known as "Soul of Ra," who died on the World Tree in order to renew himself, to "shine on the world." His spirit dwelt in the
phallic obelisk, called Bennu or the Benben-stone, which stood for the god's sexual union with the Mother. Another of his phallic forms
was the mighty serpent Ami-Hemf, "Dweller in his Flame," who lived on the Mountain of Sunrise and was identified with the morning
star. 10 Thus Egypt and Mesopotamia had several versions of light
552



bringing Lucifer long before scraps of his myth found their way into
Judeo-Christian writings. Plato knew the morning-star god as Aster (Star) and also under
stood that the same star appeared at evening in a different position
and so became the evening star (actually the planet Venus). Plato therefore viewed Aster as the dying-and-reborn deity himself: "Aster,
once, as Morning-Star, light on the living you shed. Now, dying, as
Evening-Star, you shine among the dead." u Gnostic Christians maintained that the "light" Lucifer brought
was true enlightenment, which he gave humanity against God's will, as Prometheus stole the fire of heaven to bring civilization to mankind
against the will of Zeus. The Bible's story supported the Gnostic view. God denied Adam and Eve the fruit of the tree of knowledge,
desiring to keep them ignorant; but Lucifer, in the form of the
serpent, gave them the "light" of wisdom. The Persians, too, said their own Great Serpent Ahriman gave knowledge to the first couple in the garden of Heden. Ahriman too was the twin brother of the solar God, cast out of heaven for his hubris;
but the Magi worshipped the Great Serpent as the source of their
occult wisdom. 12 He was often thought more influential in terrestrial
affairs than the Father who cast him down.
Such Persian precedents influenced Gnostic Christians who re
garded Jehovah as the villain and Lucifer as the hero, savior, and
friend of man, revealer of sacred mysteries that the Heavenly Father
jealously withheld. Medieval secret fraternities perpetuated the Gnos
tics' respect for Lucifer and sometimes identified him with Hermes, god
of revelation. These Gnostic doctrines persisted through the first half
of the Christian era and well into the second half. 13 Meister Eckhart
said, "Lucifer, the angel, who is in hell, had perfectly pure intellect
and to this day knows much." H In the 14th century a.d. there were Gnostic groups called Lucifer
ans, who "worship Lucifer and believe him to be the brother of God,
wrongly cast out of heaven." 15 Luciferans were first heard of in Austria.
Their cult soon spread to Brandenburg, Bohemia, Switzerland, and Savoy. In 1336 the Inquisition burned fourteen men and women at
Magdeburg for holding heretical opinions about Lucifer. In 1384, a
priest at Prenzlau accused his entire congregation of believing that Lucifer was God or the brother of God. 16
One of the "great questions" among medieval Schoolmen was
how many angels fell with Lucifer and how many remained in heaven under the command of Michael. Some authorities said "most"
angels fell. Some said "most" remained. Some said a tenth, a ninth,
or a third of the angelic host fell, because "the dragon with his tail
plucked down with him the third part of the stars." Furious debate
raged also between Thomists, Scotists, and followers of Augustine on the "great question" of the battle's location and duration. It was said
to have taken place in the air, in the firmament, or in paradise. It lasted

Lucy, Saint
A Christianization of Juno Lucina or Lucetia, Mother of Light, the Sabine Goddess whose temple was built on the Esquiline in 735 B.C.
There she appeared, bearing her symbols, a lamp and a patera, offering-dish. She bestowed the gifts of light, enlightenment, and eyesight, especially as the opener of eyes of newborn children. 1 The bogus "St. Lucy" bore the same symbols and was advertised
as a patron of sufferers from eye diseases. Lucy, or Lucia, was one of
the most popular of medieval saints, ranking with Agatha, Catherine, and Mary Magdalene as a leading ecclesiastical money-maker. Lucy's legend was the same "virgin martyr" story told of dozens of other mythical female saints. Her devotion to chastity was so great
that when a pagan suitor admired her beautiful eyes, she cut them from
their sockets and sent them to him on a platter, asking to be left in
peace henceforth. This was how Christians interpreted the Goddess's
patera with its offerings. The legend went on to say the pagans tried to execute St. Lucy for
the alleged crime of keeping her virginity. But when they tried to drag her out of the temple where she had been imprisoned, she stood
rooted to the floor as heavily as a great statue. She couldn't be moved
even with ropes and pulleys. A fire built on the stone floor around her
also failed to destroy her. Finally she was killed by a sword thrust. 2
Details of this naive legend show that "St. Lucy" really was a
colossal statue of Juno Lucina, whose jeweled eyes were gouged out
by a Christian vandal; but destroying the statue proved difficult, as it was too heavy to be moved. In the end, Juno was broken up and removed
from her temple in pieces but superstitious dread inspired the awe that canonized her. The most significant detail in the legend said Lucy
was once very rich, but she distributed all her wealth to poor Christians.
This wealth evidently consisted of the expensive temple furnishings which were informally distributed among the looters. Robbing temples
and smashing their holy statues was one of the major occupations of poor Christians in Rome during the 4th and 5th centuries. 3

Ludus
Latin "Game"; the dramas, performances, and contests of a religious ptival. The ludi evolved into the commedia, carnivals, circuses, and
pystery plays of the Middle Ages, with the old gods disguised as lowns, whose traditional hieratic gestures thus became "ludicrous."

uggestively Tantric style. 2 Lug's special festival was Lammas Eve, formerly Lugnasad, "the James of Lug." The pagan rites of Lugnasad were kept to a very late ate at Taillten in Ireland, where the Goddess had been worshipped as a

Lug was Christianized as several saints: St. Lugad, St.
Luan, St. Eluan, and St. Lugidus, depending on local dialects. Irish
legendary history called him a King Lugadius martyred by a lancethrust from a druidic
priest a story taken
quite directly from ancient cults of the

Sovereignty of Erin until the day of doom." 3
brides in a custom reminiscent of the Goddess's ancient rites of sacred
promiscuity and defloration. The hill where payments were collected
was known as the Hill of the Buying. 4
Taillten was so notorious for promiscuity that any casual sexual
affair came to be known as a Taillten marriage. 5 Taillten marriages
were actually legal up to the 1 3 th century. They were supposed to last
the period specified by the old lunar calendars, a year and a day.6 Lug's curious name may have come in some remote past time from Mesopotamia, where the title of a sacred king, the Goddess's
spouse, was lugal. 7

Luna
Latin name of the Moon-goddess, coupled in Gnostic symbolism and magic texts with Sol, the male sun. Together they represented fire and water, whose combination produced the Blood of Life. Luna the
watery moon used to be considered superior to Sol the fiery sun. Even Chaucer wrote of "Luna the Serene, / Chief goddess of the ocean
and its queen, / Though Neptune have therein his deity, / Is over him
and empress of the sea." '
Many myths present the Moon-goddess as the Creatress who first drifted alone on the primal ocean of chaos until she decided to bring
orderly forms out of elemental formlessness. Thus she was specifically
"Moon Shining Over the Sea" to Scandinavian pagans. 2 Finns
called her Luonnotar, sometimes loosely translated Daughter of Nature
But she was not the daughter of anything; she existed all alone in
primordial time, until she tired of loneliness and decided to create a world. 3 See Moon.
Christians claimed the worshippers of Luna were crazy, hence the word "lunatic," a person moon-touched or moon-struck. To this day,
many people believe lunacy is affected by the moon, being character
ized by increased psychic disturbance when the moon is full.

Lupa
Sacred She-Wolf of Roman legend, nurse of the foundling twins Romulus and Remus. Lupa's temple harlots were lupae, sometimes
called Queens (or high priestesses) in outlying towns of the empire. Lupa's greatest festival was the annual Lupercalia, celebrated in the
Grotto of the She-Wolf, with orgiastic rites to insure the year's
fertility. After participating in the ceremony, naked youths traveled
throughout Palatine towns to "purify" them. 1 Perhaps this was why,

Ma
"Ma-Ma" means
"mother's breasts" in
nearly all languages. ' "All around the world, from Russia to Samoa, and in the ancient languages of Egypt, Babylon, India, and the Americas, the word for 'mother' is mama or some minor variation of this word." 2 In ancient Anatolia the Mother
was Ma-Bellona; in Sumer and Akkad the Great Goddess was often called Mama, Mami, Mammitu, etc. In Central and South America the Goddess had such names as Mama
Cocha, Mama Quilla, Mama Cuna.*
Ma
Basic mother-syllable of Indo-European languages, worshipped in itself as the fundamental name of the Goddess. The universality of the
mother-word (not shared by words for "father") indicates either that
the human race carried the same word from its earliest source to all parts
of the earth at a period previous to the discovery of fatherhood; or
else that all human beings instinctively say something like "ma" as the first verbal sound and associate it with the mother's breast, conse
quently with emotional dependence on a divinity perceived as a milk-giving mother notwithstanding the absurd reference of Moses
to a "nursing father" carrying the sucking child in his bosom (Numbers
11:12). In the Far East, the maternal blood bond that joined members of
the matrilineal clan was mamata, "mine-ness." 4 Its sacred letter Ma,
in pictographic form as the Spark of Life (bindu or vindu), was said to be "in the Great Yoni." 5 This scripture referred to a mystic essence
uniting all the souls in a matrilineal kinship group. Ma or mamata expressed the idea that descendants of the same mother shared the same blood and couldn't injure one another without injuring them
selves; therefore the concept of the maternal clan was a practical
instrument of peace.
In Indo-European root languages, Ma was often defined as "intel
ligence," the maternal force that bound elements together to create
forms at the beginning of the world.6 Ancient Egypt gave this maternal
force such names as Ma-Nu, Maa, or Maat, the Great Goddess of
the All-Seeing Eye and the spirit of Truth. 7 The primitive Iranian Moon-goddess Mah (or Al-Mah, the Moon) was another form of the same deity. Arabs called her Qis-Mah,
"Fate," which the Turks corrupted into kismet. She gave birth to a
series of Messiahs, each one called the Mahdi, one guided or given by Mother Mah. Persians made her name a sacred Word, formed of the
letters Mourdad-Ameretat, "Death-Rebirth." 8 The ideogram MA
was said to mean a state of immortality brought about by drinking the milk of the Goddess's breast, which brings one back to the original Ma-Ma.
In Hebrew the same sacred letters MA made the Mem-Aleph,
combining ideographs of "fluid" and "birth." This holy sign was credited with great protective power, and was written on Jewish amulets
dating from the early 9th century B.C. 9 It could have been copied from either the Persians or the Egyptians, whose Mother Isis wore an
"Amulet of Ma," a vase representing her own fountains of nourish
ing fluid. 10 Or again, as Ma-Nu, the Primal Deep, she was symbolized by three cauldrons. 11 Even today the Tantric Goddess as a personification of "fertilizing water" is named Mamaki. 12
In Egyptian myth, a reversal of the Ma-Ma of nourishing breasts produced the female Devourer in the underworld: Am-Am, eater of
560



Souls. In the cyclic fashion of the elder religions, the giver was trans- Maat I Formed into the taker. 13
Ma, the Great Goddess of Comana, was "worshipped by a whole
j:>eople of hierodules in the ravines of the Taurus and along the banks ^^^^^^^^^^
bf the Iris. Like Cybele she was an ancient Anatolian divinity and
jjersonified fertile nature." H She was taken to Rome where she
jTierged with the war goddess Bellona, who personified fighting spirit as ndomitable as that of a mother defending her young.
Today the divine implications of the syllable Ma are recognized bnly in obscure semi-magical cults like voodooism, where a priestess bmbodies the Goddess's spirit and is known as mamaloiox mambo. ls
However, Ma is still a universal synonym for "mother." See Motherhood.

Maat
Egyptian Goddess as personification of "Truth" or "Justice"; the
priginal name based on the universal Indo-European mother-syllable meant simply "Mother." Maat's symbol was the feather against
jvhich she weighed each man's heart-soul (ab) in her underground Hall
pf Judgment. Thus the Plume of Maat itself became a hieroglyph for
'truth." 1
The same feathers of Truth were worn by other aspects of the
Goddess, such as Isis, who was the same lawgiving Mother. The gods themselves were constrained to "live by Maat." Her law governed all
hree worlds ruled by her trinity as "Lady of heaven, queen of the earth, and mistress of the underworld." 2
As the lawgiver of archaic Egypt, Maat was comparable to Babylolian Tiamat who gave the sacred tablets to the first king of gods.
jVIaat's laws were notably benevolent, compared to the harsh commands pf later patriarchal gods, backed up by savage threats like those of
Deuteronomy 28:1 5-68. An Egyptian was expected to recite the Famous Negative Confession in the presence of Maat and Thoth (or
knubis) to show he had obeyed Maat's rules of behavior:
/ have not been a man ofanger. I have done no evil to mankind. I have not inflicted pain. I have made none to weep. I have done violence to no man. I have not done harm unto animals. I have not robbed the poor. I have not fouled water. I have not trampled fields. I have not behaved
with insolence. I have not judged hastily. I have not stirred up strife. I have not made any man to commit murder for me. I have not insisted that excessive work be done for me daily. I have not borne false witness. I have not stolen land. I have not cheated in measuring the bushel. I have
561



Maat allowed no man to suffer hunger. I have not increased my wealth except with such things as are my own possessions. I have not seized ^^^^^^^^^^^^ wrongfully the property ofothers. I have not taken milk from the mouths
ofbabes. *
Those who lived by the laws of Maat took a sacramental drink,
comparable to the Hindus' Soma or its Persian counterpart Haoma, which conferred ritual purity in the same sense as the Christian
"washing in the blood of the Lamb." Egyptian scribes of the 3rd millenium B.C. wrote: "My inward parts have been washed in the
liquor of Maat." Like baptismal water of life, Maat's potion brought lifeafter-death to the peaceful, but death overtook violent persons.4
Egyptian moral precepts were of a high order, many of them turning up centuries later in the Bible:
Take heed not to rob the poor, and be not cruel to the destitute. . . . If thou canst answer the man who attacks thee, do him no injury. Let the evildoer alone; he will destroy himself. We must help the sinner, for may we not become like him? . . . Crusts ofbread and a loving heart are better than rich food and contention. . . . Learn to be content with what thou hast. Treasure obtained by fraud will not stay with thee; thou hast
it today, tomorrow it has departed. . . . The approval ofman is better than
riches. s
Under the feudal disorders of the 12th dynasty, old rules began
to break down along with the matrilineal clan system that supported
them, and educated Egyptians deplored the disruptions of society. A
Heliopolitan priest wrote: "Maat is cast out, iniquity is in the midst of
the council hall. . . . [T]he poor man has no strength to save himself from him that is stronger than he." 6 Sometimes kinsman murdered
kinsman, in violation of the clan's most sacred rule. One writer
unfavorably compared his countrymen to the Maat-worshipping tribes of Nubia: "The Matoi, who are friendly towards Egypt, say: 'How
could there be a man that would slay his brother?' " 7
Maat was more than a judge of the dead. She was a stand-in for all
Egyptian Goddesses, including Hathor, Mut, Isis, Neith, Nekhbet, etc. The sun god was told: "The goddess Maat embraceth thee both at morn and at eve." As a birth-giver, she was sometimes Metet, the
Morning Boat of the Sun, translated "becoming strong" and corresponding to the Greco-Roman mother of dawn, Mater Matuta. 8 She
was worshipped in lands other than Egypt. Northern Syria was called by
the Hittites, Mat Hatti: that is, Mother of Hatti. 9 Egyptian priests
drew the Feather of Maat on their tongues in green dye, to give their
words a Logos-like power of Truth so their verbal magic could create
reality. 10 Similarly in northern Europe the divine bard Bragi had this
power because of the runes engraved on his tongue by the Goddess Idun. African Pygmies still know Maat by the name she bore in Sumeria as "womb" and "underworld": Matu. She was the first woman, and

Mab, Queen
peltic Fairy Queen, whose name meant "mead" a red drink
representing sovereignty which she gave to each of her many consorts. 1 Like the "claret" in the lap of Thomas Rhymer's Fairy Queen, this eems to have been a concoction of the queen's own menstrual blood ^s the feminine wine of wisdom. Mab's legends date from the
natriarchal age, when queens chose and invested their own kings. See
rhomas Rhymer.

Macabre
Crim Reaper of medieval mystery plays. As Lord of Death, Macabre led the danse macabre (German Totentanz) wearing a skeleton suit and
tarrying a scythe. Like the "Destroyer" deities of the east, the Macabre figure represented the Gnostic death-in-life principle. See Mask.
Macha
H'Great Queen of Phantoms," worshipped in Ireland even before the
coming of the Celts; probably identical with the Central Asian Moon
feoddess Macha Alia, Mother of Life and Death. She appeared in the
pld Testament as Queen Maachah, whose spirit was worshipped as an dol in a grove until ousted by her "son," King Asa (1 Kings 15:13). [The mountaintop temple of Machaerus (where John the Baptist met his lUoom) may have been named for her.
Macha's Irish shrine was Emain Macha, capital of Ulster. Its
heavenly form was Emania, the Moon-goddess's realm of death. 1 As
the third person or death-aspect of the triple Morrigan she presided over in extensive necropolis. Like other versions of the deadly mother
i Morgan, Durga, Uma, Kara), she haunted battlefields and made magic
vith the blood of slain men. 2 She was also identified with the Fairy
Queen, Mab. As a trinitarian Goddess, she cast her death curse on Cu
phulainn in the guise of three druidic "sorceresses of Mab." 3
Some said the voice of Macha summoned men to death, and it was Jhe same as the dread voice of the Banshee, or "woman of the
563



Mader-Akka barrow-graves." 4 Since followers of the Old Religion went to her land
Maera of death, naturally their spirits inhabited the ancient tombs that also
^^^^^^^^^^ represented her womb of rebirth.

Madri
"Mother," in Tantric Buddhism a Goddess of Enlightenment who gave birth to the moon and sun; the Great Mother as a spouse of one the popular incarnations of the Buddha. 1

Maenads
Priestesses of Dionysus and Orpheus, named after their original home, the holy mountain of Maenalus, where Pan also lived as an
Arcadian shepherd. Possessed by the spirit of the wine god, the
Maenads became "wild women" who tore apart their sacrificial victim
and devoured him during their orgies. In the more civilized classical
age, they worshipped their Savior with a drunken feast and carnival
processions. In Rome they were called Bacchantes, dedicated to their god under his Roman name of Bacchus. See Orphism.
Maera
Black bitch-totem of Hecate, a form assumed by her Trojan incarna
tion, Queen Hecuba, when she was captured by Odysseus. The cause of his long wandering exile apparently was the curse Hecuba-Maera laid on him. Some said she was killed and buried in "The Bitch's Tomb." Others said she scared away her enemies with her spells and curses and ran free.
She was an animal version of the fatal Crone-goddess Moera,
symbolized by the Lesser Dog Star whose rising announced human sacrifices in Attica. One of her victims was a king whose daughter
Odysseus married, "and whose fate he will therefore have shared in
the original myth." ' Similar sacrifices were still offered to the Death

Magdala
"High Place," or "Temple"; in Herod's triple-towered palace in Jerusalem, the sanctuary of Queen Mariamne. Thus "Miriam of Magdala" (Mary Magdalene) was either the queen herself or a high priestess impersonating the Goddess Mari. See Mary.
Magen David
"Shield of David," the so-called Star of David or hexagram con
structed of two interlocked triangles, now accepted as a symbol of
Judaism. Actually, it was not associated with Judaism until the late
Middle Ages and was not officially accepted as a Jewish symbol until the
17th century. 1 The original source of the Magen David was the Tantric "Great
Yantra," which stood for union of the sexes: the downward-pointing
triangle being female, the upward-pointing one male, the two signifying the eternal union of God and Goddess. 2 Cabalistic sex-worship
brought the Yantra into Jewish tradition, but later puritanical elements
obscured its original meaning. 1. Encyc. Brit, "Magen David." 2. Zimmer, p. 147.
Magi
"Magicians," the Three Wise Men inserted into the Christian birth
story because Persian-Essenic sages taught that the Magi were the only
seers able to read the coming of the Messiah's star and so identify the
right Divine Child. This teaching stemmed ultimately from Egypt, where the Three Wise Men were the three stars in the Belt of Orion,
pointing to Osiris's star Sothis (Sirius), which "rose in the east" to
announce the coming of the Savior at the season of the Nile flood.
(See Osiris.) These three Belt stars were still called Magi in the Middle
Ages. 1 In Rome early in the Christian era, Magi meant priests of Mithra
(the original Persian "Messiah"), or astrologers, or miscellaneous healers and miracle-workers; it was a term for magicians in general. Roman Christians were hostile to the Magi but were forced to retain

Magic the three Magi of the Gospel story because their presence was empha
sized as evidence of Jesus's divinity.
l.Jobes,221.
Giovanni della Porta's list said ancient
magicians were called magos by Persians; sapientes by the Latins; philosophes by the Greeks; Brachmanes or
gymnosophistas by the Indians; Chaldaeos
by the Babylonians and Assyrians; Drydas, Bardos, and Semnothesby the Celts; sacerdotes by
the Egyptians; and prophetes by the Cabalists. History's
leading magicians were Persia's Zoroaster, Rome's Numa
Pompilius, Thrace's Zalmoxis, Babylon's Buddha, and Egypt's Hermes. 3
Giovanni della Porta (1535-1615) Neapolitan philosopher and author, who wrote comedies as well as scientific treatises
on magnetism, agriculture, optical phenomena, cryptography, steam engines, chemistry, astrology, and demonology. He founded the Accademia dei Segreti,
which the Inquisition later suppressed.
Magic
Though the church condemned magic as a devilish art, the Ages of
Faith were filled with magical beliefs and practices. Magic was legal in Roman times; this tolerance continued through the early Middle
Ages, in some areas much longer than that. Sir Walter Raleigh praised
magic as a route to "virtues hidden in the center of the center." He
said magic "bringeth to light the inmost virtues, and draweth them out of Nature's hidden bosom to human use." '
The nobility including princes of the church supported court magicians, astrologers, and diviners who helped them conduct their
affairs. 2 Scholars carefully classified different types of magicians, as if to
distinguish the heretical from the acceptable. The "ancients" were
respected for their great magical wisdom. Mixtures of tradition and confusion characterized nearly all the
manifestations of magic, especially the verbal charms and holy names
popularly supposed to invoke supernatural powers necessary to the "working." A magician must recite defensive charms while enroute
to the scene of a magical operation, such as: "Zazaii, Zamaii, Puidamon
most powerful, Sedon most strong, El, Yod He Vau He (the
tetragrammaton), Iah, Agla, assist me an unworthy sinner who have
had the boldness to pronounce these Holy Names which no man
should name and invoke save in very great danger. Therefore have I
recourse unto these Most Holy Names, being in great peril both of soul and of body. Pardon me if I have sinned in any manner, for I trust
in Thy protection alone, especially on this journey." Proceedings were usually opened with an "evocation," often involving a sacrifice to be performed in a specific manner. The Grand Grimoire gives a
sample:
On the third day ofthe moon, the witch or sorcerer will sever the head of
a virgin kid with one stroke, a clean cut. The kid will be garlanded with verbena and green ribbon beforehand and the sacrifice must take place far away from habitation. A clean, new knife is used; the celebrant must bare the right shoulder and keep a willow wood lire brightly aflame.
Saying: "I offer this creature to three, O great Adonai, Elohim, Ariel
andjehovas, in the honor and power and the resplendence of The Name,
which is greater than all the spirits. O Great Adonai: agree to accept it
as agreeable."*
Magic books were full of charms in series, with assurances that if
one charm failed to call up the dread spirits, then surely the next one, bearing even more powerful names, would work. Demons who stubbornly refused to appear were threatened with eternal torments.
566



I he frustrated magician played God and enchanted recalcitrant
Ipirits into deeper circles of hell. The silliness of the grimoires can only
je appreciated through their own words; here in a series of invocapns from the Lemegeton or Lesser Key of Solomon:
O mighty and potent prince Samael, who art the ruler and governor ofthe first hour ofthe day by the decree ofthe Most High God, King of
Glory; I, the servant ofthe Most High, do desire and entreat you by three
great and potent names of God, Adonai, Aglaon, Tetragrammaton, and by the power and virtue thereof, to assist me in my affairs, and by your
power and authority to send me, causing to appear before me, all or any ofthe angels whom I shall call by name, the same being resident
under your government. I do further entreat and require that they shall help me in all matters which accord with their office, even as I shall desire, and that they shall act for me as for the servant ofthe Most High. Amen.
If this legalistic contract failed to bind the demons, the magician
pmmonly resorted to threats:
Because thou art disobedient, and obeyst not my commandments nor the precepts ofthe Lord thy God, now I, who am the servant ofthe Most
High and Imperial Lord God ofHosts, Jehovah, having His celestial power and permission, for this thine averseness and contempt, thy great disobedience and rebellion, will excommunicate thee, will destroy thy
name and seal, and bury them in unending oblivion, unless thou
comest immediately, visibly and affably, here before this circle, within this triangle, assuming a fair and comely form, without doing harm unto myselfor any creature whatsoever, but giving reasonable answer to my
requests and performing my desire in all things.
Solemn magicians seem not to have realized the absurdity of
! [(communicating a demon, who was hardly likely to be distressed by bvering relations with the church, since he had presumably severed
clations with God already. Nevertheless, wizards were supplied with :pe following curse for excommunication:
Thou art still pernicious and disobedient, willing not to appear and inform me upon that which I desire to know; now therefore, in the Name and by the power and dignity of the Omnipotent and Immortal Lord God of
Hosts, Jehovah Tetragrammaton, sole Creator ofHeaven, Earth, and Hell, with all contained therein, the marvellous Disposer ofall things
visible and invisible, I do hereby curse and deprive thee ofall thine office, power and place; I bind thee in the depth of the Bottomless Pit, there to remain unto the Day ofJudgment, in the Lake ofFire and
Brimstone, prepared for the rebellious Spirits. May all the Company of Heaven curse thee; may the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the Light ofthe Hosts ofheaven, curse thee into lire unquenchable, into torments unspeakable; and even as thy name and seal are bound up in this box, to be choked with sulphureous and stinking substances and to burn in this material fire, so, in the name ofJehovah, and by the power and dignity ofthe three names, Tetragrammaton, Anexhexeton, Primematum, may
all these drive thee, O thou disobedient Spirit N., into the Lake ofFire.
Magic
Grand Grimoire One of the most popular Renaissance collections of spells,
exorcisms, invocations, and magical recipes.
567



Magic The grimoires provided many excuses for failure. They required infinite care in the manufacture of tools, with complicated charms and
^^^^^^^^^^ debilitating purifications, fasting, and penance. Their lists of holy
names and words of power were lengthy and hard to remember and
letter-perfect recitation was essential. The practice of magic was
clearly beyond the grasp of the lazy, stupid, or illiterate. Unfortunately i was also beyond the grasp of the credulous educated as well.
A grimoire called the Little Albert gave an infallible formula for
making a ring of invisibility, but the ring had to be plaited with three hairs from the head of a hyena. 6 Hyenas were scarce in Europe, but
even if one could be found, its head hairs would prove too short to be
plaited in a ring. Similarly impossible prescriptions appeared in all magi< books. The more infallible the charm, the more outrageously difficult
its execution.
Faith in magic was identical with faith in religion. Both depended
on hieratic ceremony and verbal incantation. Both involved prayer to
a superior power even the same power in both cases. Both used the
name as a vehicle of appeal and coercion. The pious practiced magic no less than the impious by way of a thousand informal charms like the
following, advocated in 1785 to learn winning numbers in the
French national lottery:
LordJesus Christ, Who hast said, "lam the Way, the Truth, and the Life, "for Thou hast cherished truth and hast shown me the secrets of
Thy wisdom whereby again this night the unknown things which are not revealed save to the lowly shall be revealed to me, send me the angels Uriel, Rubiel, and Barachiel to teach me which numbers I must choose k win, by Him Who will come to judge the quick and the dead and the
times by fire. 7
Peasant magic was usually crude, without the secret names and
verbose invocations requiring a written recipe. Illiterate witches simply
performed acts of magic, like this rude country charm to cure
lameness:
Take hog's dung and charnell, and put them together and hold them in your left hand, and take in the other hand a knife, and prick the medicine three times, then cast the same into the tire, and take the said
knife and make three pricks under a table, and let the knife stick there; and after that take three leaves ofsage, and as many ofherb John, and pui
them into ale, and drink it last at night and first in the morning. 8
A witch's patient testified that this procedure did indeed give her
"ease of her lameness." We may laugh, but equally crude magic has
been promulgated for profit in our own time, often by churches themselves. In 1880, one of the leading churches in Philadelphia sold
blessed candles with the guarantee that the purchaser would be
preserved for one year from all disorders of the throat. A sermon was
preached to this effect, and seven examples given of miraculous cures.9 The mass of exploitable believers was still evident a century latei

in 1970, when an enterprising seer sold healing cloths by radio Magic
: advertising: "I lay hands on a cloth," he said. "The healing power of God which I received four years ago is passed on to the cloth which I ^^^^^^^^^^^
isend to you." 10 Christians practiced magic from the very beginning of the church.
Isaac of Antioch complained in the 5 th century that not only the
people but clergymen also "carry about the incantations of the magi
icians; and instead of the holy cross, lo, they carry the books of devils . . . ;
i b child carries about devils' names and comes to church." u In other
words, pagan amulets were credited with as much protective power as
jChristian amulets. St. Jerome himself affirmed that a sapphire amulet
a ['procures favor with princes, pacifies enemies, and obtains freedom
ifrom captivity." 12 Christian authorities said an amulet containing many secret names
f God was sure to keep the bearer from any evil death. The cake of
ax called Agnus Dei (Lamb of God) was advertised by Pope Urban V
as a sure protection against lightning, fire, and water; also a charm for |sasy childbirth and remittance of sins. Various charms were sold by the
: church to preserve horses' hoofs from cracks, to prevent disease, to enhance sexual potency. Girls wishing to grow long hair were told to
hang locks of their hair before an image of St. Urbane. Christians had
malevolent charms too. It was believed that any man would die within a
year if the 108th Psalm was "said against" him by a priest. 13 The
, Mass was credited with potent magical force for both good and evil uses.
Masses were said for healing, for fertility, for magical protection of
r livestock, houses, boats, etc.; they were also said to kill enemies. From the 7th to the 1 5 th century, church literature spoke of priests who
could cause death by saying the Mass for the Dead against living
frsons.
14
Up to the 17th century it was still written that a dream revealing
:he whereabouts of any stolen article could be obtained by placing
jnder one's pillow a wax tablet with the names of the Magi Jasper,
Melchisor (sic), and Balthasar. Another kind of magical dream, to see
the face of one's future mate, could be had by putting a Bible under the
jpillow with a sixpence inserted in the Book of Ruth. 15 Many magic
:harms invoked the names of apostles:
The devil is tying a knot in my leg!
Mark, Luke, andJohn, unloose it, I beg; Crosses three we make to ease us: Two for the thieves, and one for Christ Jesus! 16
Priests often tried to impress simple folk by teaching them magic :harms. Ady's maid was given a charm to make butter come in the :hurn, by an old woman who said her mother had it from "a learned Church man in Queen Maries days, when as church men had more
cunning, and could teach people many a trick, that our Ministers
now a days know not." 17 Typical Christian magic included verbal
569



Magna Dea charms to exorcise, heal, bless, or excommunicate; the wearing of
Magog amulets such as crucifixes, St. Christopher medals, and scraps of the ^^^^^^^^^^^m scriptural texts; the use of holy water; the invocation of saints; and of
course the belief in miracles generally for "magic" and "miracle" were but different words for the same idea.

Magna Dea
"Great Goddess" of Syria, worshipped especially at Hierapolis, "Holy City." The same title was applied to all Goddesses throughout the Roman empire, which was verging on a concept of female mono
theism when Jewish, Persian, and Christian patriarchy intervened.
Magnates
"Landowners," medieval noblemen, whose title in the Balkans prob
ably descended from the Magnetes or Centaurs. Equestrian warriors
were the model of every military aristocracy in Europe: Spanish
caballeros, French chevaliers, English cavaliers, all meant "riders of horses."
Magog
"Mother of Gog," biblical name of the Scythian-Amazonian Goddess and her land in the north, whence came equestrian warriors greatly
feared by the Semites, to judge from the prophets' lengthy cursings and invocations for their defeat (Ezekiel 38). Authors of Genesis made Magog a "son" of Japheth (Genesis 10:2), though Japheth himself was not a Hebraic hero but a borrowed
form of the titan Iapetus in Greek myth. 1 From this bit of syncretic
confusion arose the impression that Magog was a male, and a giant,
for a titan's offspring would naturally be another titan.
Though tribes of western Asia continued to worship Magog as a
Goddess, in Europe "Gogmagog" was usually envisioned as a demonic colossus. "Ma" was merged with the Celtic mac to yield an
interpretation of "Gog, son of Gog." Gog and Magog were commonly used names for any pair of colossal figures, especially figures of pagan deities. Yet, curiously, "Gog and Magog" appeared in Renaissance magic books as two of the Ineffable Names of God. 2

Hindu sage, a word literally meaning "Great Mother," masculinized In much the same way as the Semitic ima, "mother," became imam, a male sage. The original mahatmas were the Primal Matriarchs, or
jnatrikadevis.
Mahdi
]One guided by, sent by, or given by the Moon-goddess Mah; Arabic
iMoslem title of the promised Messiah, who became the Desired Knight pf medieval European romance. He was essentially the same as the
final avatar of Buddha, the Kalki yet to appear on earth; or the Persian
Messiah, or the Christian Christ in his Second Coming. The Mahdi
[would be born of "the Virgin Paradise" (Pairidaeza), who embodied the
(spirit of the Moon-goddess on earth. His coming was so eagerly pvaited that many historical Islamic leaders claimed to personify him.
After Arabia was converted to Islam, it was usually supposed that the Mahdi would be sent by Allah. But he was older than Islam. As
jhis title suggests, he was a Son of the Moon in the most primitive times, when all Arabia was the territory of the lunar Goddess, one of whose oldest names was Mah. 1 See Ma.

Maia
Mama
Maia
"Grandmother of Magic," mother of the Greeks' Enlightened One, Hermes; the western version of Maya, "Magic," mother of the Hindus'
Enlightened One, Buddha. She personified the powers of transformation and material "appearances," the same powers attributed to Maya-Kali, who made the universe by her magic. Greek writers
called Maia one of the Pleiades, but also understood that she was the
Great Goddess of Maytime festivals, of the renewal and rebirth of the dead. She made her son Hermes the Conductor of Souls in the
underworld, just as the Hindu Maya made her masculine counterpart Ya-Ma into a Conductor of Souls and Lord of Death. 1

Mama
Title of the Great Goddess Ma, or Mama, the world's basic name for
"mother's breasts." Mother Kali was sometimes Mamaki, spirit of the
world's "Fertilizing Waters." She was also Mamata, spirit of "mine
ness" or belonging, binding members of the same matrilineal clan
together through the blood of mothers. 1 In Mesopotamia, she was Mami or Mammitu or Mama, the Creatress who made mankind of clay and nourished her creatures with her own magic fluids. 2

Mammisi Mammisi
Egyptian "motherhood temple" usually built to honor the queen's Mamom
maternity, after she gave birth to her first child and so became assimilat- ^^^mmmmi^m ed to the Goddess. Queen Cleopatra had a mammisi built for
worship of her own motherhood after the birth of her first child. It was
still standing in the 19th century a.d. but has since vanished. See
Cleopatra VII.
| Mammon
Medieval demon of commercial acquisitiveness, whose name meant
"riches." In the Middle East, the original meaning of this name was the
rich outpouring of the Great Goddess's inexhaustible breasts (mam
mae), which nourished all her children; Babylon named her Mami or
Mammitu (Mother), the biblical Mamre. Some Sumero-Babylonian scriptures called her "Mammetun the mother of destinies." '
Jesus's precept, "Ye cannot serve God and Mammon" (Luke 16: 1 3) meant a choice between God and Goddess, in a time when
I her temples were richer and more magnificent than his. The Gospels demanded that her shrines be destroyed and her wealth taken away,
in an obviously jealous attack on the "Many-breasted" Goddess "whom all Asia and the world worshippeth" (Acts 19:27). Like the Oriental Goddess Earth (Artha, "riches"), she stood for material wealth because
I her temples had a great deal of it and her soil was the ultimate source
of all. 2
It was the habit of demonologists to masculinize even Goddesses
when they were diabolized and consigned to hell. Even Ashtoreth, or Astarte, was a male in hell. Much the same thing seems to have happened to Mammetun: she became a "lord" of riches. Weyer made her/him a dignitary of hell and an ambassador from hell to
I England, probably a reflection of resentment of English
commercialism. 3

Primal Mother of the Yanomamo tribes, who gave birth to the first
people and instituted ritual cannibalism.
Mamom
"Grandmother," the oldest style of Maya pottery, designed and executed by women, to whom the art of pottery was sacred. See Potter.
573



Man
The Goddess-orGod Mana-Anna, or Mannanan, was masculinized as a "son of Lir" of Sidh Finnaha. Lir however was the same as
Shakespeare's King Lear, who had three daughters but no son. 10
Thus, Shakespeare's source seems to indicate that this child of Lir
was originally the Triple Goddess, for one of the so-called daughters,
Cordelia, was really Creiddylad, another name for the Fairy Queen. 11
Man
In the original Old Norse, man meant "woman." 1 The word for "man" was not man but wer, from the Sanskrit root viras in wer-wulf, the man-wolf. 2 The name Man meant the Moon, creatress of all
creatures according to Scandinavian and other tribes throughout Europe. Even in imperial Rome, Man or Mana was the mother of all manes or ancestral spirits. The Sanskrit root man meant "moon" and
"wisdom," both the primary attributes of the Great Goddess. 3
Heathen skalds composed a class of sacred love songs to the
feminine principle of the Moon and her earthly incarnation, woman;
these were mansongr, "woman-songs." They were expressly prohibited by the Catholic church.4
The Isle of Man was formerly sacred to the Moon-goddess, who was sometimes a mermaid or an androgynous Aphrodite who kept
men's souls in "pots turned upside down" i.e., grave mounds and
beehive tombs. 5 Passage graves in East Jutland were full of upturned pots, an Iron Age burial custom.6 The same custom was mentioned in
South America where the Moon carries souls away and places them
under upturned pots. 7 Apparently the Isle of Man used to be a sacred Isle of the Dead. The name of its deity was variously rendered Man,
Mana, Mana-Anna, or Manannan. The island used to have an "enchanted palace" with a crypt or
chapel of thirteen pillars, the sacred number of the old lunar year.
Every visitor was expected to count the pillars. If the counting ceremo
ny was omitted, the visitor would be imprisoned in the crypt, which
indicates a burial place sacred to the Moon. The site was later destroyed
by "salt spilled on the ground," a reference to Christians' habit of
leveling pagan shrines and sowing the ground with salt to make it
infertile.
The Moon-goddess appeared in Manx legend as a Fairy Queen who sometimes led the whole male population "into the sea, where
they perished." Most probably they perished first and were given to the sea-wornb as in the ancient Norse funeral rite. The Fairy Queen
escaped annihilation by the priests when she took the form of a wren. But pious Manxmen organized wren hunts, a custom followed every New Year's Day thereafter, killing scores of the little birds in an effort to
kill "Jenny Wren," the fairy. Feathers of the slain wrens were said to
preserve sailors from shipwreck, and no Manx sailor would go to sea without one. 8 The wren hunts possibly were pre-Christian, with the
legend of the Fairy Queen invented for a new rationale. Before the
missionaries came, wrens probably were the "soul-birds" sacrificed to
the Goddess. Vallancey said the druids considered the wren supreme
among all birds. "The superstitious respect shown to this bird gave offense to our first Christian missionaries, and by their commands he is still hunted and killed by the peasants on Christmas Day, and on the
574



following (St. Stephen's Day) he is carried about hung by the leg, in the I center of two hoops crossing each other at right angles." 9

Mana
Managarm
Mana
Nearly all languages had a cognate of this word, the basic meaning of
which was maternal power, moon-spirit, magic, supernatural force, and a title of the Goddess. Mana came back into English via anthropolog
ical studies in the South Pacific, where the word was described as
follows:
Mana is the stuffthrough which magic works . . . proceeding immediately from the nature ofthe sacred person or thing, or mediately because a
ghost or spirit has put it into the person or thing. . . . The cult ofthe relics ofsaints springs from the belief that their bodies, whether living or
dead, possessed Mana. 3
Mana also ruled the underworld, which the Finns called Manala. 6 The Romans knew her as a very ancient Goddess Mana or Mania,
| governing the underground land of the long dead: the ancestral spirits called manes, her children. They dwelt in a pit under the lapis manalis
in the Forum, emerging to receive their offerings on the annual feast
I day of the Maniae. 7 On this occasion the Goddess Mania appeared in a
fright mask, like the terrifying Crone-face of Medusa or Destroying Kali. 8
Mania was not solely a spirit of death or madness, however, in classical times. Her "moon-madness" or "lunacy" was viewed as a
revelation of the divine, to be received with gratitude. Socrates said,
"The greatest of our blessings come to us through mania. . . .
Madness coming from [the deity] is superior to sanity of human origin." 9 In other words, Mana-Mania was the Muse. Gnostics said
Mana is "the divine spirit in man"; and the Great Mana, or Mana of
I Glory, is "the highest godhead." 10

-anagarm
"Moon-Dog," firstborn wolf-son of Angurboda, the Danish death
idess called Hag of the Iron Wood, mother of Hel. Managarm and
brother wolves carried the bodies of the dead to Valhalla by g them. See Dog.
var. Mania
Mana may be compared to Hindu Maya, the Virgin Goddess whose name
was "power," and Arabic Manat, the Virgin Goddess whose name was "fate"
and who represented the Triple Moon. 1 In
archaic Europe, Mana was the Moonmother who gave birth to the race of man that is, of woman, which is what
man originally meant. 2
Mana or Mania became a common name for the Great Goddess as Creatress and Queen of Heaven (moon), because it was
intimately connected with the mysterious powers of women, like the moon itself. Scandinavians called the Goddess's sky
realm Manavegr, "the Moon's Way."4 Celts called it E-Mania,
or Hy Many, the
land ruled by the Triple Goddess. Sometimes it was Emain Macha, the moon-land of Mother Macha. Cormac's Glossary

Manasa-Devi Manicheans

Serpent Goddess of Bengal, identified with the moon, bearing the moon's magic name Mana.
Mana . . .
said ema meant "blood'
(compare the Semitic ima, "mother," and dam, meaning both "mother" and
"blood"). Emain, therefore, was the country of the Great
Mother's regenerative lunar blood. 5
Manat
Arabic Moon-goddess, ruler of Fate: thus her name is still a synonym for Luck or Fortune. She was venerated in a sacred stone at Kodaid in
pre-Islamic times, and was one of the trinity of Fates worshipped at Mecca. See Arabia.
Mandala
Oriental sacred diagram or meditation symbol, usually circular, some
times square, sometimes another regular shape, such as the Eight- Petaled Lotus of Smashana-Kali. Contemplation of the manda
la was supposed to lead to mystical insight.
Vesica piscis
Mandorla
"Almond," the pointed-oval sign of the yoni, used in Oriental art to signify the divine female genital; also called vesica piscis, the Vessel of
the Fish. Almonds were holy symbols because of their female, yonic
connotations. Almonds had the power of virgin motherhood, as shown by the myth of Nana, who conceived the god Attis with her own
almond. 1 The candlestick of the Jews' tabernacle of the Ark was
decorated with almonds for their fertility magic (Exodus 25:33-34). Christian art similarly used the mandorla as a frame for figures of God,
Jesus, and saints, because the artists forgot what it formerly meant.
l.Frazer.G.B.,403.
576
Manicheans
Gnostic Christian sect, a leading rival of the early orthodoxy. St. Augustine was a Manichean for over a decade, before he was
converted to orthodoxy and began writing arguments against the precepts of his former teachers. 1 Founder of the Manichean sect was the third-century Persian prophet Manes or Mani, whose legend claimed he was another incarnation of Christ. He was born of a holy virgin named Mariham, or Mar Mariam, "the Lady Mary," whose title was "Mother of the Life of the Whole World." 2 He performed the usual feats of every Savior:
preached, healed the sick, exorcised demons, collected twelve disci



I pies, and eventually suffered martyrdom. He was crucified and flayed by jthe Persian king, perhaps as a ritual surrogate. 3 Mani's central doctrine was puritanical. The material world was
I the work of the devil, who invented sex to entrap ethereal souls in the prison of flesh: the same view was held by the Essenes. Mani's
'followers abstained from sex, and also from animal food, even eggs,
|believing that all flesh was evil if begotten by copulation. They ate fish,
I pretending that fish do not reproduce sexually but are spontaneously
Ijengendered from "living water." Christians' adoption of the Aphrodijtean fish symbol for Christ may have been a Manichean idea. 4
According to Mani, the devil who created this world of gross
[matter was the Jewish Jehovah. He said: "It is the Prince of Darkness
Iwho spoke with Moses, the Jews, and their priests. Thus the Christians, ithe Jews, and the Pagans are involved in the same error when they
worship this God. For he led them astray in the lusts that he taught
pern." 5 Like Jesus, Mani faced this same demon-god on a moun
fltaintop and resisted his temptation. The demon-god offered Jesus "all flthe kingdoms of the earth" in return for a single act of worship,
mplying that all the kingdoms of the earth belonged to the devil, who could dispose of them as he pleased (Matthew 4:9). Jesus refused the bffer, and so did Mani.
Manicheans naturally aroused the ire of orthodox Christians by
balling their God a devil. Eusebius fairly frothed with indignation at
jpese heretics: "Mani presumed to represent the person of Christ; he (proclaimed himself to be the Comforter, and the Holy Ghost, and
being puffed up with this frantic pride, chose, as if he were Christ,
twelve partners of his new-found doctrine, patching into one heap felse and detestable doctrines of old, rotten, and rooted out heresies, the
|*rhich he brought out of Persia." 6
This was wishful thinking on Eusebius's part. The heresy was not
looted out. The Manichean idea of the Catholic demon-Jehovah was
o recur again and again through the Middle Ages, in sects like the
3athari, Paulicians, Albigensians, Bogomils, and many others. In /iew of the sufferings of these people at the hands of Catholic Rome,
heir premise seemed not unfounded. One historian said the Mani
:hean heresy was conquered only by "massacre and violence at first,
ind afterward by organized terrorism." 7 So terrible were the persecu
ions that Lea said, "If the blood of the martyrs were really the seed of Church, Manicheism would now be the dominant religion of
rope." 8

Mante objected and even fought back, there arose what General Philip Mantra Sheridan called "the vexed Indian question." The general's solution to ,^^__^^^^^^ the question was to exterminate the buffalo, on whom the Plains
Indians depended for food, shelter, and clothing. When the great herds were killed and left to rot, many Indian tribes died of famine. This
was hailed as a working of Manifest Destiny. 1 It was also part of Manifest Destiny that the Indians must be
converted to the conquerors' religion. They didn't like that either. In 1805 a Seneca chief told a missionary: "Brother, we do not wish to
destroy your religion, or take it from you; we only want to enjoy our own. Brother, we are told that you have been preaching to white people
in this place . . .; we will wait a little while and see what effect your
preaching has upon them. If we find it does them good, makes them
honest, and less disposed to cheat Indians, we will then consider again
what you have said." 2

Mante
"Prophetess," or "One Inspired by the Moon"; title of oracular priestesses in ancient Thebes. In patriarchal myth, Mante was a "daugh
ter" of the Theban sage Teiresias, daughter being the usual replacement for mother, as in the reversed story of Adam and Eve. The
myth signified male usurpation of the priestesses' functions of magic
and prophecy, at first by transvestism and/or castration to turn men into
pseudo-women; Teiresias was made female and lived for seven years
as a temple harlot, which gave him his divinatory powers. 1 The Mantes eventually came to include male priests, then to consist of a wholly
male priesthood. Souls of such magical folk were thought to take the form of insects between incarnations, hence the "praying mantis." The same Greek root word meant a method of divination, as in
necromancy, geomancy, oneiromancy, pyromancy, etc.
1. Graves, CM. 1,258; 2, 396.
Mantra
Sanskrit term for a spoken formula incorporating "words of power,"
like Egyptian hekau or the Neoplatonic Logos. The root word man meant feminine "wise blood" emanating from the moon; it was
usually defined as Intelligence.
1 Like the Muses who gave Greek poets the gift of words, the Mother Goddesses or matrikadevis gave
Sanskrit poets the secret of mantras, by which the gods themselves coul<
be controlled. 2 The matrikamantra or Mother of Mantras was Kali's Word of
Creation Om, meaning her own "pregnant belly" and perhaps
578



stemming from the grunting exhalation of a woman in childbirth; for Mantra
Om was the word Kali uttered in giving birth to the universe. 3 The
second most famous Tantric mantra, Om manipadme hum, Jewel in ^^^^^^^^^^^
the Lotus, referred to the Lord of the universe contained within the Goddess.
Hindus believed anything could be accomplished if one only knew the correct mantras. Compendia like the Tantrasara gave "prayers,
Mantras and Dharanis to protect against every form of evil, against the
bad Spirits, wild beasts, natural calamities, human enemies, and so
forth which were said to be effective, provided that they were applied in the proper disposition and at the right time and in the right manner." To produce the desired effect, "the Mantra must be intoned in the
proper way, according to both sound (Varna) and rhythm (Svara)." Therefore a Mantra loses its efficacy when translated into another
language. 4 The same belief led the Catholic church to retain Latin as its
liturgical tongue, 1 500 years after Latin ceased to exist in the mouths
of ordinary folk. Like Brahman priests with their God-controlling mantras, church fathers thought the very sound of the words had
been invested with magic power at the see of St. Peter; so translation of
the Latin would rob the words of their power to make God act. 5 This
superstition forced Christian laymen to listen, century after century, to church services of which they couldn't understand a single word.
The idea of the mantra wasn't introduced into Rome by Chris
tians; it was there already. Pagan Romans believed, as Virgil said, that the right words, rightly spoken, could draw the moon down from the
sky. A ritual of "drawing down the moon" is still practiced by modern "witches." 6 By the power of her words, a Roman priestess could "arrest
the flow of rivers and turn back the stars in their courses; she
summons the nocturnal spirits; you will see the ground rumble beneath her feet; and the ash trees descend from the mountains." 7
All liturgies were basically mantras, evolved from the primitive I theory that human words could make things happen in the supernatural realm, which in turn influenced the natural one. An example is the
|
idea of praying souls out of Purgatory, where "mantras" alone
produce the result even though the result is unverifiable. This also had
Tantric precedents. Tibetan lamas still circumvent their own law
against eating animal flesh by eating it anyway, to the accompaniment of a mantra that will assure the eaten animal's rebirth in heaven.8
Thus the offended creature is placed, by human words, in a blessed
situation where he can no longer take offense. Naturally, mantras of
such marvelous power are revealed only with great care, by qualified gurus to tested candidates worthy to become Guardians of the
Mysteries. 9

Manu Manu
ara The Vedic Noah, who rode out the Deluge in his ark with the
MamiHHai assistance of the Great Serpent, Vasuki. Manu's ark, loaded with the
seeds of every plant and a pair of every kind of animal, tied up to the Serpent's horn and so survived the watery chaos between the destruc
tion of one universe and the creation of the next. 1
Manu's ark was the cosmic seed-vessel, in pre-Vedic myth the
womb of the Goddess, which preserved the spark of life through cycles of destruction and renewal. It seems Manu was a masculinized form of Ma-Nu or Mother Night, the name she bore in Egypt, as the
spirit of the primordial abyss that gave birth to the cosmos. Sumerians knew her as Nammu, "the primeval ocean, the mother of the gods." 2 The archaic notion of Manu as a Creatress also attributed to her
the foundation of morality and law; hence the scriptures that Vedic
sages called the Laws of Manu, frequently rewritten and augmented by patriarchal Brahman and Buddhist philosophies. However, Manu remained sexually ambiguous, like Egypt's Ma-Nu or Nu or Nun, who sometimes took the form of a great Fish who gave birth to the gods. 3
Nu was translated into Hebrew as Noah. Significantly, this name was
the "Fish" without the sexually definitive mother-syllable Ma. Vedic sages came to believe in Manu as a kind of Adam, the
progenitor of the human race, incestuously begotten by the Brahman creator upon his own daughter a reversal of the archaic myth of the
primal creatress who made, then mated with, her Great Serpent. So
many different acts, myths, laws, and customs were attributed to the
authority of Manu that this personage multiplied into 14 different Manus, avatars or reincarnations of the same Manu in different ages of
the world. 4 This may have been a re-interpretation of the original idea of successive universes, with the dark mother-womb bridging the
periods of watery chaos between them by preserving the seeds of
future life.

var. Marah Mara
Exceedingly ancient name of the Goddess-as-Crone, the deathbringer. The name and its variants may be found from India to northern
Europe. Buddhists translated the name as Fear-of-Death, and com
bined it with Kama, Erotic-Desire, to create the demon who tempted Buddha to abandon his meditation before he achieved true knowl
edge of Nirvana. 1 This "temptation in the wilderness" scene was
replayed over and over in subsequent legends of ascetic Saviors, such
as Mani and Jesus.
The gypsies, with their traditions rooted in Hinduism, knew Mara
to be the death goddess who trapped the soul of the Enchanted
580



Huntsman in a mirror, and caused his death a myth that paralleled Mardoll ancient Pelasgian stories of the death of Dionysus. 2 Marduk The Slavs said Mara or Mora was a destructive female spirit who ^^^^^^^^^^^
"drank the blood of men" by night. 3 She became the mare or Night
mare, "A monstrous hag squatting upon the breast mute, motionless and malignant; an incarnation of the evil spirit whose intolerable weight crushes the breath out of the body." 4 This was the same image assumed by black Kali the Destroyer, whose death aspect meant
"passive weight and darkness." 5 Semitic peoples associated Mara or Marah with the "passive
weight and darkness" of the deep sea-womb; thus the name was sometimes translated "briny" or "bitter." Marah was the name assumed
by the matriarch Naomi (Ruth 1 :20) as she passed into the Crone stage of her life. An old shrine of the goddess Mara was the Old
Testament's Maralah, "a place of trembling" (Joshua 19:1 1), possibly a necropolis. The biblical death-curse Maranatha (1 Corinthians 16:22) also invoked the destroying Goddess. Mari was another version of her name, as in Kel-Mari (Kali the Pot Goddess, who made mankind out of clay), Marici the Goddess "clothed with the sun," Yamamari, a combination of Mari with Yama or "Death," and Mari-Amma the
Death-giver, in Hebrew Mariamne, Miriam, or Mary.

Mardoll
"Moon Shining Over the Sea," an epithet of the Goddess Freya as
the Creatress brooding over the primal waters. 1 Her biblical form,
derived from older Sumero-Babylonian sources, was the (female) Spirit of God moving "on the face of the waters" (Genesis 1:2). See Tiamat.
1. Branston, 133.
Marduk
Babylonian municipal god whose legends strongly influenced Jewish ideas of Yahweh. Marduk claimed to have created the world by
separating the celestial and the abyssal waters, as Yahweh did (Gene
sis 1 :7); actually, Marduk did it by cleaving the body of his mother Tiamat, who personified all "Waters." Marduk also killed the first
born God, Kingu, and created the first man from Kingu's blood a myth remembered by the Arabs, who said Allah made man from flowing blood. 1 Marduk also inherited the tablets of sacred law that the
Mother Goddess had given her elder, favorite son. These same
tablets were entrusted to Babylonian kings by presentation on the holy
581



Marea "mountain" of the ziggurat. This tradition, too, was copied by the
Margaret, Saint God of Moses.

Marea
City in western Egypt, sacred to the Goddess Mari, possibly the so
called Land of Goshen occupied by Israelites before their expulsion from Egypt (see Moses). Mari was the same Goddess later wor
shipped in Israel as a consort of Yahweh. 1
1. Graves, W.G, 439.
Mare Nostrum
"Our sea," or "Our mother"; Roman title of the Mediterranean, or "Middle-of-the-Earth Sea." All seas were maria, "Marys," symbolized by the Goddess in her blue robe, sometimes a mer-maid (literally,
Sea-Virgin), often named Aphrodite Marina. See Mary.
Margaret, Saint
Mythical "virgin martyr" who never existed as a Christian but was a
canonized form of Aphrodite Marina, Pelagia, or Margarita, called Pearl of the Sea. 1 Originally she was a yonic Goddess representing Aphrodite's "Pearly Gate," which, like the Jade Gate of the Chinese Great
Mother, meant the genital entrance to paradise. The name Margaret may be traced to Sanskrit Marga, "the Gate" or "the Way," i.e., the
yonic gate of Kali-Shakti leading through ritual sexuality to the
paradise of Tantric sages. 2
Hagiographers invented several legends of Margaret-Pelagia-Marina, all names of the pagan Sea-goddess. Sometimes she was a virgin who suddenly turned Christian on her wedding day and so renounced
her bridegroom, the "sinful riotings" of the wedding feast, and the joys of married life which she decided were worthless as "dung."
Sometimes she was a divine harlot, the wealthiest and most beautiful
woman in Antioch, covered with gold, silver, and gems, who suddenly turned Christian and gave away all her possessions to poor folk
(Christians, of course), and allowed a bishop to impose on her a hard life
of penance. 3 This legend was a favorite of early saint-makers, who
particularly resented promiscuous women and invariably coveted their
ill-gotten gains. One legend made St. Margaret the daughter of a pagan priest. She spurned her rich suitor, Olybrius, governor of Antioch, and devoted herself to Christian virginity. She was subjected to amazing tortures to =
582



overcome her determination. "All her bones were laid bare, and the Margawse
blood poured forth from her body as from a pure spring." 4 But she still had strength enough to conquer the devil, who took the form of a ^^^^^^^^^^
great dragon and swallowed her, whereupon she caused his body to burst and stepped forth "unharmed" except of course for the harm
that had already been done by her various tortures. After this she was
burned, drowned, and beheaded: St. Margaret was very hard to kill.
Another legend of St. Margaret said she fled from her suitor to
become a holy hermit. She joined a monastery of ascetics, disguising herself as a monk, "Brother Pelagius." In this connection one might recall the rule of early Syrian churches, that no women would be permitted to become Christians unless they "made themselves male." 5 Margaret made herself male so successfully that she was accused of
seducing a nun, subjected to severe penances which she accepted humbly, and finally vindicated only after death, when those who came to prepare her body for burial discovered that she had been a woman. Under her other name of Pelagia, before she became the monk
Pelagius, Margaret devoted her early life to "lewd" worship of Aphrodite as a temple harlot. On being converted to Christianity, she called herself "a sea of wickedness overflowing with the waves of sin
... an abyss of perdition ... a quagmire and pitfall of souls." 6 The feast
day of this Margaret- Pelagia was the same as that of St. Thais,
another mythical version of the same courtesan-turned-Christian, the
second most popular type of female saint, after the "virgin martyr."
Since Margaret was fundamentally an incarnation of Aphrodite, spouse of Adonis "the Lord" at Bethlehem, it would be expected that
she remain the spouse of "the Lord"; and accordingly her worshippers
said, "Blessed art thou O Margaret the spouse of Christ." 7
Through all her appearances as virgin, harlot, monk, and so on, however, Margaret remained what the pagan Goddess always was:
the primary patron of childbearing women.

Margawse
Second person of the Celtic female trinity in Arthurian legend:
Elaine the virgin, Margawse the mother, Morgan the crone. Margawse was the same as the Latin Anna, the Mother of the Year: she gave
birth to the four Aeons, named Gareth, Gaheris, Agravine, and Gawain. She also mated with her brother Arthur and brought forth
[Arthur's nemesis, sister-son, son, tanist, and supplanter: Mordred,
whom Arthur tried to kill in his infancy. As Fate or perhaps
[Margawse herself decreed, Mordred lived to grow up and destroy
[Arthur.

Man Mari
Many place names evolved from Marian shrines. Among them were Amari or
Ay-Mari, the Cyprian home of Aphrodite Marina; Marib, City of the Moon, seat of the queens of Sheba; Marea in western Egypt; Maronea near Lake
Ismaris; Maru, mother-city of the Medes; Sa-Maria, a country whose name
meant literally "holy blood of Mary." 2 One of the entrances to her underworld womb, a sacred cave accessible only by sea,
was Mar-Mari, "Mother Sea." 3
Sometimes the deity was named simply Mer, an Egyptian word for both "waters" and "mother-love." 6 Mer was also a component of the names of Egyptian queens in the first
dynasty. One of Egypt's oldest names was TaMera, Land of the Waters, which could
also be interpreted as a Land of the Great Mothers. 7
Northern Europe knew the same Goddess as Maerin, wedded to Thor at her shrine in
Trondheim. H To the Saxons she was Wudu-Maer:
Basic name of the Goddess known to the Chaldeans as Marratu, to
the Jews as Marah, to the Persians as Mariham, to the Christians as
Mary: as well as Marian, Miriam, Mariamne, Myrrhine, Myrtea, Myrrha, Maria, and Marina. Her blue robe and pearl necklace were
classic symbols of the sea, edged with pearly foam. 1 The Goddess's Amorite city of Mari was one of the wonders of the
ancient world. Its six-acre temple-palace astonished archeologists who uncovered it in the 1930s. Mari dominated the area now known as the Holy Land until it fell to the armies of Hammurabi in 1700 b.c. 4
Semites worshipped an androgynous combination of Goddess and
God called Mari-El (Mary-God), corresponding to the Egyptian Meri-Ra which combined the feminine principle of water with the masculine principle of the sun. 5
The Syrian version of Mari or Meri was worshipped in combination with her serpent-consort Yamm, derived from Yama, the Hindu Lord of Death. Yamm alternated with Baal, "the Lord," as the
Goddess's favorite and a sovereign over heaven and the abyss. Indian
Yama was one of the consorts of Kel-Mari, as Kali was called in the
south. 8 Tantric Buddhists still speak of the "Slayer of the Death
King," Yama-Mari, who was identified with the Dalai Lama.9 Jews and early Christians used the same combination of names, Mari-Yamm or
Mariam, for the mother of Jesus. 10
The spirit of the archaic Mari entered into Babylonian diviners
known as mare baruti, sea-mothers, who operated in the bit mummu or womb-chamber, where statues of the gods were said to be "born"
(made animate). 11 In similar womb-chambers the Hindu goddess was worshipped as Kau-Mari or Kel-Mari. 12 She is still invoked as MariciTara, the Diamond Sow on the Lotus Throne, "Glorious One, the sun of happiness." She is the Goddess "whose mayik vesture is the sun," forerunner of the Gospels' "woman clothed with the sun"
(Revelation 12:1), who was identified with the virgin Mary. 13 She was also the Great Fish who gave birth to the gods, later the
Mermaid, Mare-mynd, mareminde, marraminde, maraeman, or mereminne. 20
In short, she was always Mother Sea. Her Latin name was Maria,
"the Seas." St. Peter Chrysologus called her Christian incarnation,
the virgin Mary, "the gathering together of the waters." 21 But she was
also the earth and heavens, since her earliest form was a trinity. She
was worshipped in pre- Roman Latium as Marica, mother of the first
king Latinus, who was also her priapic goat-footed consort Faunus. She was probably the same Goddess worshipped by the Slavs under the
name of Marzanna (Mari-Anna), who "fostered the growth of
fruits." 22
Mari and her pagan consort were incongruously canonized as a
pair of Christian saints, Addai and Mari (Adonis and Aphrodite
Mari). Their legends called them "bishops" dispatched to Aphrodite's
584



cult center at Edessa, probably because their portraits appeared there, and it was easier to Christianize them than to destroy them.
Their cult began with Nestorian Christians who called them "Holy
Apostles Addai and Mari." 23 Another Christianization was St. Maura, from the Goddess's Fate-name Moera, "older than Time." 24
As the Fate-spinner who held men's destinies in her hand, she
generated a taboo: on St. Maura'a day, women were forbidden to spin or sew. 25
Medieval Spain knew the Goddess Mari as a "Lady" or "Mistress"
who lived in a magic cave and rode through the night sky as a ball of
fire. 26 This may have meant the red harvest moon, or possibly the moon
in eclipse always a dire omen. The Goddess Mari was said to give
gifts of fairy gold and precious stones, which might turn into worthless lumps of coal by the light of day. 27 In later centuries, the same worthless gifts were given to "bad" children by St. Nicholas at
Christmas.
The island of Inis Maree had a ruined temple, sacred to a certain "St. Mourie" none other than the Goddess Mari for whom the
island was named. In 1678 the Presbytery of Dingwall "disciplined" some people who sacrified bulls to the divinity of Loch Maree on the
25th of August, a day dedicated to Aphrodite-Mari for more than 1 500

Marriage
The word marriage came from Latin maritare, union under the
auspices of the Goddess Aphrodite-Mari. Because the Goddess's pa
tronage was constantly invoked in every aspect of marriage, Christian fathers were opposed to the institution. Origen declared, "Matrimony is
impure and unholy, a means of sexual passion." St. Jerome said the primary purpose of a man of God was to "cut down with an ax of
Virginity the wood of Marriage." l St. Ambrose said marriage was a
crime against God, because it changed the state of virginity that God
gave every man and woman at birth. 2 Marriage was prostitution of e members of Christ, and "married people ought to blush at the state
which they are living." Tertullian said marriage was a moral crime,
more dreadful than any punishment or any death." It was spurcitiae,
obscenity," or "filth." 5
St. Augustine flatly stated that marriage is a sin. Tatian said
literally, a Wood-Mary, or Goddess of the Grove. To the Celts she was Maid Marian, beloved by Robin, the witches' Horned God. Their greenwood cult caused church authorities considerable trouble in the 14th
century. 15
Mari was the same Merian or Merjan worshipped in Persia as Queen of the Peris
(Fairies). 16 Iran had its
mother goddess Mariana from very ancient times. 17 She might be traced to the land of Akkad, created by a Goddess called the Lady Marri, Mother of the World. 18 A king of Mari in 2500 B.C., united with the
Goddess, took the royal name of LamkiMari. 19
St. Peter Chrysologus (Peter Golden-word) Fifthcentury bishop of Ravenna, friend of Pope Leo the Great. Three centuries after his death, a collection of 1 76 sermons was
produced, and attributed to him,
though mostly spurious. He was made a doctor of the church in 1729.

Marriage
Origen (Origenes Adamantius) Christian father, ca. 185-254
a.d., an Egyptian who wrote in Greek, ex
erting a powerful influence on the early Greek church. At first he was accounted a saint, but three centuries after his death he was declared a heretic because of Gnostic elements found in
his writings.
Tertullian (Quintus
Septimius Florens Tertullianus) influential early Christian writer and father of the church, ca. 1 5 5-220 a.d., born in
Carthage of pagan parents.
marriage is corruption, "a polluted and foul way of life." Influenced by him, Syrian churches ruled that no person could become Christian except celibate men, and no man who had ever been married could be baptized. Saturninus said God made only two kinds of people, good
men and evil women. Marriage perpetuated the deviltry of women, who dominated men through the magic of sex. 4 Centuries later, St. Bernard still proclaimed that it was easier for a man to bring the dead
back to life than to live with a woman without endangering his soul. 5
St. Paul damned marriage with faint praise, remarking that to
marry was only better than to burn (1 Corinthians 7:9); but later
followers of Pauline Christianity damned marriage altogether, according to the word of Jesus: "If any man come to me, and hate not his
father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters,
yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple" (Luke 14:26). Jesus renounced his family, declaring that he had no relatives except the
faithful (Mark 3:31-35). Jerome interpreted this as a mandate to
destroy marriage and the family. He was disgusted by motherhood: "the tumefaction of the uterus, the care of yelling infants, all those fond
feelings which death at last cuts short." 6 He said every man who loves
his wife passionately was guilty of adultery. 7 Augustine also expressed disgust at feminine sexual and maternal functions. He coined the saying
that birth is demonstrably accursed because every child emerges "between feces and urine." 8
An example of anti-family virtue was made of one of the artificial
saints built on a title of the pro-family Goddess, Perpetua, "the
Eternal One." In her new Christian disguise as St. Perpetua, she was so
devoted to single blessedness that she not only faced martyrdom with
equanimity but also renounced her parents, her husband, and her
suckling infant in order to become Christian. Her pagan relatives
tried to soften her heart by putting the infant to her breast, but she threw
it aside and said to them, "Begone from me, enemies of God, for I
know you not!" 9 This was the early Christian notion of a "good" woman: one who
placed faith before family. Church customs reflected this view. There
was no Christian sacrament of marriage until the 16th century. 10
Catholic scholars say the wedding ceremony was "imposed on" a reluctant church, and "nothing is more remarkable than the tardiness
with which liturgical forms for the marriage ceremony were evolved." It is perhaps not remarkable to find that these liturgical forms were not evolved by the church at all, but borrowed from pagans' common law. 11
The Anglican marriage service came from Anglo-Saxon deeds used to transfer a woman's land to the stewardship of her "house
man" (husband). The original wording had the bridegroom say: "With this ring I thee wed and this gold and silver I give thee and with my
body I thee worship, and with all my worldly chattels I thee honor."
The bride responded: "I take thee to my wedded husband, to have
586



bnd to hold, for fairer for fouler, for better for worse, for richer for Marriage poorer, in sickness and in health, to be bonny and buxom in bed and
jat board, till death us depart [sic]." A curious clerical note made in the ^^^^^^^^^^^
margin at a later date, explained that "bonny and buxom" really meant "meek and obedient." 12
About wedding ceremonies in Greece and the Balkans, an authority on Greek religion wrote: "With the modern Greeks as with other
Europeans, the religious service of their church is intrusive, no real part pf the ceremony of marriage, but an elaborate way of calling down a plessing on the ceremonial, or what is left of it, which constitutes the
real wedding." 13 The Christian priesthood was fighting ancient traditions in which it
was remembered that male spiritual authority was dependent on marriage: either a hieros gamos between the ruler of a land and his
Goddess, or the mandatory husbandship of priests who were not allowed to contact the deities unless they had wives. In Asia, the gods
themselves had to be married. Even patriarchal figures like Vishnu and Brahma needed their Shaktis or wives who embodied their power,
and "without whom they avail nothing." H Brahman priests couldn't
perform certain ceremonies without wives. 15 Oriental mystics taught
that any man was spiritually incomplete until he experienced bhavanan, "husbandship," which linked him to the Goddess as Bhavani or I Existence." 16 The implication was that an unmarried man does not
truly exist. Tantric hymns said all women are goddesses because they
embody the spirit of the Goddess; thus "women are Life itself." 17
Early Israelites also barred unmarried men from the priesthood.
They thought a priest's spells and invocations would be powerless if he had no wife. 18 Jewish scriptures said, "The man who has neither wife
nor children is disgraced in the world and is hated by them, like a
leafless and fruitless tree." 19 Similarly, the spiritual authority of Rome's
[ligh priest the Flamen Dialis depended on his marriage to the plaminica, high priestess of Juno. If she died or left him, he immediately jost his holy office. 20
So much depended on a man's ability to remain married, in the
:t ancient times, that the first rules of marriage invented by men
m to have been rules for insuring permanent monogamy. Thus a iband could hold on to a woman's property and children by
ding the woman herself. Matriarchal societies seldom permitted
ual jealousy. Women were free to change lovers or husbands, to
ake polyandrous or group marriages. Myths record the transition from
oose, flexible marital arrangements favored by Goddesses to the rigid
nonogamy favored by Gods. The pre-Hellenic Mother of God, Rhea, condemned monogamy
is a sin and insisted on her ancient law of group marriage. Her son
eus defied her, on behalf of patriarchal invaders of her lands. He reed Rhea's "daughter" Hera actually another form of Rhea
erself into a monogamous union, though he never stuck to his own
o
587



Marriage side of the bargain. He was constantly adulterous, and Hera detested him. On one occasion she roused the other gods in a rebellion against
^^^^^^^^^^^ him. Zeus punished her by hanging her from the sky with anvils
attached to her ankles perhaps the first divine precedent permitting men to torture wives into submission. 21
Hellenic Greeks believed that men should seize every possible
advantage in forcing wives to be obedient and (especially) faithful.
Aristotle taught that a husband should be more than twice his bride's
age he 37, she 18 so he could dominate her: "The elder and full
grown is superior to the younger and more immature." 22 Greek
patriarchy foreshadowed the patriarchal religion which, "in the form
seen in Judaism, Christianity, and Mohammedanism, is basically noth
ing other than a formalization, by means of a projection upon deities, and the demand for obedience to their revealed command, of the
father's desired sexual control of his wives and of their female
children, and the forcible exclusion of male children from sexual
activity." 23 The Greeks' contempt for wives eventually led to their cult of
homosexual romance, ignoring their families and taking young boys
for true-love relationships. Some scholars say this belittling of marriage was founded on fear of women:
The Greek male's contempt for women was not only compatible with, but also indissolubly bound to, an intense fear of them, and to an underlying suspicion ofmale inferiority. Why else would such extreme measures be necessary? Customs such as the rule that a woman should not be
older than her husband, or ofhigher social status, or more educated, or paid the same as a male for the same work, or be in a position of
authority betray an assumption that males are incapable ofcompeting with females on an equal basis; the cards must first be stacked, the
female given a handicap. 24
Observing group marriages among their neighbors, the Greeks regarded such customs as barbaric or unusual. In an age when the
Greeks were almost the only people with a patriarchal-monogamous social structure, a Greek said to the Spartan wife of Leonidas: "You of Lacedaemon are the only women in the world that rule the men."
She retorted: "We are the only women who bring forth men." 25
Despite their pretense that their own system was the only normal one, Greek writers like Herodotus knew the Arabs were polyandrous,
the Scythians shared spouses and children communally, the Lycians
recognized only matrilineal inheritance, and the Agathyrsi "cohabit in common with the women, in order that they should all be blood kin
and that their family relationships should prevent them from harboring envy and hostility toward one another." 26
Caesar said group marriage was the rule in Britain. An indicator of
the group-marriage system among the Celts was the multiple paternity of many of their mythic heroes. Clothru, queen of Connaught, married three brothers at once, the same kind of fraternal polyandry
588



I practiced by such eastern peoples as the Todas and the Singhalese. 27 Marriage The Nairs practiced group marriage up to the 19th century. Hindu literature speaks of a princess who married five brothers at once, and was ^^^^^^^^^^^
blessed by the Goddess Cunti, and promised many children. 28 In the
I Mahabharata, a speech to the same Goddess Cunti told of "the practice
of old indicated by illustrious Rishis fully acquainted with every rule
of morality":
Women were not formerly immured in houses and dependent on husbands and relatives. They used to go about freely, enjoying themselves as best they pleased. . . . They did not then adhere to their husbands
faithfully; and yet . . . they were not regarded as sinful, for that was the sanctioned usage of the times. . . . Indeed, that usage, so lenient to
women, hath the sanction ofantiquity. The present practice, however, ofwomen being confined to one husband for life hath been established
but lately. 29
After Brahmanism established monogamy in some parts of
India, the rules of marriage were greatly changed: "No act is to be done
according to her own will by a young girl, a young woman, though she be in her own house. In her childhood a girl should be under the
will of her father; in her youth under that of her husband; her
husband being dead, under the will of her sons. A woman should never
enjoy her own will. Though of bad conduct or debauched, a husband
must always be worshipped like a god by a good wife." ?0 Rules similar to those of the Brahmans were established in
western Europe by Christian authorities, insofar as possible. Some churches even insisted that a bride at her wedding must kneel and
place her bridegroom's foot on her head in token of abject obedience. 51
Christianity accepted marriage only on condition that the partners form a slave-and-master relationship. This meant getting rid of the Goddess whose many forms and avatars protected the married woman in all phases of matrimony and motherhood.
Juno, the Roman Queen of Heaven, regulated every aspect of
marriage through her priestesses. Juno Pronuba arranged marriages. Juno Domiduca conducted the bride across the threshold of her new
I home. Juno Nuxia perfumed the doorposts. Juno Cinxia untied the
bride's virgin-girdle. Juno Lucina watched over the pregnant woman.
Juno Ossipago strengthened her infant's bones. Juno Rumina provided mother's milk. Juno Sospita took care of women in childbed. 32 So it
went: in marriage and family matters, women ignored God and appealed to their own Goddess. The idea that a male priest should
preside alone over a marriage ceremony was unthinkable which is
one reason why Christians didn't think of it. For many centuries,
marriage existed in a limbo without a deity to solemnize it, having no place in canon law, which is why marriage remained so long under the
jurisdiction of common law. The Council of Trent decreed that a person who even hinted that
the state of matrimony might be more blessed than celibacy would be

Marriage declared anathema accursed and excommunicated. 33 The earliest
form of Christian marriage was a simple blessing of the newly wedded
j^m^ pair, in facie ecclesiae outside the church's closed doors to keep the
pollution of lust out of God's house. This blessing was a technical violation of canon law, but it became popular and gradually won acceptance. In 1215 the fourth Lateran Council granted it legal
status. 34 Still, the church maintained that there were no marriages in
heaven, according to Christ's statement in the scriptures (Mark
12:25; Luke 20:35). St. Thomas Aquinas assigned a "goodness value" of 30 to marriage, as compared with 60 for widowhood, and 100 for
lifelong virginity. 35 Medieval folk tales convey a distinct impression that the Christian
God opposed marriage. One story said a pure youth and maiden agreed never to marry, "for love of God." But their heathen parents
forced them into a wedding. By God's grace, the ground opened under their feet and swallowed them before they could spoil their
virginity. A priest who dared officiate at the wedding was found dead
next day. Another young couple eloped, being forced to defy God, who "did not sanction earthly marriages." Gebhard, archbishop of Cologne, was said to have blessed married couples illegally, and even toi
wife himself. He was excommunicated, besieged by Catholic forces
in Godesberg Castle, caught, and killed. The ruins of his castle are sti!
shown to travelers. 36
Common-law marriages were often informal. Mere cohabitation
could constitute a valid marriage. 37 Temporary trial marriages were
legal up to the early 17th century. Peasant "betrothals" were often trial
marriages, incorporating such customs as "tarrying," night-visiting,
and courting-on-the-bed. Pregnancy might make the union permanent, but not necessarily. Bastardy was a commonplace in all social classes of medieval society. 38
The church displayed remarkable reluctance to deal with the
matter of marriage at all. During the Middle Ages there was no
ecclesiastical definition of a valid marriage nor of any contract to validate one. Churchmen seemed to have no ideas at all on the subject. 39
They ignored marriage, leaving it largely in the realm of the common law.
Under Roman and barbarian laws, marriages "could be freely
initiated and could be terminated without formality by either party
and at any time." 40 This system persisted among common folk until
1 563. Finally the church declared the priestly blessing indispensable
to a legal marriage, refusing to recognize any more marriages made by the common law. Still, the church's rule remained invalid in many
areas for several centuries more. 41
In 1753 Lord Harwicke's Act made clerical blessing a requirement
for legal marriage in England, but the Act didn't apply to Scotland. Therefore Scotland became a mecca for elopements, because legal
marriages could be made there by the old pagan custom of "handfast
590



ling" simply joining the couple's hands in the presence of witnesses,
i
I without benefit of clergy. 42 All the way up to 1939, English lovers il could travel across the Scottish border to the "marriage town" of Gretna
I Green for an instant wedding.
When Christian authorities revised pagan marriage laws, they were
I primarily concerned with placing a wife's property in her husband's | control and keeping it there. Women owned the land under the pagan
{system, and their husbands could acquire an interest in it only
through matrimony. This system was reversed in husbands' favor.
ICommon-law and Morganatic marriages were provisionally accepted I by Christian churches only after many restrictions had been imposed on
the wife's rights of ownership and inheritance. Christian marital f morality amounted to taking the means of independence from women
fland turning it over to men.
Celibacy was strictly enforced among the clergy when new laws
Mpermitted men to bequeathe their property (and their wives' proper
ty) directly to their children. When priests were forbidden to make valid
Dmarriages, they couldn't have heirs. Thus all property they owned or I gained would revert to the church when they died. 43 Clerical marriages, 'on the other hand, meant a loss of ecclesiastical income.
Priests abandoned the early church's rule of celibacy and began to
i take wives during the 5th and 6th centuries. This continued to the
f
1 lth century, when papal decretals commanded married clergymen to |tum their wives out of their homes and sell their children as slaves. 44
flThese new laws brought much more wealth to the church. Though Isome ex-wives stayed on as the concubines of their former husbands,
I they were disinherited in the church's favor. (See Matrilineal
Inheritance.) Churchmen revered St. Hilary, who was married and the father of
a daughter. When his daughter wished to marry, however, Hilary forbade her. Fearing she might weaken and lose her virginity, he asked
|God to kill her. God complied with a little help from Hilary
ihimself. After burying the daughter, "by his prayer" Hilary sent his wife Ito heaven also. The legend claims the wife voluntarily begged Hilary Ito "obtain for her the same grace which he had obtained for her
(daughter."
45
Besides popularizing the peculiar morality of a saint who killed his family, the church fostered "chastisement" of wives by husbands,
Iciting St. Paul's teaching that "the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man" (1 Corinthians 1 1:3). In practice,
under the pretext of discipline a man could torture his wife with
I impunity, and no legal or religious agency would defend her. A mild protest in the 13th-century Laws and Customs of Beauvais noted that Jan excessive number of women were dying of marital chastisement,
so husbands were advised to beat their wives "only within reason." 46 The theological view of the time was that "woman has sinned
more than man" and should therefore be unhappier; her suffering

Marriage must be doubled on earth, even in the womb, which is why female
embryos did not receive their souls from God as early as male
^^^^^mma^^^^ embryos.47 Men were only doing God's will when they made women
suffer.
The Oriental heathen, whom Christians thought barbaric, were
teaching different rules: "The householder should never punish his
wife, but should cherish her like a mother. ... By riches, clothes, love, respect, and pleasing words should one's wife be satisfied. The husband should never do anything displeasing to her." 48 Westerners
simply condemned as obscene the passages in the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad describing as a sacrament a husband's sexual worship of his
wife as "House-Goddess (Grhadevata)." 49 Physical abuse and sexual coercion were so often the lot of a
Christian wife that it came to be an accepted idea that no woman
could love a husband. A "lover" meant a man outside the marriage. The Countess of Narbonne, ruler of France's celebrated Court of
Love, said the relation between husband and wife and "the true love
between lovers are two absolutely different things which have noth
ing in common. . . . We say definitely and considerately that love cannot exist between married people." 50 One good reason was the
master-slave relationship. "Men were exhorted from the pulpit to beat
their wives and wives to kiss the rod that beat them." 51
Medieval society was so accustomed to the idea that all wives were
battered by their husbands, that churchmen used this as an argument
for women to renounce marriage in favor of the cloister. They told
young girls that "the wife was subject to her husband, that often she
was exposed to blows and kicks, and often brought forth misshapen
offspring. . . . While men are betrothed they seem filled with gentle
ness, whereas after marriage they rule as cruel masters." 52 It has been recently shown that, "Although omitted from most
church historical accounts, the Christian church . . . has had a record
of practicing and recommending physical abuse to women." The Decretum of 1 140 said: "It is right that he whom woman led into
wrongdoing should have her under his direction so that he may not fail a second time through female levity." Friar Cherubino's 1 5th
century Rules ofMarriage made a husband his wife's sole judge: "Scold
her sharply, bully and terrify her. And if this still doesn't work . . . take
up a stick and beat her soundly, for it is better to punish the body and
correct the soul than to damage the soul and spare the body. . . .
Then readily beat her, not in rage but out of charity and concern for her
soul, so that the beating will redound to your merit." "
A Russian pope recommended the use of a whip rather than a rod
of wood or iron, which was more likely to cripple or kill. "Keep to a
whip," said the pontiff, "and choose carefully where to strike: a whip is
painful and effective." 54
Martin Luther thought himself an unusually kind husband. He

English jurisprudence applied to marital "disagreement" the fam

ous Rule of Thumb elucidated by Blackstone: a husband was free to

beat his wife with a whip or rod no thicker than his thumb, "in order to
enforce the salutary restraints of domestic discipline." British law up t to the late 19th century decreed that acts which would amount to an
(assault if committed against a stranger were legally innocent when committed by a husband against a wife. 56 Wives had little help from the
Ijlaw; they were legally classified with minors and idiots, and were consigned to the custody of their husbands. 57
When John Adams was helping to draw up the Constitution of the United States in 1777, his wife Abigail wrote to him, "Do not put
Isuch unlimited power in the hands of husbands. Remember, all men
twould be tyrants if they could." 58 Abigail's plea went unheard. The
American husband was no less tyrannical than his British forebear. It has
been said that among the Puritans especially, the husband "exercised the authority of God" over his wife. 59
In 1848 feminist Emily Collins described a typical example of the abused American wife: a woman who mothered seven children,
cooked, cleaned, washed, spun, wove, sewed and mended the family
clothing, milked the cows, and took the multiple responsibilities for the welfare of nine persons, including her husband, who beat her because she sometimes "scolded" that is, nagged, or complained.
This was accepted as sufficient reason for violent attacks on his hard
I working spouse. 60 Up to the middle of the 20th century, American law upheld the
so-called doctrine of immunity, which meant the "sanctity of the home" could not be invaded to stop husbandly violence. A man's home
was his castle, even if it was also his wife's prison. The law denied
women the right to sue their husbands for assault because the suit
"might destroy the peace of the home." Only in 1962 did a judge rule that the peace of the home was already destroyed by a wife-beating husband, therefore the doctrine of immunity was legally unsound. 61
J Even now, the law may refuse to recognize a woman's right to protection within her home.
Wife-beating was a by-product of the Christian view of woman
las man's property. Napoleon remarked, "Woman is given us to bear
jchildren. She is our property. . . . She is our possession, as the fruit tree is that of the gardener." 62 St. Thomas Aquinas said a wife is lower
than a slave because a slave may be freed, but "Woman is in
subjection according to the law of nature, but a slave is not." 63
Josephine Henry reported that "The ownership of the wife estab
lished and perpetuated through Bible teaching is responsible for the domestic pandemonium and the carnival of wife murder which reigns
throughout Christendom. In the United States alone, in the eighteen

Marriage hundred and ninety-seventh year of the Christian era, 3,482 wives, many with unborn children in their bodies, have been murdered in
^^^^^^^^^^^m co'd blood by their husbands. . . . The by-paths of ecclesiastical history
are fetid with the records of crimes against women; and 'the half has never been told.'" 64
From feudal times onward, Christian systems of slavery placed similar powers in the hands of slaveowners and husbands, often
combining the two functions. A sister of President Madison wrote: "We
southern ladies are complimented with the name of wives: but we are
only the mistresses of seraglios." A southern planter's wife described
herself as "the chief slave of the harem." The wife of a Confederate
general wrote: "God forgive us, but ours is a monstrous system. . . .
Like the patriarchs of old, our men live all in one house with their
wives and their concubines. . . . Any lady is ready to tell you who is the
father of all the mulatto children in everybody's household but her
own. Those, she seems to think, drop from the clouds." 65 Southern ladies' doublethink about their roles was an expected,
even mandatory, social response. The first edition of Emily Post's
Etiquette described "The Instincts of a Lady: As an unhappy wife, her
dignity demands that she never show her disapproval of her husband,
no matter how publicly he slights or outrages her." 66 Though the rule obviously served the man's dignity, not the
woman's, unhappy wives tried to obey it. Patriarchal society managed to convince them that if they failed to make their marriages "happy,"
they failed as women and as human beings. Hence, battered wives
often accepted the guilt for their own victimization. Recent investigators
report that battered wives go to great lengths to conceal the crime because of their own embarrassment and shame.67
Churches helped develop this secret embarrassment. One clergy
man's routine advice to brides was: "Your duty is submission. . . .
Your husband is, by the laws of God and of man, your superior; do not
ever give him cause to remind you of it." 68 Of all professional groups,
clergymen have proved least able or willing to help battered wives. One abused wife from a "nice suburban neighborhood" wrote of
her appeal to her clergyman and the reprimand she received. The minister demanded to know what she was doing wrong to bring her husband's violence down upon herself, and advised her only to search
her own soul and discover how she might behave better to relieve the
tension. She had a husband so violent that she feared for her life. Yet
her spiritual leader and alleged comforter gave her less than no comfort.
He tried rather to increase her suffering with a specious burden of
guilt. 69 In 1977 Ellen Kirby of the Board of Global Ministries of the United Methodist Church wrote: "The institutional church either
through its blatant sexist theology, which has blessed the subordination
of women, or through its silence, blindness, or lack of courage, has allowed itself to be one of the leading actors in the continuing tragedy of
594



i." 70 Under the circumstances it seems unrealistic for Pope Paul
to have observed in 1966 that "a true contradiction cannot exist
/een the divine laws pertaining to the transmission of life and
pertaining to the fostering of authentic conjugal love." 71 TranslatI from theologese, the "divine laws" meant simply the church's id on birth control and "authentic conjugal love" meant husbandly linance over the wife.
Patriarchal religions developed many rules for maintaining male
linance in marriage, but the structure was inherently unstable:
The patriarchal "family" ofacademic social science is but a euphemism for the individualistic male with his subordinate dependents. As a social
unit the family means the (male) individual activated by his most
aggressively individualistic instincts; it is not the foundation, but the
negation ofsociety. . . .
Human society did not arise as an organization ofadjusted interests. It arose out ofan extra-rational sentiment; it has never existed in any
form except through the binding force ofsuch sentiments. n
The patriarchal family was at bottom unnatural, a reversal of the ogical authority of the female over her dependents. "Economic man
icis in perfect self-interest; a woman cannot base her relationships
[vithin the family on the principle of quid pro quo: she gives. It appears, rom a masculinist perspective, that woman might be a more primitive version of a man not because there is prima facie evidence of her
ower intelligence, but because of her loving and giving nature, which Is itself taken as evidence of lower intelligence. Rousseau's 'noble
jiavage' like his ideal woman was compassionate and nurturing." 75
As a rule, women were driven into marriage by social pressures
pat made spinsterhood even less attractive economically. When patriarchal laws took property out of women's hands and placed it in the lands of men, unmarried women became as helpless to support
pemselves as wives were. In the 1 7th century, a "spinster" was any
woman imprisoned in a "spin-house" without money or male protectors. John Evelyn described a spin-house as a place where "incorrigible bid lewd women are kept in discipline and labor." 74 It was seldom
noticed that spinsters had become "incorrigible and lewd" in an effort to
parn a living, in a society that allowed them to learn no skills other
(than trying to please men. Though patriarchal marriage typically existed for the service of man, there was usually a pretense of male autonomy and leadership; and the discovery of its mythical quality caused the wife's "basic
trauma," according to Jessie Bernard:
There are few traumas greater . . . than the wife's discovery ofher
husband's dependencies; than the discovery ofher own gut-superiority in a thousand hidden crannies of the relationship; than the realization that
in many situations his judgment is no better than hers; that he does not really know more than she; that he is not the calm, rational, nonemotional dealer in facts and relevant arguments; that he is, in brief, not at all the

kind ofperson the male stereotype pictures him to be. Equally, ifnot more, serious is her recognition that she is not really the weaker vessel, that she is often called upon to be the strong one in the relationship. 75
Marc Feigen Fastau also pointed out that false commitment to
the myth of masculine steadiness and objectivity brings on disillusion
ment among wives:
Nothing contrasts more sharply with the masculine image ofself-confi
dence, rationality, and control than men's sulky, obtuse, and, often virtually total, dependence on their wives to articulate and deal with their
own unhappy feelings and their own insensitivity, fear, and passivity in helping their wives to deal with theirs. This, more than anything else, disillusions women about their men. Bromides like 'Men are just
overgrown little boys' are both a description ofthe phenomenon and an attempt, by labeling it innocuously, to ease the pain ofdisillusionment: disillusionment at having subordinated yourselfto a person who isn 't, it
turns out, special enough to justify the sacrifice, who is probably not much smarter than you are in most ways and in some very important ways
is a lot less perceptive, more dependent and more childlike. 76
Though wives provide an essential support system, without
which few men would be capable of carrying on productive careers, the "job" of a wife is the last relic of slavery in that it earns nothing. A
woman can't collect unemployment insurance for losing this non-paid
job, even when it means financial hardship for herself and her
children. As a widow she is taxed at the highest level because she is not
considered a contributor to her husband's estate. Yet a conservative
estimate of the market value of a wife's services amounts to over
$1,000,000. Nor is the job an easy one. Data collected by the Department of Health and Human Services show that housewives
suffer more from symptoms of stress than do working women. 77
Marlene Dixon said marriage is "the chief vehicle for the perpetu
ation of the oppression of women; it is through the role of wife that
that subjugation of women is maintained." 78 To a large extent it was th<
Christian concept of marriage in the western world that brought this
about, since the church declared women socially, politically, and intel
lectually inferior and made them their husband's chattels. 79
Wife-beating was so routine in Christian Europe that the standard
symbol of "marriage" in Alsatian New Year decorations was a miniature man beating his miniature wife.80
Nineteenth-century clergymen in both Europe and America consistently upheld a husband's right to abuse his wife and to use
"salutary restraints in every case of misbehavior," without the interfer
ence of what some court records of 1824 referred to as "vexatious
prosecutions." In other words, it was vexatious for a battered wife to
seek redress, but not vexatious for her husband to beat her in the first
place. Many clergymen still have this attitude. A battered wife recently
said: "My husband repeatedly spoke scripture at me about what a wife's responsibility was. . . . She was supposed to be submissive, and he

[narriage service. Many clergymen still believe a wife should bow to her husband's wishes more than he bows to hers not the best attitude in

Mars
lome's "red" war-god Mars was once anEtruscan fertility-savior Claris, worshipped at an ancient shrine in the Apennines, Matiene. 1 At
i similar shrine in northwestern Iran, Matiane (Mother Ana), the
Vledes worshipped the same god who became Martiya to the Persians, a loly "martyr" also called Immanuel or Imanisi. The inscription of
Darius at Behistun says the god was incarnate in a sacred king slain by Sign of Mars
lis people. 2 His spirit ruled what Sufis still call the "fulfilling" death
irjdriebirth process, known as mardiyya or martyrdom. 3 An early Phrygian version of the same sacrificial god appears in Greek myth as
he flayed satyr Marsyas, slain on a pine tree "between heaven and
jarth" by order of the heavenly father.
Mars was "red" because his basic Indo-European prototype was
he pre-Vedic flayed god Rudra, father of the Maruts or sacrificial victims, red with their own blood. Rudra "the red one" was born of the
hree-faced virgin-mother Marici, Goddess of birth, dawn, and the ^ew Year, a manifestation of the ancient feminine Trinity. Thus,
ludra bore the title of Tryambaka, "He Who Belongs to Three
597



Martin, Saint Mother Goddesses." In Japan this Goddess was known as Marici-deva
or Marishi-ten, whom later patriarchal writers masculinized as a ^^^^^^^^^^_ Buddhist monk. However, this alleged monk always wore the garments
of a woman. 4 The same Goddess was Marica to the Latins. She gave birth to the
god-king Latinus, ancestor of all Latin tribes. Her consort was the
flayed goat god of the Lupercalia, Faunus, another incarnation of Mars, who also appeared in bird-soul form as the sacred woodpecker Picus,
giving oracles from the top of a phallic pillar in his shrine. 5 The Martian New Year sacrifices took place in the god's month of
March, which once began the Roman year; this is why the "Ides of March" were considered dangerous to kings. In the Babylonian sacred calendar, the same New Year month of atonement sacrifices was
Marcheshvan.6 The astrological sign of this month still begins the year,
according to astrologers' tradition. In northern Europe, Mars was identified with Tiw, Tyr, or Tig: names derived from Indo-Germanic dieus, "God." 7 Just as Mars was often confused with the sky-father Jupiter, so Tiw was another name for
the sky-father Odin. Tiw's sign was a lingam-yoni arrangement of a phallic spear attached to a female disc. As wielder of the spear or
lightning bolt of fertility, Mars-Tiw became a god of battle. He was
the patron of Roman warriors, who called him Marspiter (Father Mars) and honored him with "martial" exercises on the Campus Martius,
site of a temple of Maris in Etruscan times. His sacred day was Tuesday,
named after Tiw in English, though it is still dies martis in Latin and
similarly named in Latinate languages (French mardi). To account for the inevitable story that the Queen of Heaven as
Celestial Virgin gave birth to the sacrificial god, Romans claimed the
Blessed Virgin Juno spurned the love of her spouse, Jupiter, and to spite him conceived Mars by her own unaided feminine fertility magic, the
lily blossom that represented her own yoni.8

Ireland preserved the custom of killing the god incarnate in an ox, the Mart-beast. It was claimed that the saint himself was cut up and eaten in the form of an ox. Every household killed some domestic animal and
sprinkled the threshold with the animal's blood. St. Martin as "martyr"
came to be regarded as "one of the very chief of the saints. . . . The
tradition of slaughter is preserved in the British custom of killing cattle
on St. Martin's Day." 1 The holy day was a continuation of the Roman festival of Martina

Martyrs
Martyrs
ince the 9th century, when martyr-legends became wildly popular, [ne church listed countless bogus saints said to have died in "persecu
Jons" of the 4th and 5th centuries. With more imagination than
istoricity, martyrologists created a church history out of fictions. Rec
rds of the alleged martyrs slain in "persecutions" are virtually bnexistent. The gory fantasies reported by such sources as the Golden
legend were invented from six to nine centuries after the time of the
! leged events. Even Catholic scholars say martyrologists' tales are so
nildishly naive that when reading them "it is often difficult to refrain
pm smiling." ' Still, one might wonder why a smile should be the response to
hese grisly fantasies of torture and butchery, which hint at a sadistic
lirn of mind in those who invented such tales for the edification of their
i [How Christians.
Most of the classic martyrs were assigned to the persecution of
Piocletian, which Christian tradition greatly exaggerated. Diocletian
Lade no objection to Christians until 298 a.d., when his priests claimed
thristian unbelievers, present at an official sacrifice, prevented the ception of favorable omens. The emperor ordered Christians to honor
e gods by burning a pinch of incense on the imperial altars. For lose in the army or civil service, refusal to comply with this rule could
[lean discharge. Five years later, quarrels between Christian and ligan priesthoods escalated to the point where official oracles began to
llsist on the closing of Christian churches. Some Christian zealots
Itok it on themselves to strike back by attacking the emperor himself.
Two fires were set in Diocletian's palace at Nicomedia. Three
lihristian eunuchs, residents in the palace, were accused of arson and
Icecuted. Centuries later they were canonized as Saints Dorotheus,
jtorgonius, and Peter. 2 After the fires, Diocletian also ordered the
Itest of some Christian priests. Martin Jones says "Some months later,
Hie imprisoned clergy were all forced to sacrifice, and then, with the Icception of a few obstinate reclusants, released." Some of the obstinate
Hies were executed. But the "persecution" was never more than
Hilf-hearted. Though it continued intermittently for a while, it was
Intirely abandoned by 3 1 3 a.d.*

Martyrs These ten years and comparatively few deaths were blown up into
a legendary reign of terror, after the teachings of the primitive church ^^^^^^^^^^^m were forgotten. One of these teachings was that martyrdom, called "the
Crown," automatically brought Christlike apotheosis and made the soul of the martyr one with Jesus, as the soul of an Egyptian could
become one with Osiris. In pursuit of this "imitation of Christ," so
many Christians purposely broke laws and clamored for the death
penalty that Antoninus of Antioch irritably inquired whether Chris
tians had no ropes or precipices to kill themselves, without constantly making trouble for the authorities. 4
Some of the early churches taught that martyrdom was required t( be among the blessed in heaven. Apocryphal Gospels quoted Jesus: "Truly I say to you, none of those who fear death will be saved; for the
kingdom of death belongs to those who put themselves to death."
Tertullian said he longed for martyrdom, "that he may obtain from Go
complete forgiveness, by giving in exchange his blood." Gnostics however ridiculed martyrdom, saying it made God a cannibal who
desired human blood; and the advocates of martyrdom were said to
inflict it on each other all too often. Some Gnostic writings denounced
other Christians for "oppressing their brothers" and even making
children suffer, to save their souls. 5 This was one of the sources of the
charge that Christians sacrificed children to their deity.6 Centuries
later, Christians used the same charge of child sacrifice to justify
persecution of the Jews. 7
In reality, Rome embraced many diverse faiths, Christianity among them, with far more tolerance than Christians showed. Angus
says, "In the matter of intolerance Christianity differed from all pagan
religions, and surpassed Judaism; in that respect it stood in direct
opposition to the spirit of the age." 8 Some of the so-called persecutors were actually trying to stop the fighting between different factions of
Christians, like the emperor Maxentius who arrested the rival popes
Marcellus and Eusebius to prevent further street battles between their
followers. Another pair of rival popes, Damasus and Ursinus, precipitat
ed such bloody fighting that 137 corpses were left in the basilica of
Sicininus in only one day. Ammianus reported that "It was only with
difficulty that the people, having been roused to such ferocity, could be brought back to order." 9
A persecution, rich in martyrdoms, was expected from the "Apostate" emperor Julian, an urbane pagan who disliked fanatical
Christians. But Julian disappointed them by leaving them alone. Gregory of Nazianzus held even Julian's tolerance against him: "He
begrudged to our soldiers the honor of martyrdom. ... In order that wc
might suffer, and yet not win honor as we should, suffering for Christ's sake ... he attacked our religion in a very villainous and
ungenerous way, introducing into his persecution the traps and snares of argument." Julian was killed in a military camp, under odd circumstances. According to Libanius, the emperor was assassinated by a
600



christian less inclined to argue, more inclined to destroy the Martyrs
(pponent. 10 There are no verifiable contemporary records of individual Chris- ^^^^^^^^^^^
tans "slain for their faith" under the Roman empire. Eusebius
U. 371 a.d.) mentioned a letter, supposedly from the churches of Lyons nd Vienne to the churches of Asia and Phrygia, listing the names of
[8 Christians executed in the reign of Marcus Aurelius, 177 a.d., nearly
wo hundred years earlier. 11 Eusebius probably wrote the letter
^imself. It was he who adopted the principle of "holy lying" on the hurch's behalf. Ever afterward, churchmen cited Eusebius to prove
nat any lie is permissible if it glorifies the Christian faith. 12
Aside from this father of "holy lying" and his dubious letter, no nartyrs' names were heard of until the 7th to 9th centuries. A
pajority were only names or titles of old pagan deities whose shrines had
|een pilgrimage centers since pre-Christian times. The real martyrs of the early Christian era were not made by the
lagans so much as by their fellow Christians. Diocletian's persecution
las negligible compared to the violent warfare of Christian against
Christian in those centuries. Zealots in Asia Minor destroyed whole pwns and villages and massacred thousands of "heretics." Women and
hildren were tortured until they agreed to receive the Host of the
rue faith. Ammianus said "no wild beasts are so hostile to man as
Christian sects in general are to one another." 1? Toleration itself was
[unishable. At Trier in the 4th century two bishops, Priscillian and
pstantius, with two other men and a woman, were illegally tortured
nd executed by their fellow Christians for being too tolerant of their
lagan neighbors. 14 In the 5th century, Innocent I proclaimed that God gave the
hurch the right to kill. Its military might "had been granted by God
nd the sword had been permitted for the punishment of the guilty"
(leaning anyone holding unorthodox opinions. 15 A letter attributed p Clement, bishop of Rome, said whoever refuses to "bow the neck" to
God's bishops, priests, and deacons is guilty of insubordination
{gainst God and must suffer the death penalty. 16 Once in power, the church attacked both pagans and non-ortho
px Christians in a reign of terror. By a conservative estimate, pagan
mperors spilled less than one ten-thousandth of the amount of Chris
an blood later shed by other Christians. 17 The persecutions in Asia
Minor were thus described in 386 a.d.:
The monks say they are making war on the temples but their warfare is i way ofpillaging what little poor unfortunates do have, the produce of
the fields and the cattle they feed. . . . They grab people's land, claiming the place is sacred. Many have been robbed oftheir patrimony on such
a pretext. They who (as they say) give honor to their god by fasting are getting fat on the wretchedness ofothers. And as for those others, the victims ofsuch a sack, if they go to
town, to a "shepherd" he will be called that, though he may not be a
601



Mary good shepherd precisely and tell him, weeping, oftheir injustices suffered, the shepherd will approve ofthe pillagers, and chase their victims ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ away, saying that they should count it a gain that they have not suffered
worse.
Ifthey hear ofa place with something worth raping away, they immediately claim that someone is making sacrifices and committing
abominations, and pay the place a visit. '8
Christian zealots sometimes tortured pagan women to make them renounce their Goddess. 19 This may have been the real origin of
the many fictitious "virgin martyrs" said to have renounced love and
marriage to embrace Christian celibacy, retaining their virginity despite the most horrendous tortures. Catholic writers now call the church's
virgin-martyr horror tales only "edifying romance" though why these sadistic fantasies should seem edifying is not made clear. 20 Christian
tales of the pagans' execution of virgins made no sense in any case; for under Roman law, no virgin could be executed. If sentenced to death, a virgin had to be legally deflowered before sentence could be
carried out. 21 No Roman law made virginity perse a crime. The real reason why the church demanded martyr-myths was that
it was the best traditional way to achieve union with a deity and
consequent immortality. From the earliest ideas of sacred kingship, he who died in agony could become at once one with his God. The very
word martyr was the name of the ancient sacred king in Persia, MartiyaImmanuel (see Mars). 22 The Fourth Book of Maccabees, written
about the 1st century B.C., provided a typical scriptural model for Christian martyrologists. It described the sufferings of the Jew Elea
zar and his companions, who endured the usual sequence of flayings,
burnings, scourgings, disembowellings, etc., couched in loftily metaphorical prose: "Eleazar, like a fine steersman steering the ship of sanctity on the sea of the passions, though buffeted by the threats of
the tyrant and swept by the swelling waves of the tortures, never shifted for one moment the helm of sancity until he sailed into the haven of
victory over death." 2?

Mary
Fathers of the Christian church strongly opposed the worship of
Mary because they were well aware that she was only a composite of
Mariamne, the Semitic God-Mother and Queen of Heaven; Aphro
dite-Mari, the Syrian version of Ishtar; Juno the Blessed Virgin; Isis as Stella Maris, Star of the Sea; Maya the Oriental Virgin Mother of the
602



i Redeemer; the Moerae or trinity of Fates; and many other versions of the Great Goddess. 1 Even Diana Lucifera the Morning-Star God
jdess was assimilated to the Christian myth as Mary's "mother," Anna or Dinah. Churchmen knew the same titles were applied to Mary as to
her pagan forerunners: "queen of heaven, empress of hell, lady of all [the world." 2
The Speculum beatae Mariae said Mary was like the Juno
Urtemis-Hecate trinity: "queen of heaven where she is enthroned in
Ithe midst of the angels, queen of earth where she constantly manifests
jher power, and queen of hell where she has authority over the
jdemons." According to the Office of the Virgin, she was the primordial being, "created from the beginning and before the centuries." 3
Christian patriarchs therefore sought to humanize and belittle
(Mary, to prove her unworthy of adoration. Epiphanius ordered: "Let
ithe Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit be worshipped, but let no one I [worship Mary." 4 Anastasius said, "Let no one call Mary the Mother pf God, for Mary was but a woman, and it is impossible that God should be born of a woman." 5 Ambrose called Mary the "temple" of God, end "only he is to be adored who worked within the temple." 6 Up to
1 the 5th century the church persecuted as heretics a sect calling
(themselves Marianites, who claimed that Mary possessed the true
quality of divinity. 7 Mariolatry has plagued Christian patriarchy
throughout its history, as the popular need to worship the Mother-figure always arose unbidden.
Some early church fathers sought a way out of the dilemma by
\ attacking Mary's motherhood, to prove her neither divine nor really naternal. Some claimed Jesus wasn't born in the ordinary way but
! suddenly materialized before Mary. 8 Marcionites said Jesus could
[never touch vulgar female flesh, therefore he was never born at all. He descended from heaven as a fully formed adult. 9 Some church fathers
rejected Mary's motherhood on the ground that she was not only a \ mere mortal, but even a sinful woman. 10
There was ecclesiastical opposition to Mary throughout the Chris
i lian era. Pope Nicholas III ordered Jean d'Olive, a friar
{'distinguished for learning and piety," to burn with his own hands a
|
Tact he had written in praise of Mary because it expressed excessive
Hevotion to her. 11 When it was permitted, Marian devotion did appear
|o take on an Oriental extravagance.
Germanus, Patriarch of Constantinople in 717, called Mary "Lady
Ipll-holy" and "Lady most venerable," maintaining that no one could
i be saved or receive the gift of grace except through her, since God
Ipbeys her "through and in all things, as his true mother." Henri
| poudon, archdeacon of Evreux, said his people thought Mary "as much
is, or more than, God himself." Isidore Glabas said Mary ruled in
leaven before her earthly birth; like a creatress she brought all things
I nto being, and all the angels obeyed her. Bernardine of Siena said
( Mary's birth of the Savior through her own mystic powers was more

Mary
St. Louis-Marie Crignion de Montfort
(1673-1716) French priest who founded two
congregations and wrote True Devotion to the Blessed Virgin. He was canonized in 1947.
Protoevangelium, also known as the Revelation of James: a Gospel written in the
second century a.d., valued by early church fathers as authentic
but eventually eliminated from the
miraculous than God's generation of him. "Even if she had not been the Mother of God, she would nevertheless have been the mistress of the world." Louis-Marie de Montfort declared that Mary had absolute power over God. 12
People of the Middle Ages often viewed God as their persecutor,
Mary as their defender. Early 16th-century woodcuts showed God
shooting arrows of pestilence, war, and inflation at the world, while the
inscription pleaded with Mary to restrain him. 13 It was said that
"Mary stands for Mercy, and it is only because of her influence at cour
not because of love or goodwill on God's part, that heaven is within
reach." M A 14th-century Franciscan wrote:
When we have offended Christ, we should go Erst to the Queen of
Heaven and offer her . . . prayers, fasting, vigils, and alms; then she, like a mother, will come between thee and Christ, the father who wishes to beat us, and she will throw the cloak ofmercy between the rod of
punishment and us, and soften the king's anger against us. 1S
Ashe says, "Christian scripture and doctrine totally preclude placing Mary above Christ. Yet the vitality of Christ's own Church has
often seemed to depend on her rather than him. . . . [Wjithout her he
would probably have lost his kingdom." 16 During its first five centuries, Christ's church discovered that no amount of force would make people renounce their Mother Goddess. She had to be preserved in some form:
The church seemed doomed to failure, destined to go down to bloody
death amidst the bleeding corpses ofits victims, when the people discovered Mary. And only when Mary, against the stern decrees ofthe church, was dug out ofthe oblivion to which Constantine had assigned her and became identified with the Great Goddess was Christianity finally
tolerated by the people. . . . The only reality in Christianity is Mary, the Female Principle, the ancient goddess reborn. l7
In the eastern empire it was said the mark of true Christian faith
was to "confess the holy Ever-Virgin Mary, truly and properly the Mother of God, to be higher than every creature whether visible or
invisible." Ephraem of Syria called Mary the bride or spouse of Jesus as
well as his mother, after the fashion of the pagan Goddess and her
son-consort; she was also Gate of Heaven, Ark, and Garden of Paradise.
Mary personally sprinkled the face of Adam with life-giving rain, which placed her in the creation myth as "co-redemptress." Ephraem's opinions were called heretical by some, but after a lapse of 1 600
years in the year 1920 he was declared a Doctor of the Universal
Church by papal decree. 18
The Christian figure of Mary was gradually created during the first
four centuries of the Christian era, out of bits and pieces of the Great
Goddess who conceived "sons of God" and Saviors in all the temples of
the ancient world. The Protoevangelium said Mary served as a
temple hierodule, and received God's seed as she was beginning to spin
604



a blood-red thread in the temple the work of the Fate-virgin, first of
the Moerae or "Marys," who spun the thread of destiny. 19 At this
mystically crucial moment the angel Gabriel "came in unto her"
(Luke 1:28), the biblical phrase for sexual intercourse.
Other sources also identified Mary with the Fate-spinner, whom
the Greeks called Clotho, youngest of the trinity of Moerae. The
Coptic Discourse on Mary, attributed to Cyril of Jerusalem, represented Mary as the same triple Goddess of Fate, incarnate in the three
Marys who stood at the foot of Jesus's cross. 20 In like manner, the three
Fates of Nordic myth stood at the foot of Odin's tree of sacrifice; their
virgin aspect was sometimes Freya, "the Lady." The Swedes called the constellation of Orion the distaff of the virgin Mary, because it was
formerly the distaff used by Freya to spin the destinies of men. 21
Greek myth presented an image of the Virgin Persephone almost identical to that of fate-spinning Mary. Persephone sat in a sacred
cave or temple, starting to spin a web with a great picture of the universe the magic picture which the Mother made into reality. At
that moment the Heavenly Father appeared in the form of a phallic
serpent and begot the savior Dionysus on her. 22
In an effort to make Mary's impregnation as sexless as possible, some Christian ascetics invented very peculiar mechanisms for it. Sacred art showed semen emanating from God's mouth and passing
through a long tube that led under Mary's skirts. Some theologians claimed God's seed was carried to Mary in the beak of the Holy Dove.
Others said it came from Gabriel's mouth, to be filtered through the
sacred lily before entering Mary's body by way of her ear. 23 Though the Christian God took over the Triple Goddess's ancient
trinitarian character at the Council of Nicaea, there is some evidence
that early Christians perceived Mary as a trinity. Like the Buddhists'
Mara, she was sometimes a spirit of death. 24 The Gospel ofMary
identified all three of the Marys at Jesus's crucifixion with one another,
as if they were the same Triple Goddess who attended the death of
the pagan Savior. 25 For some centuries, eastern churches worshipped a Father-Mother
Son trinity modeled on such pagan triads as Osiris-Isis-Horus,
Zeus-Rhea-Zagreus, Apollo-Artemis-Heracles, etc. This idea was so commonplace that even writers of the Koran felt compelled to deny
the divine trinity of God, Mary, and Jesus. 26 Moslem sources also
preserved another manifestation of the Virgin Goddess as Mar Mariam or Sancta Maria, mother of the Persian savior Mani. 27 As "the
Sea" (Maria), the Triple Goddess swallowed up the god she gave birth to. In solemn imitation, the women of Alexandria threw images of
Osiris into the sea after his Passion Play. 28 Hebraic copies of this rite
probably account for Plutarch's report that the chief city of Palestine
Jerusalem was built in honor of a child whom Isis killed and threw
into the sea. 29
Mary was also closely associated with the Great Goddess of
Mary

Gospels, once included with the books of the New Testament but later eliminated from the canon. A copy was rediscovered in the 1940s at Nag Hammadi.

Mary
Mariale Common name of two Marianist
handbooks, the first written by an
anonymous author and falsely ascribed to Albertus Magnus; the second written in 1478 by the Franciscan friar Bernardine of Busti.
Ephesus, whose temples she took over. In the 5th century an
Ephesian priest named Proclus delivered a sermon on the multiform nature of Mary, calling her "the living bush, which was not burnt by
the fire of the divine birth . . . virgin and heaven, the only bridge between God and men, the awesome loom ... on which the garment of union was woven." 30 Much was made of the reversal of Mary's Latin Ave and the name
of Eve (Eva). Mystics said Mary was Eve's purified reincarnation, as Jesus was the similar reincarnation of Adam. 31 Somehow, theologians
failed to recognize that the new incarnations apparently reversed the
parent-child relationship. Then again, as Adam and Eve were spouses, so the relationship of Mary and Jesus sometimes verged on the sexual
or conjugal. In a legend ascribed to St. John, Jesus welcomed Mary into heaven with the words, "Come, my chosen, and I shall set thee in my
seat, for I have coveted the beauty of thee." 32
The church's doctrine of the assumption of Mary was explained in
a number of ways. Early churchmen declared that Jesus visited
Mary's tomb variously located in Ephesus, Bethlehem, Gethsemane, or Josaphat and raised up her corpse, which he made to live again; then he personally escorted her into heaven as a live woman. 33 She was
not a soul or a spirit but an immortal person in her own original body. This became the official modern view when the doctrine of the
assumption was declared an article of faith in 1950, when Pope Pius
XII pronounced that "the immaculate mother of God, the ever Virgin Mary, when the course of her earthly life was run, was assumed in
body and in soul to heavenly glory." 34 But the point had already been argued for more than a thousand years.
The church's problem was to take advantage of popular reverence
for Mary but at the same time prevent her literal deification. Some
theologians of the 13 th century claimed Mary's mortality should bring more women to obey the church, because the king of heaven "is no mere man but a mere woman is its queen. It is not a mere man who is
set above the angels and all the rest of the heavenly court, but a mere
woman is; nor is anyone who is merely man as powerful there as a mere woman." 35
Always the theologians feared to impute too much power and glory to Mary. Pope John XXIII, presuming to know Mary's inner thoughts, announced: "The Madonna is not pleased when she is put above her Son," though in fact it was the church who was not
pleased. Catholic doctrines themselves attributed to her two of the three
basic characteristics of divinity: she was immortal by reason of the
assumption, and sinless by reason of the Immaculate Conception.
The third requirement of divinity, omniscience, was conceded to her by popular belief. A 1 3th-century Mariale said she had perfect knowl
edge of divine mysteries, understood all scriptures, foresaw the future,
and knew everything about mathematics, geography, astronomy, alche
606



my, and canon law even in her earthly life, when there was no Mary
canon and therefore no canon law. 36 A French manuscript illustration
showed Mary enthroned beside God on Judgment Day, weighing ^^^^^^^^^^^
souls in her balances like her prototype the Goddess Maat 3000 years
earlier. 37 (See Alchemy.) The Welsh confused Mary with the triadic White Goddess, and
seldom asked the blessing of God without also imploring the favor of
"the white Mary." 38 Saints' tales implied that Mary's was the true touch of canonization. St. Bernard was ennobled by three drops of milk that
the Virgin pressed from her own breast for him. 39 St. Catherine of Siena also claimed to have been nourished by Mary's milk. 40
Many legends depicted Mary as the only true source of the milk of human kindness. At Mainz Cathedral she gave away one of her
image's gold shoes to a starving beggar, who had pleased her by playing
his fiddle for her. He was caught with the shoe, arrested, and
sentenced to death. On the way to the scaffold he paused to pray to the
Virgin, and she exonerated him by publicly giving him her other
shoe. The beggar was released, but the priests took away the gold shoes and locked them in the treasury, "lest the Virgin should again be
tempted to bestow them upon some penniless beggar who prayed for her aid." 41
Mary's mercy often proved superior to that of God or Jesus. She
was occasionally represented leaning on the balance that weighed a sinner's few good deeds, to make them heavier than his evil deeds and save him from damnation. Her mercy extended even to the Jews,
despite her priests' detestation of them. On Easter Day in Bourges, a
Jewish child took Holy Communion along with his Christian friends.
For this offense, the boy's father threw him into a furnace; but he lay
unharmed by the fire, saying the Lady who stood on the Christians'
altar was protecting him. "Then the Christians, understanding that he meant the statue of the Blessed Mary, took the aged Jew and threw him into the furnace, and he was burnt and consumed." 42
Ethiopian Christians' Lefafa Sedek, "Bandlet of Righteousness," said God gave the secrets of salvation to humanity only because Mary
requested it, when she began to grieve for her relatives writhing in hell's
River of Fire. Egyptian paganism was the real source of this "Chris
tian" scripture, copied from the Book of the Dead with the name of
God substituted for Ra, of Christ for that of Thoth, and of Mary for
that of All-Merciful Isis.43
Some theologians said even the worst of sinners could win a sure
salvation by doing some special service for Mary. Two scribes pleased her by making copies of the Book ofthe Miracles ofthe Virgin Mary. Afterward they committed many sins, and when they died, devils
came for their souls. But the Virgin pulled them away from the devils,
saving them on account of their devotion to her.44
At times it seemed that Mary, not God, was the real opponent of
607



Mary evil forces. Spengler said this was "one of the maxima of the Gothic,
one of its unfathomable creations one that the present day forgets and
^^^^^^^^-^m deliberately forgets It is not possible to exaggerate either the
grandeur of this forceful, insistent picture or the depth of sincerity with which it was believed in. The Mary-myths and the Devil-myths formed themselves side by side, neither possible without the other.
Disbelief in either of them was deadly sin. There was a Mary-cult of prayer, and a Devil-cult of spells and exorcisms." 45 Historian Henry
Adams noted: "Without Mary, man had no hope except in atheism, and for atheism the world was not ready The thirteenth century
could not afford to admit a doubt. Society had staked its existence, in
this world and the next, on the reality and power of the Virgin.""*6 Caesarius of Heisterbach told a story showing that Mary was more revered than God. A knight of Liege needed money and so made a pact with Satan. When asked to curse and renounce God, he did so
willingly. However, when the demon required him to renounce the Virgin, he refused, horrified. Therefore the Virgin later intervened to
save him from damnation. 47
Mary dispensed compassion (Hindu karuna) more effectively than Christ, for this very quality had been associated with the feminine
image from the beginning. Compassion was the chads of sacred harlots,
which contributed much to Mary's consistent patronage of prostitutes. The "whore" Mary Magdalene was one of the original Marian
trinity. 48 Augstein says Mariolatry evolved because "the people needed a queen of heaven, as the Israelites needed one in Jeremiah's time,
one for whom they could bake cakes, a great mother, a fertilityprostitute; but she was half shown to them, half withheld, and Freud
only gives us half the truth when he says that the Christian religion
recreated the mother-god." 49 Actually, the people recreated the
mother-god out of their own pagan heritage.
Churchmen claimed that all women lay under a threefold curse.
j
They were accursed if they were barren. They were accursed also if
they conceived, since conception was of the nature of original sin. They were accursed by the pains of childbirth, in fulfillment of God's curse
on Eve. But Mary escaped all three curses. "Mary alone of all women is
blessed, because she is virgin and fruitful, she conceives in holiness, and gives birth without pain." 50 Of course this view of Mary did little to
improve the lot of ordinary women, presenting them with a wholly
impossible ideal, yet implying that they fell short of the ideal only because of their sinfulness. 51 The ancients saw no incongruity in a
Goddess who was both virgin and mother (as well as lover and crone),
because she represented all women in all phases of life. Christians
however insisted on taking the "miracle" literally, having lost sight of its
subtle allegory. A hidden reason for the church's adoption of Mary was the
608



uccessful amputation of her pre-Christian sexuality. Of all the Mary Attributes she inherited from the ancient Goddess, Mary's virginity was
Tiost emphasized. She was called "the Virgin," not "the Mother." m^mmmhmmmm
Church fathers insisted that she never engaged in sexual intercourse in
her life, even though the Bible plainly spoke of Jesus's brothers and isters. 52 St. Ambrose demanded, "Would the Lord Jesus have chosen tor his mother a woman who would defile the heavenly chamber with
he seed of a man, that is to say one incapable of preserving her virginal thastity intact?" 53 Marian legends insisted that, although Mary was
[mazingly beautiful, no man could ever look on her with desire. 54
Yet some monasteries institutionalized desire for Mary, who "mar
ked" the monks as Christ "married" nuns. If a knight placed his ring
j>n
the finger of Mary's image, she would grip it firmly so it couldn't be temoved. At this, the knight considered himself a Bridegroom of the
nrgin and entered a monastery. The same tales were told of pagan
ftatues of Venus, who "married" any man who placed a ring on her narble finger. 55 In 1470 a Breton Black Friar, Alain de la Roche,
laimed the Virgin married him in the presence of many saints and
ngels, placing on his finger a ring woven of her hair. 56
Cistercians styled themselves "Knights of Our Lady," associating
heir Lady with the pagan May Queen. Aegidus's 1 3th-century istory of the order said it was the custom in the time of Bishop Albero pr the clergy of Liege to choose "from among their concubines" a
faschal and Pentecostal Queen, who was robed in purple, crowned, nroned, and worshipped with drums and music, "revered almost
nth idolatry as if she were an idol." 57 She also manifested herself as the
[airy Queen who watched over a monastery near Laach as the nonks' divine Bride. She announced each man's death three days in
pvance by placing a lily in his stall at midnight. 58
Gothic cathedrals were dedicated not to God or Jesus but to Notre
Uame; they were collectively called "Our Ladies" or "Palaces of the Queen of Heaven." 59 Many of them were built over pagan shrines of pe Great Goddess. Rome's cathedral of Santa Maria Maggiore was 'kiilt over the sacred cave of the Magna Mater. Santa Maria in Aracoeli
p the Capitoline Hill was formerly a temple of Tanit. Mary's hurches throughout Italy were founded on shrines of Juno, Isis, Minerva, Diana, Hecate. One church was even naively named Santa
_Haria sopra Minerva: Holy Mary over (the shrine of) Minerva.60
kin the 6th century, the great temple of Isis at Philae was re
icated to Mary.61 Aphrodite's sanctuaries on Cyprus became iurches of Mary, whom the Cypriots continued to address by Aphro
ite's name.62 At Chartres, the heathen idol of the virgo paritura (Virgin
living Birth) was preserved in the so-called Druid Grotto under
th the cathedral. It was said to be a black statue of Mary. 63
Ecclesia, "the Church," was one of Mary's titles. She was identi
609



Mary fied with both the buildings and the organization of Holy Mother Church as bride and mother of God. Yet this pseudo-female church ^^^^^^^^^^^ remained the exclusive property of men. As late as February 1977
Pope Paul VI again forbade ordination of women, saying the church
"does not consider herself [sic] authorized to admit women to priestly ordination." The pope maintained that priests must have a "natural
resemblance" to Christ, and if they were women "it would be
difficult to see in the minister the image of Christ." 64 There was no
mention that a priestess might present a resemblance to Mary, who
symbolized the church itself. The modern church prefers to forget that
early churches of Mary were staffed by priestesses, not priests.65 Above all, Christian authorities feared Mary might be the channel
through which Goddess-worship could reestablish itself, for she
inspired utterances similar to those the ancient Mother inspired, like
Goethe's: "Supreme and sovereign Mistress of the World! ... Oh
Virgin, in the highest sense most pure, oh Mother, worthy of all our
worship, our chosen Queen, equal with the gods." 66 The secret,
ineradicable heresies of Marian worship received graphic form in the
famous Vierge Ouvrante Mary as a statue that opened up to show
God, Jesus, angels, and saints contained inside her.
In the generating and nourishing, protective and transformative, feminine
power of the unconscious, a wisdom is at work that is infinitely superior to the wisdom ofman 's waking consciousness, and that, as source of vision
and symbol, ofritual and law, poetry and vision, intervenes, summoned or unsummoned, to save man and give direction to his life. This feminine-maternal wisdom is no abstract, disinterested knowl
edge, but a wisdom ofloving participation. . . . In the patriarchal development of the Judeo-Christian West, with its masculine, monotheis
tic trend toward abstraction, the goddess, as a feminine figure of wisdom, was disenthroned and repressed. She survived only secretly, for
the most part in heretical and revolutionary bypaths. . . . Seen from the outside, the "Vierge Ouvrante" is the familiar and unassuming mother with child. But when opened she reveals the
heretical secret within her. God the Father and God the Son, usually
represented as heavenly lords who in an act ofpure grace raise up the humble, earth-bound mother to abide with them, prove to be contained in
her; prove to be the "contents" ofher all-sheltering body. 67
Mary represented the second of the two expedients men used to
overcome their fear of women, according to Homey: disparagement and idealization. 68 But she was so ideal that she had to be apotheo
sized just as unmistakably as Jesus himself. So she rose bodily from the earth and ascended to glory. Unfortunately, those who formulated
this idea were quite ignorant of the vastness of the universe, and their
simplistic "rising to the sky" no longer serves an age in which such information is readily available. Even assuming that Mary's body could
travel at the speed of light an impossible idea to begin with it
would be only two thousand light-years away at the present time, about
610
ftM i



one-fiftieth of the distance across our own galaxy, let alone plunged Mary
into the unthinkable immensity of intergalactic space. And yet in an era when the absurdity of the idea is perfectly plain to the educated, to be ^^^^^^^^^^^
exact on June 30, 1968, the Credo of Pope Paul VI reconfirmed the
dogma of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary though God apparently didn't take the trouble to inform him about the method of its
accompl ish ment.69 But not all minds in the modern age are modern minds. Many
remain ignorant of what has been discovered about the physical
universe. Many are ignorant of the theories and doctrines professed by
their own religion. They worship Mary only because their inner
being demands a mother-archetype, and she is the only one presented to them. They don't know how many "Marys" there were before Christianity. But educated churchmen know. Canon John de Satge
wrote: "The evangelical has a strong suspicion that the deepest roots of the Marian cultus are not to be found in the Christian tradition at all.
The religious history of mankind shows a recurring tendency to
worship a mother-goddess. . . . May it not be the case, the evangelical wonders, that what we have here is in reality an older religion, a
paganism which has been too lightly baptized into Christ and whose
ancient features persist under a thin Christian veil?" 70
However, Mary wasn't "lightly" adopted by Christianity. She was
opposed, attacked, and finally accepted only with many theological misgivings and restrictions. Early Gospels that dwelt on the divinity of
Mary were labeled "poisonous" by the orthodox church. 71 Christian
mystics who coveted the female role and spoke of "becoming Mary and
bearing God from within," did so in defiance of the church's earlier
edict that Mary couldn't claim the title of Theotokos (God-bearer), because God couldn't be born of a mortal woman. 72 The edict was
abandoned after several centuries only because Christians wished to
emulate the pagan Mystery-cults whose Savior-gods were invariably
born of mortal virgins. (See Virgin Birth.) Christian art of the first five centuries showed Mary in a position lower than Jesus, even lower than the Magi, who wore haloes while
she wore none. In the 6th century she acquired a halo and rose to the
central position in a group of non-haloed apostles. By the 9th century she reigned as Queen of Heaven in the middle of the apse in two
cathedrals. 73
By the 14th century, Wyclif was writing: "It seems to me impossible that we should obtain the reward without the help of Mary.
There is no sex or age, no rank or position, of anyone in the whole
human race, which has no need to call for the help of the Holy Virgin." The Te Deum Laudamus declared, "All the earth doth worship thee, Spouse of the Eternal Father." 74 When Mary appeared in a subordinate position, it was in the role
f Daughter like the Virgin Kore on the lap of the Elder Goddess
o
611



Mary represented by "God's grandmother," the ancient Anna (St. Anne,
called Mary's mother). In some painted or sculpted groupings, the ^^^^^^^^^^^ two Goddesses and the male infant seem to form a trinity quite
exclusive of God. 75 An observer might be reminded of the Egyptian
god-king on the laps of his Two Mothers, they who would nurse him
forever and thus give him eternal life. The mythical history of St. Anne reveals that she, even more directly than Mary, descended from
the image of that fertile Creatress, Mother Earth. 76
Legends and images of Mary exerted an uncanny appeal even in the "scientific" modern age with its professed skepticism about the
supernatural. In 1945, a young boy named Joseph Vitolo was greatly impressed by the film Song ofBernadette, and subsequently conjured up a vision of the Virgin for himself. He conversed with her for sixteen
consecutive nights at a certain rock in the Bronx. She told him to
have a chapel built on the spot, and promised the appearance of a healing spring within a short time.
Though the site received the popular name of the Bronx Lourdes,
and credulous folk hurried there in astonishing numbers to pray for
miraculous cures, the spring never appeared. Eventually, young Joseph became embarrassed by the fuss he had caused. He then said the
Virgin told him she wouldn't come any more to that place. Despite this
disappointment, for many years the faithful continued to gather and
dig in the mud, seeking the holy spring. 77 But it was not only the simple-minded who sought help from Mary. Historian Henry Adams thought Christianity's divine mother, however attenuated, offered the only hope of spiritual comfort in an
alienated technological society. He saw that "the males of his society,
who had transferred so many of their once autonomous activities to
machines and automatons, did not have sufficient life-sense to save
the race. In their blind pride over their scientific facilities, they would
cling to the insensate mechanisms they had created, making them go
faster and faster, though incapable of applying the brakes. . . . Henry Adams, at the end of his own career, turned to another countervailing
form of energy, the energy of life, the energy of erotic love, reproduc
tion, and creation; he sought a counterpoise to chaos by invoking woman's faith in her own creativity, in all the ramifying, formative
processes of life, above all those of sex, love, and motherhood." In a
poetic address to the Virgin he said: "I feel the energy of faith, not in
the future science but in you." 78 Once more it seemed that God (or man) depended on his Mother
(or woman) to straighten up the mess he had made, even if it meant
ceding supreme power to her. An 1 8th-century theologian wrote, "At the command of Mary all obey, even God." Today it is widely
recognized even by laymen that "two rivers of common source, Mary and Maya, the Virgin and Shakti, once again run into one: and the
612



idess is once more, as she ever was, the creatrix of the universe, the Mary Magdalene
self-revealing energy of the unknowable God." 79

Mary Magdalene
The Gospels say Jesus cast seven devils out of the sacred harlot Mary
Magdalene, and appeared first to her after his resurrection (Mark 16:9).
Books later eliminated from the canon by Christian censors gave
further curious details about the relationship: Jesus loved Mary Magda
lene more than all other apostles, called her Apostle to the Apostles
and "the Woman Who Knew the All," and often kissed her. 1 He said
she would excel every other disciple in the coming Kingdom of Light, where she would rule. 2
Before Gnostic Gospels were cut out of the canon, they were
accepted as the Word of God, as much as the synoptic Gospels and other New Testament writings. Therefore medieval traditions concern
ing Mary Magdalene hark back to her early mystical supremacy. She was called Mary Lucifer, "Mary the Light-giver." It was said Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead solely for love of her. "There was no
grace that He refused her, nor any mark of affection that He withheld from her." 5
The Pistis Sophia made Mary Magdalene the questioner of Jesus, Pistis Sophia (Faith
in the Oriental manner of the catechism applied to the god by his Wisdom) A Gnostic
Shakti or Devi (Goddess). The female questioner then was addressed as scr'P^e of the 3rd
ccnturv a O trcinsritccl
"Dearly Beloved."4 Jesus used the same form of address, though later from q^i^
editors eliminated all traces of the identity of his questioner; but it was Coptic, setting forth the
apparent that his "dearly beloved" was Mary Magdalene. 5 teachings of Jesus
Origen showed a mystic devotion to Mary Magdalene, confusing uPon his return to earth,
her with the Goddess by calling her "the mother of all of us," and ] 2 years after his
1 <* resurrection.
613



Mary Magdalene
Origen (Origenes Adamantius) Christian father, ca. 185-254
a.d., an Egyptian who wrote in Greek,
exerting a powerful influence on the early Greek church. At first he was accounted a saint, but three centuries after his death he was declared a heretic because of Gnostic elements found in
his writings.
Gospel of Mary One of the early
Gnostic Gospels, once included with the books of the New Testament but later eliminated from the canon. A copy was rediscovered in the 1940s at Nag Hammadi.
sometimes Jerusalem, and sometimes The Church (Ecclesia, another title of the Virgin). Origen claimed Mary Magdalene was immortal,
having lived from the beginning of time.6 Thus it seems Mary the Whore was only another form of Mary
the Virgin, otherwise the Triple Goddess Mari-Anna-Ishtar, the Great Whore of Babylon who was worshipped along with her savior-son
in the Jerusalem temple. 7 The Gospel ofMary said all three Marys of the canonical books were one and the same. 8 Indeed, the Virgin and Whore were still confused with one
another in the 7th century a.d. when, on the day of the Nativity of
the Blessed Virgin, Pope Sergius instituted an annual procession to the
old temple of the prostitute-goddess Libera, changing the temple's name to Santa Maria Maggiore: Most-Great Holy Mary.9 It was not
made clear which Holy Mary was meant. A Gnostic poem merged the two of them as a primal feminine power: "I am the first and the last. I am the honored one and the scorned one. I am the whore, and the holy one." 10
Magdalene means "she of the temple-tower." The Jerusalem
temple had a triple tower representing the triple deity, one tower bearing the name of the queen, Mariamne, an earthly incarnation of the Goddess Mari. 11 This was the same Mariamne, Miriam, or Mary who took Joseph for her lover. 12 Priestesses of this temple apparently
subsidized Jesus and his companions, according to Luke 8:1-3,
which says Jesus and "the twelve" were financially supported by Mary Magdalene and a group of women. Latin texts say the women
provided for "him" (Jesus), but Greek texts make it "them." n
The seven "devils" exorcised from Mary Magdalene seem to have
been the seven Maskim, or Anunnaki, Sumero-Akkadian spirits of the seven nether spheres, born of the Goddess Mari. Their multiple birth was represented in her sacred dramas, which may account for
their alleged emergence from Mary Magdalene. An Akkadian tablet said of them: "They are seven! In the depths of the ocean, they are
seven! In the brilliancy of the heavens, they are seven! They proceed
from the ocean depths [Maria], from the hidden retreat." H The Gospels say no men attended Jesus's tomb, but only Mary j Magdalene and her women. Only women announced Jesus's resurrection. This was because men were barred from the central mysteries of the Goddess. Priestesses announced the successful conclusion of
the rites, and the Savior's resurrection. The Bible says the male apostles
knew nothing of Jesus's resurrection, and had to take the women's word for it (Luke 24:10-1 1). The apostles were ignorant of the sacred
tradition and didn't even realize a resurrection was expected: "They
knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead"
(John 20:9). Mari-Ishtar the Great Whore anointed or christ-ened her doomed god when he went into the underworld, whence he would
614



rise again at her bidding. That is, she made him a Christ. Her priestess Mary Magdalene
raised the lament for him when he died in the flesh, as a sacrificial
victim. In the Epic of Gilgamesh, victims were told: "The harlot who ^^^^^^^^^^^
anointed you with fragrant oil laments for you now." 15 Templewomen of Jerusalem raised the same lament for Tammuz (Ezekiel
8:14), with whom Jesus was identified. Jesus himself said Mary
Magdalene anointed him for his burial, pouring a precious unguent on his head in the time-honored manner of the sacred king's crowning
(Matthew 26:7-12). The christening-vase of holy oil was the ubiquitous symbol of Mary Magdalene in Christian art though the virgin Mary also bore the harlot's title of Holy Vase. 16 See Jesus Ben Pandera.
Virgin and Whore constantly exchanged attributes through the
Middle Ages; the virgin Mary was consistently a special patron of
prostitutes. 17 A Christian magic ring, now in the London museum, bears the legend, "Holy Mary Magdalene pray for me." 18 Pope Julius II by a papal bull established a "sacred" brothel in
Rome, which flourished under his successors Leo X and Clement
VII. The earnings of this brothel supported the Holy Sisters of the
Order of St. Mary Magdalene, indicating that the Holy Sisters and the magdalenes (whores) were one and the same. Pope Innocent III
also favored Rome's collegia of prostitutes, called virgines, "unmarried women." He publicly announced that any man who married one of them would be specially praised in heaven. 19
Much Christian myth-making went into the later history of Mary
Magdalene. She was said to have lived for a while with the virgin
Mary at Ephesus. This story probably was invented to account for the
name Maria associated with the Ephesian Goddess. Afterward, Mary
Magdalene went to Marseilles, another town named after the ancient sea-mother Mari. Her cult centered there. Bones were found at
Vezelay and declared to be hers. Her dwelling was a cave formerly
sacred to the pagans, at St. Baume (Holy Tree). 20 For thirty years she lived there without eating or drinking, her only nourishment the sweet
songs of the angels, a "delightful repast" she daily took in through her ears. 21 A church was built over her grotto. Local winegrowers still offer
votive candles to her for a good vintage, as if the ancient fertility
mother still occupied the site. 22 St. Martha accompanied Mary to Provence and worked a number
of miracles there. Meeting a dragon named Tarasque (i.e., the Celtic
deity Taranis), Martha destroyed him by tying him up with her girdle and pouring holy water on his head. 23 Old images of the Twofold Goddess with her Great Serpent seem to have been renamed Mary and
Martha. More often, Mary appeared as the typical feminine trinity
ruling birth, love, and death. As Holy Mary at the Cradle, she was the midwife (or birth-goddess) who delivered Jesus. 24 As harlot and
funerary priestess she was linked with sex and death. Finally there was
the Gnostic suggestion that she was the original "pope," foundress of
615



Mascot Christ's church, according to the Oriental idea that spiritual authority
Mashya and Mashyoi must pass from male to female and vice versa (see Peter, Saint). ^^^^^^^^^^^ Some said she married St. John the Evangelist. 25 In 1 2th-century Milan
they were worshipped together in a dual cathedral built and adminis
tered by the monks of St. John jointly with the virgines of St. Maria
Maggiore, also entitled Sancta Dei Genetrix (Holy Mother of God).
The androgynous cathedral was excavated in 1943-44, but its discovery
was kept secret. 26
During the 1 3th century a Dianic temple was rededicated to Mary
Magdalene. At Easter, the story of her conversion of the rulers of
Marseilles was chanted at the altar. Later the sacred song was sup
pressed. Later still, Mary's devotees were forbidden to hold mass. In
1781, the Magdalene temple was demolished. 27

Mascot
Originally a familiar spirit in animal form, like a witch's traditional
black cat or black dog. Mascoto meant "witchcraft," from Provencal
French masco, a sorceress (i.e., "masked one"). 1 The mascot of a pagan totemic clan was its animal mask, worn on ceremonial occasions. By Christian definition this became an animal-headed demon.

goddess Macha, slayer of heroes; or even to the twin-peaked mountain Macchu Picchu, "Hitching Post of the Sun," in distant Peru. 2

Persian prototypes of Adam and Eve, the first human couple born together from the womb of Earth, in which the seed of Gayomart, the
primal man, had been buried for "forty years" a mythic augmentation of the sacred forty weeks, normal term of human gestation. God
616



(Ahura Mazda) told them not to listen to the lies of the devil Mask
(Ahriman). But they disobeyed, and came to regard Ahriman as the creator of the feminine elements, water, earth, and fruit. This couple ^^^^^^^^^^
gave birth to seven other couples, from whom descended all the races of
humanity. 1 The same sevenfold pattern of racial "roots" reappeared in Simonian Gnosticism as the seven powers born of the primordial
female source, from whom came even God the Father. 2 See Simon
Magus.
1. Lamusse, 319. 2. Legge 1, 183.
Mask
It is a commonplace of primitive religion that deity resides in a sacred mask. A wearer of the mask is possessed by the spirit. He or she is the
God or Goddess, at least for participation in the sacred drama or
procession. Paleolithic rock drawings show divine creatures as human beings wearing the masks of animals. Egyptian animal-headed deities
were obviously human beings wearing elaborate animal heads. 1 Modern
Africans, Melanesians, Australians, and many others maintain the same belief. A witch doctor in a lion mask "isn't pretending to be a lion;
he is convinced that he is a lion. . . . [H]e shares a 'psychic identity'
with the animal." 2 Similarly in pre-Christian Europe, anyone wearing the mask or headdress of a god would become the god or, as
Christians put it, would be possessed by the devil.
The word mask occurs in many Indo-European languages and might be traced to the maskim of Sumer and Akkad: spirits of the
nether spheres, or ancestral ghosts. Initiated Sufi magicians of the
Middle Ages wore spirit masks and became maskhara, "revelers," at
their sabbats; this probably gave rise to the French designation of a
mystery play as a masque} The Scandinavian word for a mask was grim} This word was often
a component of gods' names, like Grimnir (Masked One, a title of Odin). 5 In some legends the mask became a magic helmet that gave admission to the spirit world. The most famous magic helmet was
called Hildegrim, or Helkappe, or Tarnkappe, or Cap of Darkness. It was given by Mother Hel (Hilde) to her favored heroes. It made
them invisible so they could enter the rose gardens of paradise as if they
were dead, yet return alive to the earth. The wearer of the mask
became like the Lord of Death, able to reincarnate himself. The Book of Heroes and the Wilkina saga named Hel's perennial consort Grim. He lived with the Goddess in her secret cave until
another hero came to challenge and kill him and inherit the mask.6
Some said this magic Helkappe was made of dog skin, since dogs were sacred to the death-goddess, and it was the same mask worn by
Hades, the Lord of Death. 7 In medieval France the same Lord of Death was Macabre, the
617



Mass Mater
Grim Reaper that is, the masked reaper, wielding his scythe as a reaper of souls. He performed the danse macabre, Dance of Death, in
the mystery plays and folk festivals so frequently featured in medieval
art. Like Dancing Shiva in Kali's cosmic yoni, Macabre reminded his
audience that the dance of life is also a dance of death; that the two
are mutually dependent, neither possible without the other. 8 Tibetan
mystery plays still present the death-masquerader in his skull mask and skeleton costume.9 Evans-Wentz said medieval mystery plays
contained "symbolism so much akin to that found in mystery plays
still flourishing under ecclesiastical patronage throughout Tibet and the neighboring territories of Northern Buddhism as to point to another
stream of Orientalism having come into Europe." 10 Animal-headed deities of Egypt and the Middle East also found
new incarnations in medieval mystery plays, some of which may have been rooted in Neolithic rites when sacred dancers wore the heads of
sacrificed beasts. At the ineradicably popular Carnival, "Mummers
went about dressed as various kinds of beasts, probably a remnant of
some seasonal festival of native gods, Gaulish or other, for in Gaul at
all events gods often were represented under forms other than human." 11
Pagan mask-wearing at religious festivals continued in the secular
Carnival. After having denounced it as unlawful for many centuries, the church finally capitulated and declared it "lawful" to wear masks in
Carnival season. 12 However, the word masca remained one of the
church's official words for a witch. 15

Matrilineal Inheritance
During the Neolithic age, the matrilineal clan system and the rule of
mother-right were followed almost everywhere. Early writings from Egypt depict the woman in complete control of herself and her
home, with property descending from mother to daughter. The most significant revolution in Greece was the transition from matrilineal to
patrilineal succession and the resulting destruction of clan loyalties. In
many other areas, the matrilineal system survived to a late date. The
Venerable Bede mentioned rules of matrilineal succession still existing
in parts of the British Isles up to the 9th century. 1 Matrilineal inheritance was the rule among British tribes until the
coming of Christianity. The Picts inherited all property, even "king
doms," through the female line. 2 With the coming of Christianity, the
old laws of mother-right began to decline. Sixth-century England still had laws of equal inheritance, but a wife who decided to leave her
husband could carry off half the property and all the children. Later
in the Christian era, the wife was deprived of everything. The English "heir" came from heres, cognate with the Greek word for a female landowner, here or "Hera." The Magna Carta referred to a here as a
person of either sex. Later church laws listed heres as exclusively
male. 3
Among pagan Celts, men bequeathed nothing to their children; their possessions were inherited by their sisters or their sisters'
children. According to old laws of Burgundy and Thuringia, property
passed only in the female line.4 Charlemagne opposed marriage for his daughters, because under old Frankish laws of matrilineal inheri
tance this would have meant division of his kingdom. 5
In pre-Roman Latium a landholding was called latifundia, founded by the Goddess Lat, after whom the country was named; thus each parcel of land belonged originally to a matriarch.6 Even in the later Roman empire, husbands had no legal claim on their wives' land or
possessions as long as the wife was careful to spend three consecutive nights each year away from home. 7 This was a remnant of an earlier
custom like that of pre-Islamic Arabs, whereby a wife divorced her husband by shutting him out of the home for three consecutive
nights. 8 In Greece, a parcel of property was temenos, "land belonging to
620



t : moon," i.e., to woman.9 This came to mean specifically the land
rounding a temple of the Goddess. 10 In primitive times however, fcry matriarch's hearth was a temple of the Goddess. The populain and land unit in Attica was a demos, derived from De that is, the
xldess De-Mother, or Demeter. 11 Chieftains ruled only through
rriage with the resident matriarch. Harking back to this same system
India, the Mahabharata says the leading attributes of a queen were
h intelligence, sacred knowledge, and property. 12 In most ancient societies, young men went forth from their
Mternal homes to seek their fortune elsewhere, because their sisters
merited the family home. It was a fixed habit of Greek men, and also
the pagan heroes depicted in fairy tales, to leave home and seek a trilocal marriage with an heiress in a distant land. 13
"Matrimony" used to mean the feminine equivalent of "patrimo
|
: inheritance of property, in the maternal line. Matrimony came
be synonymous with marriage only because marriage was a way for In to gain control of property.
In Lydia, women owned the land, governed the communities, and |>k the initiative in love affairs. 14 The same was true in Egypt.
Inheritance passed through the mother rather than through the fa
ftr," says Professor Gordon. "This system may well hark back to
ehistoric times when only the obvious relationship between mother
ad child was recognized, but not the less apparent relationship
ween father and child." For many centuries, patriarchal marriages in lypt existed side by side with old-style matriarchal unions, initiated
the wife and terminated by her will alone. 15 Since daughters, not
Ins, inherited property, it was the duty of an Egyptian daughter (not
1) to care for aged parents. 16 Male scholars have been reluctant to describe ancient systems of
trilineal inheritance. After translation of early Babylonian texts,
I Boscawen wrote, "The freedom granted [my italics] to women in ibylonia allowed them to hold and manage their own estates. . . .
fjhe mother here is always represented by a sign which means fcddess of the house.'" 17 The implication was that women held
A-ir property only through men's lenience, which was not the case, lbmen held property by the ironclad law of mother-right, and a
Ibylonian wife had the same title as a matriarch in India, grhadevata, flouse-Goddess."
Even Mohammed, a leading opponent of matriarchal principles, ftas enabled to carry out his mission thanks only to the wealth which
acquired from his first wife Khadija, who was engaged in lucrative
BBc and owned landed estates." 18 Landed property developed in the hands of women because
men were the first to farm the land, thereby establishing ownership
lit. Some primitives still believe only the life-magic inherent in women
II make plants grow: "Women know how to bring forth, and how
Inake the seed bring forth; men don't understand these things." 19

Matrilineal Inheritance Amerindians universally attributed the invention of agriculture to
women, sole owners of the cultivated fields. Matrilocal marriage and
^^^^^^^^^^^ matrilineal ownership of the home place were customary among the Algonquin, Sioux, Seneca, Pawnee, Seminole, Kiowa, and Cree tribes. As in ancient Greece, fathers were "strangers" in the clan. Women
were "mistresses of the soil." 20 "The women were the great power
among the clans as everywhere else [T]he original nomination of the chiefs always rested with them/' 21 When the Iroquois conveyed
lands to the U.S. government, documents had to be marked by their women, because the marks of men had no validity among the tribes. 22
Payuga women owned everything, as one missionary found to his astonishment: "If the husband gives his wife any cause, real or
fancied, of offense, she packs up the tent and its furniture, appropriates even the canoe, and takes everything away; the children follow her, and the husband and father is left with the clothes he stands in and his
weapons as his only possession." 23 The laws of this missionary's homeland insisted on the contrary: a divorced husband retained every
thing including the children, the wife having no legal right even to her clothes. Hence, the missionaries' surprise at Indian customs and
their expectation of men's resentment. Yet Indian men didn't resent
the prerogatives of mother-right. They considered the mother's author
ity natural, as Christians considered the father's authority natural.
Indian husbands were known to take forty- or fifty-mile hikes only to
procure some special food craved by a pregnant wife. 24 In Africa, women owned the land and other property connected
with the home place, and transmitted ownership to their daughters or i
their brothers' daughters. European governments and missions in Africa
loosed a torrent of propaganda against matrilineal customs among the
natives. In most African nations, European land reforms consisted of
taking land away from the women and allocating it to their husbands. 25 This tended to make the women paupers and destroy their
self-respect, as the tribes looked down on a woman who couldn't
support her children.
Patriarchal religious authorities everywhere changed ancient sys- I terns of matrilineal inheritance to put property in the hands of men.
Medieval Christian kings commonly endowed their barons with the
phrase, "Take that woman and her fief." 26 The early centuries of the
Christian conquest of Europe were largely occupied with acquisition of ' lands from the pagan women. The monastic Order of Teutonic
Knights got the island of Mainau from its owner, the Fair Maid of Mainau, on condition that her lover be made head of the order. 27
The Bible contains traces of former matrilineal inheritance and
matrilocal marriage, e.g., a man shall "leave his father and his
mother, and cleave unto his wife" (Genesis 2:24). Naomi told her
daughters-in-law to "return each to her mother's house" (Ruth 1:8)
because houses were owned by mothers, not fathers. A marriage
agreement permitting removal of a woman from her maternal home
622



was a violation of ancient laws. Therefore Abraham, seeking a bride for Matrilineal Inheritance
his son, had to give many gifts to the bride, to her mother, and to her brother (not to her father) as compensation for taking her away from her ^^^^^^^^^^^
iiome (Genesis 24:53). Retention of property in the hands of a patrilineal clan was the purpose of the so-called Levirate marriage commanded by God
(Deuteronomy 25:5). If a man died, his brother must marry the widow rather than allow her to take her property and depart from the family.
[This rule dated from an early era when nomadic Israelites began to
acquire lands and possessions by intermarrying with pagan women of Canaan, Moab, Phoenicia, etc. Modern laws play the same trick on
|women. If a husband and wife die together in an accident, it is
(assumed that the wife dies first, so the man's family will inherit. 28
People who maintained the matrilocal marriage tradition, like the
American Indians, developed no wedding laments, mock battles,
pseudo-kidnappings, or displays of coyness. 29 But in patrilocal marriages, jthe bride's relatives usually put on a show of resistance. Matrilocal
marriage appeared in the Norse myth of Ragnar Lodbrok (Leather
breeches), who married a foreign warrior-princess, but could not induce her to leave her own country. When he wished to return to his homeland, he was forced to leave her behind. 30
Even the peripatetic gypsies had matrilocal marriage traditions. In gypsy folklore, heroines never left their maternal homes. After death
pey were buried under the family threshold a custom of the early
Hindus, the gypsies' forebears. 31
The aim of European Christianity was acquisition of property, Which meant overturning pagan systems of matrilineal inheritance.
By forcible seizure and warfare, the church managed to acquire fully a fthird of all the landed property on the continent by the early Middle
Ages. 32 The rest was more difficult. In some parts of Europe up to 1200
U.D., women were still listed as the landowners, and men identified
themselves by their mothers' clan names. Until the 10th century, priests
married to gain property, claiming that without their wives they would succumb to "hunger and nakedness." Church laws revised the
Jjystem; then a series of papal decretals between 103 1 and 105 1
prdered priests to abandon their wives and sell their children into
klavery. 33 Naturally, the property and monies thus acquired by a priest would revert to the church upon his death, since he no longer had legal
heirs.
The legal/ecclesiastical war on female property ownership went on Icentury after century, until women were so hamstrung by the laws of Cod and man that they had almost nothing left that they could call their
own. By the end of the 19th century, English wives could not
administer their own property even if they had any, nor make a will
disposing of it, without their husbands' consent. 34 As late as 1930 in France, a woman was forbidden to do any business with a bank, not even to make small deposits, without her husband's permission. 35 Up

to the present time, lack of control over money and property is still the
greatest obstacle for women who wish to take their children and leave
abusive or violent husbands. In this respect the centuries of patriarchal
effort achieved their goal.

Matronalia
"Feast of the Mothers," a Roman holy day celebrated in spring by women only, at the sacred grove established in pre-Roman times by the
Sabine matriarchate. The women's subsequent period of asceticism
and fasting up to the festival of Ceres in April was the forerunner of the
Christian fast of Lent. 1 Rites of the Matronalia were kept secret from
men and remain obscure to this day, though their purpose undoubtedly
was to make the Earth Mother ready for springtime regeneration.
l.Gaster,645.
In Scandinavia, May was dedicated to Maj, the Virgin, either Mary or the pagans' Virgin Mother, interchangeably. In Saxon England the month was called
Sproutkale: the sprout
ing time of virginmother Earth with her archaic Aryan name of
Kale, Kelle, or Kali. Another name for the month was Tri-Milchi,
improbably derived by the Venerable Bede from a theory that the Saxon cows gave milk three times a day in
May. 8 Alternatively, it meant the Triple
Goddess's appearance in the form of three
May
The month of Maya or Maia, the Virgin Goddess of Spring; in northern Europe, Maj or Mai, the Maiden. 1 This was the traditional month of "wearing of the green" in honor of the Earth Mother's new
garment, and of fornicating in plowed fields to encourage the crops. May was a "honey-moon" of sexual freedom throughout rural Europe up to the 16th century. 2 Marriage bonds were temporarily in abeyance. The maxim that "only bad women" marry in the month of
May probably was a relic of earlier taboos on all marriages during the
month of license. 3
Yet there were traces of a divine marriage ritual in the "May
riding," when knights and ladies rode in pairs into the wood, led by the Queen of the May on a white horse and her male companion on a dark one. They impersonated Frey and Freya, "the Lord" and "the
Lady" whose union made fertility magic each spring.4 May Eve was the great springtime festival of "witches," corresponding to Halloween at the opposite pole of the year. May Eve was known in Germany as Walpurgisnacht, in Ireland and Scotland as
Beltaine or Baltein, when the god Baal, Bel, or Balder was burned in
effigy. Sometimes a man chosen by lot represented him, and leaped through the May fires still called "Balder's balefires" in rural Scandi
624



Bavia. 5 Clearly, these were customs dating back to real burning of the May
pan who represented the god in his love-death (Liebestod).
The May King of medieval romance inherited the customs of ^^^^^^^^^^
Diana's sacred kings. He won the "queen of a magic wood" (the Ipoddess) by combat with her previous king on the festival of Ascension
Day in May. Le Chevalier de la Charrette named him Meleagant, jlrince of the land of no return (he was a Lord of Death). Le Morte
WArthur corrupted his name to "Mellyagaunce," a lascivious May
png who became the ritual lover of Queen Guinevere and led the
lexual games of May Day.6 A 1 5th-century poet identified the same May King with Christ, who was like the Holy Rose of May: "the red lower that Mary bore." 7
The god's phallus was planted in the earth's womb in the guise of
he Maypole, which was not originally European but a direct borrow
ng from India where the Maypole is still "the great lingam." 9 In
6th-century England its phallic symbolism was understood perfectly veil, as shown by the diatribe of the Puritan writer Philip Stubbes:
Young men and maids, old men and wives, run gadding overnight to the woods, groves, hills, and mountains, where they spend all night in
pleasant pastimes; and in the morning they return, bringing with them birch and branches oftrees, to deck their assemblies withal. And no
marvel, for there is a great Lord present amongst them, as superintendent and Lord over their pastimes and sports; namely, Satan, prince ofhell. But the chiefest jewel they bring from thence is their May-pole, which
they bring home with great veneration, as thus. They have twenty or forty yoke ofoxen, every ox having a sweet nose-gay offlowers placed on the tip ofhis horns, and these oxen draw home this May-pole (this
stinking idol, rather) which is covered all over with flowers and herbs, bound round about with strings, from the top to the bottom, and sometimes painted with variable colors, with two or three hundred men, women and children following it with great devotion. And this being reared up, with handkerchiefs and flags hovering on the top, they strew
the ground round about, bind green boughs about it, set up summer halls, bowers, and arbors hard by it. And then fall they to dance about it, like as the heathen people did at the dedication ofIdols, whereofthis is
a perfect pattern, or rather the thing itself. w
Young men and maids went into the woods, and few returned
me "undefiled," as the observer said. According to Spelman, the ic fellows and their girl friends fell "into ditches upon one
nother," for the odd reason that they were "enveloped with a mist of
wandering out of their ways." Douce had no doubt of the festival's
>agan origin: "The Queen of the May is the legitimate representative of
he Goddess Flora in the Roman Festival." n Stuckeley described
day celebrations in 1 724:
There is a May Pole near Horn Castle, Lincolnshire, where probably stood an Hermes (herm, phallic pillar) in Roman times. The boys annually keep up the festival ofthe Floralia on May Day, making a procession to this hill with May gads (as they call them) in their hands.
625



Maya This is a white willow wand, the bark peeled off, tied round with cowslips, a thyrsus ofthe Bacchanals. At night they have a bonehre, and other
merriment, which is really a sacrifice, a religious festival. ' 2
Naturally the church was opposed to this religious festival.
Bishop Eligius of Noyons begged his converts in the 7th century to stop observing the sexual rites of May without success. 15 A thousand
years later the month was still given over to "witches." Church bells in
1 7-century Treves were rung all night throughout the month of
May, to "protect the city from flying witches." H There were a few voices raised against ecclesiastical restrictions on
the activities of the Merry Month. William Fennor's Pasquil's Palino
dia (\6\9) lamented the new puritanical laws against the rites of May:
When no capricious constables disturb them, Nor justice ofthe peace did seek to curb them,
Nor peevish puritan, in railing sort, Nor over-wise church-warden, spoiled the sport, Happy the age, and harmless were the days (For then true love and amity were found),
When every village did a Maypole raise, And Witson-ales and May-games did abound . . . But since the Summer poles were over-thrown, And all good sports and merriments decay'd, How times and men are chang'd, so well is known, It were but labor lost ifmore were said. Alas, poor May Poles; what should be the cause That you were almost banish 'd from the earth ?
Who never were rebellious to the laws; Your greatest crime was harmless, honest mirth . . .
Some fiery, zealous brother, full ofspleen, That all the world in his deep wisdom scorns, Could not endure the May-pole should be seen To wear a cox-comb higher than his horns: He took it for an idol, and the feast
For sacrifice unto that painted beast.' 5

Maya
"Magic," title of the Virgin Kali as the creatress of earthly appear
ances, i.e., all things made of matter and perceptible to the senses. She
also gave birth to the Enlightened One, Buddha. 1
The same Goddess, called Maia by the Greeks, was the virgin mother of Hermes the Enlightened One, who had as many reincarnations as the Buddha. Sometimes Maia's partner was Volcanus (Greek
Hephaestus, the divine smith and fire-god). This was another mythic
626



nating of male fire and female water. 2 Hindus said Agni the fire-god Maya
vas the consort of Kali-Maya, though he was periodically swallowed lp and "quenched" by her. According to the Tantric phrase, the ^^^^^^
Goddess quenched a blazing lingam in her yoni. 3 As the virgin mother of Buddha, Maya embarrassed ascetic Bud
Ihists and was soon written out of the script. Like ascetic Christians
peaking of Christ's birth, some Buddhists claimed the Enlightened One uld not touch his mother's "parts of shame" and so was born
hrough an opening in her side. This mythic Caesarian section seems to lave been bungled, for a few days later Maya died "of joy," as
Juddhist scriptures rather fatuously put it. 4
Nevertheless, Maya remained very much alive as one of Kali's nost revered manifestations, because the very fact of "Existence" le material cosmos demanded her presence. As Zimmer analyzed
ler:
Maya-Shakti is personified as the world-protecting, feminine, maternal side ofthe Ultimate Being, and as such, stands for the spontaneous,
loving acceptance oflife's tangible reality. . . . [S]he affirms, she is, she represents and enjoys, the delirium ofthe manifested forms. . . . Maya
Shakti is Eve, "the Eternal Feminine, " das Ewig-Weibliche: she who ate, and tempted her consort to eat, and was herselfthe apple. From the
point of view ofthe masculine principle ofthe Spirit (which is in quest of
the enduring, eternally valid, and absolutely divine) she is the preeminent enigma. s
In herself Maya embodied all three aspects of the maternal
Trinity. Her colors were white, red, and black, the colors of the Gunas,
>r the Virgin-Mother-Crone. 6 Like every other form of Kali, she was
Creator, Preserver, Destroyer. She was also a spirit dwelling perpetually n women. A Mahayana text says, "Of all the forms of Maya, woman
s the most important." 7 Maya's son Buddha was surrounded by her symbols. He entered lis trance of meditation under her sacred fig tree, which protected
lim from the weather. On his return from the soul-journey, his first
ymbolic act was to accept a dish of curds from a maiden on Full
vloon Day in the month of May, the greatest of Buddhist festivals. 8
Not only the month but many other traditions, names, and ncepts attest to the great age and wide distribution of the Goddess ifaya. She was more than the Maia who mothered Hermes; she was
ilso Maga the Grandmother-goddess who bore Cu Chulainn's nother; and the Mandaean Christians' Almaya, called "Eternity," or
'the World," or "Beings"; and Maga or Maj the May-maiden in Scandinavia.9 Like the Hindu Maya who brought forth earthly appear
inces at creation, the Scandinavian one personified the pregnant vomb of chaos before the beginning: Ginnungagap. In this the World
nrgin was associated with the idea of magical illusion, creating
'appearances" like her Hindu counterpart. 10 This universal Creatress-name may have reached the western
627



Me hemisphere also. The Maya people of Yucatan offered sacrifices in Medea the same way as in northern India, at the same seasons, determined by
^^^^^^^^^^^ the same stars. 1 ' Mayan "scorpion stars" were the same as the
constellation Scorpio on Hindu and Greek charts. As in India, Mayan
divine images were painted blue and Mayan woman pierced the left nostril for insertion of a jewel. 12 Another version of the Creatress seems to have been the Mother Goddess Mayauel of the Mexican Agave, called "Woman with Four Hundred Breasts," with a strong resem
blance to the world-nurturing Many-Breasted Artemis and other eastern forms of the deity who mothered all the world's creatures.

Babylonian word for "mother-wisdom" enshrined on the Tablets of
Destiny, given by the Great Goddess to her firstborn son; cognate of
Sanskrit medha, feminine wisdom, and Egyptian met, with the same
meaning, as well as a decimal numbering system, like the Greek meter
(mother). 1 Me also meant the magic power of Fate, religious inspiration, and healing magic (medicine). Goddess names derived from this
root include Medea, Medusa, Metis, Mene, Maat, and Demeter.

Mearah
Hebrew "Cave," a title of the Goddess Cybele, Great Mother of the Gods; also applied to the holy cavern where Adonis was born in
Bethlehem. (See Cave.)
Medea
"Wise One," eponymous Mother Goddess of the Medes. Like Medusa and Metis, she was named from the Sanskrit concept of medha, "female wisdom." ' She was a fount of the feminine art of healing, and her name was related to "medicine." 2 She could restore the dead to
life in her magic cauldron, as shown by the myth of Aeson, who was
so restored. Pliny called Medea a Goddess whose magic arts could
control the sun, moon, and stars. 5 She rode in a chariot drawn by
serpents; it also had wings, to show that she ruled both earth and heaven. 4
According to Herodotus, Medea was the Great Goddess of all the
Aryan tribes of Parthia. 5 She was all-wise, and never died, but dwelt
forever in heaven.6
628



She seems to have been remembered in Ireland as the Goddess Medusa Medana, associated with a sacred tree and a regenerative well, whose waters were reputed to cure sore eyes. She was artificially canonized as a ^^^^^^^^^^^
saint, and her Christian legend was copied from that of the equally
bogus St. Lucy. 7 The classic story of Medea's ill-starred marriage to Jason apparently was based on a captured idol of the Goddess. Her rites were
imported into Greece but proved too sanguinary for Hellenic taste.

Medusa
Classic myth made Medusa the terrible Gorgon whose look turned
men to stone. The Argives said Medusa was a Libyan queen beheaded
by their ancestral hero Perseus, who brought her head (or ceremonial mask) back to Athens. 1
Actually, Medusa was the serpent-goddess of the Libyan Amazons, representing "female wisdom" (Sanskrit medha, Greek metis,
Egyptian met ox Maat). She was the Destroyer aspect of the Triple Goddess called Neith in Egypt, Ath-enna or Athene in North Africa.
Her inscription at Sais called her "mother of all the gods, whom she
bore before childbirth existed." She was the past, present, and future:
"All that has been, that is, and that will be." 2 So famous was this
description of her that Christians later copied it on behalf of Jehovah
(Revelation 1:8). She said: "No mortal has yet been able to lift the veil that covers
me," because she was Death, and to see her face to face was to die
that is, to be "turned to stone" as a funerary statue. She was veiled also because she was the Future, which always wears a veil. Another
meaning of her hidden, dangerous face was the menstrual taboo.
Primitive folk often believe the look of a menstruous woman can turn
a man to stone. 3 Medusa had magic blood that could create and destroy
life; thus she represented the dreaded life- and death-giving moonblood of women (see Menstrual Blood). 4 The Perseus story was invented to account for the appearance of
Medusa's face on Athene's aegis, inherited from the pre-Hellenic
period when Athene was actually the same Goddess (also mythologized
as Metis, her alleged "mother"). The Athenians pretended their municipal Goddess was the "wisdom" of Zeus, born from his head. But
older myths said Athene was born of the Three Queens of Libya

each Sabbath day she must remain in seclusion, alone in her own castle
of Lusinia. There she became a fish-tailed mermaid and spent the
day reclining in her bath. (According to classic myths, it was fatally dangerous for men to see the Goddess in her bath. Whether she was
Aphrodite, Artemis, Athene, or Ertha, she could be seen bathing only by "men doomed to die.") 1 Churchmen discovered Melusine and either killed her, or, accord
ing to another version, drove her out of her castle. The legend says
she still returns every night, like the moon, to suckle her "children,"
probably meaning the people themselves. She had a prophetic deathgoddess form also. It was said when Melusine appeared wailing over th<

rulers. Its Egyptian name was Men-nefer, "Beautiful Moon-virgin." Another variation of the Egyptian Moon-goddess was Menos, credited
with the invention of hieroglyphic writing. See Moon.

enstrual Blood Menstrual Blood
m the earliest human cultures, the mysterious magic of creation
was thought to reside in the blood women gave forth in apparent mi^m^^^^m harmony with the moon, and which was sometimes retained in the
womb to "coagulate" into a baby. Men regarded this blood with holy dread, as the life-essence, inexplicably shed without pain, wholly
foreign to male experience. Most words for menstruation also meant such things as incompre
hensible, supernatural, sacred, spirit, deity. Like the Latin sacer, old Arabian words for "pure" and "impure" both applied to menstrual blood and to that only. The Maoris stated explicitly that human souls are made of menstrual blood, which when retained in the womb "assumes human form and grows into a man." ' Africans said
menstrual blood is "congealed to fashion a man." 2 Aristotle said the
same: human life is made of a "coagulum" of menstrual blood. Pliny . icalled menstrual blood "the material substance of generation," capable
of forming "a curd, which afterwards in process of time quickeneth
and groweth to the form of a body." This primitive notion of the

; prenatal function of menstrual blood was still taught in European
I medical schools up to the 18th century. 3
Basic ideas about menstrual blood came from the Hindu theory
that as the Great Mother creates, her substance becomes thickened
and forms a curd or clot; solid matter is produced as a "crust." 4 This was
the way she gave birth to the cosmos, and women employ the same
- method on a smaller scale. According to Daustenius, "The fruit in the womb is nourished only by the mother's blood. . . . [T]he menstruum
does not fail the fruit for nourishment, till it at the proper time comes to
the light of day." 5 Indians of South America said all mankind was made of "moon
blood" in the beginning.6 The same idea prevailed in ancient Mesopotamia, where the Great Goddess Ninhursag made mankind out ... of clay and infused it with her "blood of life." Under her alternate
names of Mammetun or Aruru the Great, the Potter, she taught women to form clay dolls and smear them with menstrual blood as a
conception-charm, a piece of magic that underlay the name of Adam, from the feminine adamah, meaning "bloody clay," though scholars - more delicately translate it "red earth." 7 The Bible's story of Adam was lifted from an older female-oriented
creation myth recounting the creation of man from clay and moon
blood. So was the Koran's creation story, which said Allah "made man
out of flowing blood"; but in pre-Islamic Arabia, Allah was the Goddess of creation, Al-Lat. 8 The Romans also had traces of the
01 original creation myth. Plutarch said man was made of earth, but the power that made a human body grow was the moon, source of menstrual blood.9
635



Menstrual Blood The lives of the very gods were dependent on the miraculous
power of menstrual blood. In Greece it was euphemistically called ^^^^^^^^^^^m the "supernatural red wine" given to the gods by Mother Hera in her
virgin form, as Hebe. 10 The root myths of Hinduism reveal the
nature of this "wine." At one time all gods recognized the supremacy of
the Great Mother, manifesting herself as the spirit of creation (KaliMaya). She "invited them to bathe in the bloody flow of her womb and
to drink of it; and the gods, in holy communion, drank of the fountain
of life (hie est sanguis meusl) and bathed in it, and rose blessed to
the heavens." ' To this day, cloths allegedly stained with the God
dess's menstrual blood are greatly prized as healing charms. 12
W.R. Smith reported that the value of the gum acacia as an amulet "is
connected with the idea that it is a clot of menstrous blood, i.e., that
the tree is a woman." For religious ceremonies, Australian aborigines
painted their sacred stones, churingas, and themselves with red ochre,
declaring that it was really women's menstrual blood. 13
The esoteric secret of the gods was that their mystical powers of
longevity, authority, and creativity came from the same female essence. The Norse god Thor for example reached the magic land of
enlightenment and eternal life by bathing in a river filled with the
menstrual blood of "giantesses" that is, of the Primal Matriarchs, "Powerful Ones" who governed the elder gods before Odin brought
his "Asians" (Aesir) out of the east. 14 Odin acquired supremacy by stealing and drinking the "wise blood" from the triple cauldron in the
womb of Mother-Earth, the same Triple Goddess known as Kali-Maya in southeast Asia.
Odin's theft of menstrual magic paralleled that of Indra, who stole
the ambrosia of immortality in the same way. Indian myth called the
sacred fluid Soma in Greek, "the body," because the word's eastern
root referred to a mystical substance of the body. Soma was the object
of so much holy dread that its interpretations were many.
Soma was produced by the churning of the primal sea (Kali's "ocean of blood" or sometimes "sea of milk"). Or Soma was secreted by the Moon-Cow. Or Soma was carried in the "white pot" (belly) of Mohini the Enchantress. Or the source of Soma was the moon. Or from Soma all the gods were born. Or Soma was a secret name of the Mother Goddess and the active part of the "soul of the world." 15 Soma was drunk by priests at sacrificial ceremonies and mixed with
milk as a healing charm; therefore it was not milk. Soma was
especially revered on somvara, Monday, the day of the moon. In an ancient ceremony called Soma-vati, women of Maharashtra circum
ambulated the sacred female-symbolic fig tree whenever the new moon
fell on a Monday. 16 Some myths claimed the Goddess under her name of Lakshmi,
"Fortune" or "Sovereignty," gave Soma to Indra to make him king
of the gods. His wisdom, power, and curiously feminine capacity for pregnancy, came from Lakshmi's mystic drink, "of which none tastes
636



who dwells on earth." 17 On drinking it straight from the Goddess, Indra Menstrual Blood became like her, the Mount of Paradise with its four rivers, "manyhued" like the Goddess's rainbow veils, rich in cattle and fruiting ^^^^^^^^^^^
vegetation. 18 The Goddess's blood became his wisdom. Similarly, Greeks believed the wisdom of man or god was centered in his blood,
the soul-stuff given by his mother. 19
Egyptian pharaohs became divine by ingesting "the blood of Isis," a soma-like ambrosia called sa. zo Its hieroglyphic sign was the same as
the sign of the vulva, a yonic loop like the one on the ankh or Cross of
Life. 21 Painted red, this loop signified the female genital and the Gate of Heaven. 22 Amulets buried with the dead specifically prayed Isis to
deify the deceased with her magic blood. 23 A special amulet called
the Tjet represented Isis's vulva and was formed of red substance
jasper, carnelian, red porcelain, red glass, or red wood. This amulet was said to carry the redeeming power of the blood of Isis. 24
The same elixir of immortality received the name of amrita in
Persia. Sometimes it was called the milk of a mother Goddess, sometimes a fermented drink, sometimes sacred blood. Always it was
associated with the moon. "Dew and rain becoming vegetable sap, sap becoming the milk of the cow, and the milk then becoming
converted into blood: Amrita, water, sap, milk, and blood represent but differing states of the one elixir. The vessel or cup of this immortal
fluid is the moon." 25
Celtic kings became gods by drinking the "red mead" dispensed by the Fairy Queen, Mab, whose name was formerly Medhbh or
"mead." 26 Thus she gave a drink of herself, like Lakshmi. A Celtic
name of this fluid was dergflaith, meaning either "red ale" or "red
sovereignty." In Celtic Britain, to be stained with red meant to be chosen by the Goddess as a king. 27 Celtic ruadh meant both "red"
and "royal." 28 The same blood color implied apotheosis after death. The pagan
paradise or Fairyland was at the uterine center of the earth, site of the
magic Fountain of Life. An old manuscript in the British Museum said
the dying-and-resurrected Phoenix lives there forever. The central Holy Mountain or mons veneris contains both male and female sym
bols: the Tree of Life and the Fountain of Eternal Youth, the latter
obviously menstrual, as it was said to overflow once every lunar month. 29 Medieval churchmen insisted that the communion wine drunk by
witches was menstrual blood, and they may have been right. The famous wizard Thomas Rhymer joined a witch cult under the tutelage of the Fairy Queen, who told him she had "a bottle of claret wine . . .
here in my lap," and invited him to lay his head in her lap. 50 Claret
was the traditional drink of kings and also a synonym for blood; its name
meant literally "enlightenment." There was a saying, "The man in the moon drinks claret," connected with the idea that the wine repre
sented lunar blood. 31
637



Menstrual Blood
The Hebrew word
for blood, dam, means "mother" or "woman" in other
Indo-European languages (e.g. dam, damsel, madam, la dama, dame) and also "the curse" (damn). The Sumerian Great
Mother represented maternal blood and bore names like Dam-kina, Damgalnunna. From her belly flowed the Four Rivers of Paradise, sometimes called rivers of blood which is the "life" of all flesh. Her firstborn
child, the Savior, was Damu, a "child of the blood." 37 Damos or "mother-blood" was the word for "the
people" in matriarchal Mycenae. 58 Another common ancient symbol of the blood-river of life was
the red carpet, traditionally trod by sacred kings, heroes, and brides.' 9
Medieval romance and the courtly-love movement, later related to witch cults, were strongly influenced by the Tantric tradition, in which menstrual blood was indeed the wine of poets and sages. It is still
specified in the Left Hand Rite of Tantra that the priestess impersonating the Goddess must be menstruating, and after contact with her a
man may perform rites that will make him "a great poet, a Lord of
the World" who travels on elephant-back like a rajah. 32 In ancient societies both east and west, menstrual blood carried the
spirit of sovereign authority because it was the medium of transmis
sion of the life of clan or tribe. Among the Ashanti, girl children are still
more prized than boys because a girl is the carrier of "blood"
(mogya). The concept is also clearly defined in India, where menstrual blood is known as the Kula flower or Kula nectar, which has an
intimate connection with the life of the family. When a girl first
menstruates, she is said to have "borne the Flower." 34 The corre
sponding English word flower has the significant literal meaning of "that which flows."
The British Goddess of flowers was Blodeuwedd, a form of the
Triple Goddess associated with sacrifices of ancient kings. Welsh
legend said her whole body was made of flowers as any body was,
according to the ancient theory of body formation from the blood
"flower." Her name suggests the Blood Wedding, and myth made her
the spouse of several murdered heroes, recalling the old idea that the Goddess's divine blood had to be periodically refreshed by human
sacrifice. 35 The Bible also calls menstrual blood the flower (Leviticus
1 5:24), precursor of the "fruit" of the womb (a child). As any flower mysteriously contained its future fruit, so uterine blood was the
moon-flower supposed to contain the soul of future generations. This
was a central idea in the matrilineal concept of the clan. 36
The Chinese religion of Tao, "the Way," taught Tantric doctrines
later supplanted by patriarchal-ascetic Confucianism. Taoists said a man could become immortal (or at least long-lived) by absorbing menstrual blood, called red yin juice, from a woman's Mysterious
Gateway, otherwise known as the Grotto of the White Tiger, symbol of
life-giving female energy. Chinese sages called this red juice the
essence of Mother Earth, the yin principle that gives life to all things. They claimed the Yellow Emperor became a god by absorbing the yin juice of twelve hundred women.40
A Chinese myth said the Moon-goddess Chang-O, who controlled
menstruation, was offended by male jealousy of her powers. She left her husband, who quarreled with her because she had all the elixir of immortality, and he had none, and was resentful. She turned her back on him and went to live in the moon forever, in much the same way
that Lilith left Adam to live by herself at the "Red Sea." Chang-0 forbade men to attend Chinese moon festivals, which were afterward
celebrated by women only, at the full moon of the autumnal
equinox. 41
638



Taoist China considered red a sacred color associated with women, Menstrual Blood
blood, sexual potency, and creative power. White was the color of
men, semen, negative influences, passivity, and death.42 This was the ^^^^^^^^^^
basic Tantric idea of male and female essences: the male principle
was seen as "passive" and "quiescent"; the female principle as "active" and "creative," the reverse of later patriarchal views. 43 Female blood color alone was often considered a potent magic
charm. The Maori rendered anything sacred by coloring it red, and calling the red color menstrual blood. 44 Andaman Islanders thought
blood-red paint a powerful medicine, and painted sick people red all over in an effort to cure them. 45 Hottentots addressed their Mother
Goddess as one "who has painted thy body red"; she was divine because she never dropped or wasted menstrual blood. 46 Some African
tribes believed that menstrual blood alone, kept in a covered pot for
nine months, had the power to turn itself into a baby.47
Easter eggs, classic womb-symbols of the Goddess Eostre, were
traditionally colored red and laid on graves to strengthen the dead. This habit, common in Greece and southern Russia, might be traced all
the way back to Paleolithic graves and funeral furnishings reddened
with ochre, for a closer resemblance to the Earth Mother's womb from which the dead could be "born again." Ancient tombs everywhere have shown the bones of the dead covered with red ochre. Sometimes
everything in the tomb, including the walls, had the red color. J.D. Evans described a well tomb on Malta filled with reddened bones,
which struck fear into the workmen who insisted the bones were
covered with "fresh blood."48
A born-again ceremony from Australia showed that the Aborigines linked rebirth with the blood of the womb. The chant performed at
Ankota, the "vulva of the earth," emphasized the redness surrounding
the worshipper: "A straight track is gaping open before me. An underground hollow is gaping before me. A cavernous pathway is
gaping before me. An underground pathway is gaping before me. Red I am like the heart of a flame of fire. Red, too, is the hollow in
which I am resting." 49 Images like these help explain why some of the oldest images of the Goddess, like Kurukulla in the east and her
counterpart Cybele in the west, were associated with both caverns
and redness. 50
Greek mystics were "born again" out of the river Styx, otherwise known as Alpha, "the Beginning." This river wound seven times
through the earth's interior and emerged at a yonic shrine near the city
of Clitor (Greek kleitoris) sacred to the Great Mother. 51 Styx was the
blood-stream from the earth's vagina; its waters were credited with the
same dread powers as menstrual blood. Olympian gods swore their
absolutely binding oaths by the waters of Styx, as men on earth swore by
the blood of their mothers. Symbolic death and rebirth were linked
with baptism in the waters of Styx, as in many other sacred rivers the
world over. Jesus himself was baptized in Palestine's version of the
Styx, the river Jordan. When a man bathed seven times in this river,
639



Menstrual Blood "his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child" (2 Kings
5:14). In Greek tradition the journey to the land of death meant
^^^^^^^^^^^ crossing the Styx; in Judeo-Christian tradition it was crossing the
Jordan. This was the same "river of blood" crossed by Thomas Rhymei
on his way to Fairyland. Tantric worship of menstrual blood penetrated the Greco-Roman
world before the Christian era and was well established in the Gnostic
period. This worship provided the agape "love-feast" or "spiritual marriage" practiced by Gnostic Christians like the Ophites. Anoth
er name for the agape was synesaktism, "the Way of Shaktism,"
meaning Tantric yoni-worship. 52 Synesaktism was declared a heresy before the 7th century a.d. 53 Subsequently the "love-feast" disappearec and women were forbidden direct participation in Christian worship,
according to St. Paul's rule (1 Timothy 2:1 1-12).
Epiphanius described the agape practiced by Ophite Christians, while making it clear that these heretical sexual activities filled him
with horror:
Their women they share in common; and when anyone arrives who
might be alien to their doctrine, the men and women have a sign by
which they make themselves known to each other. When they extend
their hands, apparently in greeting, they tickle the other's palm in a certain way and so discover whether the new arrival belongs to their cult. . . . Husbands separate from their wives, and a man will say to his own
spouse, "Arise and celebrate the love feast (agape,) with thy brother. "
And the wretches mingle with each other . . . after they have consorted together in a passionate debauch The woman and the man take
the man s ejaculation into their hands, stand up . . . offering to the Fathei the Primal Being ofAll Nature, what is on their hands, with the words,
"We bring to Thee this oblation, which is the very Body of Christ. " . . . They consume it, take housel of their shame and say: "This is the
Body of Christ, the Paschal Sacrifice through which our bodies suffer
and are forced to confess to the sufferings of Christ. "And when the woman is in her period, they do likewise with her menstruation. The
unclean flow ofblood, which they garner, they take up in the same way and eat together. And that, they say, is Christ's Blood. For when they read in Revelation, "I saw the tree oflife with its twelve kinds offruit,
yielding its fruit each month "
(Rev. 22:2), they interpret this as an
allusion to the monthly incidence of the female period. M
The meaning of this Ophite sacrament to its practitioners is easily recovered from Tantric parallels. Eating the living substances of
reproduction was considered more "spiritual" than eating the dead body of the god, even in the transmuted form of bread and wine,
though the color symbolism was the same:
When the semen, made molten by the fire ofgreat passion, falls into the lotus ofthe "mother" and mixes with her red element, he achieves "the conventional mandala ofthe thought ofenlightenment.
" The
resultant mixture is tasted by the united "father-mother" [Yab- Yum],
and when it reaches the throat they can generate concretely a special bin

In the occult language of the Tantras, two ingredients of the Great Rite were sukra, semen, and rakta, menstrual blood. The officiating priestess had to be menstruous so her lunar energies were at flood tide. 56 She embodied the power of rakta, sometimes rendered rukh or
ruq, cognate with the Hebrew ruach, "spirit," and the Arabic ruh, which meant both "spirit" and "red color." Throughout all Tantric and
related faiths, the merging of female red and male white was "a
profoundly important symbolic conjunction." 57 The Sufis, who practiced their own brand of Tantrism, said ruh
was female and red. Its male counterpart sin, "consciousness," was white. Red and white colors alternated in the Sufi halka or magic circle,
corresponding to the Tantric chakra and called "the basic unit and
very heart of active Sufism." The Arab rosary of alternating red and white beads had the same meaning: men and women coupled around
the circle, as in most European folk dances. 58
Red and white were the colors worn by alternating female-and
male dancers in the witches' "fairy ring" of pagan Ireland, where the
Goddess was worshipped under the same name as the Tantric earth
mother, Tara. 59 With men and women alternating as in a Tantric chakra, the dance moved counterclockwise or moonwise, as nearly all
circle dances still do. Red and white colors "represented the fairy
world." 60
The rites were often governed by old women, due to the ancient
belief that post-menopausal women were the wisest of mortals be
cause they permanently retained their "wise blood." In the 17th century
a.d., Christian writers still insisted that old women were filled with
magic power because their menstrual blood remained in their veins.61
This was the real reason why old women were constantly persecuted for witchcraft. The same "magic blood" that made them leaders in the
ancient clan system made them objects of fear under the new
patriarchal faith. Because menstrual blood occupied a central position in matriar
chal theologies, and was already sacer holy-dreadful
patriarchal-ascetic thinkers showed almost hysterical fear of it. The
Laws of Manu said if a man even approached a menstruating woman he
would lose his wisdom, energy, sight, strength, and vitality. The Talmud said if a menstruating woman walked between two men, one of the men would surely die. 62 Brahmans ruled that a man who lay with
a menstruating woman must suffer a punishment one-quarter as severe as the punishment for Brahmanicide, which was the worst crime a
Brahman could imagine. Vedic myths were designed to support the law, jj iuch as the myth that Vishnu dared copulate with the Goddess Earth
641



Menstrual Blood while she was menstruating, which caused her to give birth to monsters
who nearly destroyed the world. 63 ^^^^^^^^^^^m This was patriarchal propaganda against the Tantric Maharutti
("Great Rite"), in which menstrual blood was the essential ingredi
ent. In Kali's cave-temple, her image spouted the blood of sacrifices
from its vaginal orifice to bathe Shiva's holy phallus while the two
deities formed the lingam-yoni, and worshippers followed suit, in an
orgy designed to support the cosmic life-force generated by union of male and female, white and red. 64 In this Great Rite, Shiva became the Anointed One, as were his many Middle-Eastern counterparts. The Greek translation of Anointed One was Christos.
Persian patriarchs followed the Brahman lead in maintaining that menstruous women must be avoided like poison. They belonged to
the devil; they were forbidden to look at the sun, to sit in water, to speal
to a man, or to behold an altar fire. 65 The glance of a menstruous
woman was feared like the glance of the Gorgon. Zoroastrians held tha
any man who lay with a menstruating woman would beget a demon, and would be punished in hell by having filth poured into his mouth. 66
Persian religion incorporated the common primitive belief that th< first onset of menses must be caused by copulation with a supernatural snake. People not yet aware of fatherhood have supposed the same
snake renders each woman fertile and helps her conceive children.67
Some such belief prevailed in Minoan Crete, where women and snake!
were sacred, but men were not. Tube-shaped Cretan vessels for
pouring oblations represented a vagina, with a serpent crawling inside.6 Ancient languages gave the serpent the same name as Eve, a name
meaning "Life"; and the most ancient myths made the primal couple not a Goddess and a God, but a Goddess and a Serpent.69 The
Goddess's womb was a garden of paradise in which the serpent lived.
Phrygian Ophiogeneis, "Snake-born People," said their first male
ancestor was the Great Serpent who dwelt in the garden of para
dise. 70 Paradise was a name of the Goddess-as-Virgin, identified with
Mother Hera (Earth), whose virgin form was Hebe, a Greek spelling
of Eve. Virgin Hera parthenogenetically conceived the oracular serpen Python, of the "Womb-temple," Delphi. 71 Snakes living in the womb of Mother Earth were supposed to possess all wisdom, being in contact with the "wise blood" of the world.
One of the secrets shared by the primordial woman and her
serpent was the secret of menstruation. Persians claimed menstrua
tion was brought into the world by the first mother, whom they called
Jahi the Whore, a Lilith-like defier of the Heavenly Father. She
began to menstruate for the first time after coupling with Ahriman, the Great Serpent. Afterward she seduced "the first righteous man," who
had previously lived alone in the garden of paradise with only the divin<
sacrificial bull for company. He knew nothing of sex until Jahi taught him. 72

The Jews borrowed many details from these Persian myths. Menstrual Blood
Rabbinical tradition said Eve began to menstruate only after she had
copulated with the serpent in Eden, and Adam was ignorant of sex until ^^^^^^^^^^^
Eve taught him. 75 It was widely believed that Eve's firstborn son Cain
was not begotten by Adam but by the serpent. 74 Beliefs connecting serpents with pregnancy and menstruation appeared throughout Europe for many centuries. Up to modern times, German peasants still held that women could be impregnated by snakes. 75
Whether initiated by a serpent or not, menstrual bleeding inspired
deadly fear among both Persian and Jewish patriarchs (Leviticus 1 5). Rachel successfully stole her father's teraphim (household gods) by hiding them under a camel saddle and sitting on it, telling her father
she was menstruating so he dared not approach her (Genesis 3 1). To this day, orthodox Jews refuse to shake hands with a woman because
she might be menstruating. Jews also adopted a rule apparently laid down by Hesiod, that a man must never wash in the same water
previously used by a woman, lest it might contain a trace of menstrual
blood. 76
There were many similar taboos. The ancient world's most dread
ed poison was the "moon-dew" collected by Thessalian witches, said to be a girl's first menstrual blood shed during an eclipse of the moon. 77 Pliny said a menstruous woman's touch could blast the fruits of the
field, sour wine, cloud mirrors, rust iron, and blunt the edges of knives. 78
If a menstruous woman so much as laid a finger on a beehive, the bees would fly away and never return. 79 If a man lay with a menstruous
woman during an eclipse, he would soon fall sick and die. 80
Christians inherited all the ancient patriarchs' superstitious horrors.
St. Jerome wrote: "Nothing is so unclean as a woman in her periods;
what she touches she causes to become unclean." Penitential regula
tions laid down in the 7th century by Theodore, Bishop of Canterbury, forbade menstruating women to take communion or even enter a church. At the French Synod of Meaux, menstruous women were specifically forbidden to come to church. From the 8th to the 11th
centuries, many church laws denied menstruating women any access
to church buildings. As late as 1684 it was still ordered that women in
their "fluxes" must remain outside the church door. 81 In 1298 the
Synod of Wiirzburg commanded men not to approach a menstruating woman. 82 The superstition came down to the 20th century, when a Scottish medical text quoted an old rhyme to the effect that menstrual
blood could destroy the entire world:
Oh! Menstruating woman, thou 'rt a fiend From which all nature should be closely screened. 83
Christian women were commanded to despise the "uncleanness" of their own bodies, as in the Rule for Anchoresses: "Art thou not
formed of foul slime? Art thou not always full of uncleanness?" 84

Menstrual Blood
Dr. Augustus Kinsley Gardner Eminent physician of the late 19th century, opponent of all forms of birth
control, which he claimed led "directly
and indisputably" to nervous diseases and debilities.
Medical authorities of the 16th century were still repeating the old belief that "demons were produced from menstrual flux." 85 One of the "demons" born of menstrual blood was the legendary basilisk with its
poisonous glance. 86 The legend evidently arose from the classic myth of the Gorgon with her serpent-hair and wise blood, petrifying men with her glance. The Gorgon and the red cross of menstrual blood once marked the most potent taboos. 87 The very word taboo, from
Polynesian tupua, "sacred, magical," applied specifically to menstrual blood. 88
Just as primitives attributed beneficial powers to menstrual blood
along with its fearfulness, so medieval peasants thought it could heal,
nourish, and fertilize. 89 Some believed a menstruating woman could
protect a crop by walking around the field, or exposing her genitals in it. 90 Peasant women carried seed to the fields in rags stained with their
menstrual blood: a continuation of the custom of Eleusinian fertility
priestesses. 91 Even doctors thought menstrual blood could cure leprosy,
or act as a powerful aphrodisiac. Madame de Montespan used it to encourage the ardor of her royal lover, Louis XIV. 92 Gypsies said a woman could win any man's love with a potion of her own menstrual blood. 93
As the former medium of reincarnation, menstrual blood was
sometimes called a remedy for death itself. In the tale of Childe Roland,
the elven-king roused men from the magic sleep of death with a "bright
red liquor." 94 Early romances associated this universal heal-all with "the
blood of a noble virgin," as a wise-woman revealed to Galahad.95 The
same belief impelled Louis XI to try to stave off death by drinking
young girls' blood. Victorian superstition taught that a child conceived during a menstrual period would be born with a caul, and would have occult
powers.96 Nineteenth-century doctors inherited their predecessors' notions of witchcraft and evil, and so maintained that menstruating
women are not healthy; copulation with them could infect a man with
urethritis or gonorrhea. Dr. Augustus Gardner said venereal diseases were usually communicated from women to men, not vice versa. 97
Speaking of savages' menstrual taboos, anthropologists described the women as "out of order," "suffering from monthly illness," or "stricken with the malady common to their sex." 98 A doctor wrote even in the
present century: "We cannot too emphatically urge the importance of
regarding these monthly returns as periods of ill health, as days when
the ordinary occupations are to be suspended or modified." 99 At the present time just as in the Middle Ages, the Catholic church
still considers itself on firm theological ground by advancing, as an
argument against ordination of women, the notion that a menstruating
priestess would "pollute" the altar. This would not preclude ordination
of post-menopausal women, but different excuses are found for those. The holy "blood of life" used to be feminine and real; now it is masculine and symbolic.

Menstrual Calendar
Two conflicting calendars were used through most of the Christian
era in Europe: the church's official, solar, "Julian" calendar, and the
peasants' unofficial, lunar, Goddess-given menstrual calendar. The thirteen annual lunations of the latter produced one of the contrasting
answers to the nursery-rhyme riddle: "How many months be in the
year? There be thirteen, I say." Christians produced another answer: "There be but twelve, I say." The lunar calendar's thirteen 28-day
months had four 7-day weeks apiece, marking new, waxing, full, and waning moon-sabbaths in the ancient form. Weeks are still lunar, but
they no longer fit neatly into the solar month system. Thirteen lunar
months gave 364 days per year (1 3 X 28), with one extra day to
make 365. Nursery rhymes, fairy tales, witch charms, ballads and other repositories of pagan tradition nearly always describe the full annual
cycle as "a year and a day." It has been shown that calendar consciousness developed first in
women, because of their natural menstrual body calendar, correlated with observations of the moon's phases. Chinese women established a
lunar calendar 3000 years ago, dividing the celestial sphere into 28 stellar "mansions" through which the moon passed. Among the
Maya of central America, every woman knew "the great Maya calendar had first been based on her menstrual cycles."
* Romans called the
645



Menstrual Calendar calculation of time mensuration, i.e., knowledge of the menses. Gaelic words for "menstruation" and "calendar" are the same: miosach and ^^^^^^^^^^^ miosachan. The new-moon sabbaths of ancient Latium were kalends,
possibly related to the Aryan name of Kali. For fear of disrupting the
Goddess's transitions, activities of some kinds were forbidden on the
seventh day of each lunar phase; thus sabbaths became "unlucky" or taboo. Because it was the time-honored custom, even the biblical God
was forced to "rest" on the seventh day.
One of the prototypes of Yahweh was the Babylonian god Marduk, who divided the maternal "waters" into those above and below the firmament (Genesis 1:7). Marduk claimed to be the creator, but was not yet so patriarchal as to abandon his Mother's lunar calendar.
Babylonian priests said Marduk established holy days and seasons by the moon. 2 Yet older traditions said the menstrual calendar was instituted
in Babylon by the god Nabu-Rimmani, the biblical Baal-Rimmon, a phallic deity united with the Great Mother's yoni in the form of a
pomegranate. 3 The Chinese explained their menstrual calendar with the myth of
the holy calendar plant, lik-kiep, on which a pod grew every day for 14 days, then a pod fell off every day for 14 days. When the months be
came confused by solar reckoning, the Chinese added extra days when "a pod withered without falling off." 4 According to another story, the menstrual calendar was called Hsiu, "Houses." The Moon Mother rested each night of the lunar month in a different one of her 28 houses, which were kept by the 28
warrior-hero consorts she had placed in heaven to attend her. 5
The ancient Hebrews took their calendar from Chaldea, legendary home of Abraham, whose older name was Ab-sin, "Moon-father." 6 Chaldeans were credited with the invention of astrology, now largely based on the movements of the sun; but the Chaldeans didn't study
the sun. They were "Moon-worshippers," believing the moon determined the fates of men by her movements through various "houses"
of the zodiac. The same lunar myths were found in Egypt, northern
Europe, Greece, and Rome. Latin kings were sacrificed at the three
day dark of the moon period called ides, to insure the Goddess's safe
return from the underworld. Greeks similarly made offerings at the Great Sabbath called Noumenia (New Moon). The other Great Sabbath was Dichomenia (Full Moon), when the Goddess stood at the
peak of her cycle. 7
Early attempts at calendar reform left Greek city-states quarreling among themselves about sabbaths and intercalary days. Aristophanes's The Clouds makes the Moon-goddess complain that her
reckoning of the days was not being correctly followed. 8 Time-spans in myths became confused. Adonis was born after "ten months' gesta
tion," which really meant ten lunar months, the normal 280 days.9
According to the Book of Maccabees, every gestation lasted ten months. 10 This wasn't ignorance; it was just lunar reckoning.
646



LEven
the saints' days of the medieval church were established by Menstrual Calendar
enology, literally "knowledge of the moon." The church's so-called movable feasts were movable because they were determined by lunar ^^^^^^^^^^^
cycles, not solar ones; thus they drifted erratically through the months of the canonical calendar. The most important of them, Easter, is still
determined by the moon (first Sunday after the first full moon after
the spring equinox), at a time when the Goddess slew and re-conceived the Savior or vegetation god for a new season. 11
More confusion was created by the fact that menstrual calendars
reckoned the day from noon to noon, with the midnight hour in the
central position; but solar calendars reckoned the day from midnight to
midnight. The Saxon word den (day) really meant "night." In
Shakespeare's time, people said goodnight by wishing each other good
den, literally good moon-day. Old French nursery rhymes greeted the moon rising in the evening with "Good morning, Madame
Moon." n The meridian or high point of noon used to indicate the full moon overhead at midnight: hence its name Meri-Dia or Mary
Diana, the Moon-goddess. Superstitious folk talked of the daemonium meridianum, devil of the meridian, a diabolization of the
Goddess. 13 She was probably the second of the Slavic trinity of Fates
(Zorya), called "She of the Evening, She of Midnight, and She of Morning," in that order. 14
Pagans held their festivals at night, by moonlight: a custom that
might be traced as far back as ancient Egypt, where major religious ceremonies were nocturnal, as listed in the Book of the Dead:
The night of the battle and ofthe overthrow ofthe Sebau-Beld in Tattu . . . , the night ofwaking to stand up the double Tet in Sekhem . . . , the
night ofestablishing Horus in the heritage ofthe things ofhis father in Rekhti . . . , the night when Isis maketh lamentation at the side ofher
brother Osiris in Abtu . . . , the night ofthe Haker festival when a division is made between the dead and the spirits who are on the path of the dead . . . , the night ofthe judgment of those who are to be annihilated at the
great festival ofthe ploughing and the turning up ofthe earth. ls
Pre-Christian Europe also gave night precedence over day. Germanic tribes, Celts, Gauls, druids, the ancient Irish calculated
"months, years, and birthdays in such a way as to make the night precede the day." 16 Caesar noted that the Celts measured time by
nights instead of by days. 17 Christian holy days were copied from pagan ones, displaced by 12 hours in their solar reckoning; therefore the older, heathen version of
each festival was celebrated on the "Eve" of its Christian counterpart.
From this arose the so-called devilish rites of May Eve, Midsummer Eve, Lammas Eve, All Hallow's Eve, and Christmas Eve which was
taken from the pagan Yule, and to a late date was still called the
Night of the Mother. 18 Witch persecutors pretended the witches copied their sabbats from
Christian feast days in deliberate mockery of the church; but in fact
647



Menstrual Calendar the copying had gone in the other direction. The church took over the
pagan feasts of Halloween, May Day, Lammas, Imbolg, Midsum^^^^^^^^^^^ mer, Easter, Yule, and so on, then claimed to have invented them.
However, of the two rival festivals on the same day, the Christian one was invariably the newcomer. 19
May Eve was the Saxons' Walpurgisnacht, the Celts' Beltain, announcing the opening of the Merry Month of sexual license and
"wearing of the green" in honor of the earth's new spring garment. The occasion was still marked by pagan ceremonies in the late 16th
century. 20 (See May.) Midsummer Eve merged with St. John's Day, but the solstitial rites remained more pagan than Christian. Lammas Eve was a witches' Great Sabbat because it was formerly the pagan Feast of Bread (Hlaf-mass) in honor of the Corn-mother. 21 Halloween was All Hallows' or All Souls' eve, from the Celtic Samhain or
Feast of the Dead, when pagan ancestors came forth from their fairy
mounds, and Christians called them "demons" who attended the witches' feasts. 22
The thirteen months of the menstrual calendar also led to
pagan reverence for the number 13, and Christian detestation of it. Witches' "covens" were supposed to be groups of 1 3 like the moon
worshipping dancers of the Moorish zabat (sabbat), to whom thirteen
expressed the three-in-one nature of the lunar Goddess. 23 Some said thirteen was a bad number because Christ was the
thirteenth in the group of apostles, thus the thirteenth member of any
group would be condemned to death. Actually, it was the church's
opposition to pagan symbolism that brought opprobrium on the number 1 3. Some even feared to speak its true name, and it was
euphemized as a "baker's dozen," or sometimes "devil's dozen." 24
The heathen tradition persisted in such symbols as the Thirteen
Treasures of Britain, probably lunar-month signs taken from a primi
tive list of zodiacal constellations. They were defined as a sword, basket,
drinking horn, chariot, halter, knife, cauldron, whetstone, garment, pan, platter, chessboard, and mantle. 25 The thirteen menstrual months were symbolized in the Tarxien temple on Malta as a sow with 1 3 teats, like the Celts' Sow-goddess Cerridwen. 26 Thirteen "moons" of the menstrual calendar were suggested also by the English Twelfth
Night custom of kindling twelve small fires and one large one, to
represent the moon of the New Year. 27
In general, the symbols of ancient matriarchy came to be known as night, the moon, and the number 13, while those of patriarchy were day, the sun, and the number 12.

Merlin
Druidic wizard associated with the fairy-religion, later thinly Chris
tianized as the resident wise-man of King Arthur's court. Old Welsh
traditions called Merlin a "wild man of the woods" with prophetic or
shamanistic skills; he was named either Lailoken or Myrrdin. Geoffrey
of Monmouth said Merlin's earlier name was Ambrosius, associating him with the female-symbolic "ambrosia" given by the Fairy Queen to her chosen bards and magicians. 1 In medieval falconry, a merlin was a kind of hawk that could be flown only by a lady. 2
Merlin learned all his magic from the Goddess, in the guise of
Morgan le Fay, or Viviane (She Who Lives), or the Lady of the Lake. At the end of his life she took him back into her magic cave and
wrapped him in deathless sleep until his Second Coming. Here she
was called Nimue, or Fate, the same as the Moon-goddess Diana Nemorensis, or the Nemesis of the Greeks. Pagan Britons believed Merlin would return from his enchanted sleep to announce the coming
of a new age of peace and fertility. Christian writers however made Merlin a child of the powers of
650



[hell. According to Robert de Borron, Merlin was deliberately conceived to become Antichrist; he was fathered on a virgin by a devil. He possessed a benevolent nature because of his mother's goodness,
which prevailed over his demonic nature.
When King Vortigern's temple was being built on Salisbury Plain, Ithe structure persisted in falling down because so the astrologers jsaid its foundations needed the blood of a child who had no human
jfather. Young Merlin fitted the description and was brought to be isacrificed; but his magical X-ray vision discovered the real cause of the
trouble. A red and a white dragon were fighting in a mystic pool
under the temple's foundations. Merlin prophesied from this that
iVortigern, the Welsh red dragon, would be slain by Uther Pendrag
pn, the British white dragon; and it so happened. Afterward, Merlin built Stonehenge by himself, in one night calling all its massive stones from Ireland with his magic songs. 3
Merlin was also an artisan and a smith. He forged King Arthur's
magic armor and a wonderful cup identified with the Holy Grail. He
built the palace at Camelot. 4 He made the Round Table, symbol of the
pagan lunar calendar. The first tally of its knights made up the
(moon's number, 28. 5 The Round Table seems to have been derived from the sacred
mensa, calendar-table, of Vesta. Petronius said it was a Round Table
with the Goddess's image in its center. It represented the earth, which
t Anaximenes described as "like a Table in form." Plato's Symposium
said the table stood for Mother Earth because "besides feeding us it is
round in shape, it is fixed, and very suitably it has been given by some i me name of Hestia." 6
Merlin's secret cave was located either in the Breton fairy-wood of
Broceliande, or in the British druidic shrine of Mount Ambrosius.
Some said this was Chislehurst, a chalk cliff honeycombed with caves, ||ong occupied by a college of druidesses. 7 Merlin was associated with
:he druidic Goddess under many of her names: Morgan, Viviane,
[Nimue, Fairy Queen, Lady of the Lake the Celtic Water-goddess
Muirgen, often called boine clergesse (the Good Priestess). Because VIerlin was clearly connected with Goddess worship and the mass of
Merlin literature was for centuries a vehicle for criticism of the church,
in the 16th century the Council of Trent placed the Book of Merlin's
[Predictions on the Index of Prohibited Books. 8

Mesmerism
When Mesmer excited popular interest with his new cult of "animal
magnetism" and began performing miraculous cures, the Vatican approved it in 1840. Then in 1847 it was discovered that "mesmer
ized" people tended to have religious experiences, and to claim powers of clairvoyance and prophecy. Therefore the church declared hereti
cal "those who profess to see things which are invisible ... or apply
purely physical principles to things which are in reality supernatural." Finally in 1856 an encyclical letter warned the clergy that mesmerism
was a dangerous "error." ' It was a good example of the church's
refusal to admit any source of spiritual illumination or mythic imagery
other than its own.

Messiah
Persian title of the Anointed One (Greek Christos) supposed to come to earth just before doomsday; based on the Kalki Avatara, final
incarnation of Buddha, due to appear in time to save the virtuous,
before destruction of this universe. 1
Persians sometimes identified the Messiah with the virgin-born
prophet Zoroaster, who would return as his own reincarnation or "son" just before the final battle of the God of Light and the God of Darkness (Ahura Mazda and Ahriman). 2 The Jews called the Messiah "Mashiach," and identified him with
Elijah. Passover ceremonies required four cups of wine, one left
untasted. This was the Cup of Elijah which would be mysteriously drained before the Second Coming. During the Middle Ages, the
hopes of oppressed Jewry were raised from time to time by a report that
someone's Cup of Elijah had been emptied by a miracle. 3 The Talmud spoke of two Messiahs; Messiah ben David and
Messiah ben Joseph. For this reason, Christian genealogies tried to
make Jesus both of them at once, through his mother Mary of the house
of David, and through his father Joseph. Some versions of the
Gospels said Joseph was Jesus's natural father, other versions said he war

Metis
'Wisdom," mythical mother of Athene, assimilated to the Zeus cult by the claim that Zeus impregnated her, then swallowed her, so her
wisdom-principle became part of himself. Thus he was able to give irth to Metis's child Athene from his own head. Older versions of the
nyth show that Metis was really Medusa, whose Gorgon face and ;nake hair symbolized Female Wisdom. Athene was the virgin form of he same Goddess, born not from Zeus's head but from the triple
Gorgon in the land of Libyan Amazons, who worshipped Medusa
vletis as the Mother of Fate. 1 A later, Gnostic-Christian version of :he same Goddess was Sophia, whose name also meant "Wisdom."

Vtezuzah
ewish door-charm, supposed to protect the house from entry by evil spirits. Originally, an imitation of Egyptian door-charms known as
'illars of Horus: small tablets engraved with hieroglyphic spells to
epel evil spirits.
1 Touching or kissing the door-charm when passing :hrough dates back to the Hindu custom of touching the yoni of the
Joor-post Kali-figure "for luck," when entering her temple. 2 Similar obscene" yonic door-charms were used in early Irish churches; see

Michael, Saint
udeo-Christian archangel who inherited the myths and attributes of
Hermes and Heimdall, including the trumpet of the Last Trump and
653



Mictecaciuatl the two sacred Mounts of Mercury on either side of the English
Midwifery Channel, now known as Michael's Mounts (in France, Mont St.
^^^^^^^^^^^ Michel).
Michael was said to have been the leader of God's angelic army
during the War in Heaven, and God delegated to Michael the divine "words of power" that would defeat the rebellious troops and propel them down to the underworld. 1 Michael-the-Warrior was a favorite
subject of Christian artists, who usually showed him in golden armor,
with a long spear.
l.Legge 1,169.
Mictecaciuatl
"Lady of the Place of the Dead," eponymous Mother Goddess of
Mexico. Very similar to Kali, she represented the earth's yonic hole from which all things were born, and she was shown also in the
trappings of death, thrusting a corpse into the earth. 1 See Kali Ma.

Midas
Ass-eared king of Phrygia, credited with the Golden Touch that later
passed into the lore of alchemy as a magical ability to turn base metals
into gold. Hellenic myths made fun of his ears, evidently shown on icons because they were once a sign of divine power, as in the cult of Ass-eared Set. See Ass.
Middle-Earth
Scandinavian Midgard, the world of men, located between the spiritworlds above and below. Old Norse gard meant earth, place, home: the
modern yard. 1 Like all ancient people, the Scandinavians regarded
their own land as the geographical center of the universe. See
Omphalos.

Midwifery
From Anglo-Saxon med-wyf, "wise-woman" or "witch." Even in the Christian era, priestesses of the Great Mother maintained their monop
oly of obstetrics, for most men were afraid of the taboo mysteries of birth. The Bible declared a new mother sacer or untouchable for as long
as 66 days after giving birth (Leviticus 12:5); and by canon law, a mother was not allowed to enter a church until 40 days after childbed.
654



For the first half of the Christian era, the arts of medicine Midwifery temained almost exclusively in the hands of "wise-women" because indent healing shrines had been devoted almost exclusively to the ^_^^^_^___
goddess's priestesses. 1 In ancient Egypt, midwifery was the province
>f Sevenfold Hathor who gave each infant its seven souls. The Malayan
Semai still say all midwives are holy, partaking of the spirit of the First Vlidwife who lives in the highest of the seven heavens, each one of
vhich is ruled by one of the Seven Celestial Midwives, identical with
he Hathors. An earthly midwife is a sort of fairy godmother, with a
piritual tie to each child she brings into the world. 2
Mexican peasants attribute similar powers to the recibidora who
ombines the functions of obstetrician, godmother, priestess, and
vitch. She performs complicated knot-magic in binding and tying the imbilical cord and casts spells for the future fate of the newborn. 3
Pagan Rome recognized several kinds of midwives, who received ;eparate offerings after a successful birth. There was the obstetrix vho performed the delivery; the nutrix or "nurturer" who encouraged
[he mother's milk and taught techniques of nursing; and the ceraria, jxiestess of Ceres charged with birth rituals. 4 All were connected with [he women's temple, like the Greek Horae who were temple-women pn earth and ascended to heaven as midwives to the gods.
Medieval Christianity detested midwives for their connections with
Dagan matriarchy and Goddess-worship. Churchmen viewed them as mplacable enemies of the Catholic faith. Handbooks of the Inquisition
irtated: "No one does more harm to the Catholic faith than mid
lives," because they invariably offered newborn children to the service
)f the devil with a magical baptism by the kitchen fire. 5 The real
reason for ecclesiastical hostility seems to have been the notion that
midwives could help women control their own fate, learn secrets of
;ex and birth control, or procure abortions. The pagan women of antiquity had considerable knowledge of such matters, which were
:onsidered women's own business, not subject to male authority.6
Patriarchal religion however forbade midwives to assist their patients
n preventing conception, relieving themselves of unwanted pregnan
es, or easing their birth-pangs. In 1 591 a Scottish noblewoman, Eufame Macalyne, was burned
alive for asking a witch-midwife for drugs to ease her labor pains. 7
Parliamentary Articles of Enquiry in 1559 ordered churchwardens to
jreport any use of "charms, sorcery, enchantments, invocations,
circles, witchcrafts, soothsaying," or any like procedures "especially in khe time of women's travails." 8
Some charms and sorceries were allowed as long as they were of
the Christian variety: that is, with Christian names substituted for
pagan ones in the formulae. Women in childbed were officially advised
ito bind around their thighs a long charm in Latin, beginning In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus SanctiAmen, followed by invocations
of saints and secret names of God. If the names were not Christian,
655



Midwifery however, the charm was devilish. An episcopal injunction of 1 5 54 said midwives must not "use or exercise any witchcraft, charms, sorcery, ^^^^^^^^^^^^ invocations, or prayers other than such as be allowable and may stand
with the laws and ordinances of the Catholic church." 9
Christianity's official view was that to relieve women's sufferings in
any aspect of reproduction was to oppose God's will in the matter of the curse on Eve. God decreed that she and all her female descendants
must bring forth children with "sorrow" (pain). Consequently, up to
the beginning of the 20th century, doctors refused to consider treatment
of the major cause of women's deaths, childbed (puerperal) fever. The clergy held such deaths to be either a just reward for an immoral
life, or the expression of God's continuing judgment on "the sex." I0
When James Simpson proposed to relieve women's labor pains with the newly discovered anesthetics, chloroform and ether, there
was a great outcry from the clergy, who called it a sinful denial of God's
wishes. According to Scottish clergymen, to relieve labor pains would
be "vitiating the primal curse against woman." n A New England minister wrote: "Chloroform is a decoy of Satan, apparently offering
itself to bless women; but in the end it will harden society and rob God
of the deep earnest cries which arise in time of trouble, for help." 12
With the usual half-concealed sadism of patriarchal morality, he was
really saying that female screams of pain gave God pleasure, and men must see to it that God was not deprived of this.
The matter was resolved when Queen Victoria allowed her doctor
to give her chloroform during delivery of her eighth child, and
publicly hailed the new pain-reliever as a great blessing. All at once the clergymen were silenced, in effect conceding to the Queen the right to overrule God. 13
Toward the end of the 19th century, male doctors moved in on
the last remaining area of exclusively female medicine, and took the midwifery-trade away from women. At the instigation of the American
Medical Association, the U.S. Congress outlawed midwives, and the new male "obstetricians" replaced them. Frequently, an elder midwife
found herself out of work, or even in jail for illegal practice, in a
community most of whose members she had brought into the world! 14
The effects of the new male professionalism were not always
beneficial:
Our mechanized civilization, in the interest ofa speedy delivery, at the
convenience, even at the timed participation ofthe physician, often endangered mother and child with impatient interference in the natural
process, and too often compounded this mistake by anesthetizing the mother completely. All too soon, as a result ofscientific pride over
inventing a formula for feeding independent ofthe natural source of milk, the child was parted from its mother and deprived not only of mother's milk, but ofthe experience ofa warm, loving, commensal relationship with her, the kind we must have also with Mother Earth. ,s
The male-dominated medical profession not only took up delivering
656



Lvomen's babies, but even presumed to teach women how to "mother" Milky Way i:hem which often led to terrible mistakes like the tum-of-the-century
minimal-handling theory, which assumed that crying children must not ^^^^^^^^^^^
3e "spoiled" by cuddling them but should be picked up only at predetermined infrequent intervals. Perhaps the ultimate hubris was attained by L.K. Frank who wrote: "The psychiatrist is uniquely
Competent to tell us how to practice the Christian injunction to love little children." 16 Here is modern "education" ignorant of the histori
cal truth that the very existence of the human race depended for
bountless thousands of years long before either Christianity or
psychiatry were heard of on the unique ability of mothers to love little Ichildren and of "wise-women" to assist the instincts of motherhood.

Milky Way
The Milky Way is our galaxy, from the Greek gala, "mother's milk."
The ancients believed this heavenly star-stream issued from the breasts
pf the Queen of Heaven. 1 Worshippers of Argive Hera said the stars
were made of milk from Hera's Moon-Cow incarnation. Ionians said the stars came from the udder of their own Moon-Cow, Io, "the Moon." 2 Others said the Moon-Cow was Europa, consort of Zeus as a
totemic white bull. All white Moon-Cows were the same Goddess, known from India to Scandinavia as the nourisher of the world and the
mother of the star-spirits.
3 See Cow. The Four Rivers of Paradise were supposed to pour from the four
(teats of the Moon-Cow's udder. Norsemen said these rivers came from the udder of Audumla, the Nourisher, a divine cow who existed
before any other creature. 4 She was identified with Mana, the Moon
Mother. Scandinavian mythology knew the Milky Way as Manavegr,
"Moon-Way." 5 To the Celts, it was Bothar-bo finne, Track of the White Cow.6 The primordial white cow whose udder produced the star-rivers was almost certainly the same cow who "jumped over the moon" in the nursery rhyme, because she was shown hovering over the
moon in pre-Christian icons. Akkadians called the Milky Way River-of-the-Divine-Lady, or Hiddagal, the Great River, which the Bible rendered Hiddekel
(Genesis 2:14). Arabians called the Milky Way Umm alSama, Mother
of the Sky. 7 Egyptians called the Milky Way the "Nile in the Sky,"
which poured from the udder of the Moon-Cow, Hathor-Isis, who thus
gave rain to the rest of the world, though she reserved her "true
Nile" for Egypt.
Classic mythology made the galactic mother Gala-Tea, "Milk
Goddess," a white statue of Aphrodite carved by her priest-consort

from the breasts of Rhea when she suckled Zeus.9 Names differed,
but everywhere the Milky Way was regarded as the Goddess's star-milk, which formed curds to create worlds and creatures.
The Rabelaisian statement that the moon is made of green cheese
dates back to old legends of the moon's creation as a ball of cheese
curdled from the Milky Way. 10 Sometimes it was the earth that was made of green cheese from the Goddess's milk. The Bible copied a former address to the Goddess: "Hast thou not poured me out as milk,
and curdled me like cheese?" (Job 10:10).
Anglo-Saxon names for the Milky Way suggested that it was not only a river but also a main street of heaven. It was called Irmin's
Way, Waetlinga Straet, Vaelinga, Vaetlinga, or Watlingastrete, Wadlyn Street, and Watling Street. 11

Mirror
The ancients attributed mystic powers to any reflective surface, solid
or liquid, because the reflection was considered part of the soul. Heavy
taboos were laid on the act of disturbing water into which a person
was gazing, because shattering the image meant danger to the soul. Hence the similar taboo on breaking a mirror, now said to bring
seven years' bad luck.
Damage to the reflection-soul was the real basis of the myth of
Narcissus, usually misinterpreted as a fable of excessive self-love. Narcissus couldn't bear to leave the reflection of his beautiful face in th<
magic pool of the nymph Echo, and so he pined away and died, and turned into a flower on the bank. Echo also pined until nothing
remained of her but a voice. Actually, Echo was the Goddess of
death-by-water, who lay in wait to seize one's reflection-soul, according to beliefs still current among Africans and Melanesians. 1 Narcissus
was another name of the sacrificed springtime-flower hero also called
Antheus, Adonis, Hyacinthus, or Dionysus, who died at the May
Day Heroantheia (Hero-flowering) in Crete, Mycenae, and Lacedaemon. 2
A mirror meant the god's death in the Pelasgian myth of Dionysus The Titans trapped his soul in a mirror, as the soul of Narcissus was
trapped in reflective water. Then Dionysus was torn to pieces in the rite
of the omophagy (see Cannibalism). Many centuries later, the gypsies repeated a tale of Dionysus transformed into the Enchanted or
Accursed Hunter, whose soul was trapped in a mirror by a "witch"
Mara, the same as the Hindu death-spirit Mara. 3 Among Slavic gypsies,
Mara or Mora was a destroying Fate-goddess who rode the night winds and "drank the blood of men."4
The tragically deceased Narcissus was taken into the Christian
canon as a saint, said to have been a "bishop" of Jerusalem in the first
century (when there were no bishops of Jerusalem). Instead of dying like his ephebic namesake at the pinnacle of youth and beauty, St.
Narcissus lived to be 116 years old. 5 He was one of the pseudosaints
whose legend was supposed to convince the pagans that the Christian
faith could grant the gift of longevity. Mirrors were connected with death in many Christian supersti- i
tions. Demons, werewolves, vampires, and such "soulless" creatures
showed no reflection in a mirror. Many Europeans still turn mirrors to
the wall after a death in the house, in the belief that mirrors trap the
souls of the living or detain the souls of the dead on their journey.6
Some say one who looks in a mirror in a house of death will see not
660



his own face but the face of the deceased. 7 Pope John XXII had an Mistletoe
inordinate fear of mirrors; he claimed wizards sent devils to attack
him through mirrors.8 ^^^
The so-called witch's mirror could be made of polished stone, a
sheet of metal, a crystal, or a bowl of water or ink. Water represented
the Abyss, the numinous hidden spirit world; its reflections therefore could be read as shadows cast ahead by future events. In fairy tales,
the land of souls often appeared as a hall of mirrors.9
Cabalists professed to read the will of the seven planetary spirits in
seven mirrors, each made of the appropriate metal for its day, its
deity, and its subject matter. Questions about the great folk of the earth were addressed to a golden mirror on Sun-day. Dreams and mystic
enlightenment were observed on Monday (Moon-day) with a mirror of silver. Enmities and lawsuits were resolved on Tuesday with a Mars
mirror of iron. A Mercury mirror of quicksilver in glass was consulted on Wednesday about money matters. A Jupiter mirror of tin was
questioned on Thursday about worldly successes. Questions of love were resolved on Friday with a Venus mirror of copper. Lost articles
and secrets could be discovered on Saturday by a Saturn mirror of
lead. 10
The esoteric meaning of the mirror was explained long ago by Plotinus, who connected it with the Hindu concept of Maya, crea
tress of the "reflections" of spiritual reality in the mirror of the material
world. "Matter serves as a mirror upon which the Universal Soul
projects the images or reflections of its creations, and thus gives rise to
the phenomena of the sensible universe." n
Oriental mystics were close to the conclusion that the Universal
Soul really meant one's own soul, where reality was perceived as in a
mirror, darkly. A Buddhist aphorism said: "All existence is like a
reflection in a mirror, without substance, only a phantom of the mind. When the finite mind acts, then all kinds of things arise; when the
finite mind ceases to act, then all kinds of things cease." 12 In other
words, the world exists only for those who live and perceive it. This was
an idea that Western philosophers played with endlessly, even to the
logical but irrational idea that if there were no intelligent beings to
perceive it, the universe would not exist at all.

Mistletoe
Mistletoe was the Golden Bough that gave access to the underworld,
according to pagan belief. The gold color of dry mistletoe was seen as a
symbol of apotheosis, as was gold metal. The living plant was viewed as the genitalia of the oak god, Zeus or Jupiter or Dianus of Dodona,
661



Mistletoe consort of the Moon-mother Diana Nemetona, Lady of the Grove.
At the season of sacrifice, druidic priests ceremonially castrated the oak
^^^^^^^^^^^ god by cutting off his mistletoe with a golden moon-sickle, catching it
in a white cloth before it could touch the ground, so it remained like
every sacrificial deity "between heaven and earth." '
The phallic significance of mistletoe probably stemmed from the
notion that its whitish berries were semen-drops, as the red berries of
its feminine counterpart, holly, were equated with the Goddess's men
strual blood. Among Indo-European peoples generally, castration of the god was customary before his immolation.
Sacred-oak cults continued throughout the Christian era. In the
8th century a.d., the Hessians worshipped the oak god at Geismar
and gave hjs holy tree the name of Jove (Jupiter). As late as 1874, an ancient oak-tree shrine in Russia was worshipped by a congregation led
by an Orthodox priest. Wax candles were affixed to the tree, and the
celebrants prayed, "Holy Oak Hallelujah, pray for us." A drunken orgy ensued. 2 Modern customs of kissing under the mistletoe are pale
shadows of the sexual orgies that once accompanied the rites of the
oak god. To Nordic pagans, mistletoe symbolized the death of the savior
god Balder, son of Odin, whose Second Coming was expected after doomsday, when he would return to earth to establish the new creation.
Balder was slain by a spear of mistletoe wielded by Hod, the Blind
God, another name for Odin himself. Or, some said Hod was Balder's
dark twin, corresponding to the light-and-dark year-gods Set and Horus in Egypt. 3
Some derive the Saxon mis-el-tu from Mas, the Sanskrit "Messi
ah" (Vishnu), and tal, a pit, metaphorically the earth's womb. Thus it stood for the god's entry into his Mother-bride. Norsemen's word for
mistletoe was Guidhel, the same "guide to hell" as Virgil's Golden
Bough. 4 After they were converted to Christianity, Saxons claimed the mistletoe was "the forbidden tree in the middle of the trees of Eden,"
i.e., the Tree of Knowledge, which was Ropularly supposed to have furnished the wood for Jesus's cross. 5
The phallic meaning of the mistletoe made it the "key" that
opened the underworld womb, key and phallus being interchangeable in mystical writings. Some treatises said, "All locks are opened by the herb Missell toe." Combined with the "feminine" herb Alcyone,
it "makes a man do often the act of generation."6
The pagan's interpretations of mistletoe were still understood in Renaissance times, when it was adopted as an emblem of the new
Messiah and "carried to the high altar" of English churches on
Christmas Eve. But some Christian writers insisted that the mistletoe
"never entered those sacred edifices but by mistake, or ignorance of the
662



jjxtons; for it was the heathenish and profane plant, as having been of Mithra bch distinction in the pagan rites of Druidism."7

Aithra
j'ersian savior, whose cult was the leading rival of Christianity in
lome, and more successful than Christianity for the first four centuries
If the "Christian" era. In 307 a.d. the emperor officially designated
Mithra "Protector of the Empire." l
Christians copied many details of the Mithraic mystery-religion,
xplaining the resemblance later with their favorite argument, that
le devil had anticipated the true faith by imitating it before Christ's irth. Some resemblances between Christianity and Mithraism were
3 close that even St. Augustine declared the priests of Mithra wor
lipped the same deity as he did. 2
Mithra was born on the 25th of December, called "Birthday of the
le Unconquered Sun," which was finally taken over by Christians in
le 4th century a.d. as the birthday of Christ. 3 Some said Mithra sprang
om an incestuous union between the sun god and his own mother, ist as Jesus, who was God, was born of the Mother of God. Some laimed Mithra's mother was a mortal virgin. Others said Mithra had
o mother, but was miraculously born of a female Rock, the petra
enetrix, fertilized by the Heavenly Father's phallic lightning.4 Mithra's birth was witnessed by shepherds and by Magi who
jrought gifts to his sacred birth-cave of the Rock. 5 Mithra performed
ne usual assortment of miracles: raising the dead, healing the sick,
laking the blind see and the lame walk, casting out devils. As a
leter, son of the petra, he carried the keys of the kingdom of heaven
lee Peter, Saint).6 His triumph and ascension to heaven were
deb rated at the spring equinox (Easter), when the sun rises toward its
pogee. Before returning to heaven, Mithra celebrated a Last Supper with
is twelve disciples, who represented the twelve signs of the zodiac,
i memory of this, his worshippers partook of a sacramental meal of read marked with a cross. 7 This was one of seven Mithraic sacra
lents, the models for the Christians' seven sacraments. 8 It was called
lizd, Latin missa, English mass. Mithra's image was buried in a rock
>mb, the same sacred cave that represented his Mother's womb. He
'as withdrawn from it and said to live again.9 Like early Christianity, Mithraism was an ascetic, anti-female
iligion. Its priesthood consisted of celibate men only. 10 Women
-ere forbidden to enter Mithraic temples. 11 The women of Mithraic
663



Mithra families had nothing to do with the men's cult, but attended services
of the Great Mother in their own temples of Isis, Diana, or Juno. 12 mm^^^^mmg^l^m To eliminate the female principle from their creation myth,
Mithraists replaced the Mother of All Living in the primal garden of
paradise (Pairidaeza) with the bull named Sole-Created. Instead of Eve
this bull was the partner of the first man. All creatures were born
from the bull's blood. Yet the bull's birth-giving was oddly female
imitative. The animal was castrated and sacrificed, and its blood was
delivered to the moon for magical fructification, the moon being the source of women's magic lunar "blood of life" that produced real children on earth. 13
Persians have been called the Puritans of the heathen world. The]
developed Mithraism out of an earlier Aryan religion that was not so puritanical or so exclusively male-oriented. 14 Mithra seems to have bee
the Indo-Iranian sun god Mitra, or Mitravaruna, one of the the twelve zodiacal sons of the Infinity-goddess Aditi. Another of Aditi's
sons was Aryaman, eponymous ancestor of "Aryans," whom the Persians transformed into Ahriman, the Great Serpent of Darkness, Mithra's enemy. 15
Early on, there seems to have been a feminine Mithra. Herodotus said the Persians used to have a sky-goddess Mitra, the same as
Mylitta, Assyria's Great Mother. 16 Lydians combined Mithra with his
archaic spouse Anahita as an androgynous Mithra-Anahita, identified
with Sabazius-Anaitis, the Serpent and Dove of Anatolian mystery cults. 17
Anahita was the Mother of Waters, traditional spouse of the solar
god whom she bore, loved, and swallowed up. She was identified with the Anatolian Great Goddess Ma. Mithra was naturally coupled
with her, as her opposite, a spirit of fire, light, and the sun. 18 Her
"element," water, overwhelmed the world in the primordial flood, when one man built an ark and saved himself, together with his cattle, according to Mithraic myth. 19 The story seems to have been based on the Hindu Flood of Manu, transmitted through Persian and Babylo
nian scriptures to appear in a late, rather corrupt version in the Old Testament. See Flood.
What began in water would end in fire, according to Mithraic
eschatology. The great battle between the forces of light and darkness
in the Last Days would destroy the earth with its upheavals and
burnings. Virtuous ones who followed the teachings of the Mithraic
priesthood would join the spirits of light and be saved. Sinful ones who v followed other teachings would be cast into hell with Ahriman and
the fallen angels. The Christian notion of salvation was almost wholly a
product of this Persian eschatology, adopted by Semitic eremites and
sun-cultists like the Essenes, and by Roman military men who thought
the rigid discipline and vivid battle-imagery of Mithraism appropriate ]

for warriors. Under emperors like Julian and Commodus, Mithra Mffi became the supreme patron of Roman armies.20 Mnemosyne After extensive contact with Mithraism, Christians also began to _^^__^^____
describe themselves as soldiers for Christ; to call their savior Light of
the World, Helios the Rising Sun, and Sun of Righteousness; to celebrate their feasts on Sun-day rather than the Jewish sabbath; to
claim their savior's death was marked by an eclipse of the sun; and to adopt the seven Mithraic sacraments. Like Mithraists, Christians
practiced baptism to ascend after death through the planetary spheres to the highest heaven, while the wicked (unbaptized) would be dragged down to darkness. 21
Mithra's cave-temple on the Vatican Hill was seized by Christians
n 376 ad. 22 Christian bishops of Rome pre-empted even the Mithraic
ft nigh priest's title of Pater Patrum, which became Papa, or Pope. 23 Mithraism entered into many doctrines of Manichean Christianity
jnd continued to influence its old rival for over a thousand years. 24 The
Mithraic festival of Epiphany, marking the arrival of sun-priests or
Pagi
at the Savior's birthplace, was adopted by the Christian church
ly as late as 8 1 3 a.d. 25

Mola "Mother," the Norse Goddess who gave birth to the ruling caste of jarls (earls), or landowners. See Caste. Her name was related to

and called Mati-Syra-Zemlya.

I'yrian fire god, probably based on Hindu Agni. His name meant king," like the Semitic mekk or melkart. He was assimilated to the

Molech was worshipped by the Jews in the time of Solomon, ihose famous temple was actually built by the king of Tyre (1 Kings ll-l 1). Jews seem to have identified Molech with Yahweh when they
Ijere passing their firstborn children through the fire to Molech
Leviticus 18:21); Yahweh also demanded sacrifice of firstborn children

The so-called "root of all evil" took its name from a title of Rome's
treat Mother, Juno Moneta (Juno the Admonisher), whose Capitoline bmple included the Roman mint. Silver and gold coins manufac
ured there were valuable not only by reason of their precious metal but
Iso by the blessing of the Goddess herself, which could effect good
prtune and healing magic. Later popes carried on the pagan tradition \y blessing Christian amulets and holy medals which were also used
p trade, like money. 1 The attendant spirit of Juno Moneta was the erotic Cupid,
^responding to the Greeks' Eros, who was both child and compan
pn of Aphrodite. Thus, "cupidity" used to mean erotic desire, but in
Christian times its meaning was changed to greed for money.

Monotheism
Though in practice they worshipped three gods, one goddess, and nnumerable demigods (angels and saints), Christian theologians insistxl their religion was monotheism, and monotheism was the highest
brm of religion. Vetter comments:
One might well ask, where is the evidence that the worship ofone
supreme god is so superior to the worship of several gods? that is
unless one takes the position that it is difficult enough to furnish proofof the existence ofone god, and that each additional god assumed to exist would simply double the problem faced. Ifthe reduction in numbers of
deities ofitselfhas merit, then why are not those religions in which no
gods whatever are worshipped the "highest" ofall?'
667



Mons Veneris There was nothing lofty about the original impulse toward monotheism: the conceit of kings who identified themselves with a god
i^^^HBM and demanded that god's supremacy. One of the earliest self
worshipping monotheists was the Egyptian pharaoh Ikhnaton (Akhenaten), who reigned from 1379 to 1362 B.C.
Ikhnaton decided that the sole supreme deity was Aton, symbolized by the sun disc and incarnate on earth in himself. He moved his
family and court to an earthly paradise 300 miles north of Thebes, to a
site now called Tell el Amarna, a great city and temple-palace. He ordered even the word "gods" removed from inscriptions throughout
the land, so his own divine alter ego reigned alone. Jewish monothe
ism probably originated in Egypt. The Old Testament contains writings copied from the cult of Aton, especially the 104th Psalm, thought to have been written by Ikhnaton himself.
Egyptian priesthoods of the old deities refused to tolerate the royal i
monotheism. Ikhnaton died mysteriously. His body disappeared, and wasn't buried in the tomb prepared for it. His name was erased from
king lists. He was described as a criminal. 2 The Egyptians plainly
were not disposed to call monotheism a "higher" religion.
Another self-worshipper was the Roman emperor Elagabalus (He-liogabalus), who identified himself with the solar god El Gabal, and
tried to absorb all other deities into a single faith. He built a temple on
the Palatine, "and he desired to bring into that temple the image of the Magna Mater and the fire of Vesta and the Palladium and the
shields and all things that were sacred to the Romans; and he strove to
bring it to pass that no god save El Gabal should be worshipped in
Rome." 3 But the Roman people were not ready to limit themselves to El Gabal or any other single god.
Fifty years later, Aurelian erected in the Campus Martius his greati
temple to the Mithraic sun god, Deus Sol Invictus, the only god. Diocletian also declared this god Rome's sole ruling deity. Mithraism almost succeeded in establishing Roman monotheism. Mithra was adored "from the mouth of the Danube to Hadrian's Wall in Britain,
from Hadrian's Wall to the Pillars of Hercules, and from the Pillars of
Hercules to the Desert of Sahara." Moesia, Dacia, Pannonia, and
Noricum adopted the cult, as did southern France, especially Lyons. I Mithraic inscriptions and sanctuaries have been found at Ostia, Naples,
Palermo, Syracuse, Spoleto, and other sites. 4 See Mithra.

'Egyptian priests style the moon the Mother of the Universe," 'lutarch said, because the moon, "having the light which makes moist

Land of the Moon." 2 In worship of the heavenly bodies, primacy
/as always assigned to the moon. 3 Babylonians gave the moon precelence over the sun. Oriental nations in general worshipped the moon
pore the sun.4 Moses Maimonides said moon worship was the religion
|f Adam. 5 The Gnostic sect of Naassians believed in a primordial eing known as "the heavenly horn of the moon." 6 The moon was the
ternal Great Mother. In central Asia it was said the moon is the

Joddess's mirror reflecting everything in the world, like the mirror of
laya. 7 Many savages revere the moon more than the sun, reasoning that le Moon-mother gives her light at night, when it is needed, whereas
ie sun shines only by day. This belief presupposes that sunlight and aylight are not the same, a common idea among primitives. 8 Writers the Bible made this same mistake. They said God created "light"
laylight) before the sun and moon (Genesis 1:5, 16).

Moon
Mana or men gave
the name of the preRoman Latin Goddess Menrva
(Minerva), and such words as mentality, menstrual, menology, mensuration, mentor, menage (a matrilineal household), omen (a revelation from the moon), and amen (the moon of
rebirth).
Ashanti people had a generic term for all deities, Boshun, "Moon." In the Basque language, the words for "deity" and "moon" were the same. Sioux Indians called the moon "The Old Woman Who
Never Dies." Iroquois called her "The Eternal One." 9 Rulers in the Eritrean zone of South Africa bore the Goddess's name, "Moon." 10
Ancient rulers of the Tutsi tribe were named Mwezi, "Moon." n The Gaelic name of the moon, gealach, came from Gala or Galata, original Moon-mother of Gaelic and Gaulish tribes. Britain used to
be called Albion, the Milk-white Moon-goddess. Persians called the
moon Metra (Matra, mother), "whose love penetrated everywhere." 12 The root word for both "moon" and "mind" was the Indo
European manas, mana, or men, representing the Great Mother's "wise blood" in women, governed by the moon. 13 Its derivative mania
used to mearl ecstatic revelation, just as lunacy used to mean possession by the spirit of Luna, the moon. 14 To be "moon-touched" 01 "moon-struck" meant to be chosen by the Goddess; a "moon-calf"
was one carried away by love of her. When patriarchal thinkers belittled
the Goddess, these words came to mean mere craziness. The
moonstruck person was described as "silly," a word that formerly meant
"blessed," possibly derived from Selene, the Moon. 15 To the Greeks, menos meant both "moon" and "power." To the
Romans, the morality of the Moon-goddess was superior to that of the Sun-god. Plutarch said, "The effects of the moon are similar to the
effects of reason and wisdom, whereas those of the sun appear to be
brought about by physical force and violence." 16
In many cultures, the Moon-goddess and the Creatress were one and the same. Polynesians called the Creatress Hina, "Moon." She
was the first woman, and every woman is a wahine, made in the image of Hina. 17 To the Finns, the Creatress was Luonnotar (Luna, the
Moon). She brooded over the sea until she brought forth the World
Egg, heaven, and earth. 18 Scandinavians sometimes called the Crea
j
tress Mardoll, "Moon Shining Over the Sea." 19
The Moon-goddess created time, with all its cycles of creation,
growth, decline, and destruction, which is why ancient calendars were based on phases of the moon and menstrual cycles (see Men
strual Calendar). The moon still determines agricultural work in
some parts of India. 20 Indonesian moon priestesses were responsible for I
finding the right phase of the moon for every undertaking. The Dayaks prayed to the moon for children, increase of cattle, and abundant crops; they said she was the cause and measurer of time. 21
Greeks said the same of Demeter, whose priests were called Sons of the
j
Moon. 22
Peruvians called the moon either Mama Quilla or Mama Ogllo, ; sometimes identifying the two as mother and daughter, like Demeter I and Kore. Mama Quilla married the sun and gave birth to Mama Ogllol "Egg," the moon-maiden and her brother the sun-man. These two
670



mated and founded the Inca royal line on the site of Cuzco, "the Moon
Navel," in Inca cosmology the center of the world. 23
Because the Moon-goddess was threefold, the Destroyer as well as ^_.^_^^^_
the Creator, she was the devourer of the dead as well as the giver of
life. In Mexico her Destroyer aspect was Mictecaciuatl, who roamed the skies at night, seeking victims to devour. She was called Lady of the
Place of the Dead, in appearance like Kali the Destroyer. She was not only the moon but also the All-mother from whose genital hole in the
earth humanity crawled in the beginning, and to which humanity would
return. 24
The Vedas say all souls return to the moon after death, to be
devoured by maternal spirits. 25 Trobriand Islanders spoke of these
spirits as "female sorcerers" associated with the moon, eaters of the dead. 26 Maoris called the Moon Mother "man-eater." Tartars of
central Asia worshipped the moon as Macha Alia, Queen of Life and Death, said to be an eater of men. Africans said the moon searched for men to devour. 27
Orphic and Pythagorean sects viewed the moon as the home of the dead, a female Gate (yoni) through which souls passed on the way
to the paradise-fields of the stars. 28 Greeks often located the Elysian Fields, home of the blessed dead, in the moon. 29 Kastor of Rhodes said the shoes of Roman senators were decorated with ivory lunules
(crescents) to show that after death they would inhabit the moon. 30
Roman religion taught that "the souls of the just are purified in the moon." 31 Wearing the crescent was "visible worship" of the Goddess. 32 That was why the prophet Isaiah denounced the women of Zion for
wearing lunar amulets (Isaiah 3:18). "The crescent moon worn by Diana and used in the worship of other Goddesses is said to be the
Ark or vessel of boat-like shape, symbol of fertility or the Container of
jthe Germ of all life." 33 The same Ark carried gods, like Osiris, into
death; which may account for Jeremiah's hostility to the Ark's symbol
fern (Jeremiah 3:16). Semites feared the devouring Old Moon as Hindus feared the
devouring Kalika. Her dual nature may account for the correlation
between Semitic ima, "mother," and e-mah, "terror." 34 Superstitious Christians sometimes refused to sleep where moonlight might touch
jthem. According to Roger Bacon, "Many have died from not protecting themselves from the rays of the moon." 35 There was always an
issociation with death:
The idea of the journey to the moon after death is one which has been
preserved in the more advanced cultures. . . . It is not difficult to find . . . themes ofthe moon as the Land of the Dead or the regenerating
receptacle ofsouls. . . . This is one reason why the moon presides over the formations oforganisms, and also over their decomposition. i6
Because the moon was the receptacle of souls between reincar
nations, it sheltered both the dead and the unborn, who were one and

the same. Believers in prophetic dreams said if a man dreamed of his
own image in the moon, he would become the father of a son. If a
woman dreamed of her own image in the moon, she would give birth
to a daughter. 57 Most important for its association with birth, the moon was
supposed to be the receptacle of menstrual blood by which each mother formed the life of her child. This sacer, taboo moon-fluid kep
even the gods alive. The moon was "the cup of the fluid of life
immortal, quickening the vegetable realm and whatsoever grows in the sub-lunar sphere, quickening also the immortals on high." 38
Many myths of the moon-journey bore witness to the ancient
belief in lunar heavens. Gypsies opposed the Christian savior with
their own Romany savior who carried souls to the moon, like Hermes
Psychopomp. 39 Strangest of all myths of the moon-journey was one
involving Jesus himself. The Digby mystery play of the 1 6th century quoted "Jesus's hymn to the Moon, his mother, the vessel ... in whom he rested before he ascended to the Sun." 40 Peasants in France and Portugal confused Jesus's mother with thi
Moon-goddess, whom they called "Our Lady" and "Mother of God." 41 Scottish women curtsied to the moon when they saw her,
saying "It is a fine moon, God bless her." 42 In the Loire district,
children's rhymes spoke of Madame Moon, giver of babies. 43 A medieval German sect of Cathari worshipped the moon as Heva (Eve),
Mother of All Living, an older incarnation of the virgin Mary. 44 Even the orthodox church held that, as Jesus was the second Adam, so
Mary was the second Eve; and Mary was associated with both the moon and the sea.
As the moon governs the sea's tides, so she was supposed to goverr the tides of life and death. Shore dwellers had an ineradicable
conviction that a baby can be born only on an incoming tide, and a
dying person cannot expire until the tide goes out. As a corollary, it was often said birth at a full tide or a full moon betokens a lucky life. 45
The soul may ride the tide in lunar form, according to Caesarius of
Heisterbach: "The soul is a spiritual substance of spherical nature, like the globe of the moon."46
Scottish girls refused to schedule a wedding day for any time othei
than the full moon, the most fortunate time for women. 47 Scandina
vian women particularly prized amulets made of silver, the moon metal. The moon was the special deity of women even during the Renais
sance, when it was said if a woman wanted anything she should not ask God but should pray instead to the moon.48
Witches invoked their Goddess by "drawing down the moon," a
rite dating back to moon-worshipping Thessaly, centuries before the Christian era. 49 Thessalian priestesses also prefigured "witchcraft" by
laying curses with "moon-dew," said to be the first menstrual blood
of girls gathered during a lunar eclipse. 50 Medieval folk believed such a
672



curse incurable. St. Augustine and other fathers of the church Moon
jbelieved what Virgil said about moon-priestesses, that they could draw down the moon, stop rivers in their courses, turn back the wheel of ^^^^^^^^^^
the stars, or bring trees marching downhill. 51 St. Augustine berated
women for dancing "impudently and filthily all the day long upon the
|days of the new moon." 52
Few religious symbols occurred in so many diverse contexts as symbols of the moon. In the runic menological calendar the moonsickle stood for the festival of Harvest Home, which the Scots called
Kirn from Koreion, moon-virgin Kore which Christians renamed !the Feast of Our Lady of Mercy. 55 In Gaul the crescent moon stood for the druidic Diana. Crescere meant "to grow," a form of Latin creare,
to produce, to create. 54 Hence the crescent. Gauls made communion bakes in crescent shape. Modern France still makes them, and calls
jrhem croissants, "crescents," colloquially known as "moon-teeth." 55 The moon ruled the sexuality of women, and sometimes made them scornful of the male-dominated society's notions of hierarchy. An astrological book of 1688 warned: "The double conjunction of
Venus and the Moon produces extreme lubricity, brings venereal disease, and causes women of quality to become enamored of menservants." 56
Despite all the church's condemnations, rural folk continued to
[rust the Moon-mother in all their most important activities. A
Ipopular almanac said: "Kill fat swine for bacon about the full moon. . . .
iJhear sheep at the moon's increase: fell hand timber from the full to
jhe change . . . ; horses and mares must be put together in the increase
|f the moon, for foals got in the wane are not accounted strong . . . ;
fruit should be gathered, and cattle gelded, in the wane of the moon."
Most of all, the moon always governed magic. Melton said in 1620 mat no sorcerer ever drew a circle of protection without observing the lime of the moon. 57

slay his father-king. Like other supplanter-gods he was born of a version of the Triple Goddess, Margawse, the middle one of Arthur's
three "sisters" who really represented the Virgin, Mother, and Crone. See Arthur.
Morgan Le Fay
Celtic death-goddess: Morgan the Fate, or Fata Morgana, or the Triple Morrigan, or "Morgue la Faye." Sometimes she was a Ninefok Goddess, the Nine Sisters called Morgen ruling the Fortunate Isles in \ the far west, where dead heroes went. 2 Sometimes she, or they, became mermaids. Morgans or "sea-women" could "draw down to their
palaces of gold and crystal at the bottom of the sea or of ponds, those who venture imprudently too near the water." 3
Like Macha, the Crone aspect of the Morrigan, Morgan as Mother Death cast the destroying curse on every man. Even Arthuri- ,
an romances which presented her as a human being, Arthur's sister,
inconsistently admitted: "Morgan the Goddess is her name, and there is never a man so high and proud but she can humble and tame : him." 4
Sometimes she kindly promised immortality to her favored lovers, like Ogier the Dane, who accompanied her to her paradise. As the Morrigan, she stage-managed the contest between Cu Chulainn and a giant named Terrible. She presided over Cu Chulainn's killing of his
springtime rival, in a tale based on the Celtic legend of Gawain and the
Green Knight. 5 Morgan sat at the head of the table in the Green Knight's castle,
presiding over the death and resurrection of the rival year-gods as they beheaded one another in their proper seasons. Gawain was
obviously a solar hero, his strength waxing in the morning and waning in the afternoon; he was one of four brothers representing the 1
four solar seasons. The Green Knight was his perpetual antagonist.

Like Njord and Frey, Horus and Set, Gwynn ap Nudd and Gwythyr Moras son of Greidawl, they rose again and killed each other at the turning Morrigan
of the year. Gawain bore Morgan's pentacle as a heraldic device on his ^__
blood-red shield. He and his rival seem to have established the
ceremony of knighthood, a symbolic decapitation, which formerly transformed a victim into a god at the year's end.6
Late romances deprived Morgan of her divinity and made her human, just as the Great Goddess Mari became a mortal virgin Mary. Morgan became Arthur's sister, yet "a great clerk of necroman
cy," a prototypical witch. 7 She received a fictitious husband, King
Uriens of Gore, probably a corrupt form of the classic castrated heaven
god Uranus. Her name was applied to anything magical, miraculous, or misleading, as the Fata Morgana. An old word for witches' spells,
glamor, came from Glamorgan, the Goddess's sacred territory in Wales.
Morgan's mysterious Fortunate Isles continued to appear in Irish
folklore up to the present time. It was claimed that off the coast of
Galway nine islands rose out of the sea every seven years; but if anyone
tried to reach them by boat, they would vanish. 8

Morrigan
The Triple Goddess Morgan in Ireland: the virgin Ana, flowering
fertility-goddess; the mother Babd, "Boiling," the cauldron perpetually producing life; and the crone Macha, "Great Queen of Phantoms," or Mother Death. 1 Sometimes she was Mugain, the ruling Goddess of Munster. Like Hecate the triple Mooh-goddess, Macha sometimes stood for
all three personae. Queens of Ulster governed her shrine, Emain Macha, or Macha's Emania, land of the moon. 2 She laid the death
curse on Cu Chulainn, and haunted battlefields, making magic with the blood of slain men. 3 In the form of a raven she emerged from her
fairy-mound and perched on a standing-stone, singing of her Mysteries: "I have a secret that you shall learn. The grasses wave. The flowers
glow golden. The goddesses three low like kine. The raven Morrigan herself is wild for blood." 4 See Trinity.

Moses Moses
Akki the WaterDrawer, or breaker of the waters, may be related to Hekat in Egypt, Acco the
childbirth-goddess in Greece, "Acca the Maker" in the Roman cult of Heracles, and
Akka the eponymous mother of Akkad.' Finns and Lapps said she was Mader Akka (Mother Akka) who gave birth to all humanity. This Akkadian Great Mother was associated with many tales of heroes float
ing on rivers in infancy for this was a mythic symbol of birth-waters. Rome's Acca Larentia drew Romulus and Remus from their floating basket on the Tiber, in the same
myth-cycle. 4 Egypt's version of her was
the "pharaoh's daughter" of the Moses
myth, i.e., Hekat the Midwife, or HekaAkka.
Sir Flinders Petrie said the name Moses was Egyptian, as in Thut
mose, Ahmoses, etc., meaning "unfathered son of a princess." An Egyptian model for Moses's myth was the demigod Heracles of
Canopus, drawn from an ark in the Nile bulrushes. When he grew up,
he performed great deeds, and finally died on a mountaintop. 1 The myth was not only Egyptian. It was applied to many heroes and god-kings. King Sargon of Akkad, 2242-2186 B.C., was a virginborn son of a temple maiden, whose title enitum meant Virgin Bride of
God, like the Semitic kadesha. She set Sargon afloat on the river in a
basket of rushes. He was rescued by the divine midwife, Akki the Water
Drawer, now transformed into Aquarius. He passed through the sacred king's customary adventures: an early threat of destruction from
the incumbent monarch, a period of exile in the wilderness, temptation by evil spirits, finally elevation to the throne as the spouse of the Goddess Ishtar. 2
The fatherless hero born of "waters" (Maria) was a universal
image of the sacred king, repeated in the myths of Perseus, Horus, Jason, Oedipus, Trakhan of Gilgit, Joshua son of Nun, and others
including conceptually at least Jesus. Most were based on the ancient myth of the Goddess Cunti (Kali-the-cosmic-yoni), who gave birth to the sun god and placed him in a basket of rushes on the river
Ganges. The same sun god was reborn in Athens, fathered by Apollo
on the virgin Creusa, and left in a woven basket. 5
Moses's miracles were equally derivative, drawn chiefly from
Egyptian myths. The drying up of a body of water, to cross dry-shod, was a miracle of Isis, who parted the waters of the river Phaedrus on her
journey to Byblos.6 The same tale was told of Bindumati (Kali as mother of the bindu or Spark of Life) when she crossed the Ganges.
Moses's extraction of water from a rock was performed long before
by a guru at Lhasa; his rock is still called "the water of the god's
vessel." 7 Atalanta of Calydon also brought forth water from a rock by striking it with her spear and calling on her Goddess. 8 Mother Rhea
performed the same miracle; and she was also the giver of law tablets on a holy mountain.
The historical basis of Moses myths seems to have been the
expulsion of Jews from Egypt during an outbreak of "pestilence," possibly leprosy. The historian Choeremen said the oracles blamed the infection on foreign workers called Children of Israel. The priest
Manetho said in the 3rd century b.c. that alien tribes in northwestern
Egypt were lepers and unclean. Lysimachus stated that the oracle of
Amon ordered the alien workers to be collected and driven out of
Egypt. 9 Tacitus's account called the Jews "a race detested by the gods,"
whose presence in Egypt was responsible for an outbreak of disfiguring disease. The offenders were evicted from Egypt and sent into the
desert:
676



The people, who had been collected after diligent search, finding them- Moses
selves left in a desert, sat for the most part in a stupor ofgrief, till one of the exiles, Moyses by name, warned them not to look for any relieffrom
god or man, forsaken as they were ofboth, but to trust to themselves, ^^^^^^^m taking for their heaven-sent leader that man who should first help them to
be quit of their present misery. They agreed, and in utter ignorance began to advance at random. Nothing, however, distressed them so much
as the scarcity of water, and they had sunk ready to perish in all directions over the plain, when a herd of wild asses was seen to retire from
their pasture to a rock shaded by trees. Moyses followed them, and,
guided by the appearance ofa grassy spot, discovered an abundant spring ofwater. This furnished relief. After a continuous journey for six days,
on the seventh day they possessed themselves ofa country, from which
they expelled the inhabitants, and in which they founded a city and a
temple. l0
Jewish history begins with this expulsion from Egypt. Every
thing previous to this in the Bible was syncretic mythology gathered from non-Jewish sources. 11 Moses's encounter with the god of
pinai the Chaldean moon-god Sin shows that the Jews tried to settle
n this god's territory, the Cainite-Midianite mining community on
he Sinai peninsula. The whole peninsula was the Land of Sinim, i.e., "Land of the Vloon." Its god Sin was a consort of Mother Inanna, or Nanna, who
innually turned the waters of Sumer into blood. Sin dwelt in a holy
nountain, which Moses climbed, and Moses reported that he was the
ame as the god of Abraham, though Abraham didn't know him by the
ame name (Exodus 6:3). In very ancient documents, the name of Abraham himself appeared as a synonym for Ab-Sin, "Moon-father." 12 The "God of Abraham" whose name meant Father Brahm ntroduced himself to Moses as "I Am That I Am," in imitation of
le Brahmanic Tat sat, "I Am That that Is." 1? (See Tetragramma
on.) The god also commanded, "Put off thy shoes from off thy feet,
ar the place whereon thou standest is holy ground" (Exodus 3:5). This
/as an ancient Hindu custom. In India it is still proper to go barefoot
i temple precincts, on the theory that subtle emanations from the holy
round can enter the body through the feet. Ancient Egyptians and
loman witches had the same custom. 14 Another Brahma-like habit of Moses's god was to view a thousand
ears of man as one day in his own sight (Psalms 90:4). This was rapied from the "Day of Brahma" made up of a thousand years, or
pmetimes a thousand mahayugas or "great aeons." 15
The stone tablets of law supposedly given to Moses were copied fom the Canaanite god Baal-Berith, "God of the Covenant." Their [en Commandments were similar to the commandments of the Bud
hist Decalogue. 16 In the ancient world, laws generally came from a
eity on a mountaintop. Zoroaster received the tablets of law from
Lhura Mazda on a mountaintop. 17 An earlier lawgiving mountain
eity was Mother Rhea of Mount Dicte, or Ninhursag, probably a
677



Moses model for the masculine lawgivers. Moses's god provided laws re
markably similar to those handed down from the Babylonian god to
^^^^^^^^^^^ King Hammurabi. 18
Moses took over another matriarchal myth in the tale of the
plagues of Egypt. This came from the third-dynasty reign of Tcheser ' (or Joser, whom the Hebrews called Joseph). The Nile flood failed for
seven years, and Egyptians starved to death by thousands. The
pharaoh sent a desperate message to Mater (Mother), ruler of Nubia, to ask how the Goddess might be propitiated. Mater's reply described
"the couch of the Nile," a double cavern called Qerti or Khert, the
underworld, likened to "two breasts from which all good things
poured forth." I9 Mater said the trouble was caused by a jealous male
god, who wished to be called "father of gods" and to hold the Key of
the Nile. As usual, the god's practical demands boiled down to gifts and
tithes for his priesthood.
When the story was written down many centuries afterward, in the
late Ptolemaic period, priests of Ra pretended their god had ended
the drought, by spreading a "red beer" over Egypt's fields to distract the
attention of Mother Hathor, who was killing the people. 20 This "beer" was said to be "as human blood." What transformed it into
blood was a holy substance from the Nile's source, called dedi. 21 This
was sometimes said to be a salty red earth, like ochre, likened to
menstrual blood. Or again, the red color was pomegranate juice,
another symbol of menstrual blood. 22 The pomegranate represented the
vulva in biblical times, and was worshipped as an emblem of the Goddess on her holy mount Rimmon ("Pomegranate"). 23 What really turned the Nile into blood was not Moses's magic
wand, but the red silt of flood time, supposed to be the Goddess's life
giving uterine blood bathing the land in the substance of life. The
mythic killing probably referred to hecatombs of firstborn sons, sacri
j
ficed in the attempt to end the drought, their blood spread on the
fields to encourage the flood by sympathetic magic. See Firstborn.
Moses's followers pretended that Yahweh had caused the slaughter
of Egyptian firstborn sons (Exodus 12:29), while the Israelites were
permitted to redeem their sons with the blood of lambs (Exodus 13:15).
However, Yahweh had long copied the Egyptian custom of firstborn
sacrifice. He said, "Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever
openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of
beast; it is mine" (Exodus 13:2). Like early Egyptian gods, Yahweh forgave sins only when his altars were soaked in blood: "without
shedding of blood there is no remission" (Hebrews 9:22).
The Lord rather unnecessarily told Moses to instruct his people to
smear sacrificial blood on their doorposts, a custom that would have
been perfectly familiar to any people living in Egypt where it was done
at most religious festivals since the earliest times. Again it seems to
have originated in the Far East. At New Year sacrifices in China,
doorposts were smeared with blood of sacrificial lambs just as in the
678 A



Passover myth. 24 Upper Nigerian tribes still sacrifice to ancestral ghosts Mot on the threshold of the house and smear the blood on doorposts. 25 Mother Carey
Many laymen are still led to believe that a real Moses wrote the ^^^^^^^^^^
Pentateuch (first five books of the Old Testament), even though
scholars have known for a long time that these books were first written
in the late post-exilic period by priestly scribes in Jerusalem. 26 Their purpose was to create a mythic history for their nation out of customs,
sayings, and legends mostly borrowed from others. The figure of Moses remains mysterious because it was largely a framework of myth hung on a non-Jewish name.

Mot
Canaanite god representing "Death" or "Sterility"; the rival, tanist, twin, and alter ego of the fertility god Aleyin or Baal. Mot may be compared to Shiva in his "dead" phase as Shava the Corpse, or to
Osiris in his "mummy" phase as the Still-Heart. In other words, he was
the vegetation-god in the fallow season.
Like the dying Jesus, Mot was "forsaken" by his heavenly Father
(El) and symbolically castrated by the breaking of his reed scepter. Like the harvested grain, he was cut with a sickle, beaten with a flail,
ground in a mill, and scattered in pieces over the fields by his
Goddess, Anat (Anatha). He was also assimilated to the pre-Christian figure of the Lamb of God, calling himself the sacrificial lamb made
ready with pure wheat to atone for the sins of the people. 1 After each of his annual ceremonial "deaths" he was always resurrected by the Goddess, who caused him to be reborn as the new crop, Aleyin. He was
worshipped in Babylon and also in Jerusalem under the name of Tammuz.

Motherhood Motherhood
During the early evolution of the human race, motherhood was the
only recognized bond of relationship. Like any mammalian family, the primitive human family consisted of mother and offspring.
The animal family is the product ofthe maternal instincts and ofthose alone; the mother is the sole centre and bond ofit. . . . The male has no share in forming the animal family; he is not an essential member ofit; he may join the maternal group, but commonly does not do so. When he attaches himself to the animal family his association with it is loose and precarious. . . . Where the female can derive no benefit from associa
tion with the male, no such association takes place. Where male
cooperation is useful, the male seeks out or follows the female, and it is the latter who determines the segregation ofthe group and selects its abode.'
The root of civilization was the kinship bond that kept groups together to evolve mutual cooperation. The bond was maternal because
no paternal relationships were perceived, or even guessed, by such early groups with their shifting, temporary sexual attachments. "The connection between sexuality and childbearing was unknown to
primitive men." 2 People in primitive circumstances still show ignorance of the connection between sexuality and childbearing. Trobriand Islanders
attributed pregnancy to spirits, not sex. A woman's husband might help care for her children, but he thought of them as "the children of my
wife." The islanders laughed at white men who first tried to tell them
about impregnation. Chukchi female shamans said they made their
children by their sacred stones, not by intercourse with men. Australian
aborigines thought women became pregnant by eating some special foods, or by embracing a sacred tree hung with umbilical cords from
previous births. Bataks believed no woman could become pregnant
unless umbilical cords and placentae were buried under her house. 3
Primitives not only attributed pregnancy to a variety of causes, but
also assigned to it a variety of different durations, showing that they were not sure when it began. 4 Most authorities now agree that not only
the uncivilized races today, but certainly all the world's people in the
prehistoric period, knew nothing of man's part in the process of reproduction. It was believed that only women held the divine power
to give life. 5 All the most ancient mythologies speak of a Creatress rather
than a Creator because living things could be made only by a female,
according to primitive beliefs. Men believed themselves unnecessary to 1
the process. 6 The most primitive hunting cultures have legends of still earlier
ages, when women possessed all magical arts and men had none. As
childbearers and nurturers, women took charge of growing things generally. They became the producers, storers, and distributors of vegetable foodstuffs, hence the owners of the land they used for cultiva
tion. They made the earth valuable and equated it with themselves.
680



Their economic and social power thus evolved the early village commu- Motherhood nities in matriarchal form. The men saw themselves as almost entirely
superfluous, except for the labor they could contribute as hunters or ^^^^^^^^^^
defenders of the matriarchal group. 7
The secret of fatherhood can only have been revealed to men by
the women themselves, because women were the keepers of calendri
cal records, another traditionally female skill that most men thought
j beyond their comprehension. Before the advent of monogamous marriage, a late development in human history, there would have been no reason or inclination to correlate copulations with births. Even if
[
the truth were suspected, there were many negative cases to disprove it:
i some women could copulate frequently and never become pregnant, I others could remain "barren" when living with one man but conceive
I when living with another. Women past menopause or before menarche could take any number of lovers without conceiving, which tended
to suggest that menstruation was the crucial factor rather than sexual
activity. As may be found still in many groups of people, motherhood alone
was the foundation of clan loyalties. In Assam, the social unit of tribes
jwas maharis, "motherhoods." The Malay family was a sa-mandei, "motherhood." Among the Garos and Khasis, mothers headed the
family groups and bequeathed all property in the female line; men could
inherit nothing. Nearly everywhere, kinship bonds also passed only through the female line, as in the ancient system deliberately reversed
Sby the Bible's "begats," which recognized only male ancestors. Seri
Indian tribes called themselves Kunkak, "womanhood," or "mother
iihood."8 The earliest religious works of art "are figures of the solitary
Great Goddess the Paleolithic image of Mother, before there was any iFather either on earth or in heaven."9 The idea of fatherhood was
blien to the religious or social thinking of the earliest civilizations. 10
"Home and mother" are written over every phase ofneolithic agriculture. . . . It was the woman who wielded the digging stick and the hoe;
she who tended the garden crops and accomplished those masterpieces of selection and cross-fertilization which turned raw wild species into the
prolific and richly nutritious domestic varieties: it was woman who made
the first containers, weaving baskets and coiling the first clay pots. . . . In form, the village, too, is her creation: for whatever else the village might be, it was a collective nest for the care and nurture of the young. Here
she lengthened the period ofchild-care and playful irresponsibility, on which so much ofman 's higher development depends. House and
village, eventually the town itself, are woman writ large. In Egyptian hieroglyphics, "house" or "town" may stand as symbols for "mother," as ifto confirm the similarity ofthe individual and the collective nurturing
function. In line with this, the more primitive structures houses, rooms, tombs are usually round ones: like the original bowl described in
Greek myth, which was modeled on Aphrodite's breast. "
Ancient civilizations show ample evidence of the matriarchal
matrix in which they grew. Egyptians traced their descent through
681



Motherhood mothers, calling themselves "X, born of the Lady Y," omitting their
father's name. 12 On Egyptian funerary stelae, the mother's name was ^^^^^^^^^^^ given but the father's was omitted. 13 Diodorus said Egyptian queens
received more respect than kings. 14 In the Ramesseum, the queen mother was addressed as "mighty mistress of the world." 15 Pharaohs
ruled by matrilineal succession, and styled themselves "Rulers from the Womb." 16 The name of the Goddess was always a component part
of royal names in the earliest dynasties. A pharaoh's title was originally per aa, Great Gate or Great House, symbol of the cosmic womb. Rulers of the Egyptians' Nubian neighbors had an even more mothercentered title: Mater. 17
Egyptian men were awed by maternal behavior patterns, wondering why women did what they did to maintain the race. Maxims written about 1500 B.C. said:
Thou shalt never forget thy mother and what she has done for thee. . . . For she carried thee long beneath her heart as a heavy burden, and
after thy months were accomplished she bore thee. Three long years she carried thee upon her shoulder and gave thee her breast to thy mouth, and as thy size increased her heart never once allowed her to say, "Why should I do this?" >8
Egyptian scriptures emphasized the honor due "thy mother, who bore thee with much suffering. She placed thee in the Chamber of
Instruction that thou mightest acquire instruction in books. She was
unremitting in her care for thee, and had loaves and beer for thee in her
house. When thou art grown . . . cast thine eyes upon her that gave
thee birth and provided all good things for thee, thy mother. Let her never reproach thee." 19
An Ethiopian woman expressed to Frobenius the basic psychological attitude of primitive mothers:
How can a man know what a woman 's life is? . . . The man spends a night
by a woman and goes away. His life and body are always the same. The woman conceives. As a mother she is another person from the woman without child. She carries the fruit ofthe night nine months long in her
body. Something grows. Something grows into her life that never again departs from it. She is a mother. She is and remains a mother even though her child die, though all her children die. For at one time she carried the child under her heart. And it does not go out ofher heart ever again. Not even when it is dead. All this the man does not know; he knows nothing. He does not know the difference before love and after love, before motherhood and after motherhood. He can know nothing. Only a woman can know that and speak ofthat. That is why we won 't be told what to do by our husbands. 20
In Old Iranian, the head of a clan or family was the hana,
"grandmother." Among the Medes, genealogies were based on the female line. In Babylon, the ideogram for "mother" combined the elements of "house" and "deity," like the Hindu grhadevata or "housegoddess." The female sex received precedence in all forms of
682



address. The descending order of beings began with "Goddess and Motherhood
gods, women and men." 21 By Babylonian law, "any sin against the mother, any repudiation against the mother was punished by banish- ^^^^^^^^^^
ment from the community." The Lycians too kept track of female ancestors only. Heraclides Ponticus said of them, "From of old they
have been ruled by the women." 22 Phoenicians wrote of recent past
when people didn't know their fathers, but took the names of their mothers. 25
Etruscan tomb inscriptions also disregarded fathers. When married couples were buried together, only the wife's name was written. Late j Roman texts reversed this usage, writing the name of the husband and
omitting that of the wife. 24 But before the founding of Rome, Italy
was governed by the Sabine matriarchate, when not even kings knew I their fathers. Romulus, Ancus Marcus, and Servius Tullius had only
! mothers. Indeed, fatherhood was not always noticed even in the classical
period; Roman plebeians didn't know their fathers. When the myth jof Romulus and his men was written down, it was said Romulus made
j
his followers marry Sabine women, because, as men, they lacked \ sanguis ac genus, the blood of the race. 25 This could come only from the female owners of the land.
Patriarchal writers claimed that Romulus named each of the early
Roman curiae (clans) after one of the Sabine women. 26 The story
[was invented to disguise the fact that these curiae were "motherhoods,"
[bearing the names of maternal ancestresses. 27 The mother of all clans
Dwas Juno Curitis, the Queen of Heaven whom the Romans adopted
land presented with a new spouse, Jupiter. 28 Among barbarian tribes of northern Europe, women were proper
Ity owners, clan heads, and religious leaders. Roman writers called the
[(northern nations "lands of women" governed by kvaens (queens). 29 HPrehistoric Irish queens were mentioned in old writings, but their
'spouses were left nameless. The Lombards claimed their ancestors
[descended from a primal virgin mother, Gambara, who had no |spouse. Mothers, not fathers, gave their names to children in pagan ['Britain and Scandinavia. Old German documents designate persons
i by their mothers' names only. 30
It was the same in the Far East. Chinese family names are always [formed from a sign meaning "woman." The custom is said to date [from a past time when people knew their mothers but not their bathers. 51 The Man-Tseu of southern China had a system of heredi
tary queenship passing through a sacred female clan. 32 Chinese writings call Tibet "the land of women" and Japan "the land of queens."
Japanese imperial families traced their descent from the supreme sun
i goddess, Omikami Amaterasu, mother of the world. Japanese legendlary "chiefs" of ancestral tribes were usually women. 33 The Chinese said the first man to understand fatherhood and
[institute monogamous marriage was Fu-Hi who, however, had no Mather but only a mother. 34 The same first discoverer of paternity in
683



Motherhood Greek myth was Cecrops, a high priest of Athene and one of her serpent-consorts. 55 Athene however was a name of the Aegean Great
^^^^^^^^^^^ Goddess and Universal Mother, who ruled alone and supreme
during the Bronze Age. 56 In the whole Aegean area, religious rites were in the hands of priestesses, regarded as emanations or embodiments
of the Goddess, who was simply woman deified, as the later God was
man deified. Men didn't participate in public worship until a fairly
late date, then only as priestesses' helpers, as the male deity was subordinate to the female. 57
In Europe also, the Great Goddess was thought the sole omnipo
tent deity. Fatherhood was not incorporated into religious thinking, because in clan life it was a very frail bond, even if recognized. 58
Scholars know that "in the beginning the Goddess everywhere
antedated, or at least was predominant over, the God. It has been affirmed that in all countries from the Euphrates to the Adriatic, the Chief Divinity was at first in woman form." 59
Recent researches into the history ofthe family render it in the highest
degree improbable that the physical kinship between the god and his [sic] worshippers, of which traces are found all over the Semitic area, was originally conceived as fatherhood. It was the mother's, not the father's blood which formed the original bond ofkinship among the Semites as
among other early people and in this stage ofsociety, if the tribal deity was thought ofas the parent ofthe stock, a goddess, not a god, would
necessarily have been the object of worship. *
Modern male scholars often tried to conceal or deny the
evidence of the ancient matriarchate. Whenever possible, some auto
matically converted references to the Great Mother into the word
"God," as was done in translating the Bible. Even so responsible a
scholar as Cumont, translating Apuleius's description of the Syrian Goddess as omnipotens et omniparens, "all-powerful and all-producing," glossed the description as a "conception of the absolute, unlimited authority of God [sic] over the earth." 41
Frankfort said the Goddess was supreme in Mesopotamia "because the source of all life is seen in the female." Saggs said she
was "the central figure in Neolithic religion." 42 In Egypt, she was "the I
Being eternal and infinite, the creative and ruling power of heaven,
earth, and the underworld, and of every creature and thing in them. . . .1
Mother-goddess, lady of heaven, queen of the gods . . . who raised up Tern in primeval time, who existed when nothing else had being, and
who created that which exists . . . the greatest power on earth, who
commandest all that is in the universe, and who preservest all the gods
... the God-mother, giver of life All that has been, that is, and that will be." 45
Besides creating the world and everything in it, the Goddess
created the civilized arts: agriculture, building, weaving, potting,
writing, poetry, music, the graphic arts, calendars, and mathematics. These seem to have developed mostly in the hands of women as
684

behavior. "Woman was the creator of the primordial elements of

the actualities of life, all art, all poetic sentiment, are irradiations of ^^^^^^^^
those extra-individualistic, racial interests which are represented by the

They have their source in the race-regarding feminine impulses." 44
Hindu scriptures say the Goddess invented alphabets, pictographs,
mandalas and other magical signs, hence her title of Samjna (sign,
name, image). The Brahmavaivarta Purana says under another of her
[titles, Savitri, the Goddess gave birth to the Vedas, the rhythms of the
Ragas, day and night, the year, the month, the seasons, the inch, the second, and all other units of measurement; also logic, grammar, the
[days of the week, Time, Death, Nourishment, Memory, Victory,
i religious rituals, the trinity of aeons, and all the gods. 45 As Great Mother Kali Ma, she wore on her necklace of skulls the
; sacred Sanskrit letters, which she invented, and invested with such
magic power that she could create things simply by pronouncing their names in this language. 46 The notion led to the Neoplatonic, and
later Christian, concept of the Creative Word or Logos. Sanskrit matra, like the Greek meter, meant both "mother" and "measurement." Mathematics is, by derivation, "mother-wisdom." Root words for motherhood produced many words for calculation:
metric, mensuration, mete, mens, mark, mentality; geo-metry, tri
gono-metry, hydro-metry, etc. Women did temporal and spatial calculations for so long that, according to the Vayu Purana, men once thought women were able to give birth because they had superior
skill in measuring and figuring. Men imagined that if they could master these feminine skills, they could give birth, too. "Male ances
tors" told one another that if they could only learn to measure the
earth, they would "happily create progeny." 47 In the Middle East also, numbers and letters were inventions of
the Goddess and the special concern of her priestesses. Ashurbanipal proudly declared that he was the first Babylonian king to learn "the
noble art of tablet-writing," which belonged to the special scribes
called maryanu.** A similar Egyptian word for a scribe was Maryen or Mahir, "great one" or "mother." 49 No one was permitted to enter
the Holy of Holies in Babylon's municipal temple except women who had given birth; thus it seems likely that the maryanu were originally mothers, dedicated to the Semitic Goddess Mari-Anna, otherwise
known as Ishtar. 50 Among the Hittites, priestesses known as Elderly
Women taught the art of writing, kept records, advised kings, and practiced medicine. 51 The Triple Goddess of Fate was incarnate in three Guises or "writers," corresponding to the Germanic Fates called Die Schreiberinnen, the Writing-Women, and the Roman mother of destiny Fata Scribunda, "the Fate who writes." 52
In pre-Hellenic Greece the alphabet was attributed to the original
685



Motherhood three Muses, who were identical with the Fates or Graeae, eponymous mothers of Greek tribes. The Latin alphabet was created by the ^^^^^^^^^^^^ archaic Goddess Carmenta, mother of carmens or "charms." Or,
according to Isidore of Seville, the alphabet was created by the Moon- i
goddess Io under her Egyptian name of Isis. 5J Egyptians revered the Goddess as measurer of time, mistress of
the house of books, mistress of the house of architects. 54 As foundress of
the science of architecture she was named Seshat, "Lady of the
Builder's Measure." She built "the abode of a king in the next world," a
pyramid. She also created the Golden Calf, Horus, familiar in the
Bible as the idol worshipped by Aaron and the Israelites. 55
Ancient beliefs linking motherhood with superior intelligence,
reasoning power, and magical knowledge made it hard for men to oppose the matriarchate, even when they discovered paternity and personified it in gods. Fathers' claim to children's respect seemed
relatively trivial by comparison with the mothers' gestation, birth-giving,
nursing, supporting, and daily teaching. The Book of Maccabees said a mother's sympathy with her children is deeper than a father's. 56 The
Mahanirvanatantra said, "Mother is superior to father on account of
her bearing and also nourishing the child." 57 Menander wrote, "A mother loves her child more than a father does." 58 Therefore the
child is more hers than his; as the old Irish proverb put it, "To every
cow belongs her calf." 59 The Laws of Manu stated that "A spiritual
teacher exceeds a worldly teacher ten times, a father exceeds a spiritual teacher one hundred times, but a mother exceeds one thousand times
a father's claim to honor on the part of a child and as its educator."60
There may have been a real biological advantage underlying ancient views of the female's superior intelligence. As mothers or potential mothers, female mammals have more need of naturally
responsive alertness than males. "Girls' more mature skills enable
them to attend to stimuli, especially from other people, more swiftly and
accurately than boys. Girls are better at analyzing and anticipating environmental demands; in addition, they have greater verbal facility.
. . . The perceptual, cognitive, and verbal skills which for unknown
reasons are more characteristic of girls enable them to analyze and
anticipate adult demands."61 As a modern woman said, "After the birth <
of children that enormous thing you do everything else seems
kind of a breeze. But so many of us lock the doors of the mind. We nev
er bother to penetrate below the surface of that bottomless sea of
resources that may be nature's gift to women."62
For a long time men feared to oppose women because they were convinced women were more closely allied with the forces of nature. West African tribesmen testified that "women were more powerful than
men, for to them alone the mysteries of the gods and of secret things
were known." Women founded the magical Egbo society, but after
men learned the secret rites, they kept women from participating any more. In Queensland also, once men learned magic, they forbade
686



women to practice, on the ground that women had too much natural Motherhood
aptitude for it. 63
In northern Europe, the Vanir or Elder Gods, led by Mother ^^^^^^^^^
Earth and the Goddess Freya, were overthrown by new patriarchal deities from Asia, the Aesir led by Father Odin. In the Aegean,
followers of Father Zeus fought the pre-Hellenic worshippers of Mother Rhea or Hera. In Babylon, worshippers of Marduk rebelled against the primal mother Tiamat, whose own son killed her to take
Dver her world-creating function. In Mexico, the legendary leader of the \ztecs overthrew his sister Malinalxochitl, former ruler of men and Deasts, afterward described as "a bad witch."64
In Australia, the Goddess named Marm (Mother) was diabolized >y men who resented the advantages she bestowed on women. She
nade women in her own image, and gave them "magic fruit" (off
spring) that she denied to men.65 In Malekula, men frankly admitted :hat their religious rites were stolen from the women, who invented
[hem but ceased to practice them.66 Tierra del Fuegan men said
vomen used to rule the world by witchcraft, and all religious mysteries pelonged to their Goddess, the moon. 67 Men adopted the cult of the
^un god, and under his leadership they murdered all the adult women of
the tribe, leaving only immature girls not yet initiated.68
A transparently mendacious Iatmul legend said women invented
acred objects and secrets of magic, then "gave" these things to men, and "asked" the men to murder them so no woman would have the
secrets any more. 69 Many similar examples show that the defeat of
he matriarchate was mythologized as a violent attack of men upon
vomen. Such myths of leadership forcibly wrested from women >ccur throughout the world and cannot be overlooked. 70 As Engels
loted, "The overthrow of mother-right was the world-historical lownfall of the female sex." 71
In some ways, it may have meant the downfall of all humanity
rom a basically peaceful social order to a hierarchical structure
stablished and maintained by aggression. Patriarchal societies insisted
m pecking orders; matriarchal ones tended to be more egalitarian. 72
Neolithic village cultures with their matriarchal family-based govern
nents were cooperative, unwarlike, and nonviolent. Their lack of
lestructiveness has been attributed to the life-loving spirit of affirmation
hat scholars find at the core of most matriarchal societies. 73
The same spirit of affirmation has been found in matriarchal or
iemi-matriarchal societies of the recent past. American Indians who
vorshipped the female principle, and were ruled by tribal chiefs elected
>y the real leaders, called Female Governesses, surprised Christian nissionaries with behavior more "Christian" than that of white men. A
nissionary said, "What is extremely surprising in men whose external
ippearance is wholly barbarous, is to see them treat one another with a jentleness and consideration which one does not find among com
non people in the most civilized countries." Indian women were
687



Motherhood known as the Life of the Nation, and Mistresses of the Soil.74 In
answer to a white questioner who couldn't understand the Indian ^^^^^^^^^^^^ reverence for women, one Indian man said, "Of course the men
follow the wishes of the women; they are our mothers." 75
Even aggressive savages like the Dobu Islanders regarded motherhood as the only possible antidote to warfare. Mutual trust was
maintained exclusively among members of a matrilineal kinship group known as "mother's milk." 76 Societies where women set the stan
dards of behavior and morality were found generally kinder than male-dominated societies. Children grew up without harsh punish
ments, expecting kindness from others as a matter of course and
consequently developing into nonhostile, nonviolent adults. Envy,
greed, and exploitiveness were minimal; depression almost unknown; crime almost unheard-of. People were generally good-humored, trustful, and confident. Women were treated as the equals of men.
Attitudes toward sexuality tended to be positive and permissive. People seemed to feel sure Mother Nature would provide for their needs, even in cases where a harsh environment demanded hard work for the sake of survival. 77
Societies dominated by men tended to introduce cruel punish
ments, hostility toward the young, formalized rivalry, and sadistic
elements replacing easy, affectionate sexuality. Some of this may have been biologically based. Among animals, females care for the young, males fight for mates, and care only for themselves. The primitive
human female "nourished, reared and protected the more feeble
than herself, while her mate, a terrible savage, knew only how to pursue
and kill." 78
When new-born humanity was learning to stand upright, it depended much on its mother and stood close to her protecting side. Then women were goddesses, they conducted divine worship, women 's voice I was heard in council, she was loved and revered and genealogies were reckoned through her. What broke into this feminine Elysium and robbed
it ofliberty and happiness? The male ofthe species. As the race grew older, rationality flourished at the expense ofmoral sense. . . . Man, unmindful of the mother's contributions to racial uplift and welfare,
thought only ofbending every energy and forcing tribute from everything^ and every one who could elevate himselfand give him dominating power. . . . There's no more reason for not killing humans who oppose you than for sparing the lives ofmosquitoes, in the mind ofa man
whose self-seeking emotions are permitted to run rampant. And the average "normal" male's personality balance tends definitely in the
same direction.
Bachofen said, "The idea of motherhood produces a sense of
universal fraternity among all men, which dies with the development of ^ paternity." Ancient societies believed that those related by motherblood shared a common soul, so no member of the group could hurt
another without doing injury to himself. Egyptians and other folk
688



carefully distinguished between children of the same mother and Motherhood
children of the same father; the former were the "real" siblings, constrained to care for each other as for their own selves. As Telema
chus remarked, a person must be told who his father is; the mother is ^^^^^^^^" the parent every child knows "of himself." 80
Psychologists agree that the images of Mother and Father affect :he psyche in different ways. Feelings of connectedness are more closely
associated with the mother; feelings of dissociation or alienation with
the father. In spiritual terms, outer and inner worlds of nature and the elf were not separated under a matriarchal order, whereas patriarchy insisted on their absolute severance. 81
Past societies dreaded even a temporary loss of the mother image.
\puleius spoke of the period when the Goddess departed from the vorld for her season of self-renewal: "There has been no pleasure, no
oy, no merriment anywhere, but all things lie in rude unkempt
leglect; wedlock and true friendship and parents' love for their children lave vanished from the earth; there is one vast disorder, one hateful
oathing and foul disregard of all the bonds of love." 82 When the
[goddess permanently disappeared from theological imagery, the ense of alienation became universal:
The earlier, neolithic order was ofthe female above the male, the cosmic mother above the father . . . with the progressive devaluation ofthe
mother-goddess in favor ofthe father, which everywhere accompanied the maturation of the dynastic state and patriarchy. . . . A sense ofessential
separation from the supreme value symbol became in time the characteristic religious sentiment ofthe entire Near East. 83
G. R. Taylor's classification of "matrist" and "patrist" societies
showed guilt, negativism, and fear in the latter, as opposed to a more :onfident outlook in the former. Matrist societies were typified by: ( 1 )
>ermissive attitude toward sex; (2) freedom for women; (3) high eminine status; (4) welfare more valued than chastity; (5) democratic
litical principles; (6) progressive views; (7) spontaneity, exhibition; (8) ex differences minimized; (9) hedonism, pleasure welcomed; (10) nother worship. Patrist societies displayed opposite tendencies: (1)
estrictive attitude toward sex; (2) restriction of women; (3) women
een as inferior, sinful; (4) chastity more valued than welfare; (5)
luthoritarian politics; (6) conservative, against innovation; (7) inhibi
ion, fear of spontaneity; (8) sex differences maximized, e.g. in dress; (9)
ear of pleasure, ascetic self-denial; (10) father worship. 84 Worshippers of the Great Mother celebrated rites of "love,"
ncluding sexual love, which was often taken as a symbol for all loves,
jxpressed in gestures and acts similar to those of mother-child behavior:
cuddling, breast-sucking, and so on. Conversely, votaries of the rather were ordered to "fear" him (Deuteronomy 6:13). St. Paul
eclared that those who had no fear of God were automatically
inners (Romans 3:18). Christianity gave its followers much to fear, ncluding one of the most sadistic hells ever devised by the human
689



Motherhood imagination, and an implacable God who consigned "most" human
beings to that hell forever, according to his theologians (see Hell). ^^^^^^^m^^^m But the primitive Mother gave comfort and reassurance. Eskimo sha
mans still call her the soul of the universe, never seen, but her voice
can be heard: "a gentle voice, like a woman, a voice so fine and gentle
that even children cannot become afraid. What it says is 'Be not
afraid of the universe.' " 85
Montagu says the mother image is still used to alleviate terror.
"When the male's defenses are down, when he is in extremis, when
he is dying, his last, like his first word, is likely to be 'mother,' in a
resurgence of his feeling for the mother he has never repudiated, but
from whom he had been forced, at the overt level, to disengage himself." 86 Eugene O'Neill expressed the secret longing in a dramat
ic speech:
The mistake began when God was created in a male image. . . . That makes life so perverted, and death so unnatural. We should have imagined life as created in the birth-pain of God the Mother. Then we would understand why we, Her children, have inherited pain, for we would know that our life's rhythm beats from Her great heart, torn with the agony oflove and birth. And we would feel that death meant reunion with Her, a passing back into her substance, blood ofHer blood again, peace ofHer peace! Now wouldn 't that be more logical and satisfying than having God a male whose chest thunders with egotism and \ is too hard for tired heads and thoroughly comfortless?87
The Kagaba Indians expressed the same sentiments in a less
sophisticated but equally forceful song describing their Goddess:
The Mother ofSongs, the mother ofour whole seed, bore us in the beginning. She is the mother ofall races ofmen and the mother ofall tribes. She is the mother ofthunder, the mother ofthe rivers, the mother oftrees and ofall kinds ofthings. She is the mother ofsongs and dances. She is the mother ofthe older brother stones. She is the mother of the grain and the mother ofall things. . . . She is the mother of the dance paraphernalia and ofall temples, and the only mother we have. She is the mother ofthe animals, the only one, and the mother ofthe Milky Way. It was the mother herself who began to baptize. She gave us the limestone coca dish. She is the mother ofthe rain, the only one we have. She alone is the mother ofthings, she alone. And the mother has
left a memory in all the temples. With her sons, the saviors, she left songs and dances as a reminder. 88
Psychologists often regard the universal myth of the Golden
Age as a symbol of childhood. Yet when Plato wrote of the Golden
Age, he apparently took some details from matriarchal societies
familiar to the Greeks as either contemporary or belonging to the recent
past. He said there was "no wildness nor eating of each other, nor any
war, nor revolt amongst them. . . . There were no governments nor
690



wrate possessions of women and children. For all men rose again Motherhood
im the earth remembering nothing of their past. And such things as
vate property and families did not exist." 89 This was regarded as a ^^^^^^^^^
ment of Plato's imagination until research discovered the pre-urban mmunity of the Neolithic cultivator:
There was no ruling class to exploit the villagers, no compulsion to work for a surplus the local community was not allowed to consume, no taste
for idle luxury, no jealous claim to private property, no exorbitant desire for power, no institutional war. Though scholars have long contemptuously dismissed the "myth ofthe Golden Age,
"
it is their scholarship, rather than the myth, that must now be questioned.
Such a society had indeed come into existence at the end ofthe last Ice Age, ifnot before, when the long process ofdomestication had come to a head in the establishment ofsmall, stable communities with an abundant and varied food supply: communities whose capacity to
produce a surplus ofstorable grain gave security and adequate nurture to the young. The rise in vitality was enhanced by vivid biological
insight. 90
At Catal Huyuk, in what is now southern Turkey, a matriarchal nmunity of the 7th millenium B.C., there was no evidence of
eftainship or rivalry, though there were many priestesses. Children re buried in the tombs of their mothers. Art and handicrafts flour
ed, producing obsidian mirrors, copper and lead jewelry and tools, ollen textiles, artistically carved wooden vessels. For 1 500 years en times as long as the existence of the United States of Ameri
the community seemed free of massacre or war. Though many ndreds of skeletons have been found, none showed any sign of
ilent death. 91
Matriarchal Sumeria dominated the Fertile Crescent for 3000 irs with virtually no evidence of warfare.92 Neolithic foundations of
h peaceful societies have been unearthed at Hassuna, Tell Halaf, marra, and Ubaid where there were no gods. Holy icons showed
ly naked women holding or nursing infants.93 Patriarchal religions
idually ousted the ancient matriarchies, chiefly by violence; but ne scholars have suggested that this revolution was neither satisfac
y nor final. The Great Mother, ostensibly overthrown by her sons,
in ineradicable archetype dwelling somewhere in the psyche of every
man being born of woman which means, of course, every man being. The more emphatically she is denied, the more threaten
5 her images appear.94 Ancient myths were not merely allegorizing
len they spoke of the furious wrath of a neglected deity. Even scholars refrain from noticing the everyday words for ances
that clearly indicated matrilineal descent: "forebears," for
imple, a short form of "fore-bearers." Ancestry is called extraction, d obvious reference to what one came out of; similarly descent is
691



Motherhood the "descending" from the womb. From the beginning, it was materr
spirit that fostered cooperation and togetherness in work or worship.
^^^^^^i The maternal totemic clan was by far the most successful form that human association has assumed it may indeed be said that it has been
the only successful one. . . . Political organizations, religious theocracies States, nations, have endeavored in vain to achieve real and complete
social solidarity. They are artificial structures; social humanity has nevei
succeeded in adequately replacing the primitive bond to which it owes its existence. 9S
Medieval ballads depict a pagan world where mothers were the
ultimate authority in every household. Sons appealed to mothers, not fathers, in times of crisis, as the ballad-hero Johnie Cock asked the
help of his mother, and through her, of the Goddess. Christianity however was devoted to destruction of the Goddess and her temples
(Acts 19:27). Clement of Alexandria quoted Christ: "I have come to destroy the works of the female." 96 Christ ordered his followers to
renounce their families (Luke 14:26) and said to his own mother,
"Woman, what have I to do with thee?" (John 2:4). Fathers of the church wrote diatribes against motherhood.97 Western religion conse
quently became an exercise in male-dominated power-seeking.98
Many male scholars still try to pretend there never was a
Goddess, or if there was, she was only a "cult" figure vaguely associab
with sexual promiscuity and/or "fertility." It is not recognized that
religious feeling for the Mother was, if anything, much deeper and more passionate than feelings for a divine patriarch. Deities of both
sexes are styled "gods." Egyptian sacred art showing divine persons w
obvious dangling breasts, is described as a picture of "gods." 99 Scholars carefully avoid quoting ancient texts that say the Primordial
Being was a Creatress, not a Creator. Though she was the central
unifying concept of ancient civilizations, the Great Mother isn't mentioned in ancient-history texts. Scholars' violent denial of the
evidence for the prehistoric matriarchate causes one to suspect that thi
prejudices often blind their eyes, as if a patriarchal culture prevents its
members from comprehending any foreign viewpoint. 100 Freud's ignorance of feminine values left him incapable of undei
standing humanity's most basic bonds. He gave sexuality a primary significance that probably should have been relegated to the mother
child bond instead. Freud admitted that thirty years of practice never
taught him what women really want because, of course, he had already convinced himself that what every woman wanted was a penis. 101 He even went so far as to imagine that a mother loved her
child only because it was, for her, a penis-substitute.
The reason for Freud's failure ofinsight here should by now be plain: in his analysis ofthe development ofthe self, he left out ofaccount the
692



positive influence ofthe other member ofthe family, the mother. Motherhood
Overemphasizing, ifanything, the rule ofthe father, the/ovean, power-seeking, repressive, organizing element in the personality, he
played down the function ofthe mother, with her life-bestowing gifts, ^^^^^^ammm^^m
her relaxing and yielding attitudes, her life-transmitting and life-nurturing functions: the mother's sympathy and responsiveness, her giving ofthe breast to her infant, her special effort to establish an I-and-thou intimacy
through language, her endless ways ofexpressing love. W2
Freudian phallocentrism added to Christian devaluation of the
female tended to perpetuate the common pattern of troubled families, as described by a social worker: "There's always a husband who's
witholding his emotional support and a wife who's unhappy, whose
eeling of personal worth has been damaged." 10? Mumford points aut that devaluation of motherhood leaves children of both sexes cut off
rom a vital experience, the essential basis of all future commitments
to cooperative functioning in the social context. "In repressing the
mothering and nurturing impulses, in the personality, the scientist has ilso lost the normal parental concern for the future life it cherishes. One
lardly knows whether to characterize this attitude as innocence or
atalism; it certainly indicates a failure to reach maturity." 104
Gilder theorizes that few men can attain psychological maturity at ill without a vital connection with the sense of futurity through
ntimate association with a woman. She has, "as part of her very
xuality, a sense of the future: a sense of evolution and growth, a
lotion of deferring pleasures for future gains, a sense of the phases and
leasons of life, a devotion to the value of the individual human being.
These sentiments are the very source of human morality." 105 Indeed
hese are precisely the sentiments embodied in matriarchal religions'
cyclic, future-oriented view of life. Such religions were free of the
leurotic quest for indefinable "meaning" in life, since they never
issumed that life would be required to justify itself. They were also
jenerally free of the anxiety, guilt, and sense of sin imposed by >atriarchal religions, evolved by males made insecure from earliest
hildhood by a social order based on male intimidation and
lominance.
Might-is-right morality was typical of the linear, hierarchical masculine theology. Feminine morality seems to have been both more
iubtle and more affirmative, fostering the same spirit of close cooperaion that enabled humanity to become civilized in the first place.
Despite the basic male need to take part in feminine values, the
>atriarchal society seems to be organized the other way: women are
breed to attain a sense of personal worth by taking part in masculine
values. Instead of aspiring happily to the worthy estate of mother
lood, many women are taught to think it unworthy while they are still
n the "bosom" of the patriarchal family:
693



Motherhood The upwardly mobile career ofevery go-getting woman seems to have been her father's gift to her. As a sop to his male guilt, Daddy may have
goaded daughter to achievements he willfully denied his wife; or as a sop to his male vanity, he may have engendered in her such hurtful feelings offemale worthlessness that only the adoption ofa male-style existence
could appease. But always, it seems, daughter has been vicariously wounded by damage the maternal ego suffered at paternal hands. She may
feel compassion for her mother's plight, or contempt that "Mama let
Papa get away with it,
" or a mixture ofboth emotions, but she invariably
grows up with an almost pathologic horror of "living out Mom 's life all
over again."106
Briffault and other scholars believed devaluation of the maternal
role inflicted injury on males as well as females: "Men have much more
of the 'patriarchal theory' to unlearn. Women have to learn that all
racial ideals that are worth while are ultimately identical with their own
elemental instincts, and are the outcome of them. . . . The compro
mises that govern the relations between the sexes are those that
condition all true human values. ... It is, as of old, the part of the
Vestal Mothers to tend the Sacred Fires. Upon women falls the task not
only of throwing off their economic dependence, but of rescuing from the like thraldom the deepest realities of which they were the first mothers." 107 Even Buddha reached back to basic maternal imagery in his Discourse on Universal Love: "As a mother, even at the risk of her
own life, protects and loves her child, her only child, so let a man cultivate love without measure toward the whole world, above,
below, and around, unstinted, unmixed with any feeling of differing or opposing interests. . . . This state of mind is the best in the world." 108
But no man could achieve it without Motherhood as a model.

Mothering Sunday
nglish pagan Mother's Day honored up to the 18th century a.d. 3n the 4th Sunday of Lent, each person visited his or her mother with
in offering of simnel-cake (Latin simila, "fine flour"), to receive her
Jessing. This was "going a-mothering." Herrick mentioned the custom n his canzonet to the nymph Dianeme, probably Diana of Nemi. The simnel was a manikin, Gingerbread Man, similitude, or Host: a god
eremonially eaten. 1

Mountain
'erhaps more than any other natural objects, mountains most often epresented the Great Mother. In every land the mountains were dentified with breasts, belly, or mons veneris of the Earth, as well as
he paradise where gods live. Chomo-Lung-Ma, "Goddess-Mother of the Universe," is the
world's highest mountain, known in the west, typically, by the name )f a man: Mount Everest. Nearby rises Annapurna, "Great Breast Full
>f Nourishment." 1 There is also Nanda Devi, "Blessed Goddess,"
nother of the river-goddess Ganga (Ganges). These mountains are ome of the Primal Mothers called Himalaya, "Mountains of Heav
:n," which gave rise to the Germanic Himmel, "heaven." 2
Northern Europeans called the home of the gods Himinbjorg, leaven-Mountain. 3 The gods lived on the "lap" of the Great Mother. "This notion of a mountainous situation of the home of the
;ods is one shared by other Indo-European races such as the Greeks
vho settled their pantheon on Mount Olympus; it is surely behind the
walmist's 'I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh
ny help.'"4 Snow-covered, breast-shaped mountains were considered the ource of "help" (or food) from the benevolent Goddess whose white nilk was really water: glacier-fed streams whose waters were often white vith suspended rock dust. The Mountain Mother was both a source
)f life-giving waters, and a Queen of Heaven. One of the oldest titles of
695



Mountain
Dravidian Referring to the cultures of the Dravidian language group in southern and central India, now
ranging from highly civilized people to
preliterate forest primitives. Dravidian languages were rooted
in pre-Aryan Indus Valley civilization, the earliest known in India.
the Hindu triple Goddess Parvati-Kali-Uma was Daughter of Heaven j
(Himalaya). 5 According to the Greeks, the Goddess formerly ruled not I only Mount Olympus, home of the classic gods, but all mountains; hence her title Panorma, "Universal Mountain Mother."6
One of the archaic Goddesses was Niobe, "Snowy One," identi
\
fied with Mount Sipylus, where a water-streaming crag still bears the carved image of a Hittite mother goddess. 7 Mountainous breasts rise in i
County Kerry, Ireland, as double peaks called the Paps of Anu that is, the ancestral Goddess Anu, or Danu, mother of the Tuatha De
Danann. 8 Samoyed shamans believe they must experience a vision of
climbing a magic mountain, where they will meet the Lady of Waters. She is a naked Goddess who accepts the shaman by allowing him to
feed at her breast, saying, "You are my child; that is why I let you suckle
at my breast." 9
Sumero-Babylonian texts spoke of the Mother-mountain where the sun god was daily born and nightly swallowed up. This was
Mashu, "Twin Peaks," as high as the walls of heaven, dwelling in the western garden of paradise by the shores of Ocean. 10 The twin peaks were breasts nourishing heaven, and the mountain had another set of 3
"paps" reaching downward to nourish the underworld, as if it were the two-faced Goddess of life and death. The way into the land of death
was into the Mother-mountain's body, via the Road of the Chariot, or Road of No Return. 1 ' There was a curious resemblance between Mashu of the Sumerians and Macchu Picchu of the Peruvian Incas, another twin-peaked holy mountain where the sun rose and set, tended by priestesses. There as in distant Sumeria, the common name of the Goddess was Mama. 12 The Hindu pantheon was settled on Mount Meru, or Sumeru, the "Good Mountain" located in the north, pointing to an archaic connection between India and Sumeria. 13 The Chinese located their 1
Mount of Paradise in the same general vicinity as Sumeria, in the west. It produced the usual four rivers and was surrounded by "red water" like the River of Blood that surrounded ancient Fairylands. 14 See Menstrual Blood. Iranians said the Lofty Mountain-Mother stood at the center of trK
earth. She was called High Haraiti. At her summit was the Navel of
Waters, "for the fountain of all waters springs there, guarded by a majestic and beneficent Goddess." The Vedas say Yama, Lord of
Death, sits in the midst of the celestial ocean in her highest heaven, oni the Navel of Waters, where "matter first took form." 15 The Japanese combined him with the Mountain-Mother Fuji the Ancestress, and the
magic mountain came to be called Fujiyama. 16
A very old Dravidian form of the mountain-Mother was Hariti, who nursed five hundred supernatural beings at once. 17 The gods she I
696



upported on her lap recall archetypal images of the infant enthroned on Mountain
he mother's body, which is simultaneously "earth" and "paradise." dyths hold many indications of the child-parent relationship between ^^^^^^^^^^^
he god and his feminine support. One of the emblems of Isis was
he Mu'at, "foundation of the throne," meaning hers was the lap the
iharaoh and his divine alter ego sat on, on earth as well as in heaven.
The Persian sun god Ahura Mazda lived in a glowing palace on he summit of Mount Hara, a derivative of Hariti. 18 In Hebrew, hara
tieant both "mountain" and "pregnant belly." 19 In Latin the word
escribed the official diviners called haruspices, those who gaze into
!ie belly that is, entrail-readers. 20
The idea of the Mount of Paradise as the Goddess's belly or vulva
pd to the widespread belief that life-giving rivers of blood emanated
rom it, the "four rivers of paradise" common to Asiatic traditions,
ientified with real rivers by the Bible with lofty disregard for their
eography (Genesis 2:10-14). One of these rivers was Gihon, the lebrew name for the Nile, coming from "the whole land of
Ethiopia." The name was a corruption of Gehenna or Ge-enna, the liver of Ge (Gaea), or of Mother Earth. Or again, the Nile was upposed to emanate from the Mountain of the Moon (Ruwenzori)
(eyond Ethiopia. This was one of the universal female-symbolic images in mytholoy: the lunar mountain, located in a garden of paradise, containing a reat cave or labyrinth, producing the rivers of life. Its genital connota
on could hardly be overlooked. Arabs called it Jebel Ka-Mar, the
Mother-mountain. Even in medieval European romances it was the
aurce of wisdom; Merlin learned his magic by drinking of its
mbrosia. Anointed knights of Charlemagne, searching for the same Durce, traveled to a great cavern under a Mountain of the Moon at le headwaters of the Nile. 21
Egyptians eventually transferred the mystic source of the Nile
fom the remote Mountains of the Moon to the handier first cataract
t Elephantine (modern Jazirat Aswan). This was regarded as the earth's Dni, where the God mated with the Goddess, to produce the annual
utpouring of the Nile. The genital metaphor of the mountain is still
jggested by the word mons, meaning both a mountain and a female
enital. 22
Pyramids and ziggurats were artificial mountains built where the
d was flat, to serve as thrones of the Lord, "high places" for his
cred marriage to the Goddess, earth-wombs for his regeneration, and lrines. Like the Celtic tumulus, a Buddhist reliquary mound or
iipa was also an imitation of the holy mountain, often likened to the
lother's belly. 25 Similar tombs on a larger scale were the Mycenaean
whs tombs, covered with tons of earth to make artificial hills. 24
Eastern lamas were interred in domes or pyramids plated with gold
in
697



Mountain whenever possible, because imperishable gold was the metal of
apotheosis and immortality, making the body imperishable also. 25 In the ^^^^^^^^^^_ west, where gold was not plentiful, the magic mountain was said to be
made of glass or crystal, in imitation of the seven crystalline spheres of heaven. The Celtic after-world centered on a glass castle, perhaps a
misunderstanding of the old word glas, meaning "the blue of heaven." 26 But the crystal mountain was sometimes taken literally. At the Celtic burial mound of New Grange, the surface of the earth-womb wa
once covered by quartz fragments to make it sparkle in the sun like a mound of crystal. 27 The Slavs believed in a crystalline mountain of
heaven, and used to bury bear's claws with the dead, to help them
scramble up the slippery glass. 28 The expression "in seventh heaven" came from the ancient
belief that the seven celestial spheres were arranged like a seven-story
mountain, as shown by the Babylonian ziggurat of seven stages. 29 Below ground, seven concentric "hells" or "pits" reflected the celestial
realm in Sheol, its mirror image in the Abyss, ruled by the queen of
the underworld, who had many names Allatu, Eresh-kigal, Persepho
ne, Hel, Hecate, Nephthys, or the earlier female Pluto but always a dark alter ego of the celestial Goddess. 30
The Babylonian netherworld was "divided into seven zones, like
those of Dante's Inferno, upon the model of the seven planetary
spheres. . . . Seven gates gave admission, each guarded by a porter This idea of the circles of the underworld is also found in the
Egyptian mythology of the ritual of the dead." Like the biblical Joseph,
Assyrian priests went down into the Pit as part of their death-rebirth
initiations. There at the base of the celestial mountain in the land of the
Black Sun, stood "the foundations of the earth, the meeting of the
mighty waters." 51
Initiations everywhere enacted a journey through the nether and
celestial spheres, a symbolic ascent of the mountain. The Norse
father-god Odin himself had to win his wisdom by traversing the "seven
nether spheres" of death. 32 Apuleius described his own initiation into
the Mysteries of Isis as a journey to the land of death, where he beheld
the Black Sun, and saw the deities of the upper and lower worlds
"face to face." Then he rose to the heights, and was exhibited to the
congregation in the costume of the sun god. Mithraic initiates
similarly rose through seven spheres, winning the ranks of Raven,
Bridegroom, Warrior, Lion, Persian, Sun-runner, and Pater (high
priest). 33 Arabs perpetuated the basic Chaldean notion of the cosmos as a
magic mountain with seven ascending spheres and seven under
ground ones; this in turn was based on the Hindu image of Purusha, the
universe personified. "According to the common opinion of the Arabs, there are seven heavens, one above the other, and seven earths,
698



one beneath another. . . . This is explained by a passage of the Koran Mountain I in which it is said that God created seven heavens and as many earths or
i storeys of the earth." 34 Medieval Christians inherited the same idea, ^^^^^^^^^^^
| modeling their cosmos on that of ancient Chaldea. The church officially
(listed the heavens as aerial, ethereal, Olympian, the heaven of fire,
the heaven of stars, the crystalline, and the Empyrean. In the seventh
jheaven "Christ dwells, and this is the especial and proper dwelling iplace of Christ and the angels and saints." 35 Thus the magic mountain was taken over by Christianity, but at the same time the church vigorously condemned all the magic imountains where "witchcraft" carried on worship of the Goddess. Puy
de-D6me in Auvergne was a famous witch-mountain; so was the Brocken or Blocksberg in the Hartz Mountains. Puy-de-D6me had a
(temple served by women called fatuae, "fairies" or "fates," and
\fatidicae, "seeresses." Young girls were periodically initiated into the sect, under the novice-title of bonnes EUes}6 A map made of the Brocken in 175 1 noted that its summit was a
witches' ground, where sabbats were celebrated before an altar by a
magic spring, "formerly consecrated to some false deity of the pagans." 37 This may have been the mountain Pope Pius II called Mons jVeneris, where one could meet witches and demons, "address them and
learn the magic arts." 38 The story of Tannhauser's sojourn in the Mons Veneris or Mount
of Venus (Venusberg) was another relic of fairy-religion, hinting at the existence of a real high priestess powerful enough to defy the pope, and serving the Goddess under the name of Queen Sybil. The
Goddess "still resided in the megalithic temples of western Europe, which were old before the Greeks invaded Greece. Although her
rites were officially forbidden, her worship was celebrated on magical mountains throughout Europe. She came to be confused with the
classical goddess Venus, and her magic mountains were called Venus
bergs in Germany, where the written versions of the Tannhauser
myth seem to have originated. Her worship was celebrated at several
iireal mountains: Horselberg, Waldsee, Freiburg, and Wolkenstein, as well as at peaks in Italy and Scotland In all the Tannhauser myths,
the Queen Sybil is the Goddess Venus." ?9 Sybil was a Latinization of Cybele, the Great Mother of the Gods,
whose worship actually continued in secret up to the 20th century on
Iwild mountaintops in her native Anatolia. Her rites "contained primitive
usages of the religion of Anatolia, some of which have survived to this
jday in spite of Christianity and Islam. Like the Kizil-Bash peasants of
loday, the ancient inhabitants of the peninsula met on the summits of
jjmountains covered with woods no ax had desecrated, and celebrated
their festal days." 40
Throughout the Middle Ages, men believed the Goddess could
699



Mourdad-Ameretat invite them into the interior of her magic mountain, as shown by Mudra many tales Tannha*user was not the only Venus-loving hero. The ^^^^^^^^^^ Danish ballad of The Elfen Hill speaks of a youth enchanted by an
elf-maid's dancing, and invited by her to the interior of her hill. 41 There '
were even indications that the Mountain-goddess was still a trinity.
According to the Thuringian Chronicle of 1 398, she appeared at mid
j
day as three great flames in the air, "which presently ran together in
one great globe of flame, parted again and finally sank into the
Horselbcrg." 42 The Mother-mountains continued to shelter pagan gods, who
were thought to be not dead but sleeping in the terrestrial womb,
awaiting rebirth like Hindu gods between their incarnations. Merlin,
William Tell, Barbarossa, Frederick, and others slept in magic mountains. Many were assimilated to "the figure of Wotan, which survi
these legends of emperors and empires. It is Wotan who is awaiting to reappear in this world ... a dark heathen god-image that has not been
taken into account by the prevailing attitude of consciousness. " 4 *

Ninefold Goddess as the source of "in-spiration," literally breathing i "I-deas" or Goddess-spirits within. The Muses were originally a riad the primordial Triple Goddess. First of them was Mnemos

1
The seven-tone musical scale was the Muses' invention, supposed
I based on their "music" of the seven spheres. Scipio the Elder said
he spheres "produce seven distinct tones; the septenary number is the lucleus of all that exists. And men, who know how to imitate this
elestial harmony with the lyre, have traced their way back to the
ublime realm." 2 Led by Thalia, who governed music in general, the
lassical Muses were Clio (history), Calliope (heroic poetry), Terpsicho
e (dance), Melpomene (tragedy), Erato (erotic poetry), Euterpe flute accompaniments), Polyhymnia (sacred songs), and Urania, the Celestial Aphrodite of the plane of the fixed stars. The Alexandrian
hrine of the Muses was the Museum, "the nearest thing to a modern
miversity that the ancient world experienced." 3 It was destroyed by
christians, who detested pagan learning.

Mother," archaic name for the Egyptian Goddess as a trinity. The
irst of Mut's three heads was the Virgin Maat, wearing the plumes of
""ruth. The second was Hathor, Mother of the World, wearing the ed-and-white crowns of the Two Lands. The third, painted black and
rearing vulture feathers, was Nekhbet, the Crone of Death. 1 The !Joddess's trinitarian name may have been a cognate of Kali's name
701



Mutspell Mutteyalamma, one of her manifestations as a disease-causing
Myrrh Destroyer. ^^^^^^^^^^^ Mut mothered all the gods of Egypt. Though some myths said Isis
was the oldest deity in the world, others claimed Isis was born along
with Osiris from the womb of Mut. Her hieroglyphic sign was a design
of three cauldrons, representing the Triple Womb. 2 See Cauldron;
Trinity. 1. Budge, E.M., 121. 2. Book of the Dead, 205.
Mutspell
"Mother's Curse," the Norse idea of the fate that would overtake the
world at doomsday, as a result of the Goddess's disgust at the actions of men and gods. As the Crone-mother Skadi, she would lay her doom
on the world, and spirits from the hot southern lands of Mutspellheim
would begin to destroy the earth, a mythic reminder of Kali the
Destroyer in her original territory. See Doomsday.
Mylitta
"Birth-producer," a Carthaginian name for the Goddess who, Herodotus said, was Alitta in Arabia, Venus Mylitta in Assyria, and Mitra
in Persia. 1 Carthage had a province named after her, Magasmelita, "Shrine of Mylitta." Like the fish-mother Atargatis or Tirgata, she
personified the primal womb of the Abyss. 2 She espoused the sun god and "quenched the blazing lingam" in the waters of her womb, like all
personifications of the female Deep. 5 The ancient city of Mdina on Malta used to bear her name. 4

Myrrh
Appearing at two crucial points in Christian mythology, at Jesus 's birth (Matthew 2:1 1) and again at his death (Mark 15:23), myrrh
represented the mystic virgin mother who was also Mother Death, called Mary, or Miriam, or Mari, or Myrrha, or as the Christians called the virgin Mary "Myrrh of the Sea." 1
The pagans' version of Mary was the temple-maiden Myrrha, who gave birth to Adonis, "the Lord," in the same cave at Bethlehem that
Christians claimed as Jesus's birthplace. 2 Myrrh was used as aphrodisiac incense in Adonis's rites, and its thorny twigs probably formed the mock crown of the sacred king, still called the Crown of Thorns. Myrrh
was an emblem of Mara, a common Oriental name for the spirit of death. 5
702



Some scholars have offered a theory that myrrh was given Jesus on
(the cross to deaden his pain, because of a Jewish tradition that "the
jkindly women of Jerusalem" used to give myrrh to "those who were led jout to execution."4 The theory cannot be supported, since myrrh has
|no analgesic properties. The women of Jerusalem apparently had another, less kindly reason for giving myrrh to those executed; even early Christians remembered that myrrh meant the death and rebirth of
ja god and was identified with his holy mother.
In the lore of magic, myrrh was credited with power to cause
[menstruation: perhaps a relic of ancient legends of the castrated god's ihedding of the "blood of life." 5

The Victory of Samothrace is probably
better known today than
her inspiration, the preHellenic Goddess nike, was in her day. Her

century, forcefully demonstrates this characteristic. Marble, 98 inches high; 5th century b.c.
osiris was the most ancient and durable of
Egyptian gods, well established by 2000 b.c. and so strong an influence at the beginning of the Christian era that many of his characteristics were reflected in (some say assumed by)

Nagas
Vedic serpent-people, children of the Goddess Kadru. The Nagas guarded treasure in underwater palaces and kept books of mystic knowledge. 1 The real Nagas of southern India were tribes who
retained matriarchal customs, practiced matrilineal inheritance, and laid
no sexual or marital restrictions on women. 2 In return for their proper
reverence for her, their Goddess was supposed to bestow long life on them.
1. Tatz & Kent, 79. 2. Graves, G.M. 1,13.
Nakedness
Tantric sages said one should participate in religious rites "sky clad"
(digambara) or naked, because in the eyes of the Goddess all distinction:
of rank, caste, or class should be put off along with the clothing that
expressed them. 1 The Goddess herself appeared naked, under the nam<
of Nagna, "Nudity." 2 It was widely recognized that the magic of the Goddess dwelt more in the reality of her flesh than in her garments, since creation was a function of the female body, not of any external
accouterments. 3 Moreover, it was her nakedness that exerted its mysteri ous power over the bodies of men. Images of the Naked Goddess
even decorated churches until 1 1th and 12th centuries a.d., especially
in the British Isles. Though many were destroyed, some of these
images still survive.4
By contrast to this earlier emphasis on nakedness, the magic of
men and their gods usually dwelt in their garments. Odin's sayings in the Havamal show that he gave men clothes by which they would put
on "nobility" i.e., power for "the naked man is naught." 5 Patriar
chal societies generally made much of uniforms, vestments, badges of rank, and other decorations by which men defined themselves. Perhaps out of this same sense that nakedness enhanced the power
of women and reduced that of men, Christians were usually opposed
to nakedness even when it was practical, as among tropical peoples. Australian missionaries refused to give food to hungry natives until
they put on clothes. A missionary in the Orinoco regretted that the
natives had not really accepted Christianity, but he confessed himself
706



I "greatly consoled" at having taught native women such modesty that Nakedness
I they would no longer remove their clothes even in bed. 6
Early Christians condemned nakedness because it was characteris- ^^^
I tic of worship of the Goddess. The legend of St. Barnabas tells of the
saint's miraculous destruction of the temple of Aphrodite at Paphos, were he saw "a multitude of men and women celebrating a feast, and running about naked. So wroth was he that he cursed the temple of
these pagans, and instantly the temple fell in ruins, crushing a large number of pagans in its fall." 7
A 4th-century Christian bishop named Priscillian seems to have
I participated in pagan rites. He gave himself to "abominable studies, and held nightly meetings with immodest women and had been accustomed to pray stark naked." 8
Medieval books on sorcery taught that spirits can be raised by
I ceremonial nudity, but this kind of magic is a degradation which "the
foolish dotage of women is subject to fall into." 9 Women continued to
believe in the power of nakedness. Scottish maidens stripped them
I selves naked on the Eve of St. Andrew and recited a prayer "to learn what sort of husbands they shall have." 10 Pierre de Lancre wrote that
"witches in their accursed assemblies are either entirely naked or en
I chemise." 11 Up to the 17th century, ancient fertility rites dictated the
grinding of grain for festival cakes in Ireland with "certain stones," by
girls who had to be completely naked at the time. 12
At the Bulgarian ceremony of the need-fire, "two young men 'whose names must not be spoken' marched in front of the flocks and
herds which were to be driven through the flames, and afterwards stripped themselves naked and kindled the new fire in a wood." At a
i similar ceremony in Serbia, "a naked boy and girl lit the fire by rubbing
j
rollers of wood together." n Even in the present century, Balkan
i peasants and gypsies performed ceremonies requiring them to go naked I in moonlight. 14 Witches sometimes maintain the "sky-clad" tradition,
I as in the Middle Ages they were often accused of worshipping the
j "great Devil" in the form of a large star when they went out naked at
; night. Some medieval heretics called "shepherds" insisted on saying
I Mass while naked, on the theory that "this was the way our father
Adam sacrificed." The Inquisition condemned them, on the ground : that Adam didn't say Mass at all. 15
St. Jerome established the church's policy on female nakedness by
saying women should be so ashamed of their own bodies that they should "blush and feel overcome" at the sight of themselves. For this
reason, no "virgin of full age" should bathe. If she was good-looking, a woman must try to spoil her appearance by "a deliberate squalor" so
she wouldn't distract saintly men from their pure thoughts. 16 Among
medieval nuns therefore, clothing was seldom changed, and dirtiness
i was thought next to godliness. In the 1 5th century, the Adamites of Bohemia associated naked
707



Name ness with humanity's pristine purity, quoting the Bible (Genesis 3:7) to prove that garments were worn only after the first sin was committed.
They advocated nudity and free love to liberate the flesh from sinfulness. Their sect was exterminated in 1421. 17
Nakedness often figured in secret initiations, as advised in a Frencl
mystical book: "The aspirant should become stark naked, should
empty himself completely, should be stripped of all his faculties,
renouncing all his own predilections, his own thoughts, his own will in a word, his whole self." 18 Even here the "self" seemed to be
closely identified with the clothes which, as the world knows, "make the man."

Words for "name" were virtually the same as words for "soul": Irish ainm, Old Welsh
anu, Old Bulgarian /men, Sanskrit naman, Greek onoma, Latin
anima, nomen, and numen. "Irish ainm is 'name' and anim is 'soul, anima.' In certain cases they are declined alike and therefore often confused by students." ?
Name
For the purposes of magic and religion, the name of anything was considered identical with the thing itself, a spiritual "handle" by which
the thing or the supernatural being could be manipulated. Children
and primitives seldom distinguish clearly between the reality and the name of an object. 1 The childlike mind of the Middle Ages couched
the same thought in pseudo-rational terms: "The proper names of
things are certain rays of things, everywhere present at all times,
keeping the power of things, as the essence of the thing signified." 2 Like other Europeans, ancient Britons believed the name and the soul were the same. 4
Each Egyptian's soul-name, the ren, was breathed by a mother on her child as it was first put to her breast; therefore the Goddess of
soul-names was Renenet, who governed lactation. Without its ren, the child would have no identity and would not be allowed to eat. Even
the gods needed mothers to give them names, otherwise they would
pine away and die. 5 The same belief is found in India: the "thousand
eyed god" named Existence cried immediately after he was born, "Give me a name, for without a name I will not eat food." 6
Name-giving was often connected with food-giving. The French
still give a child a nom de kit, milk-name, obviously recalling the preChristian matriarchy where only mothers could give names. 7 Chinese children received a "rice-name" with the first rice; it was supposed to
embody the soul and was kept secret. 8 According to the Bible, infants
were named by their mothers, not their fathers.9 Adam's naming of
the animals, however, was a magical means of making Adam their father, after the manner of Shiva under his title of Prajapati, "Father of the Animals."
Transitions from matriarchy to patriarchy were marked by fathers'
708



takeover of the name-giving function. Brahmans insisted that fathers, Name
not mothers, breathed the essential soul-name into children; thus the soul of a Brahman was called Atman, "the Breath," from which came m^mmm^^m^^^
Greek atmos and German atmen. At each Brahman wedding, long lists
i of "begats" were recited to establish paternal ancestry. Imitators of
S this eastern custom contributed the lists of spurious "begats" in the Old
i Testament. 10 Ancestor worship was instituted in matriarchal times, when tribal
mothers became goddesses who gave their children names. When
patriarchs became synonymous with gods, the system was copied for the other sex. Egyptian priests of Ra claimed their deity created all other
gods by naming them: "It is Ra who made his own names into his
i members, and these became the gods who are in his following. . . . i Ra created the Company of the Gods out of his own names." l ' This
; was intended to uphold the priests' contention that any god one cared
to name was really Ra in disguise. But in a primeval time, Ra himself ex
isted only as a name within the being of his Mother, Ma-Nu, the cosmic abyss. 12
Egyptians remembered that the secret name embodying the soul
jwas mother-given. So did the Phoenicians, Babylonians, Scythians, I and Celtic and Germanic tribes who called themselves by mother's
j names, which encompassed the tribal soul. 13 "Ask a Lycian who he
jis," Herodotus wrote, "and he answers by giving his own name, that of
his mother, and so on in the female line." H
Despite Brahmanism, most of India retained the ancient system of
maternal name-giving. Distribution of family names was governed by the Goddess under her title of Samjna or Saranyu, "the Name," or
"Sign." 15 Chinese family names similarly incorporated the Mothersign, a custom known to date back to the matriarchal age, before people
knew their fathers. 16 The Japanese didn't use patronymics until 1400
|a.d. Previously, children took their mothers' names. 17 See Motherhood. Hellenic Greeks dated their transition from mother-names to
\ father-names back to a quarrel between the god Poseidon and the
goddess Athene. She won, but he oppressed the people to enforce his demands. Athenian women were deprived of the vote, and men were forbidden to take their mother's names as they had done before. 18
Even when calling themselves "patrician" (father-descended), Rotman clans kept the feminine names originating in the pre- Roman
matriarchate, where only mothers embodied clan spirit.
19 The fact that
i Roman women bore clan names like Julia, Claudia, Cornelia, LucreItia, etc., has been misunderstood as evidence of social oppression.
I Bullough said, "Until fairly late in Roman history women even lacked individual names in the proper sense of the term . . . ; mothers i and daughters would have the same name." 20 He missed the point: ! women bore the clan name because they embodied the clan soul,
lipassed in matrilineal succession from mother to daughter.
709



Name The wholly patriarchal Christian system maintained patronymics throughout. In nomenclature, women hardly existed at all. The only
^
i name a woman kept for herself was her baptismal name, sacrosanct
because it was ratified by a male god. Christian baptism didn't mention surnames, because in the middle ages there were still commonlaw rules providing for maternal surnames. Christian women received
the surnames of their fathers, but after marriage even these were given up, so the children inherited no name from the female line. Christian
fathers like Brahman fathers gave children their names by speaking or
sometimes writing them; hence the term "author of my being." Yet
the matronymic survived in some places, such as Spain, even though church councils declared maternal surnames illegal.
21 Scandinavia
remained pagan up to the 1 1th century and retained older systems of nomenclature. Scandinavian women didn't take their husbands' sur
names until the 1 8th century. 22 The great importance attached to names goes back to the
earliest ages, and probably bears a profound psychological relationship t( the human animal's unique ability to verbalize. Names were con
fused with souls almost everywhere. Egyptians said "To speak the name
of the dead is to make them live again." Tomb inscriptions begged passers-by to speak the name of the entombed, to give "the breath of life to him who has vanished." 25 No greater harm could be done to an
Egyptian than to erase the carving or writing of his name. To destroy the very letters meant destruction of the soul. 24
Romans also wanted to preserve the name-soul after death. Romar
epitaphs asked the passer-by to read the name aloud. Wealthy Romans often established endowments for a guild of friends and their
successors to celebrate their names at a banquet, at stated intervals on
the anniversary of death. 25 The Christian practice of writing names on
tombstones developed from the Roman practice of re-creating the
soul in speech. Some said a major purpose of the epitaph was to induce deities to
speak the name, which would insure immortality because any word
spoken by a god became reality. The spoken name in a divine mouth would re-create the actual man. The pharaoh Sesostris I (1965-1934
B.C.) had his name inscribed on the benben-stone (obelisk), remarking that "A name that standeth thereupon is mentioned [by the gods] and
perisheth not in eternity." 26 For the same reason, Babylonian kings prayed to the Goddess Ishtar to give life to their names. 27
On the other hand, a man or god could be cursed if his secret,
magical name was learned by an enemy and spoken in the wrong context. Isis spoke the secret soul-name of Ra to destroy him at the end
of his daily cycle, making him an old man tottering feebly toward his death at sunset. 28 Knowledge of his name brought destruction to
Rumpelstiltzkin in the fairy tale, which may have been a late version
of the myth of Ra and Isis. At times the Goddess invoked the power of her own name, or
710



several of her names, to release forces of creation or destruction. Isis Name
I brought Osiris back to life by invoking herself as Isis and Nephthys. 29
I She fought the dragon of darkness and "obtained mastery over him in ^^^mmm^^^^^

her name of Sekhet, she overpowered him in her name of Khut-nebat
I (Eye of Flame)." 50 Names of the Goddess of creation and destruc
I tion were incongruously applied to Yahweh under his pagan-inspired
i title El Schadaj related to schadajim, "milk-giving breasts," and
I schadaj, "to destroy." 31 Precedents older than civilization evolved the idea that forces of
creation and destruction could be activated by pronouncing a divine
j name. The Mother of Gods controlled her offspring by knowledge of
I their secret names. Early priestly theory proposed that these secret j names could be learned by human beings, who could then control the
gods with them. Brahman priests claimed to control the gods' actions
with mantras incorporating the divine names. Some of their lore was
|
embodied in the Upanishads, which means "secret names." 32 The
j name of the Amida Buddha was so powerful that a priest could send
himself or any other man to the Western Paradise immediately only
| by uttering it. 33 Naturally, priesthoods kept the knowledge of these dread names to { themselves, as it would never do to let ordinary folk use them for free. Hence the Jews' taboo on taking the name of the Lord in vain.
; Common people of the Semitic tribes didn't know their gods' real
I names; they called them simply El or Baal or Adonai, "the Lord." i When the name of the Jewish God became more widely known, the
rabbis said its magic lay in its correct pronunciation, which could be
communicated only once every seven years from an elder priest to a
younger. 34 The name was written on phylacteries which were said to
keep the bearer from every evil after many repetitions of the syllables. Learned Jews said "God brought Israel out of Egypt by means of a Name which consisted of seventy-two Names." 35
The Islamic Allah was even better equipped, with ninety-nine secret names. Moslems claimed he would be compelled to answer
any prayer if all these names were pronounced. Allah himself was called
"the Essential Name," originally the milk-giving Goddess Al-Lat. 36 Pious Moslems invoked Allah's name before sexual intercourse so no
evil spirit could enter the womb and beget an evil child. 37
Both Moslems and Christians inherited Jewish name-magic and
believed that all sorts of miracles could be worked by invoking the
name of God or the name of Christ, to say nothing of their secret
names. In the Middle Ages it was believed that any priest could
absolutely compel God to do whatever was asked, by conducting a Mass of the Holy Spirit which mentioned God's secret name. 38 The
powers of God's name were explained by Henry Morley as follows:
Whoever knows the true pronunciation ofthe name Jehovah the name from which all other divine names in the world spring as the branches from a tree, the name that binds together the sephiroth whoever has that

Name
Origen (Origenes Adamantius) Christian father, ca. 185-254
a.d., an Egyptian who wrote in Greek,
exerting a powerful influence on the early Greek church. At first he was accounted a saint, but three centuries after his death he was declared a heretic because of Gnostic elements found in his writings.
Enchiridion A book
of magic spells, charms, and secret names
allegedly written by Pope Leo the Great, who presented it to Charlemagne to insure his continuing good luck.
in his mouth has the world in his mouth. When it is spoken angels are
stirred by the waves ofsound. It rules ail creatures, works all miracles, it commands all the inferior names ofdeity which are borne by the
several angels that in heaven govern the respective nations of the earth. J9
Early in the Christian era, when Christians were struggling to
separate their sect from Judaism, many stories were invented to prove
the name of Christ superior in magic efficacy to the name of God. One such story from the Life ofPope Silvester told of a duel of holy
names performed by the pope and a Jewish rabbi, in the presence of the Empress Helena, mother of Constantine. The Jew said God's secret
name was so powerful that no unprepared creature could hear it and
live. To prove his point, he whispered the name into the ear of a bull,
which immediately fell dead. Then the pope pronounced the secret
name of Christ in the dead bull's other ear, saying, "Bull, arise; go back
to thy herd"; and the bull got up and went. 40 Silvester scoffed at the
Jew's claim to mastery of the divine name's fatal power, asking him,
"How is it, then, that thou thyself hast heard this Name and hast not
died?" 41 The Jew didn't answer.
Both Jewish and Christian Gnostics focused on the power of
divine names to bring about healing, exorcism, absolution, and salvation. In the Pistis Sophia, Jesus told his disciples to "hide the
mystery" of a great Name that could dissolve evil and "blot out all
sins, done knowing or not knowing." 42 According to the Gospels, this was the esoteric secret that Jesus concealed from all but his intimates.
The masses were not told, "lest at any time they should be converted,
and their sins should be forgiven them" (Mark 4:1 1), indicating that
early Christianity like other mystery-religions addressed itself to a favored few. Jesus gave the disciples his secret name, which had
power to exorcise, when he said "In my name shall they cast out devils"
(Mark 16:17). Seventy of his followers told him, "Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name" (Luke 10:17). Origen said
Jesus's name had "expelled myriads of evil spirits from the souls and bodies of men." 45 According to the Enchiridion, the powers of Jesus's name were so far-reaching that it was hard to see how anything could
possibly go wrong in a world where it was spoken:
O sacred Name, Name which strengthens the heart ofman, Name oflife,
ofsalvation, ofjoy, precious Name, resplendent, glorious, agreeable Name, which fortifies the sinner, Name which saves, conserves, leads and rules all . . . wheresoever the most sweet Name ofJesus is pronounced
. . . the demons take flight, every knee is bent, all temptations, even the
worst, are scattered, all infirmities are healed, all disputes and conflicts between the world, the flesh and the devil are ended, and the soul is rilled
with every heavenly delight. H
The esoteric secrets of Judeo-Christian name-magic were bor
rowed from Egypt, where the angels of light baffled the forces of darkness with words of power, and set forth in works like the Book of
712



lEnoch, which depicted the archangel Michael battling dark angels with Name
Isimilar words:
This is the number ofKesbeel, who showed the head ofthe oath to the holy ones when he dwelt high above in glory, and its name is Beqa. And this angel requested Michael to show him the hidden name, that they might mention it in the oath, so that those who revealed all that was hidden to the children ofmen might quake before that name and oath.
And this is the power ofthat oath, for it is powerful and strong, and he placed this oath Akae in the hand ofMichael. 4t.
This passage was garbled Egyptian resurrection-magic. "Those jwho revealed all that was hidden" were the serpent deities who gave
imankind holy secrets, against the will of heaven. "The oath Akae" jwas Aqa, the rudder of the boat of the dead, "shiner in the water, hidden beam." The name of Aqa had to be spoken before a dead Iman could enter the boat that plied the heavenly Lake of Reeds. 46 It was
among the words of power by which Ra's angels battled the dragon of
night: "When these gods rich in, magic spoke, it was the very spirit (ka) Df magic, for they were ordered to annihilate my enemies by the
effective charms of their speech." 47 Ethiopian and Abyssinian Christians retained the notions of
Egyptian paganism in regard to words of power (hekau). Their vision of pie War in Heaven was simply the battle between Ra and the serpent
bf darkness. They said God's armies were twice overthrown, and Satan was about to assume control of the universe, when God sent his
angels one last time into the fight, armed with a cross of light bearing the three secret names of the trinity. "When Satan saw the Cross and the Three Names of Power, his boldness and courage forsook him, his
arms lost their strength and the weapons which he was wielding fell from them and he and his hosts turned their backs and were hurled
down into the abyss of hell by the now invincible angels of God."
The same trinity, however, came into being from the same abyss, the Great Mother Ma-Nu, within whom the triple male god "at first
existed in name only."48 That is, he/they came into being because the
[Mother spoke his/their name(s). It was believed that the very existence of this trinity depended on continual mention of its/their holy name in the mouths of men.
Egyptian faith in the efficacy of speaking the trinitarian name was
laken over by Christians, who viewed "In the name of the Father, of ihe Son, and of the Holy Ghost" as a magic formula second to none. It
could cure disease, chase away vermin, protect worldly goods and acquire more of them. 49 Pope Alexander III forbade monks to study
medicine, on the ground that all sickness was caused by demonic
([possession and the only proper remedy was exorcism by the trinity's oly names. 50
Holy names constituted the effective portion of any Christian
remony. Absolution gave a typical formula: "I absolve thee from all
y sins in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
713



Name
Henry Cornelius Agrippa von Nette

Occult Philosophy, which attempted to reconcile magic, theol
ogy, physics, mathematics, alchemy, and cabalism.
Spirit." Extreme unction was a string of invocations; 'in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, may there be
extinguished in thee every power of the Devil by the imposition of
our hands, and by the invocation of all the holy Angels, Archangels,
Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors, Virgins, and all the Saints." Even longer lines of holy names marched through the
litany for the dying: "Go forth, Christian soul, from this world in the Name of God the Father Almighty, who created thee; in the Name of
the Holy Spirit, who was poured out upon thee; in the Name of the
holy and glorious Mother of God, the Virgin Mary," and so on, through long lists. Holy water for dedicating a church was exorcised
with the formula: "I conjure thee thou creature of water, in the name oi
the father, and of the son, and of the Holy-ghost, that thou drive the
devil out of every corner and hole of this church, and altar; so as he remain not within our precincts." 51 The holy names were not merely symbols. Words spoken "in the name of Jesus" or "in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost"
were supposed to have absolute efficacy in expelling demons from
altars, candles, fonts, even church hassocks, just as Egyptian hekau could expel demons from a pyramid. 52 Certainly man never invented a
weapon easier to use against the evil powers that he felt threatening him on all sides. Nothing could induce him to abandon it, then or now.
Agrippa von Nettesheim tried to explain the efficacy of holy name
in pseudo-rational style, ending with a wholly irrational description of such names as "vehicles of Divine omnipotence, not fixed by men or by
angels but by the great God himself in a certain way according to a number and figure which are unchangeable by reason of their eternal
stability; they breathe the harmony of Divinity and are sanctified by God's help. . . . The heavenly powers fear these Divine names, Hell trembles at them, the angels worship them, the bad demons dread
them, all creatures revere them." 53
Yet infernal names were considered just as effective as divine ones.
Romanians converted the pagan Mother Death into a witch from the
Mount of Olives, called Avestitza, or "Wing of Satan." She was dangerous to most human beings, but could not harm anyone who learned and wrote down her nineteen secret names. 54
Priests and magicians, Christian or pagan, operated on the same
premise that the names of supernatural beings would call them and
compel them to perform the required task. Magic books and church
liturgies were near akin in intention. One typical book of necromancy
provided impressive lists of secret names, guaranteed to work.
This is the earliest name ofTyphon, at which tremble the earth, the abyss,
Hades, heaven, the sun, the moon, the place ofthe stars and the whole phenomenal universe. When this name is spoken, it carries along with its force gods and demons. It is the hundred-lettered name, the same name as last written. And when thou hast uttered it, the god or the dead
person who hears it will appear to thee and will answer concerning the
714



things you ask. And when you have learned all things, dismiss the god only with the strong name, the one of the hundred letters, saying "Begone, Lord, for thus wills and commands the great god!" Say the name and he
will depart. ss
Another source mixed Jewish and Greek gods in a spell for
jailing a spirit of divination into a vessel of water, also for breaking
mains, blinding enemies, bringing dreams and divine favors.
I invoke thee who created the earth and the bones (rocks) and all flesh and spirit and established the sea, and shakes the heavens and did divide the
light from the darkness, the great ordering mind, who disposes all, the everlasting eye, Demon ofDemons, God ofGods, the Lord ofSpirits, the unwandering Aeon. Iao ouei, hearken unto my voice. I invoke thee
the ruler of the gods, high-thundering Zeus, O king Zeus Adonai, O LordJehovah. lam he who invokes thee in the Syrian tongue as the great
god Zaaler iphphou (Baal-zephon), and do not disregard the sound in Hebrew ablanathanalba abrasiloa. S6
The longer and more sonorous the spell, the more holy or
jly names it mentioned, the more effective it was supposed to be. A
al love-charm invoked Greek, Egyptian, and Babylonian under
ld deities, as it was placed on a grave to carry the message down to i via the deceased.
I place this charm down beside you, subterranean gods, Kore, Persepho
ne, Ereshkigal and Adonis, Hermes the subterranean, Thoth and the strong Anubis, who hold the keys ofthose in Hades, the gods ofthe underworld and the daimons, those untimely reft away, men, women, youths and maidens, year by year, month by month, day by day, hour by hour. I conjure you, all daimons assembled here. . . . Betake yourselfto that place and that street and that house and bring her hither, and bind
her. . . . Let her sleep with none other, let her have no pleasurable intercourse with any other man, save with me alone. Let her neither drink
nor eat, nor love, nor be strong nor well, let her have no sleep except
with me, because I conjure you by the terrible terror-striking name ofhim, who, when his name is heard, will cause the earth hearing it to open;
the daimons, hearing his fearful name, will be afraid, the rivers and the
rocks, hearing his name, will burst. S7
The Christian church taught that no demon could be exorcised
efore his own name was known, following the example of Jesus 'ho demanded the names of the devils he cast out of the Gadarene
Mark 5:9). The Rituale Romanum printed in 1947 prescribed that a riest must demand the devil's name and rank, "and the devil, like a risoner of war, was in honor bound to respond." 58 Precedents dated
ack, not only to the Gospels, but also to the Magic Papyri where secret
ames of God were multiplied endlessly in the effort to learn a spirit's ame:
/ conjure thee by the God ofthe Hebrews, Jesus, Jaba, Jae, Abraoth, Aia, Thoth, Ele, Elo, Aeo, Eu, Jiibaech, Abarmas, Jabarau, Abelbel, Lona, Abra, Maroia, Arm, appearing in fire, thou, Tannetis, in the midst of

One rabbinical tradition anathematized Christian use of holy
names to bring about everything from exorcism to resurrection; but
Christianity could hardly have existed without it. Jesus said, "I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me. . . . And I
have declared unto them thy name" (John 17:6, 26), copying the
Egyptian magician's secret communication of a divine name: "I am he whom you [the god] met under the holy mountain and to whom you
gave the knowledge of your greatest Name, which I shall keep holy, communicating it to none save to your fellow initiates in your holy
rites."60 Magic books attributed to Pope Honorius, famed as a wizard
despite his pontifical rank, plainly listed the seventy-two secret names of God and demonstrated their use in conjurations. For any modern \
reader who may wish to test their efficacy, they are: Trinitas, Sother,
Messias, Emmanuel, Sabahot, Adonay, Athanatos, Jesu, Pentagna, Agragon, Ischiros, Eleyson, Otheos, Tetragrammaton, Ely, Saday, Aquila, Magnus Homo, Visio, Flos, Origo, Salvator, Alpha et Omega,

Mischiros, Charitas, Aeternas, Creator, Redemptor, Unitas, Summum
Bonum, Infinitas, Jehovah, Agla, Sady, Gog and Magog.61 Christians maintained even up to the present day the old pagan
belief that to speak the name of a dead person could call up his ghost,
therefore such a name must be accompanied by the formula "God rest
him," to keep him in the grave where he belonged. Pliny said Roman pagans used the same formula for speaking of the dead. 62 It was also
thought a disaster to have a dying person carry one's name in his
mouth through the passage into death. If a dying man cursed his enem;
by name, the enemy would also die, obviously in accord with the
ancient belief that a name was a vital part of the soul.65
One tradition Christians deliberately forgot, however, was the oldest of all: that mothers gave children their name-souls while baptizing them with milk from their breasts. Pagan mothers continued

jleogram meaning "sea." She appears to have been identical with riamat or the primal mother called Ma-Nu in both India and Egypt,
e., the Deep that existed before creation. According to Sumerian
briptures, she "gave birth to heaven and earth." 1

niana
virgin mother of Attis, cognate with Norse Nanna, Anatolian Anna, bumerian Inanna; a priestess-incarnation of the Goddess, like Adonis's 'irgin mother Myrrha. In ancient Uruk, the name of Nana meant 'Moon." The same name was applied to the same deity in Dahomey, vhere the first man and woman were born of Nana-Buluku, the 'Moon-Sun." 1

Nanda Devi Nanda Devi
Nave "Blessed Goddess," the mountain-mother who gave birth to the
Ganges; one of the holiest mountains of the Himalayan chain (see
Mountain). The nearly inaccessible peak of Nanda Devi lay beyond walls of rock and ice, none less than 18,000 feet high. The Blessed Goddess was finally approached by climbers in 1936.
Nanshe
"Interpreter of Dreams," Babylonian title of the Goddess who gave
her priests the ability to interpret and prophesy from other men's dreams. To acquire this ability, priests underwent an initiation cere
mony of descent into her "pit," a symbolic death and resurrection, like that of the Old Testament Joseph who interpreted Pharaoh's dreams afterward. Nanshe was also a Goddess of water and fertility, her symbol
a vessel of water with a fish in it, signifying the gravid womb. 1 Joseph
practiced divination by means of his "cup," which was probably a Vess< of Nanshe (Genesis 44:5, 15). See Abaddon.

Narcissus
Greek flower-god who died looking at this own reflection in the pool
of the nymph Echo. As a deity of spring vegetation he was an alternate
form of Dionysus (Antheus), who was caught by the Titans with a magic mirror or reflecting pool inhabited by water nymphs who seized his soul. 1 Once his soul was caught, the god died and sprang up again
as spring flowers. The Hellenic myth that Narcissus pined away for lov<
of his own reflection was an imaginative revision of the older story of
a human sacrifice at the springtime Heroantheia, or "Hero-Flowering/ 1. Graves, CM. 1,288.
Natron
"Birth fluid," the brine in which Egyptian mummies were pickled.
Curing in salt water was a magical imitation of fetal existence. The
mummy was supposed to be awaiting rebirth from the Goddess's womb.
Nave
Central aisle of a church, from navis, a ship; medieval churches
copied the ship shape of Norman burial mounds. 1 Nave also meant the

Necromancy
Divination by the dead," one of the world's most popular forms of
magic, still widely practiced under the new name of spiritualism or mediumship. The basic idea was (and is) direct communication with the dead, to discover the secrets of the after-life and the future.
The idea of necromancy underlay every salvation cult. Every Savior came back from the land of death to tell his followers how to
avoid its pitfalls and attain blissful immortality. Such information consti
tuted the Mystery-teachings of Orphism, of Eleusis, of Samothrace, I land of the Dionysian cults as well as those of Osiris, Pan, Adonis,
| Tammuz, Krishna, Balder, Zalmoxis, and Christ. But not only . Saviors and sacred kings returned from the land of death. Any ghost
I could do so, if properly summoned.
Homer depicts Odysseus performing necromancy with sheep's t jblood, to call the dead from Hades and speak with them. 1 A gift of blood was always most welcome to the "shades" who were bloodless. This idea led on to medieval terrors like vampires and revenants who
i came back from the grave in search of blood.
The Bible shows Saul incapable of practicing necromancy for I himself, as Odysseus did. To consult the ghost of Samuel, Saul needed the help of the wise-woman miscalled the "witch" of Endor.
The text does not describe her as a witch, but as a "woman that hath
| a familiar spirit" (1 Samuel 28:7). She is an obvious fraud, presenting to Saul under cover of darkness an obscure figure hidden in a mantle,
speaking in whispers, as ghosts were supposed to do. Saul, overcome by superstitious terror, bows his face to the ground and never even tries
i to get a good look at the apparition (1 Samuel 28:14). Romans also had necromantic specialists, though the ordinary
> citizen could deal in a small way with ancestral ghosts, making
i offerings to them on the nights of the Lemuria. 2 Once each year, priests
i called up the ghosts dwelling in the pit under the lapis manalis or "soul stone" in the Forum, to consult them for omens. 3
Northern tribes had similar customs, consulting ancestral ghosts at
Samhain, the Feast of the Dead, which became Christians' All Hallows or Halloween. "Ghost" and "guest" both descended from BGermanic Geist because the death's-heads really did attend the feasts
las honored guests.4
Christians also believed in, and practiced, necromancy. St. Clem
[ |ent the Roman, called the third pope after Peter, paid a necromancer
a large sum of money to call up a spirit from the underworld and
(question it concerning the after-life. 5 Raising the dead Lazarus to life

Nehellenia Nehushtan
Rituale Romanum Catholic handbook of rites and ceremonies, with prescribed phrases and gestures for every
again for a while was one of the miracles that defined the divinity ol;
Christ; yet, Scot asked, how is that "witches do the same, and it is
called necromancy?" 6 Necromancy came to be known as "black magic" through a linguistic blunder. The Greek root nekros, a corpse, was corrupted to j
Latin niger, "black"; this gave nigromancy, the "black art." 7 A curious necromantic notion of the resurrection of the flesh
underlay the church's procedure for canceling excommunication of a
corpse. The Rituale Romanum said:
Ifthe body be not yet buried, let it be lightly beaten with a rod or small cords after which it shall be absolved. . . . But ifit hath been already
buried in unconsecrated ground, ifit may be conveniently done, let the body be exhumed, and after it hath been lightly beaten in like manner and then absolved let it be buried in consecrated ground; but ifthe body
cannot conveniently be disinterred, then the grave shall be beaten And ifthe body be already buried in consecrated ground, it shall not be
disinterred, but the grave shall be lightly beaten. 8
As a rule, Christian authorities reserved for themselves all
dealings with the dead and regarded any lay necromantic or spiritualist activities as heresy, if not diabolism. In 1866 the Second Plenary
Council of Baltimore forbade the faithful to attend seances, even if
motivated only by idle curiosity; "for some, at least, of the manifesta
tions must necessarily be ascribed to Satanic intervention since in no
other manner can they be understood or explained."

Holland after a great storm in 1 646 washed away the soil that had buried them. 1

Nehushtan
Semitic serpent god whose idol was made by Moses (2 Kings 18:4). Hebrew Nehushtan or Nahash, "serpent," descended from the Vedic
serpent-king Nahusha, once ruler of all the gods, later cast down to the underworld by Indra. 1 Gnostic Jews worshipped Nehushtan in the
first few centuries ad. and were known as Naassians, "snake-worship
pers," counterparts of the Ophites (see Serpent).

Meith Neith
Triple Goddess of Sais, also called Anatha, Ath-enna, Athene, Nemesis Medusa. Egyptians said her name meant "I have come from myself." She was the World Body, the Primal Abyss from which the sun first ose, and "the Cow, who gave birth to Ra." ' She was the Spirit Behind
:he Veil, whom no mortal could see face to face. She called herself
'all that has been, that is, and that will be," a phrase copied by the
Christian Gospels (Revelation 1:8). She was older than dynastic
Egypt. Her symbol was borne by a prehistoric clan, and her name by yvo queens of the first dynasty. Greeks knew her as Nete, one of the
Driginal trinity of Muses at Delphi. 2 In the Bible she was called Asenath (Isis-Neith), Great Goddess of the city of Aun, which the Jews rendered "On." Her high priest
Potiphar was made her "father," as Teiresias was made the "father" of the Goddess Mante, and Brahma was made the "father" of the
oddess Sarasvati (Genesis 41:45). The Goddess herself was made the
spouse of Joseph, whose Egyptian name meant "he who was brought to life by the word of the Goddess (neter)." ?

Archaic Egyptian name for Mut, the Vulture-goddess of death and

religion.

her holy groves were cognates: Nemea, Diana Nemetona, the Celtic
Nemhain, Merlin's Nimue, the Mother of the ancient Nemed or
"moon-people." Ovid called Nemesis "the Goddess that abhors boastful words," because she brought all kings and heroes down to destruction in the
end, no matter how arrogant they might become. 5 The Stoics wor
shipped her as the world-governing principle of Nature, which in time reduced all things to their component elements. Even Zeus feared
Nemesis, for she was once his destroyer and devourer, the Goddess who gave both birth and death to all gods. 4 She was sometimes entitled
Adrasteia, the Inescapable One. 5

Nereids
Greek catchall term for fairies, nymphs, mermaids, female nature spirits. Mount Parnassus has Nereid Pits and a Nereid Spring; a whole mountain on Crete is the Nereid Castle. As shape-shifters, Nereids
appeared sometimes as beautiful women, sometimes as animals. Chris
tians called them "she-devils" and their leader a Lamia. 1
1. Hyde, 143-46.
Nereus, Saint
Spurious canonization of the pagan god Nereus, an "old man of the sea" born of the Goddess under her name of Nereis, queen of Nereids. The original Nereus was confused with Proteus, the "first man," and
probably with Noah. 1 Christian legend made him one of a pair of eunuchs, Nereus and Achilleus, whose claim to sainthood was that they convinced a rich woman to remain a virgin for the sake of her soul.
The story may have begun with a funerary portrait of the woman, Flavia Domitilla, flanked by her family deities Nereus and Achilles. 2

Jergal
kkkadian underworld god, consort of Eresh-kigal, the queen of the
iiades. The Bible says the men of Cuth made Nergal's image (2 Kings
7:30). A prince of Babylon was named "Nergal-Preserves-Me" eremiah 39:3). Since Nergal represented another form of the nether
[lack Sun like Hades, Pluto, and Saturn he was assimilated to
Christian legend as a demon. 1

Nergal Neter
Jeter
.gyptologists found in ancient Egypt a concept they could equate [ith their own notions of a supreme God, though they did so only by ;noring the matter of gender since all evidence suggests that this
rimal being was female. Mariette Bey wrote: "At the head of the
gyptian pantheon soars a God who is one, immortal, uncreated, jvisible and hidden in the inaccessible depths of his [sic] essence; he
ic] is the creator of the heavens and of the earth; he [sic] has made
verything which exists and nothing has been made without him [sic]."
be Rouge gushed: "The unity of a supreme and self-existent being,
is [sic] eternity, his [sic] almightiness, and eternal reproduction thereby i God; the immortality of the soul, completed by the dogma of unishments and rewards; such is the sublime and persistent base which
1 . must secure for the beliefs of the ancient Egyptians a most
onorable place among the religions of antiquity." ' De Rouge and Mariette spoke of the concept of neter (also
indered nether, nuter, or Nu), usually translated "God" or "gods" liough several of the seven Hathors had the name of Neter. They ruled
ie womb of rebirth, the seven-layered after-world known as Khertjleter or Neter-Khertet. 2 Male gods were called neter only when they
tore artificial breasts. 3 Neteritox nutrit, "nurturer," was a common
/nonym for "Goddess." 4 She-nit or She-neterv/ere Fate-goddesses who form the conditions of the lives of men." 5 The Book ofthe Dead distinguished between gods and the netriox
'utri: "I am devoted in my heart without feigning, O thou netri more
nan gods." A king was told that in his after-life he lived "by the side of a
ieter" like a Hindu god with his shakti. Every king was warned that
|e was "only the guardian of goods and provisions which belonged to he neter." She provided all subsistence, and property, and children;
hid she opposed would-be tyrants.6
Neter netri was defined as "self-produced, primeval matter," the >cean of uterine blood before creation, holding future forms in the
ondition of formlessness or Chaos. Scholars actually translated this
oncept "Lake of God." 7 Its real meaning lay in the root syllable Nu,

Neter or Nut, "an ocean infinite in extent and of fathomless depth, bearing
the germs of all kinds of life," like Kali's primordial womb. The
^
ma^^ power of Nu was "the self-created," "maker of the gods," and "creato:
of men." She existed before the sky, the earth, mortals, or gods. From Nu the sun was born; therefore Nu and the Great Mother were one and the same.8 The sun went back into Mother Nu's "great gate" in the west
when he died. Nu was also the hieroglyphic symbol of water that the Goddess Nut carried on her crown. Nu was the Triple Goddess, show
in tomb carvings as three cauldrons. Nu "maketh fertile the watery
mass of heaven, and maketh to come forth water on the mountains to
give life to men." 9 Nu became the Semitic nun, primal sea personi
fied as the Fish-mother (see Fish). She was incarnate in the sacred
harlots of Erech, known as nu-gig. 10
This primal sea was likened to the menstrual blood of the Great
Mother Goddess Tiamat, the creatress, who menstruated for three
years and three months to produce enough life-giving essence to give birth to the universe. 11 This flow was the Nether Upsurge, or
Fountain of the Deep, emanating from her "holy door" designated by the letter dahth or delta, the sign of the yoni. (See Demeter;
Triangle.) With a vowel point, dahth formed the Hebrew word ed, erroneously translated "mist" in Genesis 2:6: "But there went up a mist
from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground." The origin
meaning was not "mist" but something like a mighty fountain or
spring, an unexplained upwelling of fluid from the bowels of the earth, which soaked the ground (adamah) to make it fertile, before the sending of rain from Father Heaven. This was what other Middle
Eastern scriptures called the Nether Upsurge: female fluid from the
deeps, bursting forth to meet a male fluid from the clouds. 12 Other Oriental sources show that the original sacrament of creation called
for a meeting of semen and menstrual blood "like the pouring of water
into water," as in the meeting and mingling of the powers of Kali and
Shiva, or of Tiamat and Apsu. Subsequently, adamah brought forth lift Adamah really meant "blood-red soil," and other myths clearly state that the Nether Upsurge from the interior of Mother Earth was
not mist but life-giving uterine blood. The ancients often likened blood
to salt water, which was regarded as the arche, the first of all elements from which the others were born. 13 Salt water was "birth fluid"
(natron), representing regenerative Mother-blood. And Mother
blood was the vehicle of that world-creating spirit called neter, nether, etc., which Egyptologists insisted on confusing with their own concept of God.
To the great and supreme Power which made the heavens, the gods, the
earth, the sea, the sky, men and women, animals and creeping things, all that is and all that is yet to come into being, the Egyptians gave the name ofneter or nether, a word which survives in Coptic under the form nuti . . . Dr. Brugsch defined neter to mean "the active power whic
724



produces and creates things in regular recurrence; which bestows new Nicholas, Saint life upon them, and gives back to them their youthful vigor. . .
" [T]he innate conception ofthe word completely covers . . . the Latin natura ^^^^^^_^^^^_
. . . the great cosmic powers, and the beings who although held to be "divine" were yet finite and mortal . . . were called neteru, and the
word is translated "gods" by Egyptologists. H
It seems, however, that "gods" didn't even begin to cover the
ue meaning of the ancient word neter, a relic of primitive matriarchal
ligion. Budge says:
One knows not exactly the meaning ofthe verb nuter, which forms the radical ofthe word neter, "god.
" It is an idea analogous to "to
become, " or "to renew oneself. " ... In other words, it has the meaning of
god, but it teaches us nothing as to the primitive value of this word. We
must be careful . . . not to let it suggest the modern religious or philosophical definitions ofgod which are current today . . . ; neter appears to mean a being who has the power to generate life, and to maintain it when
generated. IS
Naturally, at the time when this crucial word was coined, the ower to generate life was believed to be solely female (see Mother
:ood). It was the Goddess only who was "self-renewing" and the
jnirce of all "becoming." 16 Moreover, Egyptian writings contradict Egyptologists who want to call neterit "gods." The gods in the train
r Ra were strongly differentiated from neterit, whom Ra's priests called
Wemptible beings. 17 In the time of Queen Hatshepsut, the neterit ere not contemptible but divine beings; however, they "ruled without a" and paid no attention to his commands. In some way they had
een "made distant" and their footprints were gone from the earth. 18
lere it seems the neterit were nothing more nor less than deified
iiaternal ancestresses, like the matrikadevis of ancient India and the disk
i Scandinavia.
After the 20th dynasty the early religion of Egypt was fragmented hd lost in confusion under the rule of new patriarchal gods, like Ra.
fudge says, "Knowledge of the early dynastic religion of Egypt pos
ted by the priests in general after, let us say 1 200 B.C., was xtremely vague and uncertain. The result of this was to create in their
jligion a confusion which is practically unbounded." 19

Nicholas, Saint
{ bogus saint evolved from the pagan sea god who replaced Artemis
s patron of sailors and harlots. 1 Temples of Poseidon became shrines of
725



Nicholas, Saint St. Nicholas, who also inherited Poseidon's popular title, "the
Sailor." 2 ^^^^^^^^^^ Nicholas's Christian name was the same as Old Nick, or Hold
Nickar, the Teutonic sea god known as king of the nixies (sea
nymphs). Nicholas was also equated with Woden. As European pagan deities were Christianized, the benevolent aspect of Woden became
St. Nicholas (Santa Claus), who galloped over housetops during the winter solstice as the elder god did, granting boons to his worshippers
below. 3
In Italy, St. Nicholas supplanted a female boon-giving deity calta The Grandmother, or Pasqua Epiphania, or Befana, who used to fill the children's stockings with her gifts.
4 The Grandmother was ousted from her shrine at Bari, which became the center of St. Nicholas's
cult. Christian sailors carried the saint's image out to sea on his feast da
as pagan sailors formerly carried the image of the sea god or goddess. 5
Some bones were collected in the 1 1th century a.d., installed in a
church built at Bari to house them, and labeled the bones of
St. Nicholas. 6
This was the real beginning of St. Nicholas's cult, though his
Christian legend claimed (quite without foundation) that he had been
a bishop of Myra in the 4th century. His official biography was
preposterous. As an infant he fasted, said the hagiographers, taking his mother's breast only once on Wednesdays and Fridays. He became
a bishop on account of his predecessor's prophetic dream, because he was the first man to enter the church next day. He resurrected the dea*
from a magic cauldron. He instantly halted a violent storm at sea to
save three drowning sailors. He miraculously multiplied a shipment of grain to feed a whole diocese for two years, with enough seed left
over for future crops vastly surpassing Christ's miracle of the loaves and fishes. After his death he achieved even greater feats. His bones
exuded a fountain of holy oil that could cure every disease. 7
The original pagan god Nicholas gave rise to a Gnostic sect of Nicolaites who worshipped him with his cauldron of regeneration as a
fertility figure. They "held that the only way to salvation lay through frequent intercourse between the sexes." 8 Like other worshippers of
the sexual fertility principle, pagan or Christian, the Nicolaites were
surpressed; but sexual symbolism persisted in the sigil of St. Nicholas's Day in the runic almanac: a furka combined with a yonic mandorl
In ancient Egypt, this was a sign of the phallus of Set in conjunction
with the goddess's genital oval. 9 Another symbol of St. Nicholas was th
cluster of three golden balls, adopted as a crest of the Medici family
and later as a sign of pawnbrokers. 10 The Dutch called St. Nicholas Sinte Klaas, and carried his cult to the New World where the name was corrupted to Santa Claus.

Ninian, Saint
Mythical missionary, said to have converted the southern Picts to
Christianity in the 2nd century a.d., many centuries before Christianity actually touched the British Isles. The spurious Life ofSt Ninian,
"Apostle to the Southern Picts," was written in the 12th century a.d. b] a Cistercian monk. This imaginative document claimed St. Ninian
was worshipped by a tribe called Novantae, at the Candida Casa (Whit
House), a temple built "after the Roman manner." An Irish Life of St. Ninian claimed that he founded a church in Leinster, and identified him with the god Monenni. The Martyrology of Talsnacht said
Monenni was another name for the pagan goddess Nenn, or Nynia, cognate with the Danes' Nanna. 1 Thus "Ninian" seems to have been
a legend built around a pagan idol of indeterminate sex, worshipped in
Roman-style temple.

Iirvana
Itantrary to the popular western belief that Nirvana meant paradise, it
ms really quite the opposite: an eternal not-being, with cessation of all
feling, the ascetic ideal of disappearance of the self into the infinite.
Irvana meant final escape from the karmic wheel of earthly reincarna
tes ruled by the cyclic Mother. It was supposed to lie beyond all
phse perceptions, memories, loves, hates, fears, joys, or will; it was like Ip Tantric idea of Dreamless Sleep, forever. It could be achieved
tily by holy men after many cycles of reincarnation taught them to
tinquer all desires.
iu-Kua
jjgendary Chinese empress who reigned 1 30 years and had the lagical ability to command the movements of the heavenly bodies; a ythic remnant of China's matriarchal age.
ixies
ermanic water-fairies similar to Greek nereids, children of Mother
Ight, whose name in Norse was Nott; in Greek, Nyx. 1 As a personifijtion of the dark Chaos at the beginning and end of the universe,
e gave rise to the word nix, negation or nothingness. Pre-Christian
ligions viewed the Goddess Nyx-Selene (Night-Moon) as the agent deification after death, which made her a direct rival of the Christian
yior figure. 2 Her nixies were abyssal angels who kept the souls of
e dead in an underwater fairyland, in "pots turned upside down," after e manner of all Teutonic death-spirits. 3 In the Middle Ages, the
ater-fairies assumed the same characteristics as their close relatives, the

Noah mermaids, sirens, wilis, and water-witches: that is, they lured hapless Norm sailors into the water and magically devoured their souls.

Noah
Hebrew version of Nu, or Nun, the "Fish" in the Hebrew sacred
alphabet; originally the god born of Ma-Nu or Ma-Nun, Egyptian Goddess of the primordial deep. 1 The name of Ma-Nu was associated with the creation-flood in both Egypt and India. "Ma" was the
Womb of Chaos, often personified as a cosmic fish; "Nu" or Noah
was the embryonic seed of life floating into a new birth. See Creation;
Flood; Tiamat. The flood-heroes of India, Sumeria, and Babylonia also rode out the deluge of birth-fluid in a moon-vessel called argha or
ark, carrying with them the pairs of all creatures to populate the new
creation. 1 From the same root came arc, a crescent; for the vessel of
creation was always identified with the moon.
l.Jobes, 121.
Norns
The female trinity of Fates as she/they appeared in Scandinavia: also known as Weird Sisters, from Teutonic wyrd, "fate." The Prose Edda
called them "three mysterious beings," High One, Just-As-High, and Third, who revealed the secrets of the universe and wrote the book of
destiny; hence their other title, Die Schreiberinnen, "women who write." More common names for the Norns were Urth (Earth),
Verthandi, and Skuld, variously translated Fate, Being, and Necessi
ty, or like the ancient Egyptian Goddess of past, present, and future, , "Become, Becoming, and Shall-Be." 1
The original, single, eldest Norn was Mother Earth, Ertha, Urth, Urdr, etc., who represented Fate and the Word of creation. She was
Wurd in Old High German, Wyrd in Anglo-Saxon, Weird in English: She/they lived in the cave at the source of the Fountain of Life, Urdarbrunnr, the cosmic womb under the root of the World Tree. She
they were older than the oldest "heavenly father" and had power
over every god. ? The death-Norn Skuld was a variant of Skadi, an eponymous
mother of Scandinavia and a typical Destroyer. Norse poet-shamans were servants of Skuld and called themselves skalds; Christians said the
indulged in witchcraft, or "skulduggery." Skuld would lay the deathcurse on the whole universe at doomsday. Her name apparently gave
rise to "scold," meaning a woman gifted with the power of cursing. Like the third of the Moirai, Skuld cut the thread of every life.
The Norns became "fairies" in romantic traditions of pagan
balladry:

Numa
Legendary Latin king who became very wise, through his sacred marriage with the Goddess of creation and birth, Diana Egeria, the
Virgin of Nemi's sacred healing spring. Numa probably never existed, but "his" name recalls the Oriental custom of creating some of the
Goddess's spouses by reversing the syllables of her own name, e.g., Ya-ma, Lord of Death, a reversal of Ma-ya, Lady of Life. Ma-Nu was a
Goddess of Creation in some of the oldest Indo-European traditions, and Nu-Ma seems to have been her male counterpart.
Nun
Egyptian word for the primal ocean, origin of the Hebrew letter nun kneaning "fish"; it was also a sacred name, as in "Joshua son of Nun"
|(Joshua 1:1). As applied to a religious woman, "nun" descended
from nonne, a nurse, because in antiquity priestesses were practjtioners
pf the healing arts.
var. Nuit
tian Great Mother personifying the night sky. Sometimes she the Cow whose udder gave forth the Milky Way; or sometimes she was a woman arched over the earth, touching the "ends of the earth"
with her toes and fingertips; or again, her figure was painted inside coffin lids, her arms stretching down to embrace the deceased. 1 Her iconsort Geb was an earth-bound god who lay on his back and tried to
reach her with his erect penis, signified by the obelisk. 2
Pharaohs were sons and consorts of Nut. Pepi II said he was living "between the thighs of Nut." Men-Kau-Ra (Mycerinus) knew he was "born of Nut, conceived of Nut . . . spreadeth herself thy mother
Nut over thee in her name of 'mystery of Nut,' she granteth that thou
mayest exist without enemies, O king of the South and North, Men
Kau-Ra, living for ever!" 3 Egyptians said every woman was a nutrit, Little Goddess (see Neter).

Nymph Nymph
Occulta Greek nymphe, Latin nympha, a bride or a nubile young woman.
The same word was applied to female-genital symbols like the lotus flower, water lilies, and certain shells. "Nymphs" served as priestesses
in ancient temples of the Goddess, especially in sexual ceremonies,
where they represented the divine principle of flowering fertility and were sometimes known as Brides of God. See Virgin Birth. In medieval times the word nymph was applied to either a witch 01
a fairy, since both descended from the pre-Christian priestess. As spirits of nature, the "nymphs" were believed to embed their souls
forever in certain parts of the natural world that the Goddess had
ruled in antiquity: there were water nymphs, tree nymphs, mountain
nymphs, and nymphs who dwelt in the earth, the sea, or Fairyland. Their ancient connection with sexuality was more or less consistently
maintained. Even now, "nymphomania" connotes sexual obsession, like the moon-madness supposed to motivate the ancient nymphs in
their seasons of mating.
Obelisk
Egyptians knew the obelisk was intended to represent a giant phallus. It was called the benben-stone, or begetter-stone, similar to the Petra,
"the Rock that begat thee," as the Bible says. (See Peter, Saint.) Usually the obelisk was regarded as an erection of the earth god Geb in
his perpetual eagerness to mate with the Goddess of Heaven. 1

Oberon
Anglo-Saxon King of the Fairies; derived from German Alberich, the underworld dwarf king who kept buried treasure in the earth, which was also a function of the devil. Oberon was married to Titania, the
Fairy Queen, the ancients' "Mother of Titans."
Occulta
"Hidden things," the secret ceremonies of the mystery cults which
taught their own esoteric secrets of salvation in the early Christian era.
Primitive Christianity had its own occulta, but in medieval times the
word was applied to every religion other than Christian orthodoxy. Thus occulta became almost synonymous with witchcraft, magic,
heresy, Hermetism, etc.
732



Oceanus
Greco-Roman water-serpent deity supposed to surround the earth with his vast body, holding his tail in his mouth to form a continuous
barrier of water at the outer limits of the world. Oceanus was often
confused with Neptune, Poseidon, Ouroboros, Taaut, or Python. Oceanus was married to the primal Sea-goddess Tethys, or Thetis. His name meant "He who belongs to the Swift Queen." *
1. Graves, G.M. 1,27; 2, 402.
Oceanus Odin
var. Okeanos
Odin
Norse All-father, called God of the Hanged because the trees of his
sacred grove at Uppsala were laden with hanged human sacrifices even
as late as the 10th century. 1 Each victim's draumar (drama) recapitu
lated the death-rebirth of Odin himself, when he acquired his divine
powers by giving himself up to immolation on the World Tree,
wounded in the side with a spear. He said: "I know that I hung on the
windy tree for nine whole nights, wounded with the spear, dedicated
to Odin, myself to myself." 2 The occult significance of nine nights was pseudo-feminization for the sake of creativity; it was the period sacred to women in childbirth.
Latins called it the nundinum (nine-day). * Celts called it the nofnden
(nine-night). On occasion the Goddess Macha inflicted a nine-night
period of helplessness on men, which probably arose as a ceremonial couvade whereby in primitive times the men tried to partake of women's powers. 4 The purpose of Odin's nine-night ordeal was to learn the secret of the "wise blood" in the Earth-mother's uterine caul
dron, and to command the magic power of the runes, invented by his feminine prototype Idun (Freya). After he traversed all the realms of
death, he said, "I got a drink of the precious mead, I was sprinkled with Odrerir. Then I began to be fruitful and to be fertile, to grow and to prosper; one word sought another word from me." 5 By his sacrifice Odin won for men the female secrets of the saga
(speaking-woman, prophetess, priestess). He learned the runes, words of power, and sacred poetry, which his skalds called "the sea of Odin's
breast," meaning the blood he shed on the earth.6 His myth evidently
predated the discovery of fatherhood, for Erda or Urth was refreshed
and fructified by his blood, not his semen.
Sometimes the tree of his martyrdom was represented by the Tau cross, also known as the Cross of St. Anthony or the Gibbet Cross. 7
At other times, his gallows was door-shaped, with two upright tree trunks and a crossbeam. This matched the poets' description of
Odin's gallows, Yggdrasil the "Terrible Horse," for the gallows was both a tree and a horse on which men rode to the land of death. 8 The
733



Odin same form of the horse-gallows appeared on the Tarot card of the Hanged Man, whose number is twelve; he is the twelfth of the
m^^^mi^^m^^mm numbered Major Arcana or trump suit. Thus the Tarot Hanged Man
revealed Odin's secret of the Twelfth Rune, a mystery specifically mentioned in the Edda as a necromantic sign, with power to make a hanged man answer any question put to him.9 This was one of the
sources of the divinatory magic attributed to the pictures of the Tarot
cards. It has been noted that the Hanged Man is a pagan figure, and
"one of the clearest indications that the Tarot trumps were designed to
illustrate some non-Christian system of belief." 10 The card of the
Hanged Man was followed by the card of Death, number 13, showing that the victim like Odin was intended to traverse the nether worlds
of the dead.
Scandinavian sacred kings were identified with Odin and suffered
the same kind of holy death, probably followed by apotheosis as was usual for sacrificial victims. Vikarr, legendary ancestor of the Vikings,
was killed by a spear-thrust from one of Odin's priests during such a
ceremony. Medieval Swedes periodically "reddened the earth with the blood of their lord," enacting the love-death of king and god. The
blood Odin poured forth begot his reincarnation or son, Balder, the northern Adonis or Attis, whose consort had the same name as Attis's
virgin mother. She was Nanna or Nan, a Valkyrie name, probably derived from the archaic Middle-Eastern Moon-goddess Inanna. 11
Balder seems to have been the same dying-and-reborn god as Baal.
By the decree of his Heavenly Father, Balder too was slain and
sent to the underground realm of the Goddess Hel. He was restored
by the "tears of red gold" shed over him by Hel's celestial aspect, Freya;
but he would not return to this world. Balder's Second Coming
would take place in the next universe, after the destruction of the
current gods and the present world. He would rise again and establish
a new kingdom of more virtuous gods in another creation. 12 See
Doomsday.
Pagan saviors like Odin-Balder were naturally regarded as demons by followers of their Christian rival. Therefore Odin became an
"ogre" via his Lord-of-Death title Yggr, "Terrible One." n Medieval
necromancers were believed to use the things that belonged to Odin's
realm: gallows wood, gallows earth, parts of bodies of the hanged. At Toulouse in 1335 a woman named Anne-Marie de Georgel was
accused of witchcraft, on the charge of having used clothing, hair, nails, or fat of hanged criminals to make her magic ointments. 14
Though Odin was called All-father, he was not regarded as a creator. Like his Greek counterpart Zeus, he was strictly limited in power. Both Odin and Zeus were helpless in the hands of the Fates wh were Norns in Scandinavia and Moirai (Moerae) in Greece. "The ancestresses of the Nornir were those beings who also gave rise to the
Greek Moirai, the goddesses of Fate. According to Greek myth the Moirai were amongst the children of Night; and Night, as we know, was

:han the viking god Odin." Nevertheless, Odin's worshippers eventually divided him into a trinity named Twilight, Midnight, and Dawn, mmmm^^^^^^^^
:opied from the trinitarian Mother Night to whom he was mated, just as :he Hindu Lord of Death became a trinity to mate with Triple Kali. 15 Odin was an Aryan god, descended from the Vedic lord of winds,
vata, as shown by several other variations of his name: Voten,
Wuotan, Woden. 16 He was also Godan, in Hindu tradition a lord of vestern barbarians, consort of the Goddess Godiva whose name was eally a redundant "Goddess-Goddess."
As a lord of winds, Odin was identified with the Prince of the
Power of the Air, one of the titles of the Christian devil. Odin led the
vVild Hunt, a nocturnal ceremony originally representing ghost-ridden itorm clouds galloping through the sky: another form of the Gray
Morse that Odin rode. An English chronicle of 1 127 described the Wild
Hunt celebrated on the 6th of February by a group of black-clad
lorsemen, riding black horses, following black hounds with "eyes like saucers." Twenty or thirty men galloped through the woods between
Peterborough and Stamford, "and all through the night the monks leard them sounding and winding their horns." 17
Sometimes Odin appeared on earth as a one-eyed, gray-bearded bid wizard leaning on a staff, wearing either a hood or a broad
brimmed witch-hat. 18 Odin's other common title was "the one-eyed
jjod," derived from several mythological sources including the an
cient metaphor for the penis. As a nonsexual explanation of the
tnetaphor, one myth claimed that Odin gave up one of his eyes for jhe privilege of drinking from the feminine Fount of Wisdom, called
either Mimir (Mother of Memory) or Urdarbrunnr (Stream of Urd,
Le., of the eldest Norn). Still another explanation for his acquisition of feminine wisdom was that he stole the "wise blood" from the
pauldron Odrerir, which was in the keeping of the Earth-goddess in her acred uterine cave. 19 A similar story was told of the Aryan god Indra, vho stole the Great Mother's lunar blood Soma, and assumed the form
!>f a bird to fly away with it to the home of the patriarchal gods. Both
Ddin and Indra were revered by men for having obtained formerly
Sorbidden secrets of magic and bestowed them on their favored hamans.

Ddor of Sanctity
Kn alleged recognition sign for bodies or tombs of Christian saints
vas a sweet odor, as opposed to the expected odor of decay. This was
735



Odor of Sanctity emphasized in legends of many saints' relics, for example the remains of St. Mark allegedly discovered by some Venetian merchants in
^^^^^^^^^^^ Alexandria during the 5th century. "When they lifted the stone from
the tomb, so strong a perfume spread throughout the city of Alexandria that everybody wondered whence this sweet odor might come." '
According to the conventional phrase, every true saint died "in th odor of sanctity," for the sweet smell was taken as a symbolic
assurance of undecaying immortality, tied to the church's doctrine of
resurrection of the flesh. If a saint or martyr achieved heaven at once,
as was the orthodox teaching, then his flesh could not decay and would
therefore smell as sweet as the airs of heaven, which were generally
supposed to be perfumed. This was not an originally Christian notion. It was copied from
Egyptian ritual and theory of mummification. A corpse must smell
sweet in order to be accepted by the Egyptian deities; that was the
reason for embalming mummies with sweet-smelling spices, resins, and aromatic oils. Anubis guarded the gates of the after-world and checked each newcomer with his keen canine nose. If the scent was
acceptable, Anubis declared the dead man reconciled to the gods by his
Odor of Sanctity, and admitted him to the blessed realm. 2
Though the Christian Dark Age lost the art of mummification which was not to be revived until 20th-century embalmers improved
on it still the same spices were sometimes clumsily applied to dead
bodies in an effort to preserve them. The precious virtue of frankin
cense was that it served as a key to heaven by counteracting "the ill smells" of a corpse. 3 Churchmen claimed the bodies of those who were excommunicated would not decompose, but they lacked the Odo
of Sanctity that characterized saints. 4
The perfume allegedly exuded by saints' remains could work
miracles and cure diseases. The corpse of St. Stephen instantly healed 70 sick men who smelled its odor when it was first exhumed.
Earth from the grave of St. Dominic was said to smell sweet and
possess miraculous powers. 5 An effort was made to canonize the 1 3th-century inquisitor Bernard de Caux with a legend of incorruptibility, because he was "a
persecutor and hammer of heretics, a holy man . . . wonderful in extirpating heresy," Bernard Gui wrote. His body was exhumed 28 years
after his death and said to be perfectly fresh and sweet-smelling, except
that part of its nose was missing. 6
The gypsies mocked Christian legends of nondecaying saints,
claiming that bodies which fail to undergo normal decomposition are
not holy spirits but vampires. 7 The church accepted stories about the
"un-dead" but insisted on undecaying saints also.

Oedipus Oedipus
Mythical king of Thebes at a point in time when kings were ^
beginning to oppose matriarchal rule. Oedipus killed his father/prede- ^^^^^^^^i
cessor and married his mother/queen in the conventional way, but he
caused the Goddess's image (the Sphinx) to be thrown from a cliff and
broken.
His mother/queen was Jocasta or Iocaste, "Shining Moon," who apparently called down the wrath of the Goddess on her consort.
Some said he was banished from Thebes, others said he was slain by the
Goddess's Furies in her sacred grove. 1 Most stories agree that he was
blinded by a "clasp" taken from Jocasta's garment. Jocasta's "clasp" may have been a euphemism for the castrating moon-sickle. Herodotus said the women of Athens killed a man with
their "clasps," but a new patriarchal law afterward forbade women to
any such weapons. 2 Blindness was a common mythic symbol of
astration, as shown by the tales of Samson, Odin, and Teiresias of
Thebes. In Egypt also, a penis was called an Eye; to cut it off was to
put out the "light" of the One-Eyed God. ? The allegedly incestuous marriage between Oedipus and his mother/queen was no more than the conventional alternation of
sacred kings, each one chosen by the queen and declared the "son" or
reincarnation of his slain predecessor. Oedipus's "father" bore the
name of Laius, not a name at all but simply a title: "the king." As in an
iquity every king was a god, so every queen was a Mother of God, md the god's virgin bride as well. See Incest; Kingship.

Old Nick
Popular English name of the devil, probably derived from the Danish
sea god Hold Nickar, leader of the nickers, or nixies (water-fairies).
1
The same sea god evolved into the mythical St. Nicholas as might
be told by the saint's association with the cauldron of regeneration and
the symbols of the Triple Goddess. "Hold" was a variant of the
Goddess's name Holde, Hild, Hel so "Old Nick" may have been another instance of the masculinization of the personified Sea-womb.

Pyerun, the pagan thunder-god. 2 1 . Leland, 36. 2. Lamusse, 294.

Universal "Word of Creation" spoken by the Oriental Great God

Omen
Literally, a sign from the Moon. Arts of divination were generally
under the aegis of the ancient Moon-goddess. Cicero listed four types < omens. Ostenta were those that "make clear," yielding our word ostensible. Portenta were those that foreshadow or "portend." Monstn
were those that demonstrate or show, like dreams and visions.
Prodigia were the "prodigies" that give signs of future events through miraculous happenings. 1 Any omen was numinous, a word derived from nu-rnen, another

Omophagia
Eating-into-the-Belly, Greek ritual of holy communion by eating the flesh of sacrificial victims, human or animal. (See Cannibalism.)
According to the primitive tradition, worshippers were expected to tear apart the victim with bare hands and teeth, devouring him raw, as in
the earliest cults of Dionysus, Orpheus, Zagreus, and other gods torn
to pieces in their myths. "The communicants rushed madly upon the
sacrificial animal, tore it to pieces and ate it raw, believing that the
god was resident in the offering. ... It was believed that thus there took
place an identification with the god himself, together with a participation in his substance and qualities." ' His immortality was eaten too
both in the omophagia and its descendant, the Christian sacrament of
god-eating though his body was no longer meat but a tiny fragment of bread.
1. Angus, 129.
Omphale
Lydian name of the Goddess of the Hub omphalos, the navel-stone marking the center of the universal womb. Greek myth describes her as
a queen of Lydia, who enslaved Heracles and set him to work at her
spinning wheel. Heracles was the sun, and he performed his twelve Labors on the spinning wheel of the zodiac. Each "labor" was really
one of the zodiacal houses through which the sun passed during
Heracles's one-year servitude in Omphale's palace. This year marked
bis reign as the Aeon. He wore the queen's robes, in memory of which
the priests of Heracles wore female garments and pretended to command feminine powers of magic. It was characteristic of transitional
739



Omphalos periods between matriarchy and patriarchy that the king wore the
queen's robes when acting as her deputy. 1 ^^^^^^^^^__ Omphale represented the Goddess as a consumer of sun-kings,
each one annually killed and replaced by another who was born at the winter solstice; like the archaic Roman Goddess Anna Perenna she was a Mother of Time. 2 One of her consorts before Heracles was the oak
god Tmolus, who fathered his own reincarnation, the sacred king
Tantalus, cermonially drowned at the Oschophoria to represent the sun sinking into the sea. ? Tmolus as a human victim was wreathed in
the oak garland of the god and tossed by a bull onto sharp stakes,
indicating that the Goddess's bull-masked priests impaled him in a pit
where his blood could fertilize the ground.
The divine Father of Heracles-the-Savior was the sun god Apollo,
thought to have originated in Lydia although he later became one of the most typically Greek of gods. In his earliest forms, Apollo was
subject to the rule of his sister-bride Artemis, the Moon, who was
sometimes incarnate in a sacred navel-stone and therefore bore the title
of Omphale.

Omphalos
Greek transliteration of Latin umbilicus, the navel or hub of the
world, center of the Goddess's body, source of all things. As every
ancient nation regarded its own version of the Great Mother as the
cosmic spirit, so its own capital or chief temple was located at the center
of the earth, marked by the stone omphalos that concentrated the
Mother's essence. Hebrews called it the beth-elox "dwelling place of
deity." As a male god, incarnate in the king, this deity was always located at the Goddess's middle because he was her child.
In 710 B.C. a king of Susa said, "The Susian land, which is the first of the earth, is in the center of all mankind." Iranians said, "The
country of Iran is better than all other places, for it is in the middle."
China called itself "the Middle Kingdom." So did Scandinavia,
known to its inhabitants as Middle-Earth (Midgard). Old Japanese
poems called Japan the Middle Kingdom of Earth. Romans called
the sea at the center of their empire mare nostrum, "our sea," and gave
it the name of Mediterranean, literally Middle-of-the-Earth. 1
Romans placed the world's navel or omphalos at the round hearth
of the temple of Vesta. Greeks placed it at the omphalos of Delphi,
"Temple of the Womb." Jews placed it at the temple of Zion.
Christianity inherited a Jewish cosmogony wherein Jerusalem was regarded as the center of the earth, where Jesus died on the identical
spot where the Tree of Life once grew in the primal garden. It was
said a spear standing upright at the tomb of Christ would cast no shadow
at midday, because it marked the center point of everything under
740



|the sun. When Pope Urban preached the first crusade at Clermont, he Onuphris, Saint declared "infallibly" that "Jerusalem is the middle point of the Ophion
Hearth." 2 ^^^^^^^^^^^^
By pre-Christian reckoning, this middle point was the Virgin Zion, for the yonic temple of Mari-Anat. Feminine symbolism was preva
lent in all omphalic shrines, which generally represented the body of the
; Goddess with the God present as a sexual partner a phallic serpent, tree, cross, or sacrificed male bleeding the Blood of Life. Even medieval romances spoke of the Palace of Love where God and Goddess
(joined in medio mundi, at the center of the world. It was equipped with
jthe usual sexual symbols: a sacred spring in the garden, which also i contained the Tree of Life. 5
Christian theologians were amply supplied with the kind of hubris [that made men call their own home place the center of the earth,
their own lifetimes the ultimate end of time, their own religion the only
(permissible one, and their own selves the focal point of the cosmic |drama of good and evil. Indeed, the whole universe was viewed as a
mere backdrop for man's probation. Peter Lombard said, "Just as jman is made for the sake of God that is, that he may serve Him so
the universe is made for the sake of man that is, that it may serve
him; therefore is man placed at the middle point of the universe." 4 If man couldn't think of himself as somehow vitally connected with the
\omphalos, his world-view was threatened. Such a threat underlay the
church's opposition to the discoveries of Galileo, which tended to prove that the earth was not the center of God's universe.

Ophion var. Ophis
Serpent consort of the Creatress Eurynome, in the Pelasgian creation
myth; in Gnostic sexual symbolism he was the World Serpent
mated to the World Egg. According to an ancient Phrygian tradition he was the Father of mankind: a divine serpent who lived in the
Tree of Life in the primal garden, and begot the tribes called Ophiogen
is, "serpent-born." ! He was assimilated to Christ by
be Gnostic Christian sect of Ophites, and to Jehovah by their Jewish
counterparts the Naassians or "serpent-worshippers." Ophion the

Ops
Pre-Roman name of Ceres, Bona Dea, etc.; the Goddess who invented Roman law. Her secret rites were forbidden to men; but on
her December festival, the Opalia, there was a general ceremony
involving sexual orgies and touching the earth. 1 The powers of Jupiter were believed ineffective unless he was united with her, as Jove
Opulentia. 2 Like Pluto, he became Lord of Abundance, or Lord of Riches. Macrobius said the secret name of Rome was Ops Consivia.
Sacred gem of the Opalia was the opal, representing the Goddess':
many-colored veils. Because of its feminine connotation, Christians
declared it an unlucky stone. As a witch charm it was said to blind
prying eyes and make its bearer invisible. 3 Arab alchemists identified
it with the Philosopher's Stone, because the latter was believed to
contain all basic colors red, blue, yellow, green, and white.4

Orestes
Classic Greek mother-slayer, pursued by the Furies for violation of the ultimate matriarchal law. The Furies maintained that no crime is worse than killing the mother whose "intimate blood" made one's own life. Apollo however defended Orestes on the ground that even if
he did murder his mother, Queen Clytemnestra, she wasn't his true
parent because the only true parent is a father. 1
l.Bachofen, 159.
Orgy
From Greek orgia, "secret worship." 1 Most secret worship involved
sexual rites, as in the Sacred Mysteries of Eleusis, Cabiria, Shaktism, Sufism, Ophite Christianity, etc. Wilkins says, "Even when religion
742



no longer tends towards the orgiastic as all cults in close touch with
nature do ... it always has its erotic aspect. . . . The further back one
goes the less possible it is to distinguish between the erotic and the
sacral. And 'the further back' means not only in time, but also into
the depths of experience." 2 Our "holiday" derives from the Holi festivals of the east, described
by a pious western observer as a Saturnalia, featuring "the most
licentious debauchery." 3 The participants invariably saw their "debauchery" as a holy act, redolent of blessedness. Hindu texts said,
"To have carnal intercourse with the goddess Parvati is a virtue which
destroys all sin."4 The I Ching speaks of the mystical value of sexual
intercourse, which "gives life to all things." 5 According to Iwan Bloch,
"Religion shares with the sexual impulse the unceasing yearning, the
sentiment of everlastingness, the mystic absorption into the depths of life, the longing for the coalescence of individualities in an eternally
blessed union."6 For such reasons, words like passion, bliss, trance,
ecstasy, glory were interchangeably applied to religious and sexual
experience. Classical paganism used sexual orgia to represent the central
Mystery, which is why Christian ascetics condemned the Great Rite as "the unnameable rites of the mysteries" or "the whoredoms of
Eleusis." The Goddess promised eternal life to those who "privily
entered the bedchamber," meaning the pastos or bridal chamber where the hieros gamos between the Goddess and her worshipper was consummated. 7 The same sort of orgia took place among the northern
barbarians. Strabo said the druid enchanters in Ireland practiced
sexual worship "similar to the orgies of Samothrace." 8
Despite the extreme asceticism of its early centuries, Christianity too became an orgiastic religion in some of its manifestations. An
1 lth-century Christian community at Orleans met on certain nights of
the year to indulge in promiscuous behavior. A contemporary account said when the lights were put out, "every man grabs whatever woman comes to hand, even though she may be his own mother, his
sister, or a nun, without thought of sin; for such tumbling is regarded by them as holiness and religion." 9 Defining such behavior as a manifes
tation of devil-worship was not very effective in preventing it, however.
Communal mating was a standard accompaniment to religious ceremonies the world over, since before any Bibles were written. It was part
of the surge of group feeling often characterizing the religious experience. The medieval peasant had long been familiar with the
phenomenon, and liked it well enough to cling to it even if it was
called Satanism. 10
Few orgiasts deliberately viewed themselves as devil worshippers.
As a rule they thought themselves exceptionally holy. Rasputin's sect, the "Men of God,"claimed their naked dances imitated those of the
heavenly angels. After singing and dancing to induce an ecstatic state,

Oriant they engaged in sexual orgies which sometimes resulted in the birth of
Oimazd children, all of whom were said to have been begotten by the Holy
^^^^^^_ Ghost. 11
A Methodist preacher in Indiana once said, "Religious passion includes all other passions: you cannot excite one without stirring up
the others." 12 American revivalism certainly proved this, so consistent!'
that any child born nine months after a revivalist meeting was
generally known as a "camp-meeting child." Outwardly puritanical, American Protestantism nevertheless "revived" a mode of religious
behavior that would have been perfectly familiar to the ancient Greeks
with their Samothracian orgies and their lecherous satyrs. 15 It just
wasn't called by its real name.

Oriant
Medieval sun king born of the legendary Matabrune, "Burning Mother," who probably personified the red clouds of dawn. She was also embodied in Brunnhilde, leader of the Valkyries; so her name meant both Burning Mother and Burning Hel. 1 As his name suggests, Oriant was Lord of the East, like Ra, born every day from the womb of the Goddess.

Orion
"Moon-man of the Mountain," Greek version of the Lord of the
Hunt ritually slain by Artemis, the Huntress. Some Hellenic stories claimed the Goddess killed Orion by mistake while he was swimming
in the sea, too far away to be clearly seen. She shot arrows into a floatin object that turned out to be Orion's head. Other stories said Orion
was killed by a scorpion sent by Apollo, and Artemis placed his soul
image among the stars. Even in heaven, Orion is perpetually pursued by the Scorpion. According to Graves, this arrangement of constellations referred to the scorpion sent by the god Set to slay Horus. 1 In
any event, Orion was another deified sacrificial victim.

Orpheus
Orphism was one of the most popular mystery-religions of the early Christian era. It was a development of the cult of Dionysus together
with Orpheus, his earthly prophet and savior-son.
Orphism introduced a theology ofredemption. It taught a doctrine of original sin. Man s nature was dualistic, composed ofthe titanic elements closely associated with the body, and the dionysiac elements which were allied with the soul. By an ascetic morality the former must
be repressed and the latter cultivated, to the end that the soul may escape from the body as from a tomb, and may cease to be subject to the weary
kyklos genesios, "cycle ofreincarnation. " "I have flown out ofthe
sorrowful wheel, "says the Orphic initiate on the Compagno tablet. . . .
On the Dionysiac type of Greek religion it laid hold and remodelled it to
its purpose. This Dionysiac religion, like Orphism, was ofnorthern Thracian provenance, and was fraught with orgiastic-mystic elements, on which Orphism fastened, adopting its emotionalism, its doctrine of
Enthousiasmos, and ofpossession by the deity, rejecting its wild frenzy, and transforming its savage ritual into a sacramental religion. '
Orphism was a kind of western Buddhism, with escape from the
karmic wheel effected by ascetic contemplation, spiritual journeys of the astral-projection type, and elaborate revelations. "Orphism was steeped in sacramentalism, which flooded the later Mysteries and flowed
into Christianity. Salvation was by sacrament, by initiatory rites, and by an esoteric doctrine. . . . Orphism was the most potent solvent ever
introduced into Greek religious life. . . . [T]he Orphics sowed the
seeds of distrust toward the national and hereditary principle in religion,
and made the salvation of the individual soul of first importance. In
this way Orphism had enormous influence upon the subsequent history
of religion." 2 Orphism was the principal vehicle for Oriental mysticism in
Greece. Its teachings were those of mystics everywhere: "Grasping in your mind that nothing is impossible for you, consider yourself immortal
and capable of understanding everything. . . . Ascend beyond all height, descend beyond all depth. Gather into yourself the sensations of
creation, of fire and of water, of dryness and of humidity, imagining that you are at one and the same moment everywhere, on earth, in the
sea, in the heaven, that you have not yet been born, that you are
beyond death." Like an initiated yogi, the Orphic sage could repeat: "I
represent things to myself, not by the sight of my eyes, but by the
745



Orpheus spiritual energy I draw from the Powers. I am in heaven, in earth, in
water. I am in air, in animals, in plants, in the womb, before the
^^_^ --mamIMB womb, after the womb, everywhere." 3
An Orphic funerary tablet dug up near Sybaris alluded to Buddha
like escape from the karmic wheel (kyklos genesion, cycles of
becoming), essentially identical to the Oriental sangsara. An Orphic sacramental bowl of gold, with carved figures, dating from the 5th century, was unearthed in Romania in 1837. The
figures showed the Orphic initiate's death-and-rebirth journey, the
deities to be met in the upper and nether worlds, who also appeared
in person as masked temple personnel when the novice was led through
the stages of initiation. These figures were arranged on the bowl in the same way as the deities of the Intermediate State, between death
and rebirth, were arranged on mandalas of Tibetan holy books. 4
In Orphic belief as in the Orient, the power behind all forces of
manifestation was the Great Mother, whose free-standing image
appeared in the center of the Orphic bowl with other goddesses and gods ranged around her in the formation of a wheel. 5 She was the
Black Mother Night, from whom were born Sleep, Love, Dreams, the Fates, Nemesis, Old Age, and Death. Even Zeus feared her, "which
may reflect an old belief in Night as one of the great primeval powers of
the universe." 6
Mother Night was equated with Persephone, the "Destroyer" linked with both Dionysus and Orpheus. Once initiated, the Orphic mystic could announce: "I have sunk beneath the bosom of Persepho
ne, Queen of the Underworld." Upon his post-mortem descent into
hell, Persephone would personally greet him and promise to make him "god instead of mortal." 7 The Descent Into Hades was the title of the Orphic manual and
the essential rite of Orphic initiation, because the god himself
descended into hell and returned, bringing with him the revelation on
which the Mysteries were founded. 8 According to the classic myth,
Orpheus descended to retrieve his bride Eurydice, who had died after
being bitten by a snake in the grass. This was a late revision of a
primitive Thracian dying-god myth, onto which the doctrines of Orph
ism were grafted later. Eurydice was actually "Universal Dike," or Tyche, Goddess of Fate, lady of the karmic wheel. She was originally one of Demeter's matriarchal Furies, converted by Hellenic writers
into a daughter of Zeus.9 In the underworld she was herself Persepho
ne, the Death-goddess; and her "snake in the grass" was her own totem.
The oldest Orphic myth said Orpheus was torn to pieces by the
Maenads, who worshipped Dionysus, Orpheus's divine alter ego. Mythographers gave various excuses for the Maenads' act, designed to
conceal the true sacrificial motive. Some said the Maenads killed
746



Drpheus because he denounced their sexual orgies and advocated male Orpheus lomosexual love instead of the heterosexual kind. The Maenads
yere so angry at Orpheus that in Macedonia they killed all their ^^^^^^^^^^^
lusbands for listening to his teachings. It has been suggested that
jatriarchal-ascetic ideas came to Orphism from Egyptian priests of Ra,
>ecause Orphic priests wore Egyptian dress. 10 Other stories said Orpheus was killed not by the Maenads but by
Zeus's lightning bolt as punishment for his revelation of the gods'
iecrets to mankind. After he descended into hell and returned, his
disembodied head was laid in a cave sacred to Dionysus, where it
continued to sing and speak, like the head of Osiris at Abydos. As a
eacher of the mysteries of the after-life, Orpheus became a god of jracles. He was said to have founded the oracles of Hecate in Aegina
md of Demeter Chthonia in Sparta, two examples of Hellenic
syncretism, as these oracles were formerly the property of the Goddesses whose names they bore. 11 Some derived Orpheus's name from
Jrphi, a popular oracular shrine in Edessa, though others linked his
lame with Erebus, the land of the dead. 12 Aristotle insisted that
Drpheus had never lived at all. 13
The common legend said Orpheus was a famous poet and lyre
)layer, like Cinyras the ancestor of Adonis (Greek cinyra, "lyre," :ognate with Semitic kinnor, "lyre") and like David the ancestor of
esus. Orpheus's lyre was kept as a holy relic in the temple at Lesbos, intouchable and taboo. Neanthus, son of the Tyrant of Lesbos, once
jlayed the Orphic lyre and shortly afterward was torn to pieces by a >ack of "dogs," which might have meant dog-masked Maenad-priesesses. Later, the lyre was set in the stars, where it still appears as the
:onstellation Lyra. 14
One of the mysteriously significant phrases of Orphic initiation was 'I a kid have fallen into my mother's milk," possibly a reference to
ieath under Persephone's bosom followed by rebirth as her nursling.
\n ancient ritual was involved, one that was specifically forbidden by
ewish laws: "Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk" (Exodus
3:19). So great was the Jews' fear of this ceremony that they even nsisted on using different sets of dishes for milk and meat products. Yet heir god was once mated to Mother Asherah as the "Pit," like
'ersephone, in a sacred-marriage rite that included cooking a kid in its nother's milk. 15 No one now knows what the phrase meant to
jiblical writers. Certainly the prohibition was not motivated by kindness
o animals or reverence for goat-motherhood; there was a mystical
reason for it.
Orphism became one of the most serious rivals of Christianity in
:he first few centuries a.d., until the church devised ways to identify
:he Orphic savior with Christ. Fourth-century Christian art showed
Christ in the guise of Orpheus, wearing a Phrygian cap, playing the
747



Osculum Infame lyre, a sacrificial lamb under his foot. 16 Alexander Severus kept holy
Osiris images of Christ and Orpheus side by side in his private chapel. 17
^^^^^^^^^^^ The Orphic Gospel was preached throughout the Mediterranear
world for at least twelve centuries. 18 It contributed much to Christian
theology, and even reappeared in medieval bardic romance. The poets
transformed Orpheus into Sir Orfeo, a king of England, son of King Pluto and the Goddess Juno. Orfeo's wife was Heurodis (Eurydice).
entered the underworld through a rocky cleft, and found the pagan
fairyland of groves and gardens surrounding the queen's crystal palace, with its pillars of gold and gems. The place was inhabited by "people supposed to be dead, but they were not so." Orfeo returned to his
capital city, Winchester, which "used to be called Thrace" or so the bard said. 19 So much for medieval notions of geography.
Orphism gave Christian Europe more than muddled geography and romantic legends, however. The Orphic revelation was virtually
indistinguishable from the Christian one, especially in its later "purified" form among ascetics who abstained from meat and from sensual
pleasures in order to win eternal blessedness. With the introduction of
system of post-mortem punishment, the resemblance to Christianity was striking. Adeimantos, a character in Plato's Republic, said the
Orphic revelation was "misused" by unscrupulous teachers, who "hold out the bribe of a happy immortality to the good and threaten
eternal punishment to the bad, so that men turn to goodness not for
its own sake, but in fear." 20 The difficulty was not restricted to Orphisi
(see Hell).

Osculum Infame
"Infamous kiss," supposedly bestowed on the devil's anus by his
worshippers as an act of homage. Pagan rituals, however, contained no such act; it seems to have been one of the inventions of the
inquisitors. Scatological fantasies and excrement often figured in churchmen's visions of the activities of witches.
Osiris
Of all savior-gods worshipped at the beginning of the Christian era, Osiris may have contributed more details to the evolving Christ figure
than any other. Already very old in Egypt, Osiris was identified with
748



iarly every other Egyptian god and was on the way to absorbing them Osiris ||. He had well over 200 divine names. 1 He was called Lord of
|ords, King of Kings, God of Gods. 2 He was the Resurrection and the ^^^^^^^^^^^
ife, the Good Shepherd, Eternity and Everlastingness, the god who jnade men and women to be born again." Budge says, "From first to
st, Osiris was to the Egyptians the god-man who suffered, and died, jid rose again, and reigned eternally in heaven. They believed that they jould inherit eternal life, just as he had done." 5
According to Egyptian scriptures, "As truly as Osiris lives, so truly tall his follower live; as truly as Osiris is not dead he shall die no
!ore; as truly as Osiris is not annihilated he shall not be annihilated."4 Osiris's coming was announced by Three Wise Men: the three
ars Mintaka, Anilam, and Alnitak in the belt of Orion, which point
;rectly to Osiris's star in the east, Sirius (Sothis), significator of his birth,
'ngelic voices hailed the coming of the Universal Lord on this
xasion, which marked the rising of the Nile flood. Oriental paths of
le Osirian "tradition may be traced in Tibet, where the rising of the
.me star in the east marks the annual festival of "setting free the waters
"springs," as the Egyptian festival set free the waters of the Nile,
'ibetans named the star Rishi-Agastya, after a holy king of "a very jicient time." 5 Ancient Hebrews called the same star Ephraim, or
le Star of Jacob. In Syrian, Arabian, and Persian astrology it was lessaeil the Messiah.6
Certainly Osiris was a prototypical Messiah, as well as a devoured lost. His flesh was eaten in the form of communion cakes of wheat, fce "plant of Truth." Osiris was Truth, and those who ate him became
[ruth also, each of them another Osiris, a Son of God, a "Light-god, dweller in the Light-god." Egyptians came to believe that no god
Kcept Osiris could bestow eternal life on mortals. 7 He alone was the
javior, Un-nefer, the "Good One." Under this title he was even
monized as a Christian saint.8
Egyptians were much afraid of death's corruption awaiting them ithout the kindly intervention of Osiris: "When the soul hath
sparted, a man seeth corruption, and the bones of his body crumble
vay and become stinking things, and the members decay one after le other, the bones crumble into a helpless mass, and the flesh turneth ito fetid liquid. Thus a man becometh a brother unto the decay hich cometh upon him, and he turneth into a myriad of worms, and e becometh nothing but worms, and an end is made of him, and he
isheth in the sight of the god of day."9 But Osiris could prevent all
nastiness:
Homage to thee, O my divine father Osiris, thou hast thy being with thy members. Thou didst not decay, thou didst not become worms, thou
didst not diminish, thou didst not become corruption, thou didst not putrefy, and thou didst not turn into worms I shall not decay, and I shall not rot, I shall not putrefy, I shall not turn into worms, and I shall not
749



Osiris see corruption before the eye ofthe god Shu. I shall have my being, I
shall have my being; I shall live, I shall live; I shall germinate, I shall ^^^ germinate, I shall germinate; I shall wake up in peace; I shall not
putrefy, my intestines shall not perish; I shall not surfer injury; mine eye j
shall not decay; the form ofmy visage shall not disappear. . . . My body shall be stablished, and it shall neither fall into ruin nor be destroyed on I
this earth. 10
The cult of Osiris contributed a number of ideas and phrases to
the Bible. The 23 rd Psalm copied an Egyptian text appealing to Osiris
the Good Shepherd to lead the deceased to the "green pastures" and
"still waters" of the ne/er-ne/erland, to restore the soul to the body, an
to give protection in the valley of the shadow of death (the Tuat). The Lord's Prayer was prefigured by an Egyptian hymn to Osiris-Ame beginning "O Amen, Amen, who art in heaven." 11 Amen was also invoked at the end of every prayer.
Jesus's words, "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and
die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit" (John 12:24), were taken from an Osirian doctrine that a dying man is like a
corn of wheat "which falls into the earth in order to draw from its
bosom a new life." 12 Jesus's words, "In my Father's house are many
mansions" (John 14:2) came from an Osirian text telling of numer
ous Arits ("Mansions") in the blessed land of Father Osiris. 13 Stories
about Osiris turned up in Christian legends. Jesus's healing of a
nobleman's daughter was based on a tale of an Osirian priest who curec
a princess. 14 Worshippers of Osiris were promised that they would
rule the spirit-souls (angels) in heaven, foreshadowing St. Paul's promis to his followers that they would rule even angels (1 Corinthians 6:3).
The bishop's crozier was the Osirian shepherd-crook. The Christian
cross itself was a variant of the Egyptian ankh, symbolizing "the Life
to Come." 15
One significant difference between Osiris and Christ was that
Osiris was restored to life not by his divine father but by his divine
mother who was also his bride, Isis. She put his dismembered body back together and raised him from the dead. She married him and conceived his reincarnation, the Divine Child Horus who became Osiris again. She also took him to heaven where he reigned as Father Ra. Sometimes Ra was called Osiris's father, sometimes Osiris was
called Ra's father, sometimes they were the same god, named Osiris- ,
Ra. They were cyclically reincarnated as father-son and son-father,
dwelling in the Mother as fetus, lover, corpse. 16 Thus Osiris's cult centered on the theme of divine incest, apparen
also in a Christianity that declared the Father and Son identical, and
the Mother of God the same individual as God's bride. Osiris plainly
expressed the archetypal wish for union with the mother, found in all
men's religions. He was restored to life as the ithyphallic Min, Men, or Menu, "Moon-god," hailed as a Bull of lust, "the mummy with a
long member," or "the Lord Who impregnates his Mother." 17
750



A symbol of Osiris's sacred marriage was the menat, "moon- Osiris
harm," in hieroglyphics a phallus-shaped jar pouring fluid into a
vider pot or vase, signifying sexual intercourse with a deity. 18 The Haaa^MHH^HH
menat amulet was borne by nearly every Egyptian god; it was also a jitle of Isis. 19 The same sexual image of the two vessels was found in the
;ombs and temples of Babylon and Assyria. 20 The male water-jar resented the seminal spirit of the Savior in all the lands of the Middle
plast and Egypt. In his processions, the god was preceded by a jarbearer like the man with a jar of water who preceded Jesus in the
Passover procession (Luke 22:10). The Jews' Passover meal called Seder may have descended from
the Egyptian Sed, the oldest festival of Osirian regeneration and
fertility.
21 At the Sed, Osiris's masculinity was erected in the form of the
Djed column, originally a simple phallic obelisk, later a representation pf Osiris's sacrum, the "sacred bone" so called because it was once
regarded as the source of seminal fluid. When Isis brought Osiris
pack to life, her first care was to make him "stand up," which meant
restoration of his phallic spirit. 22
Primitive elements in Osirian myth show its extreme antiquity,
Bating back to Neolithic Egypt. Before re-conceiving Osiris, the Goddess apparently devoured him as she hovered over his corpse in the
buise of the archaic Vulture-mother (see Vulture). 2 * Like similar
images of devouring Kali, this points to an age predating even the discovery of fatherhood, when reincarnations were believed to be
brought about by cannibalism. Indeed, Osiris may have begun as one of the numerous forms of Shiva, for his name came from Ausar or Asar, meaning "the Asian" just like the Aesir or "Asian" gods of northern
Europe. 24 About 4000 years ago, Osiris's cult was established at Abydos,
|where he was called Osiris Khenti-Amenti, Lord of Death or Lord of
me Westerners, meaning those who had "gone west" into death's sunset land. He was incarnate in a succession of sacred kings who
seem to have served as sacrificial victims. Their bodies were divided up
bnd distributed to different parts of the country to assist fertility as in
Norway, up to the 9th century, where kings' bodies used to be quartered and sent to the four provinces for burial, so each locality would have
royal flesh to assist the crops. 25 As Christian churches used to be
founded on spurious relics of apostles and saints, so Egyptian temples were founded on bits of Osiris's body.26 Like the head of Orpheus on Lesbos, the head of Osiris was
preserved in the temple at Abydos to serve as an oracle, providing |much of the Egyptians' detailed knowledge of the after-world. The
shrine had a sacred well called Peq or Pega, the original home of the
Pega-nymphs who guarded the oracular well of Pirene in Corinth. 27
Like Christians seeking burial in consecrated ground by a church,
wealthy Egyptians bought burial space near the Osirian temple, so as to share the god's resurrection. Abydos therefore became the center of a
751



Osiris great necropolis. 28 The faithful claimed on their epitaphs that "I have become a divine being by the side of the birthchamber of Osiris; I am
^^^^^^^^^^^ brought forth with him, I renew my youth."29
When human sacrifices were replaced by animals, Osiris obligingly incarnated himself in a variety of beasts, notably the Apis bull who
ascended to glory, carrying away the sins of all Egypt as he died in
atonement. 30 Osiris-Apis later became the composite deity Sarapis, monotheistic god of Alexandria for six centuries. 31
There were several Osirian trinities. One consisted of Osiris the
father, Isis the mother, and Horus the son. Another was Ra the father, Osiris the son on earth, and Horus the son rising in heaven. Another
was (1) Ptah, "Opener of the Way," a phallic consort of the Virgin and
the opener of her matrix; (2) Seker, representing the male spent, dead, and hidden within the female tomb-womb; and (3) Osiris, newly incarnate as the Min-phallus and standing for resurrection. 32
The sacred lunar numbers seven, fourteen, and twenty-eight were
prominent in Osiris's cult. The lunar cycle of twenty-eight days corresponded to his descent into the underworld and ascent to heaven:
fourteen days each way, or fourteen steps on his mystic Ladder. Buddha's ladder of descent to earth and return to heaven also had
fourteen steps. 33 Like Buddha and Osiris, the Tibetan sage is still
supposed to pass fourteen days in the after-world before encountering enlightenment in the form of "the mandala of the animal-headed
deities," reminiscent of the Egyptian gods. Some of these deities were
named Heruka, a possible cognate of Osiris the sun, Heru-Harakhti. 34 Like Hindu sacred dramas, the cycle of Osirian drama seems to
have been keyed to the menstrual cycle of the Goddess, incarnate in the priestess who bore the title of Divine Mother. In the month of
Athyr (Hathor), Egyptian women made clay phalli as images of Osiris and threw them into the Nile when it "turned to blood" in flood time
(see Moses). 35 This custom recalled the Oriental conviction that the
Goddess must be menstruating at the time of her sacred marriage to the
dying god. Later accounts explained Osirian lunar numbers by saying
he was 28 years old at the time of his passion, or else that it took place in
the 28th year of his reign on earth. 36
As Lord of Death, Osiris was sometimes identified with the Great
Serpent of the underworld, and sometimes painted in the same serpentine form, bent around so his toes touched his head. 37 In Ptolemaic times the whole underworld became Osiris's province, its
seven halls collectively called the House of Osiris. 38
Between 1450 and 1400 B.C. the Osirian mystery-cult took form, with hundreds of verbal formulae for making the worshipper become an Osiris. He would be born of Isis and nursed by Nephthys. He would
ride across the sky "side by side with the gods of the stars." He would
be as virile as Osiris-Menu: "My palm tree (penis) standeth upright and
is like Menu Therefore the Phallus of Ra, which is the head of
752



jsiris, shall not be swallowed up." When he was in heaven, the gods
jemselves would bring offerings to him. 59 The Osirian Mysteries taught words of power for bringing about |ese desirable effects. Such words of power were "keys" to heaven,
! be concealed from non-initiates as "a great mystery." 40 The Saite
iecension said with such keys, a soul could pass freely through the
htes, gatekeepers, guardians, heralds, inspectors, and other spirits of the l;avenly mansions, for he would know all their names.
And the Majesty ofAnpu shall say unto me, "Knowest thou the name of
this door, and canst thou tell it? " ... And the Majesty ofthe god Anpu shall say unto me, "Knowest thou the name of the upper leaf, and the
name of the lower leaf?" On receiving the proper answers, the Majesty
of the god Anpu shall say, "Pass on, for thou hast knowledge, O Osiris. " 4I
During the first century B.C. the Osirian religion was established
ii all parts of the Roman Empire. 42 Its popularity declined in the end
ecause it became too complicated for the average mind. Necessary words of power" developed into lengthy catechisms of divine names of
oorposts, lintels, bolts, panels, doorkeepers, spirits of the hour,
iiresholds, gods' right and left feet, etc. Egyptians invented even a
nemory-god to bring back the spells and holy names if they were
iolen by a spirit of forgetfulness. 43 The important ceremony of "Openfig the Mouth" was performed to let the dead person speak charms nd words of power freely.44 Still, the catechisms became too long and jomplex to be remembered. Budge remarks that the Egyptians believed in "the resurrection of
lie body in a changed and glorified form, which would live to all
ternity in the company of the spirits and souls of the righteous in a ingdom ruled by a being who was of divine origin, but who had lived
pon the earth, and had suffered a cruel death at the hands of his Inemies, and had risen from the dead, and had become the God and
ing of the world which is beyond the grave Although they believed
,i all these things and proclaimed their belief with almost passionate arnestness, they seem never to have freed themselves from a hankering
fter amulets and talismans, and magical names, and words of power, nd seem to have trusted in these to save their souls and bodies, both liv
ng and dead, with something of the same confidence which they
ilaced in the death and resurrection of Osiris. A matter for surprise is
hat they seem to see nothing incongruous in such a mixture of magic
[nd religion." 45 It is a matter for even more surprise that a scholar of Budge's
|tature failed to see exactly the same mixture of magic and religion in hristianity; for indeed he could have been talking about Christians as
(veil as Egyptians. To this day, simple Christian folk still display the
lame hankering after crucifixes and medals, agnus del, incantations,
vocations of holy names and other formulae, saints' relics, holy

Ouroboros water, images, even rosaries which they copied from the Egyptians.
Owl Christian formulae of exorcism, baptism, extreme unction, absolu^^^^_^^^^^_ tion, etc., were words of power under different names. The notion of
resurrection through identification with a resurrected god (by eating
his flesh) was in itself magical rather than religious and this was the
basis of the Christian salvation-idea no less than for that of Osiris's
votaries. Moreover it seems the concept of Christ was no less syncretic
than the concept of Osiris. If anything, the older god had more right
to claim an original system of worship or of superstition, depending on one's point of view.

Ouroboros
Greek name of the Hermetic World Serpent, sometimes the Sea
serpent Oceanus encircling the earth; sometimes the underground Python coiled in the earth's womb; otherwise known as Sata, Levia
than, Taaut, Tuat, Thoth, Ophion, etc. See Serpent.
Owl
Romans called the owl strix (pi. striges), the same word that meant
"witch." I Greeks said the owl was sacred to Athene, their own version
of the ancient Mesopotamian "Eye-Goddess" whose staring owleyed images have been found throughout the Middle East, especially around the Mother-city of Mari. 2 The owl was also the totem of
Lilith, Blodeuwedd, Anath, and other versions of the Triple Goddess of the moon. See Trinity.
According the Christian legend, the owl was one of "three disobedient sisters" who defied God and was transformed into a bird
who never looked at the sun. 3 It is easy enough to see in this idea the
shape of the Goddess herself, and the church's hostility to her. One of the medieval names for the owl was "night hag"; it was said to be a
witch in bird form. 4 The owl is still associated with witches in the symbols of Halloween. The owl is also a bird of wisdom because it used to embody the
754



/isdom of the Goddess. Certain medieval magic charms apparently
ought to use the bird's oracular power against its former mistress,
/oman. If an owl could be slain and its heart pulled out and laid on
ne left breast of a sleeping woman, the woman would talk in her sleep nd reveal all her secrets. 5 This seems to have been a basis of the
xpression, "heart-to-heart talk," which meant a woman's secret conver
ation with her familiar.

Paganism Paganism
Latin pagan i meant country-dwellers, the rural people whose reli
^
gious conservatism caused them to cling to old gods and goddesses even
when Christianity was well established in cities and among the
aristocracy. "It has now been demonstrated that the hostility of the
peasantry to Christianity gave the meaning of 'pagan' to paganus. This seems to date from the first half of the fourth century and it
gradually becomes general in the second half." 1 "Heathen" came from Germanic heiden, that which is hidden, because the church officially forbade the rites of the old deities, and
the pagan people continued their rites in secret. 2
Through the first half of the Christian era, paganism was overt and
more or less acceptable. Christianity and paganism existed side by side in uneasy proximity long enough for Christians to take over as
many pagan deities, holy places, customs, and holidays as possible. Noting that the people wouldn't accept Christianity unless it could be considered an extension of their paganism, Pope Gregory the Great
directed that Christian relics must be placed in the inner shrines of
pagan temples, and the people converted gradually to the idea that their deity was a saint instead of an un-Christian spirit.
3 Pagan feast days were to be Christianized. For example, at Christmas the people were
to be allowed to sacrifice and eat "a great number of oxen to the glory of
God, as they had formerly done to the Devil."4
Though the old deities were re-defined as devils, nominal Chris
tians continued to believe in them as firmly as they believed in Christ, .1
if not more so. 5 They were quite willing to consult "devils" for guidance*
in their daily lives. The Venerable Bede said Redwald, king of the
East Saxons, kept in the same temple an altar to offer sacrifices to Christ
and another altar to offer sacrifices to "devils."6 Gothic converts to
the church simply added the name of Christ to their own lists of native I
gods but dropped it with equal readiness if its magic proved ineffective. 7
This dual religious system persisted even through periods when the "fairy-religion" was persecuted as witchcraft. It could be said that
Christianity and paganism co-exist even now, for the greater part of Christian worship, sacraments, and basic theology came from the
pagan heritage. "The lamb, the dragon (or serpent), the dove above the!
altar, the triangle enclosing the all-seeing eye (common to Freema
sonry as well), the sacred fish-symbol, the ever-burning fire, or the image of the risen sun upon the receptacle for the consecrated wafer
in the Roman Mass, the architectural symbols and the orientation of
church and cathedral, the cross itself, and even the colors and designs
of the robes of priest and bishop and pope, are a few of the silent witnesses of the survival in the modern Christian churches of the
symbolism of paganism."8 Even such essential doctrines as the virgin
birth, Incarnation, Logos, resurrection, salvation, purgatory, baptism,
758



nd holy communion were products of paganism, developed many Paganism enturies before the Christian era.
Giraldus Cambrensis complained in the 1 2th century that the __^^^^^^^^_
I eople of Ireland were still given over to "old, barbaric and obscene
I ustoms."9 The cult of Diana co-existed with Christianity in Devon as
lite as the 14th century, when the Goddess was worshipped in 'oodland shrines even by monks. 10 At Cologne in 1333, Petrarch saw
Ijwomen conjuring the Rhine" in what was described as "a rite of the
I eople." 11 The people's religion had been largely in the hands of women ' ince Caesar's day, and so it remained up to the 12th and 13 th
i enturies when active persecution of "witches" began. 12 Martin of
i iraga, a 6th-century Portuguese missionary father, noted that womIn not only maintained their own un-Christian temples, but also
i erformed domestic acts of worship like decorating tables, wearing I iurels, taking omens, offering bread to water spirits and wine to the
I [ule log, calling upon Minerva when spinning, and invoking Venus it weddings and on the public road. "What is that but worship of the
jevil?" he asked. Moreover, he believed in the women's pagan
I pities himself. He said the rivers, springs, and woods were filled with
i Lamias, Nymphs, and Dianas; "and they were all malign devils and lefarious spirits." 13
A 10th-century Penitential tried to forbid women to present their
Inildren to Mother Earth at the crossroads in their ancient manner,
Jior this is great paganism." 14 A 16th-century Finnish bishop observed [pat "when people fall ill, they seek help from the devil by laying wax
I gures, candles, squirrel skins and other things on the altars, and on lertain days sacrifice sheep and coins." 15 The 9th-century Synod of
home recorded pagan worship in the churches: "Many people, mostly iKomen, come to church on Sundays and holy days not to attend the
i [lass but to dance, sing broad songs, and do other such pagan things." 16 Of course the churches had deliberately lured women by taking
[wer the shrines of their Goddess, with the promise that the rites
jpuld continue as usual. Churches were built over shrines of Syrian
llstarte at Corbridge in Northumberland, of Diana Nemetona at
Uath, and of Sarapis and Mithra at York. 17 At Cangas de Onis,
[Lrrichinaga, and other places in Spain, churches were built around
I agan dolmens and sacred mounds, still in existence today. 18 Church
I recessions featured carnival mummers in the masks and costumes of
Indent beast-gods, such as the four totems of the pagan sacred year
on, bull, eagle, and serpent adopted as symbols of the evange
[kts.
19 Pagan deities appeared in the very carvings and decorations of
hurches. As late as 1 576 a British church employed workmen to pull
own and destroy "sundry superstitious things tending to the mainte
ance of idolatry."20 The Christian church had no holidays of its own; every feast in the christian calendar was borrowed from the pagans, including Easter
759



Paganism and Christmas. Roman festivals were particularly tenacious, until they had to be given Christian names to excuse the people's continued ^^^^^m^^b^ celebration of them. The Hilaria became the Feast of Annunciation; i
Robigalia became the Feast of St. Mark; the Quinquatrus became the
Feast of St. Joseph; St. Cyprian's Day replaced the day of Jupiter. 21 '7 thousand years ago, old and young assembled in woods or on plains
to bring gifts to their gods, and celebrated with dances, games, and
offerings the festival of spring, or of awaking and blooming Nature. These celebrations have taken Christian names, but innumerable old heathen rites and customs are still to be found in them." 22
Christian historians often give an impression that Europe's barba ians welcomed the new faith, which held out a hope of immortality
and a more kindly ethic. The impression is false. The people didn't
willingly give up the faith of their ancestors, which they considered
essential to proper functioning of the earth's cycles. They had their ov
hope of immortality and their own ethic, in many ways a kinder ethic than that of Christianity which was imposed on them by force. 25 Justinian obtained 70,000 conversions in Asia Minor by methods that
were so cruel that the subject populations eventually adopted Islam in order to rid themselves of the rigors of Christian rule. 24
As a rule, heathen folk resisted Christianity as long as they could,
even after their rulers had gone over to the new faith for its material
rewards. Louis the Pious baptized a Danish chieftain named Harald
Klak, and gave him a large fief on the Weser river, on the under
standing that he would convert his people; but the people rejected bot
Christianity and Harald. In the 10th century, King Haakon of
Norway was fiercely opposed when he tried to institute Christianity. . people rebelled, burned the new Christian churches, and forced
Haakon to eat the horse-liver sacrifices and drink New Year toasts to
Woden, Frey, Bragi, and the totemic clan. Some rulers themselves rejected the new faith out of hand. Alcuin announced in the 8th
century that there would never be any hope of Christianizing the Danes. Their king was "harder than a stone and wilder than any beast and would have none of Rome's God. 25
Certain words reveal by their derivation some of the opposition
met by missionaries. The pagan Savoyards called Christians "idiots,"
hence cretin, "idiot," descended from Chretien, "Christian." Germai
pagans coined the term bigot, from bei Gott, an expression constantly used by the monks. 26 Christians were the first to insist that there was
only one god, and it was theirs. This attitude tended to produce
resentment among worshippers of other gods. The Roman Empire tolerated all religions within its far-flung
borders, so long as Rome's official deities received due lip-service,
and the deified emperors were properly honored. This policy of religious freedom was soon abandoned by the Roman church, which
began to insist that all non-Christian faiths be destroyed; then that eve
Christians of non-orthodox sects must give up their heretical "errors,"
760



die. The beginning of organized Christianity marked the true end of Paganism e ancient world's polytheistic freedom of worship. The new Gospels :came the sole authority. Other scriptures were burned. Yet, despite ^^^^^^^^^^^
the destruction, there was no real end to paganism. 27 The people
membered it and practiced it throughout the Christian era.
The third Council of Constantinople decreed in the 7th century
at the people must stop kindling bonfires and leaping over them on ights of the new moon. 28 St. Eligius wrote: "Let no Christian place
^hts at the temples, or the stones, or at fountains, or at trees, or lclosures, or at places where three ways meet. . . . Let no one presume
make lustrations, or to enchant herbs, or to make flocks pass through
hollow tree or an aperture in the earth; for by doing so he seems to
nsecrate them to the devil." 29 Nevertheless, these activities
ntinued.
In vain the Council of Toledo condemned "worshippers of
lols, those who venerate stones, who kindle torches, who celebrate the tes of springs and trees . . . men who go about in the mask of a stag
r bull-calf, who dress in the skin of a herd animal, or put on the heads f beasts." 50 At Ephesus, twelve centuries after the time of Christ,
icient fertility rites were still performed though Christian writers
sported that "men took delight in unholy things as if they were pious ;eds." 51 To the pagans, they were pious deeds.
Slavs never ceased to worship Kupala, the Water-mother Va-kul,
bios the horse god, Yarilo the fertility-savior, and the rest of their
antheon. Bulgarian penitential books tried again and again to abolish orship of the sun and moon without success. As late as the 18th
jntury, the bishop of Voronezh denounced the "satanic games"
)nnected with the sacrifice of Yarilo; and the Bulgarian monk
piridon complained that most of his countrymen still worshipped yerun the thunder god instead of Jesus. 32
The old customs were preserved especially by women, who were
at welcome in the new church, and preferred paganism for the
)iritual authority it could confer on them. A 10th-century Ecclesiastical
anon appealed to fathers, not mothers, to instruct their children in
Christian ways. Men must "forbid well-worshippings, necromancies and
vinations; enchantments and man-worshippings, and all the other
lin practices which are carried out with various spells. . . . And we
ijoin that every Christian man zealously accustom his children to
Christianity and teach them the Paternoster and the Creed. And we
ljoin that on feast-days, they abstain from heathen songs and devil's imes." 33
But the songs and games went on, gradually taking on the guise of icular carnivals, harvest-homes, May dances, Oktoberfests, Midsum
ler feasts, and so on. Women maintained many of these traditions, not ;cause they were more rebellious than men but because they were
lore conservative. Priestesses came to be called "witches" by their
Christian enemies. "Pagan folk practices and beliefs, whether Greco
761



Paganism Roman, Teutonic, or Celtic, did not die out with the introduction of Christianity but rather remained and constituted the fundamental i^^^^^^^^^^^ substratum of witchcraft." 34
After centuries of denunciation and suppression, the church fou
that many pagan ceremonies were too tenacious to be stamped out
and had to be assimilated by the Christian system. At the end of the
18th century, Irish clergymen "artfully yielded to the superstitions of
the natives, in order to gain and keep up an establishment, grafting Christianity on Pagan rites." Bourne said "The monks, in the dark
unlearned ages of Popery, copied after the heathens, and dreamed themselves into the like superstitions." 35 Sometimes Christ and the
old gods were incongruously blended, as at a 1 5th-century temple at Istein dedicated to "Jupiter Christus." 36 To this day, the pagan
ceremony of the New Fire is enacted each Easter on Mount Lycabet
tus, where it used to commemorate the rebirth of Apollo.
Many pagan deities were remade into saints. Others were vagu<
Christianized by interpreting them as prophetic figures. "Aesculapius, who suffered death because he had raised the dead, is a type of
Christ. . . . Jupiter, changed into a bull and carrying Europa on his back, also typifies Christ, the sacrificial ox who bore the burden of the sin of the world. Theseus who forsook Ariadne for Phaedra prefigures the choice which Christ made between the Church and the Synagogu Thetis who gave her son Achilles arms with which to triumph over
Hector, is no other than the Virgin Mary who gave a body to the Son God." 37
With a combination of syncretism, reinterpretation and exeges
Christianity managed to absorb nearly all of paganism except its
Goddess. According to Guignebert:
Western peoples in the early centuries ofthe Christian era never really understood the Christian dogmas, nor have they understood them since. The religion which they have constructed upon these dogmas :
through their own efforts was something different . . . it was cast in
formulas ill able to contain it. The Western peoples have, strictly speakir
never been Christians Bearing the impress only ofthe Christian legend and nourished upon formulas passively repeated, these men th vast majority ofprofessed Christians remained actually pagans, and \ still do so within the folds ofthe Catholic commonwealth. }S

i female, one of the disguises of Vesta under the name of Diva Palatua

This mysterious fetish occupied the Holy of Holies in the Roman

essential spirit of Rome, as it had previously embodied the spirit of Troy. Roman legend said Aeneas carried off the Palladium from the
ivreckage of Troy and founded Rome with its help. It was a symbol of
i protean, androgynous deity usually called Pallas, whose name meant ither "maiden" or "youth." 1 Some said Pallas was identical with the Goddess Athene. Some
763



Palladius said Pallas was a Pan-like goat god slain by Athene. Some said Pallas
Palm Tree was a giant. Some said Pallas was a wooden image of a female warrior.
^^^^^^^^^^_ Some said Pallas was a thunder-stone. A majority believed Pallas was
a phallic god and his Palladium was "the scepter of Priam, in the
likeness of a male sex organ." 2
In Greek myth, Pallas had offspring, the Pallantids, who worshipped an Amazonian fighting Goddess, the enemy of the patriarchal Hellenic hero Theseus. 5 This may account for the notion
that Pallas was a female warrior, once a companion of Athene who
took her name and became Pallas Athene after accidentally killing her in
a mock battle. This classic myth bears the marks of revision, a story
invented to account for Athene's androgynous idol represented by a
lingam-yoni, showing her union with Pallas, Pales, or Pan. The Vestal Virgins were married to the spirit of Rome by means of
an artificial phallus in the Palladian shrine; thus it seems probable that
Pallas was a sacred lingam signifying AMOR, the secret name of
ROMA in reverse.
Constantine moved the Palladium to Constantinople and made it a
symbol of his own masculinity. It was buried under a huge red
porphyry pillar topped by an image of himself in the guise of Apollo. 4

Palladius
Roman name for the phallic god represented by the Palladium; a
name given to the Pater, or Patricius, a spirit of begetting. Palladius was assimilated to the Celtic pater, "Patrick," in a Christian legend that
claimed one Bishop Palladius was a missionary to the pagan Irish before
St. Patrick. 1 Both bishop and saint seem to have been purely
imaginary (see Patrick, Saint).
1. Encyc. Brit., "Patrick."
Palm Tree
In the Babylonian myth of the primal garden, the palm tree was the Tree of Life, a dwelling-place of the Goddess Astarte. The Hebrew version of her name was Tamar, "Palm Tree." 1
Her male counterpart was Baal-Peor, or Phoenix, the god of Phoenicia whose name meant "Land of the Palm." As a phallic deity,
Baal-Peor was symbolized by a palm tree between two large stones. Sexual orgies in the temple celebrated his union with the Goddess in
Phoenicia and in Israel until priests of Yahweh killed the celebrants in
the midst of their rites (Numbers 25:8).
Still, the feminine connotations of the palm tree remained. The Goddess was often embodied in a Mother-palm, giving the food of
764



life in the form of coconut milk or dates. A complicated biblical myth
shows Tamar the Palm-tree as the mother of a slain "firstborn of
Judah"; and as a veiled sacred harlot decorated with the signet, staff, and
bracelets of the nation of Judah; and as a widow (Crone) to whom
offerings of goats were made; and as an idol "by the wayside," whom priests of Yahweh wanted to burn (Genesis 38). She gave birth to the
rival twins Pharez and Zarah, Hebrew counterparts of Osiris and Set.
The spirit of the palm tree was still the Great Mother in the tradition
of early Christians, who gave the title of Holy Palm (Ta-Mari) to the
virgin Mary. 2 Yet Egyptians continued to call a man's penis his "palm tree." 3

Pan
Pan
King of Arcadian satyrs, the horned and hoofed woodland god par
excellence. Pan was one of the oldest gods in Greece, associated with
the cult of Dionysus and sometimes identified with him. Pan was said
to have coupled with all the Dionysian Maenads. In addition, he was
mated to Athene, Penelope, Selene, and many archaic forms of the Great Goddess. 1 Greeks claimed the Egyptian solar god Amon-Ra was the same as
Pan. They called Amon-Ra's holy city Panopolis, "City of Pan," saying it was inhabited by "Pans and satyrs." The panoply (ceremonial
dress and decoration) derives from holy processions in the City of Pan. 2 Other words connected with Pan's cult are caper, caprice, and
capriccio, all from Latin caper, the goat. Pan's sacred drama of death
and resurrection was the original "tragedy," from Greek tragoidos,
"Goat Song." 3 The word "panic" was originally the terrible cry of
Pan, who dispersed his enemies with a magic yell that filled them with
fear and took away all their strength.
It may be that Pan's legend began with the Hindu fertility god
Pancika, consort of one of the primal Mother-goddesses, manybreasted Hariti, who suckled hundreds of pre-Vedic animal spirits as
many-breasted Diana suckled the woodland beasts, whose king Pan was. 4
Pan was an important model for medieval pagans' Horned God,
whom the church called Satan. The devil always displayed Pan's
attributes of goat-hoofs, horns, and unremitting lust; sometimes also a goat head and an attendant throng of satyrs (demons). Yet the new romanticism of the 19th century laid aside the demonic nature attribut
ed to Pan only a few centuries previously and made him a gentle
image of the lost Arcadia populated by shepherds and nymphs. Romantic poets adopted Pan as their wildwood god.
In 1821, Shelley wrote to his friend Thomas J. Hogg: "I am glad
to hear that you do not neglect the rites of the true religion. Your
Pan's name has been derived from paein,
"pasture"; it was also the word for "all" and
for "bread," recalling various All-fathers who were gods of divine
bread, such as Osiris, Adonis, and Tammuz. Like them, Pan was a sacred king
who died in fertilizing the earth. The ritual phrase "Great Pan is dead" seems to have been taken from the rites of Tammuz; it was also understood as
Thamus Pan-megas Tethnece, "All-great Tammuz is dead."

Panacea letter awoke my sleeping devotion, and the same evening I ascended
alone the high mountain behind my house, and suspended a garland, ^^^^^^^^^ and raised a small turf-altar to the mountain-walking Pan." Oscar Wilde
wrote wistfully: "O goat-foot god of Arcady! This modern world hath need of thee!" 5 Byron wrote a regretful ode on the passing of Pan:
The Gods ofold are silent on their shore
Since the great Pan expired, and through the roar Ofthe Ionian waters broke a dread
Voice which proclaimed "the mighty Pan is dead. " How much died with him! false or true the dream
Was beautiful which peopled every stream With more than finny tenants, and adorned The woods and waters with coy nymphs that scorned
Pursuing Deities, or in the embrace Ofgods brought forth the high heroic race Whose names are on the hills and o 'er the seas. 6

Panacea
"All-healer," one of the divine daughters of Mother Rhea Coronis at \
her Pelasgian sanctuary of Titane. Another daughter was Hygeia, "Health." To this day, both Goddesses are invoked in the medical
Hippocratic Oath. 1 The two seem to have been personifications of the Great Mother's breasts, source of the Milk of Kindness and the balm
of healing. Egyptians said the remedy for almost every ill was "the milk of a
woman who has given birth to a child: such is the sweet perfume" that could expel demons of sickness. 2 Panacea and Hygeia were
comparable to Egypt's Two Mistresses, Buto and Nekhbet, whose milk bestowed divinity on pharaohs and health on everyone. 3 Buto was
the same nursing-mother Goddess called Latona, Lada, Leto or Leda, the Babylonians' Allatu, the Arabs' Al-Lat (who later became Allah). Etruscans called her Lat, mother of Latium and giver of
moon-milk. Latopolis, "Milk-City," was the Greek name for Buto's
oracular shrine, the oldest in Egypt. 4
Medieval Europe continued to believe in the curative virtues of
mother's milk. It was said that any mother could cure her infant's sore i
eyes by squirting her milk into them. 5 Male doctors often recommended woman-milk for the sick.
Ironically, one of the last superstitious believers in Panacea was Pope Innocent VIII, author of the infamous bull Summis Desiderantes, which laid the legal foundations for persecution of witches and
caused the torture and death of millions of women. In his last illness,
766

'andemonium
Home of All Demons," Christian term for the underworld, to which very non-Christian deity was consigned because the church claimed all ods and goddesses of the heathen were devils ( 1 Corinthians 1 0:20-2 1 ).
During Rome's long decline, almost the last thinking believers in the
Id gods were their Christian enemies. A pagan might laugh at Apollo
s a fable. A Christian would shudder at him as a malignant spirit."
'
First of the demons in Pandemonium were the rival gods menoned in the Bible. To these were added the Celtic, Teutonic, and
axon-Scandinavian deities; the deities of Greece and Asia Minor; and
le Roman classical gods and goddesses. Specifically listed among the evils were Jupiter, Mercury, Venus, and Minerva. 2 Ruler of Pandemo
ium was the underground god: Pluto, Hades, Zeus Chthonios, Saturn,
.ucifer.

andora
All-giver," title of the Earth-goddess Rhea, personified as the first 'Oman in an anti-feminist fable by Hesiod, who tried to blame war,
eath, disease, and all other ills on women. 1
Pandora's vessel was not a box but a honey-vase, pithos, from
hich she poured out blessings: a womb-symbol like the Cornucopia, nciently used as a vessel of death and rebirth. 2 Pandora's Vase became
andora's Box only in the late medieval period, when Erasmus
listakenly translated pithos as pyxis} Hesiod claimed Zeus sent Pandora to earth to punish men, who ad offended him. She bore a vase filled not with blessings but with
urses: strife, pain, death, sickness, and all other afflictions. Pandora in

escaping the full meed of suffering their Heavenly Father intended for them. 4 The basic theme is also familiar in the myth of Eve.
Hesiod's story was further adapted to the legend of King Solomon who was said to keep a horde of demons in a vase. After his death,
greedy men broke the vase in seeking treasure and let the demons out into the world. 5

Pantaloon
Stock character in Italian commedia, an amorous old rake in dancing j
slippers. He evolved from an artificially created saint, St. Pantaleone, \
patron of Venice, as he appeared in medieval mystery plays.
1 St.
Pantaleone was actually the totemic lion, steed of Venus, after whom J Venice was named. This animal was doubly canonized as the Lion of I
St. Mark, who replaced Venus as the city's patron and whose "relics" occupied the former Shrine of the Lion, now converted into St. Mark's cathedral.
Because the character St. Pantaleone wore flowing trousers in the
eastern fashion, his costume came to be called "pantaloons," later
shortened to "pants."

Paradise
The Persian Pairidaeza (Paradise) was a magic garden surrounding the holy mountain of the gods, where the Tree of Life bore the fruit of
immortality. Pairidaeza was also the divine Virgin who would give birth to the future Redeemer: the Mahdi, or Messiah, or Savior, or
Desired Knight of Saracenic Grail myths. Shi'ite Arabs still look for
the coming of the Virgin Paradise, the next Holy Mother. 1 Hebrew pardes, "garden," was derived from the same Virgin Paradise. 2 In Solomon's Song the "enclosed garden" is the virgin
768



mde whose fountain of life-giving fluid is not yet opened (Song of Paradise
Solomon 4:12). A dual vision of paradise as a living garden and the
iving garden as a female body runs through all religious symbolism. ^^^^^^^^^^^
Lorenzo the Magnificent stated the same ancient theme in his
lescription of heaven: "Nothing other than a pleasant garden, abundant
vith all pleasing and delightful things, of trees, apples, flowers, vivid unning waters, song of birds, and in effect all the amenities dreamed of >y the heart of man; and by this one can affirm that Paradise was
vhere there was a beautiful woman, for here was a copy of every
amenity and sweetness that a kind heart might desire." 3
The psychological model of paradise was life's first experience of romforting love, the mother who warmed and fed the infant right
Ifter its terrifying birth trauma. Having "fallen" from the comfort of the bomb into a world of painful stimuli, if the child is not embraced and
lulled into the illusion that the lost paradise has nearly been regained,
ne foundations for later neurosis will be laid." 4 Often the dweller in
paradise was in a state of pseudo-infancy. When an Egyptian pharaoh ame to his two divine mothers in the after-world, "They draw their
[reasts to his mouth, and never more do they wean him." 5 Egyptian
unerary priestesses bared their breasts when escorting a dead man to
lis tomb, probably as a magical promise of the nursing Goddess's tender
pre.
6 As further insurance, she was painted inside the sarcophagus d, reaching down with her arms to clasp the deceased against her bared
reast, like a mother reaching for her baby. 7 Primitive notions of paradise as land flowing with milk and honey
/ere clearly representative of the mother's body in the earliest
riemories. An elderly Kikuyu chief spoke of these memories, still vivid his mind:
She was always there; I can remember the comforting feel ofher body as she carried me on her back and the smell ofher skin in the hot sun. Ev
erything came from her. When I was hungry or thirsty she would swing me around to where I could reach her full breasts; now when I shut my
eyes I feel again with gratitude the sense of well-being that I had when I buried my head in their softness and drank the sweet milk that they gave. At night when there was no sun to warm me, her arms, her body, took its place; and as I grew older and more interested in other things, from my safe place on her back I could watch without fear as I wanted and when sleep overcame me I had only to close my eyes. 8
Western culture made this paradise the birthright of every
rimitive child a paradise lost. Dr. Henry pointed out that "No other
ulture has invented so many excuses for keeping a mother away
rom her infant." 9 Wickler said a human baby is, like a monkey baby, by
ature "a mother-hugger and should be carried against the mother's
ody continuously in the early days of its life, as is still the custom mong primitive races today. The entire behavior repertory of the
lewborn baby is adapted for this. ... It is not biological for us to place
769



Paradise our babies in cribs. Symptomatic of this is that the babies cry out of
loneliness with abnormal frequency in our culture, while one scarcely
^^^^^^^^^^^ ever finds this among the children of primitive peoples." 10
Psychologists know the image of the lost mother is projected ontc
the sexual partner, which accounts for the extraordinary sexual
significance attached to women's breasts. Erasmus Darwin noted that
the symbolism even goes beyond the breast per se: "When any object
of vision is presented to us, which by its waving or spiral lines bears any similitude to the form of the female bosom ... we experience an
attraction to embrace it with our arms, and to salute it with our lips, as
we did in our early infancy the bosom of our mother." " Man often
sees himself in an infantile relationship to a woman who may be
embraced and kissed that is, a wife or mistress. The Bengali poet Chandidas addressed himself to a loved woman as if he were her infanl
"I have taken refuge at your feet, my beloved. . . . You are to me as a
parent to a helpless child." n A psychiatrist notes that most sexual fantasies of adult males "seei
appropriate for a naive four-year-old, whose most important gratifications primarily depend on mother. ... He shows unacknowledged sign of longing for her with the same fervor he did when she was all the
world to him, the holy center of his child's universe. His desire seems
unmodified by his conscious perception and understanding of the
realities of life and the limited possibilities for gratification with his mother." 13
Similarly, the desire to return to the perfect comfort of the womb
in a post-mortem paradise seems unmodified by conscious recognition of its improbability. Hidden prenatal memory surfaces in many
religious visions of the bliss of paradise, expressing a powerful wish that what was lost at birth may be regained after death. To those traine<
in interpretation of unconscious symbolism it is clear that the meta
phors of eternity represent a return to the womb. 14 When death is neai the mind may even present vivid fantasies reminiscent of the maternal comfort that followed the birth trauma and soothed away the first
experiences of pain and fear.
Thus we find that the garden-paradise from which humanity "fell
in the beginning was a genital symbol: garden, gate, grove, holy mount (mons veneris). This was suggested by the word Eden, meaning in Hebrew "a place of delight." 15 In the Middle Ages the usual
metaphor for paradise was the Garden of Delights, a term less characteristic of the Christian heaven than of the other paradise, Fairyland
or Avalon, where sexuality was permitted. Christian tradition forbade
sexual love and marriage in heaven (Matthew 22:30), but the pagan tradition continued to view paradise as the epitome of all sensual
gratifications and the satisfaction of all sexual-romantic yearnings.
Christians adopted the word paradise as a synonym for their own
heaven, and insisted that the pagans' paradise was really hell, with a false appearance of beauty to lure sinners. In rebellion against this
770



theory, bards openly expressed a preference for hell. Aucassin gives
an example:
For into Paradise go none but such folk as I shall tell thee now: Thither go
these same old priests, and halt old wen and maimed, who all day and
night cower continually before the altars, and in the crypts; and such folk as wear old mantles and old tattered frocks, and naked folk and shoeless,
and covered with sores, perishing ofhunger and thirst, and oflittle ease. These be they that go into Paradise; with them have I naught to do. But into Hell would I fain go . . . thither pass the sweet ladies and
courteous that have two lovers, or three, and their lords also thereto. Thither go the gold, and the silver, and cloth ofvair, and cloth ofgris, and harpers, and makers, and the prince ofthis world. With these I would gladly go, let me but have with me Nicolette, my sweetest lady. l6
Other ballads and early medieval romances rejected the Chris
tian paradise for its lack of feminine company. The Irish Fenians, whose rule was never to insult a woman, were said to have gone to hell for
denying Christian anti-feminist doctrines. The heathen sage Oisin
(Ossian) rejected St. Patrick's heaven on the ground that it had no
hunting, no bardic poetry, and no love of fair women. Oisin said he would rather join the Fenians in hell. 17
Most people refused to believe that hell was identical with their
beloved Fairyland, Avalon, Cockaigne, Torelore, Valhalla, Isles of
the Blest, or whatever pagan paradise they professed; so it came to be
called the earthly paradise, as opposed to the heavenly one. This realm of the Fairy Queen was usually placed in the Far West. Revered
popular heroes dwelt there: Oberon, Lancelot, Tristan, Arthur, Ogier the Dane, and many others. 18 Since these heroes lived forever,
the Irish called their paradise Thierna na Oge, the country of eternal
youth. A wonderful fountain at its heart dispensed the Water of Life
that made old men young again. Belief in this ancient idea may have inspired the westward voyages
of Leif Ericson, Columbus, and the legendary St. Brendan the
Voyager, who was really a canonized form of the sea-god Bran, discoverer of the Cauldron of Regeneration. St. Brendan was said to
have discovered it too, on a magic isle in the west. But "St. Brendan's Isle" was never found. 19 Ponce de Leon went looking for it, and claimed to have discovered the Fountain of Youth in Florida, which he
called Bimini. 20
Churchmen also believed in this earthly paradise. St. Thomas
Aquinas was sure it existed and stated that Elijah and Esdras still lived
there. 21 The 13th-century Hereford Map showed it as a circular island off the coast of India, which Columbus thought he could reach by
sailing west. Hugo de St. Victor said the island of paradise was "a spot in
the Orient productive of all kinds of woods and pomiferous trees. It
contains the Tree of Life: there is neither cold nor heat there, but
perpetual equable temperature. It contains a fountain which flows
forth in four rivers." A Danish hero was said to have reached it by
Paradise

lover-hero, Al-Kasim.

Partridge the bridge to the mystic island. 22
^^^^^^^^^^^m The bridge to paradise appeared in nearly all Indo-European myths. It was sometimes a dragon or serpent, but most often a
rainbow. Persians called it the Kinvad Bridge. Babylonians called it the
Necklace of Ishtar. Norsemen called it Bifrost, or sometimes Brisin
gamen, the Necklace of Freya. Beyond it, the gods dwelt in Asgard or Valhalla, in a castle called Gladsheim (Joyous Home). In Grail myths, this was the Grail Castle on Mount Joy; in the Arthurian cycle, il
was Lancelot's fortress, Joyous Gard. The pagan paradises had many
"mansions," like the paradise of Osiris which Jesus claimed for his own
deity (John 14:2). 23

Partridge in a Pear Tree
Middle English pertriche, "partridge," was derived from Perdix, one of Athene's sacred kings, thrown into the seas from a tower, and carried
772



to heaven in the form of a bird by his Goddess. 1 He was the partridge, Parvati
she the pear tree. Athene was worshipped in Boeotia as Once, the Pear Pastos Tree, mother of all pear trees. Perdix's name originally meant "the ^^^^^^^^^^^
Lost One." He was a form of Vishnu-Narayana, called Lord of Pear
Trees at his holy city of Badrinath in the Himalayas (from badri,
"pear tree"). The pear tree had feminine-maternal significance through Eurasia. It was also sacred to Hera, whose oldest image at the
Heraeum in Mycenae was made of pear wood. 2 European peasants
considered the pear a favorite "life-tree" for a girl. In Russia it was a
protective charm for cows. 3 The partridge in the tree was evidently
taken as a symbol for Christ, instead of Perdix, when the image was transposed into a Christmas carol.

Parvati
Virgin aspect of Kali Ma, called Daughter of the Mountain, or Daughter of Heaven, both titles meaning the same since "heaven" was Himalaya, the Mountains. 1 Parvati was Shiva's bride under other
names as well, such as Maya, Sati, Durga, or Shakti. Often she was
identified with Prithivi, an archaic Mother Earth.

(Minos-the-Bull). Her offspring represented the line of Minoan kings who wore the bull mask and mated with the Goddess every seven years
at a ritual hieros gamos, followed by a ritual bull-killing.

present day as the bullfight.

Book of Leinster A
1 2th-century Irish codex containing stories and poems from the pagan tradition.
Patrick, Saint
Patron saint of Ireland, probably a fictitious figure built on Roman
pater or patricius, a priest. The only evidence for the existence of a
Christian St. Patrick was his own autobiography, supposedly written
in the 5th century but not heard of until 400 years later. 1 Thus it seems
that Patrick's purported writings were forged by monks wishing to pretend Ireland was Christianized earlier than it actually was. It is highly
unlikely that the Irish were converted as early as the 5th century. In
the 12th century, St. Bernard complained that the Irish were still given
over to "barbarous rites," Christianity having failed to take root among them.2
Like many other saints evolved by 9th- and 10th-century hagiogra
phy, Patrick had pagan precedents. One was the Irish god of the
shamrock, Trefuilngid Tre-eochair, "Triple Bearer of the Triple Key," whose sacred plant bore all edible fruits including the apples of immortality. He was a son-consort of the Triple Goddess whose triple
yoni was represented by shamrock designs from the earliest civiliza
tions of the Indus valley. The story that St. Patrick explained the
Christian trinity to the Irish by exhibiting the shamrock was entirely
apocryphal. The Irish worshipped the shamrock as a sign of their triple pagan deities. The Book of Leinster said Patrick's mother was the Goddess Macha: she of the feminine trinity who gave birth to the
shamrock-god. 3 Many other stories suggested Patrick's true paganism. He was
educated by a druid. 4 In Wales he bore the title of Maenwyn,
meaning one dedicated to the moon. 5 The legend of his martyrdom
indicated that he was sacrificed to the Moon-goddess, but like a pagan
god he was united with her Virgin incarnation, Brigit. The funerary temple at Downpatrick was dedicated to both Brigit and Patricius.6
The Welsh form of the Triple Goddess, Guinevere, was said to have
slain "the Irish knight Sir Patrice" with her magic apple, recalling the
Goddess's gift of an apple of immortality to each of her doomed lovers.7
774



With all his pagan precedent, it is not surprising to find the Paul, Saint monkish version of Patrick declaring himself "a sinner . . . despised
by many." 8 ^^^^^^^^^^^
St. Patrick's Day was known throughout the Roman empire as the
day of apotheosis of the god slain during the Ides of March: Liber Pater or Mars Pater, who would have been known as Patricius or
Patrick in Britain.9 At his Roman festival on March 1 7, a gigantic
phallus was paraded through the streets, and solemnly crowned with a
garland representing the divine yoni, by the hands of a specially selected matron. 10 The phallus of Liber Pater was also known as the
Palladium, planted in the womb-temple of Vesta. The priest who
represented this god's power was the pater patrum, "father of fathers," or else the Peter (the phallic stone pillar), or else Palladius. An old
chronicle mentioned a Roman-Irish martyr called Bishop Palladius,
"the first bishop to the Irish who believe in Christ," sacrificed to the
Irish Moon-goddess before Patrick appeared. 11 Evidently both Palladius
and Patrick were the same pagan god, adopted into the canon after
his old shrines were taken over by Christians. 12

'aul, Saint
The true founder of orthodox Christianity was Paul, who either
composed or inspired the earliest identifiably Christian writings, predating the Gospels. 1 Paul laid down the basic orthodox doctrines: hope
of high rank in heaven for the pure; avoidance of women and sexuality;
separation of body and soul. "For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the
other" (Galatians 5:17). Paul copied the more ascetic Gnostic sects
of his time, when "a gulf never completely to be closed again is opened: God and world, God and nature, spirit and nature, become divorced, alien to each other, even contraries." 2
One key to this process was separation of male and female principles in religion. Father Heaven and Mother Earth were no
onger wedded. Women were no longer participants in sacred mysteries
according to Paul. The church must be entirely patriarchal; women were forbidden to teach or preach in it. Paul also laid the guilt of original
sin on woman alone, absolving man from responsibility: "Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression"
(1 Timothy 2:1 1-14). Paul's antipathy toward women and sexuality leads to a suspicion that his esoteric doctrine was linked with the early Christian practice
of voluntary castration, recommended by Jesus for "the kingdom of
775



Paul, Saint heaven's sake" (Matthew 1 9: 1 2). In Paul's day, Rome revered the
self-castrated god Attis and Paul was an earnest admirer of Roman
wm^^^mmi^^^^m culture, as shown by the fact that he Romanized his name, changing it from Saul to Paul. Roman Christians later used self-castration as an
automatic ticket to heaven, in the manner of Attis's priests. 3 Tertul
lian said the heavenly gates were always thrown open to eunuchs. 4
In a secretive, elliptical style typical of contemporary mystical
writings, Paul suggested that he was among the divinely favored eunuchs. He often mentioned, but never described, his mysterious
"infirmity" which he called a "light affliction, which is but for a moment" though it would bring him eternal glory (2 Corinthians 4:17'
It assimilated him to Christ, and "They that are Christ's have
crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts" (Galatians 5:24).
Paul hinted that he was one of the "new creatures" in Christ, neither circumcised nor uncircumcised. A man would have to be one c
the other, unless he altogether lacked a penis. Paul made an oblique reference to a mutilation: "I bear in my body the marks of the Lord
Jesus" (Galatians 6:17). He scorned the "natural" (unmutilated) man for his lack of spirituality: "The natural man receiveth not the things of
the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him" (1 Corinthians
2:14). Nevertheless, Paul recognized that some men might prefer to remain natural. Although "it is good for a man not to touch a
woman," he proposed that such men be allowed to take wives, "to avoii
fornication." Yet this was a grudging concession, given "by permission, and not of commandment. For I would that all men were even as
myself" (1 Corinthians 7:1-7). Paul wrote to the Galatians: "I would they were even cut off whic!
trouble you" (Galatians 5:12). The word rendered "cut off" also meant "castrated." 5 Paul said those who "bite and devour one anoth er" terms often applied to sexual behavior may be consumed. But
those who are in the Spirit "shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh"
(Galatians 5:1 5-16). In his addresses to the Romans, Paul seemed to offer himself and some of his followers as examples of the virtue of
sexlessness:
How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? . . . Our old man is crucified with him Jesus], that the body ofsin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead j freed from sin. . . . Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that
ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. Neither yield ye your members as
instruments ofunrighteousness unto sin. . . . I speak after the manner
ofmen because ofthe infirmity ofyour flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so
now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness. (Roman
6:2-19)
Paul spoke "after the manner of men," as if he were not one,
because his hearers' flesh had an "infirmity" that he didn't share. He
asked them to crucify and destroy "our old man," a common Middle
776



Eastern epithet for the phallus. "He that is dead is freed from sin" Paul, Saint because he could no longer serve the "uncleanness" of women.
The Jews would naturally have argued that sterility was a violation ^^^^^^^^^^
of divine law, since Yahweh's commandment was to be fruitful and multiply. Paul insisted that this commandment was obsolete. God had changed his mind. Paul declared that fruitfulness of the flesh now meant death rather than life:
For when we were in the flesh, the motions ofsins . . . did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve
in newness ofspirit. . . . Sin, taking occasion by the commandment,
wrought in me all manner ofconcupiscence. . . . Fori was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be death. (Romans 7:4-10)
Paul found the divine law of reproduction outdated and distasteful because it brought forth "fruit unto death" i.e., more life doomed to die. Therefore he "died" from the carnal life and acquired new
spirituality. "The carnal mind (or, minding of the flesh) is enmity
against God ... so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
... For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit
do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live" (Romans 8:7-1 3). Paul used the parable of the wild olive tree, whose branches must
be lopped off, to be grafted onto a fruitful tree. To those whose
"branches" were lopped off for the kingdom of heaven's sake, he
promised better replacements in the hereafter, for "God is able to graff them in again. For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is
wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature to a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be
graffed onto their own olive tree?" (Romans 1 1:23-25).
This parable, Paul said, was an important "mystery" of which his
followers must not be ignorant. He pleaded for cutting of the sinful
branch: "I beseech you therefore, brethren . . . that ye present your
bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service" (Romans 12:1). Paul's "living sacrifice" may well
have been like those of Buddhist ascetics and Aztec holy men who
habitually practiced penile mutilations to win the favor of the gods. John the Baptist used arboreal symbolism like Paul's: "the ax is laid
to the root of the trees" (Matthew 3:10). In pagan context, this meant castration of the fertility king. The wild olive, "castrated" with a
golden sickle like the oracular oaks of Dodona, figured in the myths
of Heracles and his Tyrian counterparts.6 The genital blood of a castrated king was the food of immortality, according to the Book of the Dead; the soul of man was nourished on the food "shed upon the
olive tree." 7 The olive branch was, and is, a sign of Peace; and Peace" meant the death of a phallic god, who received the Word of
Peace at his departing. Here is a parable of which modern scholars
777



Pazuzu should not be ignorant. The lopped-off olive branch was carried in the Peacock oeak f the Dove, emblem of Aphrodite, who castrated sacred kings. 8

Pazuzu
The only Babylonian deity to become a movie star: Pazuzu was the "demon" of the film The Exorcist His name really came from an
ancient Sumerian title of the flood-hero-king Ziusudra, "the pa
susu." l Babylonian myths supplied him with a serpent-penis and made him the consort of the serpent-mother Lamashtu, or Lamia, the Jews' Lilith.

Peach
Female genital symbol, in China regarded as the source of the
ambrosia of life which gave gods their immortality; corresponding to the
apple in western Europe. Great Mother Hsi Wang Mu ruled the
magic peach garden in the west, where the gods were reborn. 1 Peach Blossom meant a virgin in Taoist symbolism, while the fruit
stood for a mature woman whose juices were essential to man's
health. China's patron saint of longevity Shou Lou was an old man with
a high bulging forehead, bursting with "yin juice" he had absorbed and sent up to his head through sexual coupling with many women. To
reveal his mystical secret, Shou Lou always held up a peach with one
of his fingers stuck into its cleft. 2
Chinese wizards made magic wands from peach twigs. These might be compared to magic wands made in the west from other
woods sacred to the Goddess, such as witch hazel, witch-willow, apple
boughs, or holly. 3 Western writers sometimes confused the Oriental peach with the
apricot, because abricot was once a European word for the vulva.
Sculptures from the pagan period at Nimes showed examples of this fruit in conjunction with phalli. 4

Peacock
Bird of Juno, mother of the Roman gods. The peacock's iridescent
tail-feather "eyes" symbolized the Goddess's watchfulness, her manycolored veils, and her plumes of justice, against which the hearts of
778



[nen were weighed, as against the plumes of Maat in Egypt. The Pearly Gate >eacock belonged to Juno when she was still the Etruscan Goddess Jni, the Great Yoni. It also belonged to the Hindu Goddesses Sarasvati ^^^^^^^^^^
md Maya, and their Argive counterpart Hera. 1
Juno's priests and priestesses in their sacred processions carried tall >eacock-feather fans called flabelh. These articles were taken over by
Christian popes and are still displayed at papal Easter services. They are
low said to represent "the many-eyed vigilance of the church." 2 Because it was a matriarchal totem originally, the peacock tended
o attract the same opprobrium as black cats, opals, ladders, pentacles, nirrors, owls, and moonlight. Christian superstition generally viewed he peacock as a bird of doom. St. James's Gazette reported in 1888:
'Nobody who has not gone exhaustively into the subject can have any dequate idea of the amount of general inconvenience diffused by a
>eacock. Broken hearts, broken limbs, pecuniary reverses, and various orms of infectious disease have all been traced to the presence of a
>eacock." According to some legends, the peacock became a bad-luck ird because it was the only one who consented to show Satan the
vay to paradise an echo of the pagan belief that the peacock was
uno's psychopomp. 5
In the Orient, however, the peacock remained a Bird of Paradise,
'eacocks were encouraged to wander about the precincts of any
iindu temple and in the royal gardens. Like doves in western Europe, eacocks were considered soul-birds and emblems of good fortune, ometimes even oracles.

'early Gate
Entrance to heaven; a Christian borrowing from the cult of Aphrodite
Carina, or the Sea-mother Mari, to whom pearls were sacred. Her own >ody was the Gate of Heaven, like the Jade Gate of the Chinese
oddess, through which all men passed at birth (outward) and again at eath (inward). Various yonic symbols of the Goddess were said to be ordered with pearls, including even the Celts' sacred Cauldron of
Regeneration. (See Cauldron.) When the Goddess appeared in the guise of the moon, she was
ailed Pearl of the Sea, or Pearl of Wisdom; her seven high
>riestesses were the Seven Pillars of Wisdom (see Pleiades). As the noon was the gate of paradise, so was the Goddess. Early Christian
ectaries copied the pagans in claiming that the souls of the dead
mount up by the pillar of dawn to the sphere of the moon, and the noon receives them incessantly from the first to the middle of the
nonth, so that it waxes and gets full, and then it guides them to the
un until the end of the month, and thus effects its waning in that it is
ightened of its burden." '

Pegasus The pearly moon-gate like Mother Earth made no distinctions
j
between those who could be admitted and those who could not; as all
^^m^^^^^ammm living things were her own children, so all dead things were her charg<
also. When Christian mythology supplied a gatekeeper in the form of St. Peter, then the Pearly Gate became a barrier where a judgment w made on the worthiness or unworthiness of the soul.
The ancients gave all pearls the feminine connotation, saying the were made of two female powers, the moon and water. It was
believed that pearls should be worn only at night, for moonlight woulc enhance their luster whereas sunlight would spoil them. 2
1. Jonas, 233. 2. de Lys, 284-85.
Pegasus
Winged horse of Greek myth, symbol of the sacred king's or hero's
journey to heaven; an image of death and apotheosis, like the mythic death-horses of northern Europe. 1 Pegasus had archaic, matriarchal
origins. He sprang from the "wise blood" of the Moon-goddess Medusa, who embodied the principle oimedha, the Indo-European root word for female wisdom. Or, alternatively, he was the magic horse Arion, "moon creature on high," born of the Goddess Demeter and
ridden by Heracles in his role of sacred king in Elis. There was an earl
female Pegasus named Aganippe, "the Mare Who destroys merci
fully," actually a title of Demeter herself as the destroying lunar
Night-Mare. 2 Pegasus was named for the Pegae, water-priestesses who tended the sacred spring of Pirene in Corinth. The cult seems to have been
rooted in Egypt. The oldest shrine of Osiris at Abydos (ca. 2000 b.c.)
centered on on a sacred spring called Pega. 3
The Greek Pegae preserved an ancient dying-god cult, as shown by the myth of Bellerophon, who mounted Pegasus and tried to ride to heaven "as though he were an immortal." He failed, and fell.
Bellerophon's predecessor (mythologized as his "father") also failed, and was devoured by wild man-eating mares. This was not meant to
suggest that human flesh ever became incorporated into an equine
diet. It meant rather that "the pre-Hellenic sacred king was torn in
pieces at the close of his reign by women disguised as mares." 4
Pegasus represented divine inspiration as well as godlike apotheo sis. A man who rode him could become a great poet. Pegasus's
crescent-moon-shaped hoof stamped the ground and dug the Hippocrene (Horse-Well), a spring of poetic inspiration on Mount Helicon, the home of the Muses. This was another kind of immortality; the rid<
of Pegasus could figuratively "fly through the air, to reach the heavens." 5

elagia, Saint Pelagia, Saint
everal St. Pelagias were invented during the era of saint-making (ca.
Pelican
th century a.d.) Pelagia the Penitent, Pelagia of Antioch, Pelagia of MMMMMni arsus, et al. All were fictions built on the epithet of Aphrodite
elagia, "Sea." They were identified also with St. Margaret or St.
larina, other "pelagic" titles of the same Goddess.
Sometimes Pelagia was a beautiful dancing girl, converted by a
Christian preacher and made to repent. Sometimes she was a
eautiful virgin who threw herself from a housetop to avoid losing her
irginity. Sometimes she was a beautiful Christian maiden who
xirned a royal lover, the son of Diocletian (or, in some versions, the mperor himself), and for this she was roasted to death in a brazen
ull. 1 The stories apparently were inspired by statues of the Goddess
ibeled "Pelagia," and some of the methods of destroying them.
Another legend showed Pelagia differently, as a temptress trying to arrupt a male saint. He was St. Hilary, who wandered into a remote
Jpine village when the people were celebrating pagan rites of Midsum
ler under the guidance of their chatelaine, Lady Pelagia. She 'elcomed the holy man to her palace and asked him many deep
uestions. When she asked, "What is the distance from heaven to
ell?," a heavenly voice commanded St. Hilary to breathe on her in the
ame of Christ. He did so, and she suddenly turned into a statue of
phrodite. In the morning the statue fell to pieces, and the magic palace as revealed as a ruin of an old Roman city. 2
The same riddle was asked again in the legend of St. Andrew, who
xplained that only Satan could know the distance from heaven to ell because he had measured it in his fall. 3
Another legend of Pelagia repeated the same tale told of many
ther fictitious she-saints, namely that she disguised herself as a man
id spent some time living in a community of monks, under the name f Pelagius. 4 This may have been connected with the early apocry
hal Gospels that forbade women to be Christians unless they "made
lemselves male." 5

elican
)ften confused with the stork, another baby-bringing totem of the
irth-goddess, the pelican was an early symbol of the Sacred Heart. Egyptians believed that a mother nourished her infant in utero with
er heart's blood; similarly a mother pelican nourished her young by rounding or "vulning" her own breast with her beak to let her
eart's blood flow into the mouths of her nestlings. The legend probably
rose from the pelican's habit of resting with its bill sunk in its breast
athers.

Penates
Pentacle
St. Augustine accepted this ancient fantasy of the mother pelican>j as fact, and so did subsequent churchmen, for no one dared contra
dict Augustine even though no pelican had ever been seen opening j
own breast. 1 The self-sacrificing mother pelican became a popular motif on both ecclesiastical and secular coats of arms.

Penates
Roman household gods who protected the penus, a grain-storage chamber, once associated with the family tomb. Like Jewish teraphim,
the Penates seem to have been preserved skulls of ancestors, set in niches around the storeroom. 1
1. Neumann, CM., 283.
Penelope
"She Whose Face is Veiled," a title of the weaving Fate-goddess,
miscast in the Odyssey as Odysseus's wife, though she was probably his
personal guardian angel in an earlier story. She was once an orgiastic fertility-mother, as shown by the legend that she took all her "suitors"
into her bed, and she was both the mother and the consort of Pan. 1
Her function in the Odyssey was to account for Odysseus's
charmed life. As long as Penelope refrained from cutting her thread, Odysseus couldn't die. So he survived many dangerous adventures
while she wove and unwove the tapestry of his life, never cutting it off. He even overcame the death-curse cast on him by Hecuba. 2

Pentacle
Pentacle
Based on the symbol of the Goddess Kore in the apple core, the
pentacle or pentagram was worshipped by Pythagorean mystics who called it Pentalpha: the birth-letter interlaced five times. 1 Its meaning
was given as "life" or "health." 2 Some called it the star of Ishtar or of
Isis, or of Isis's underworld twin, Nephthys. In Egypt the five-pointed
star represented the underground womb. 5 Use of the pentacle as an amulet of protection or healing was common in Babylon, where it was often drawn on pots to preserve their contents. The amulet known as The Seven Seals shows a pentack
as the first of its holy signs. According to Judeo-Christian tradition, the Seals were supposed to represent the secret names of God, and
the pentacle was the chief of them, inscribed on King Solomon's
782



magic ring.4 Thus it was sometimes erroneously called Solomon's Seal. Penthesileia However, it was more closely connected with pagan deities than
with the Jewish one. A pentacle with one point straight down __.
represented the Horned God, whom Neoplatonic philosophers called
Pentamorph, "He of the Five Shapes." 5 He appeared in human form as well as the four horned animals, bull, ram, goat, and stag. Pagan Celts like the Egyptians revered the pentacle as a sign of the
underground Goddess, whom they called Morgan. In her honor, the solar hero Gawain carried a pentacle on his blood-red shield.6
Hermetic magicians used the pentacle for their model of Man the
Microcosm. A male figure was placed inside a circle representing the
cosmos: his feet, hands, and head touched the circle at the points
designated by the inscribed pentacle, his genitals being located exactly in its center. 7 This image was related to Firmicus Maternus's remark that man is a microcosm ruled by "the five stars." 8
Like other figures constructed of a single unbroken line, the pentacle was believed to afford protection from spirits, who needed the "gates" formed by a broken line. Therefore the pentacle was often
used to mark off magical enclosures, especially for invocation. Medi
eval churchmen consequently took to calling it by such names as Devil's Sign, Witch's Cross, Wizard's Star, Goblin's Cross, or Witch's Foot. 9 It was thought that a vampire or werewolf would show a pentacle on the foot sole or palm of the hand. This notion may be compared
with the five-petaled Lotus that appeared on the hands of Buddha. 10
Continuous appearances of the pentacle in magic books probably influenced Slavic witches who tried to cure diseases by "measuring
the pentacle" on the patient. A string was stretched from feet to chin, from the middle finger of each hand to the other, from each hand to
the opposite foot, while the sufferer stood in the position of Microcosmic Man. "Differences in measurement give diagnosis and prognosis, and cutting the twine with a knife after each measurement
cuts away the sickness. The bits of twine are burned so that the
patient may inhale the fumes, and the ashes are placed in fresh water, of
which the patient drinks a portion." u
Magic charms using the pentacle are still extant. Gypsies still cut
the apple to reveal the Kore, the Pentacle of the Virgin, which they
call Star of Knowledge. 12

"Man-griever," Amazon queen slain in battle by Achilles during the Trojan War. Some said she killed Achilles first but Zeus restored him to
life. Various sources agree that when she was dead, Achilles raped

Perceval her corpse. Some stories say her eyes were gouged out and she was dragged by one foot and thrown into a river. Others say she was taken
up respectfully and buried with honor as a great heroine. 1
l.Graves,G.M.2,3B.
Roman de Perceval Alternate name for the Conte del Graal written by Chretien de
Troyes about 1185, finished later by other hands.
Perceval
Also known as Parsifal, Percival, Persevelle, and other variations, this protean hero of medieval romance united many myths both pagan and
Christian. He was first manifested as the Welsh ithyphallic demigod Peredur
Paladrhir, whose name meant "Spearman with a Long Shaft," carrying the same sexual implication as Osiris's title, "Mummy with a Long Member." ' His later name, Perceval, also meant a phallus,
literally "He Who Pierces (or penetrates) the Valley." 2 The original myth of Peredur was an allegory of druidic initiation.
His adventures were staged as secret examinations, and he had to take
an oath not to speak a single word to any Christian a detail that surely
indicates pagan Mysteries. Peredur passed 21 days in the castle of the
witches of Caer Loyw to receive his instruction. In the women's "great
court" he saw the Cauldron of Regeneration performing resurrec
tions of the Sons of the King of Suffering, near a sacred cave with a
phallic pillar at its entrance. A man was killed each day. The women anointed the corpse and bathed it in the magic cauldron, and the man's
life was restored. Two sisters resembling the Gospels' Mary and Martha gave Peredur bread and wine to serve the banquet table. This
scene was not a copy of the Christian Last Supper; it came from older
sources. It presaged primitive rites of the death and rebirth of the
vegetation god, for whom the women wailed and in whose absence the earth became a Waste Land.'
Peredur's chief instructress was his lady-love, "the most beautiful
damsel in the world," whose colors were those of the Triple Goddess
in India: virgin white, maternal red, and the black of death. These remained the colors of the Maiden in many romances and fairy tales, such as "Snow White." (See Gunas.) The colors alone put Peredur
into a "trance of meditation" on his mysterious Shakti, for that was
what she was. On saying farewell, she told him: "When thou seekest for
me, seek in the direction of India." 4
Similar instruction at the hands of a Shakti figured in the 12th
century Roman de Perceval, where the Welsh hero metamorphosed into the Desired Knight sent to cure the world's ills, like a Saracen
Mahdi. It was claimed that Perceval would heal the lame Fisher King
and restore the Waste Land to fertility. Perceval was hidden, like most versions of the Divine Child, and
brought up in secret by his mother. He happened to meet some knights, assumed they were angels, and followed them to King Arthur's
784



:ourt. Despite his appearance as a clownish rustic, a lady prophesied Perceval i great destiny for him. ("Ladies" were the court seeresses.) Perceval
isited the Grail castle and saw a vision of the holy vessel in the hands ^^^^^
|>f Queen Repanse de Joie (Dispenser of Joy). Perceval's instructress Blancheflor (White Flower) undertook to
eveal to him the secret meanings of chivalry, or the mysticism of
iove. Spiritual/sexual union with her made him invincible in battle, however, German versions of the legend recounted a battle between he old pagan Perceval sustained by the power of sexual love and a new Christian Perceval sustained by celibacy. 5 Monkish authors worked >n the unfinished Roman de Perceval from before 1200 a.d. to about
230, Christianizing the hero, who then discovered that the true
neaning of chivalry was not what his lady-love taught at all but rather he doctrines of the church. Blancheflor fell on hard times, mythically
ipeaking. She was vilified as "a Jewess named Blanchefleure" who
toupled with Satan at a witches' sabbat and gave birth to Antichrist.6 The new Perceval was no longer a champion of women. He even tastrated himself in order to become one of the pure knights who
'believed in God perfectly." On one occasion he offered assistance to a lagan noblewoman whose property had been stolen. She served him
. feast and invited him into her bed. Though sorely tempted, he caught
ight of the cross formed by his sword hilt and thrust away the
:nchantress. She vanished in a puff of black smoke. Perceval "rove
kimself through the thigh" a classic metaphor for castration
aying, "Sithen my flesh will be my master I shall punish it. ... O good
_,ord, take this in recompensation of that which I have done against
hee. " 7
In this way the phallic hero called Piercer of the Valley became the
burest of pure knights, the only one worthy to see the Holy Grail
tecause all other knights were polluted by love affairs or marriage. In
Perceval's vision, "the old law" was represented as a woman riding a erpent, who a priest told him was a fiend. The woman asked Perceval
b serve her, as the priest said, "to make thee believe on her and leave
py baptism." Perceval refused. He made the sign of the cross and killed
(he serpent. 8 In a Cistercian romance, Perceval met the Queen of the Waste
jand, his aunt, living in poverty in the Waste Forest, though she had >nce been "the richest woman in the world." This indicates the
ikxldess, her temples robbed, and only her woodland groves left to ler. Another female relative, Perceval's sister, arrived dead on Solo
non's ship, the symbol of the church. She was nobly enshrined
>ecause she had died a pure virgin, the monks' notion of the only
icceptable kind of woman. There were no women involved in the Quest, any more than there
vere women involved in setting policies for the church.9 In this final
'ersion of the Grail myth, its feminine meaning had been written out of
he script, even though it was a prize sought by men. With this
785



Pen development, interest in the subject declined. Grail legends dwindled
Persephone away for lack of further inspiration. The Christianized, virginized mm^t^^^^^^^mm Perceval seemed to lack charisma. He was a hero who pleased only th<
monks who invented him; ordinary folk found it difficult to sympa
thize with this singularly bloodless knight.

Peri
Persian fairy or genie, usually female, like western fairies but sometimes considered one of the fallen angels (djinn). A peri could also be a
familiar spirit, a mischievous elf, a heavenly nymph, a Shakti. Sufis
called a peri a pir, lady-love.
Persephone
"Destroyer," the Crone form of the Triple Goddess Demeter, whose other personae were Kore the Virgin and Demeter-Pluto the
Mother (or Preserver). The three deities succeeded each other
cyclically like the three points of a turning triangle Demeter's symbol the delta so that Kore and Persephone were often confused and came to be considered the same Goddess. The fable about Kore
Persephone's abduction by Pluto was a later invention. She was
Queen of the Underworld long before there was a masculinized Pluto.
Orphic mystics worshipped her as Goddess of the blessed dead, to whom they addressed formula prayers: "And now I come a suppliant t(
the Holy Persephone, that of her grace she receive me to the seats of
the Hallowed." Persephone answered, "Happy and blessed one, thou shalt be god instead of mortal." ' She held the keys to heaven and hell
(Elysium and Tartarus), thus anticipating the Mithraic pater patrum an his Christian counterpart Peter. 2
Persephone was considerably older than the Eleusinian myth of
classical writings, which told of her descent into the underworld and her annual return to the earth each spring. She was really another nami
for Hecate, or Hel, and had ruled the underworld as Destroying Mother Kali ruled it under the name of Prisni, which may have been
the origin of Persephone's Etruscan name, Persipnei. Romans called her Proserpine. It was under this name that she passed into Christian
tradition as a Queen of She-Demons. 5 Like Kali the Destroyer, she
was the basic Death-goddess from the beginning. 1. Legge 1,133. 2. Cavendish, P.E., 98. 3. de Givry, 141.

eter, Saint
he myth of St. Peter was the slender thread from which hung the
hole weighty structure of the Roman papacy. One solitary passage in ie Gospel of Matthew said Jesus made a pun by giving Simon son of >nah the new name of Peter, "Rock" (Latin petra), saying he would
und his church on this rock (Matthew 16:18-19).
Unfortunately for papal credibility, the so-called Petrine passage as a forgery. It was deliberately inserted into the scripture about the
rd century a.d. as a political ploy, to uphold the primacy of the Roman e against rival churches in the east. 1 Various Christian bishoprics
ere engaged in a power struggle in which the chief weapons were ibery, forgery, and intrigue, with elaborate fictions and hoaxes
ritten into sacred books, and ruthless competition between rival parties
* the lucrative position of God's elite. 2
Most early churches put forth spurious claims to foundation by xwtles, even though the apostles themselves were no more than the
landatory "zodiacal twelve" attached to the figure of the sacred king,
arly popes were often mere names, drawn from titles of Roman
xls, such as Eleutherios or Soter, falsely inserted into an artificial
ironology to simulate succession from Peter. But even Catholic
holars now admit that the stories of Peter's upside-down crucifixion
rfbre Nero, and burial in the Vatican hill, were fictitious. 3
The real roots of Peter's legend lay in pagan Roman myths of the
ty-god called Petra, or Pater Liber, assimilated to the Mithraic pater
itwm (Father of Fathers), whose title was corrupted into papa, then Dope."4 This personage had been both a Rock and a Father that
, a phallic pillar in the Vatican mundus since Etruscan times, when
racular priests called vatis gave their title to the site. Other variations
the deity's name were Patriarch (Chief Father), Pompeius, and atricius (Patrick). 5 Like Indian Brahmans, Roman "patricians" aimed a patrilineal descent from the god. Since his name also meant a
787



Peter, Saint rock, he was what the Old Testament called "the Rock that begat
thee" (Deuteronomy 32:18). ^^^^^^^^^^^ The god's stone phallus remained planted in the Vatican mount
through the later centuries of the Roman empire and well into the
Middle Ages perhaps even into the 19th century, when a visitor said
Vatican authorities "kept in secret a large stone emblem of the
creative power, of a very peculiar shape." 6 Medieval names for such an
object perron, pyr, pierre show that it was both a "rock" and a
"peter." Such was the ancient Pater's phallic scepter or pillar topped with a pine cone, the thyrsus of Pater Liber. Church authorities often
converted a carved perron into a Christian symbol simply by placing a
cross on its tip. 7
Pater Liber's perron appeared in St. Peter's Church of the 14th
century a.d., atop the round temple called Pantheon, renamed St. Mary Rotunda. The temple had been buried under an artificial hill
forming the court of St. Peter's, probably because it was known as a shrine of the Goddess. Local legend said the phallic stone had been
"carried off there by the devil on the night on which the Virgin
brought Christ into the world." 8 This "devil" probably meant the Horned God Bacchus (Pater
Liber), whose phallic staff called baculus was allegedly carried by St.
Peter, though not by the popes. A strange, garbled legend explained the loss of the baculus. Peter gave it to the earth in order to raise a saint
called Maternus from the grave. This legend evidently arose from the
cult of Bacchus, who sent his phallic staff into the underworld, ^^^^ sometimes in the form of an inverted "Peter's cross," to fertilize the
maternal soil. Hence the oddly-named Maternus who rose like
vegetation from the ground. The bones of St. Maternus were said to lie
Peter's Cross under the foundation of the First Church of the Martyrs in Cologne,
built by the Empress Helena in Maternus's honor, a typical confusion ol
chronologies. 9 However garbled, the legend of Peter's baculus was perpetuated
by Germanic emperors, who claimed Peter's staff had passed from
the popes to Germany, betokening Teutonic leadership of the Holy Roman Empire. 10 Other medieval legends presented Peter in the
pagan role of a fertilizing spirit. For instance, he was said to make a
woman conceive by giving her an apple or a pine cone, symbols of Bacchus and his bride. 11
Peter or Petra combined with other phallic "rocks," such as the
obelisk at the gate of the Egyptian after-world, sacred to Par, the title
of Ra as "Lord of the Phallus." 12 This was also called Petra. A
"prophet" of Ra incarnate in the savior Osiris was known as Petosiris;
his tomb near Hermopolis was a great pilgrimage center about 341 B.C.
A Greek prayer addressed him: "I invoke Petosiris whose venerated
body here lies. Today he is among the gods, he is now united with the
Wise." King Nechepso was possessed by his spirit, which took him on
a typical shamanic "night journey" to heaven. 13 Greco-Egyptian scrip
788



tures written under the names of Nechepso and Petosiris were Peter, Saint
popular in the 2nd century b.c. 14
Like the obelisk, a phallic pillar stood at nearly all the "Pearly ^^^^^^^^^^
Gates" of the Great Mother's temples, representing the Petra who
demanded the right passwords of initiates entering the temple, and the same initiates after death entering heaven. Petra also guarded the
gates of the year, through which the ChristosAeon passed. Thus Peter
was identified with Janus, god of gateways, and came to be called the
Janitor, "Gatekeeper." 15 The church's festival of St. Peter used to be held on the day of
Janus, when the sun entered the sign of Aquarius, symbol of both the
gate of the year and the Pearly Gate of Maria-Aphrodite. 16 Pagan
precedents naturally assimilated St. Peter to the position of guardian of the janua coeli, "gate of heaven," formerly a yonic emblem of the Virgin Juno. Robert de Borron's romance of the Grail even suggested that Peter stood for the gate of Jesus's tomb: Jesus was laid under a
pierre, a peter-stone, such as marked the graves of ancient phallic heroes. 17
As gatekeeper, Peter inherited the mystical keys based on the trident of Shiva and the Osirian ankh, called Key of the Nile and also
a heavenly key to the Nile in the Sky (the Milky Way). Key-holding deities generally gave or denied admittance to the land of the dead,
whether it was located in the earth or in the heavens. The Book of
Enoch described various keepers of the heavenly mansions as key
holders: one for the winds, one for the seasons, one for the gates of hell,
etc. 18 Prayers to the Goddess Persephone called her Holder of the
Keys; or, alternatively, her consort Hades was the holder of the keys to heaven and hell. 19
On such pagan precedents rested the crucial doctrine of the papal
keys, as stated in the interpolated Gospel passage: "I [Jesus] will give unto thee [Peter] the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever
thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven" (Matthew 16:19).
That is, holding the keys meant magic power. Whatever the keyholder commanded would come to be. This primitive idea underlay the
powers of priests, bishops, popes, and the whole church organization.
Without the mystic keys, ecclesiastics' blessings, cursings, baptisms, exorcisms, excommunications, prayers, or invocations were without efficacy. As Brahman priests commanded the gods by secret mantras, so Christian clergymen made the public believe the power of the keys could cause God to act.
The Gospels suggest that Peter controlled even the Savior's
passage through the holy gate. There is a ring of ritual about the story that Peter denied Christ three times before the cock crew (Matthew
26:34), as though some material of the ancient sacred drama were
clumsily re-interpreted. The resurrected god couldn't enter into his
kingdom until dawn. The angel of annunciation appeared as a cock,
789



Peter, Saint
Pausanias Greek traveler and geographer of the 2nd century a.d. Living in a time of
declining culture, he was inspired by a desire to describe the ancient sacred sites for
posterity.
"to announce the coming of the Sun," as Pausanias said. 20 At cockcrow
the Savior arose as Light of the World to disperse the demons of
night. But if he tried to enter into his kingdom earlier, disrupting the
cycles of night and day, the Gatekeeper would deny him. The ritualistic denial took place also in the fertility cults of Canaan, where
the dying god Mot was denied by a priest representing the Heavenly Father. 21
This story made difficulties for Christian theologians, when the
pagans inquired why Jesus should found his church on a disciple who denied him instead of a more loyal one. The conventional answer was
that it demonstrated Christ's power of forgiveness. But during the later persecutions, denial of Christ came to be considered the one
absolutely unforgivable crime. The cock was another totemic "peter" sometimes viewed as the
god's alter ego. Vatican authorities preserved a bronze image of a cock with an oversize penis on a man's body, the pedestal inscribed "The Savior of the World." 22 The cock was also a solar symbol. Sun
worship was evident in Christian literature, especially the "Gnostic
Gospel" of John. Mithraic solar symbolism entered into many papal customs. St. Peter's Chair, the papal throne, was decorated like the throne of Mithra with zodiacal signs and the twelve labors of the sun
god. 23 Another curious survival of the bird form of "Peter" was the water
walking sea petrel, whose name meant "little peter." Petrels belonged
to the legendary sea witch, Mother Carey, a corruption of Mater Cara, the Latin Goddess Car or Ceres, "Mistress of Earth and Sea."
English sailors called the petrels Mother Carey's chickens, chicken being a diminutive of "cock," just as petrel was of "peter." 24 Like St. Peter, the petrels were "fishermen" who walked on water. Some said
however that they were pagan souls who didn't reach hell before the
gates were closed, and had to fly into "holes in the earth." 25
The incident of Peter's water-walking (Matthew 14:29) was drawn from centuries of Oriental myth. Five hundred years before Chris
tians attributed this feat to Jesus and Peter, Buddhists were saying a sage
proficient in yoga could walk on water. 26 Later medieval writers
attributed the same miracle to various saints noted for asceticism. St.
Maurus for example lived an especially pure life, and found himself able to walk on water after he was blessed by St. Benedict. 27
Other miracles attributed to Peter probably v/ere intended to
prove that he truly possessed the power of the keys. Like Christ, he could make the lame walk (Acts 3:7), and he could kill with a word,
his first victims being Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5:5, 10). None of
Peter's legends however suggest that he was a real person. Scriptures concerning him were written (or forged) long after the epistles of Paul. 28
It is now certain that there was no St. Peter in Rome to "found the
papacy." 29 Stories about Peter were invented after the Roman see
790



vas well established. During the first five centuries of the Christian era,
10 one thought the bishop of Rome had a right to govern other >ishops; there was no such doctrine as the primacy of the Roman see. 'Christ neither founded nor desired the Church." 30 Indeed, the
esus of the Gospels would have had no reason to found a church, since
lis principal message was that the world was going to end almost at
jince. Whatever his origin, St. Peter stood for patriarchal opposition to
e female principle, as shown by the Gnostic Gospels later censored ut of the canon. The Dialogue ofthe Savior made the holy harlot
4ary Magdalene the superior of all apostles; the Gospel of Mary said Christ loved her best, and gave her a secret revelation that Peter tried to
orce out of her. In the Pistis Sophia, Mary remarked, "Peter makes tie hesitate; I am afraid of him because he hates the female race." 31
Medieval legends also suggested Petrine anti-feminism. It was said
>eter had a daughter, Petronilla (Little She-Peter), who was too eautiful in Peter's opinion, so he prayed God to strike her with a fatal
lness, and God complied. The Golden Legend suggested that Peter srtured women to exorcise them, as he caused them to vomit up the
evils that possessed them, along with "much blood." 32
Legends aside, the real political power of the popes depended on opular acceptance of the doctrine of Peter's keys. Like a Brahman igh priest, the pope assumed absolute control of God, who would grant
is vicar's slightest request. Thus invested with divine power on
arth, the pope became a figure comparable to the ancient god-kings, /orshipped with similar subservience and inclined toward a similar
rrogance. 33 Pope Innocent III set papal policy with a proclamation that "the ord left to Peter the governance not of the church only, but of the /hole world." 34 Innocent was not content with the title "Vicar of hrist" but had it changed to "Vicar of God." 35 The bull Unam
hnctam of Pope Boniface VIII stated that every human creature on
arth must be "subjected to the Roman pontiff." 36 In his jubilee year, loniface represented himself as the emperor of all Europe. He dressed
lis cardinals as Roman priests, and himself in imperial armor,
reclaiming, "I am the emperor; I am the Augustus." 37 Boniface came to power by tricking his simple-minded, 80-yearld predecessor Celestine into abdicating the throne. Boniface had
^destine imprisoned in the fortress of Fumone, and had him mur
ered, rumor said, by driving a nail into his head. Boniface's enemies
herished as a holy relic Celestine's alleged skull, with a hole in it.
loniface had many enemies because he used papal power to seize inds and towns of the wealthy Colonna family, to give them to his own
imily, the Gaetani. Encountering resistance from the Colonnas,
loniface preached crusades against them and plunged Italy into a
loody civil war. He beseiged the Colonna city of Palestrina and
ffered to return half the enemy's possessions if the city were given up;

Phaedra but he broke his promise. Once it was in his hands, he had Palestrina
razed, its palaces, libraries, and treasure-houses sacked, its ground
^
w^^m plowed and sown with salt. One of the Colonnas survived and
eventually assassinated Boniface. 58
A similarly avaricious heir of St. Peter was the highly inclement pope Clement VII, nicknamed "the Butcher" because of his fond
ness for massacre. He promised the mutinous people of Bologna that hi would "wash his hands and feet in their blood." 39 At Cesena in 1376
he offered mercy to the city, then killed five thousand of its citizens. There were uprisings against him. Mobs hounded him out of Rome
and Naples, crying, "Death to the Antichrist! Death to Clement and hi
cardinals!" 40
Over all, the heirs of St. Peter have tended to follow the general
pattern of dictators, some less benevolent than others. If they had any
quality in common, it was acquisitiveness. This appeared so consistently that the Renaissance popes made it a heresy to say Jesus and Peter were poor men. Visiting Rome in 1511, Martin Luther was so shocked by the decadent luxury of the papal court that he wrote: "If there is a
hell, then Rome is built upon it. . . . Tiberius, the heathen Emperor, even if he were such a monster as Suetonius writes of, is nevertheless
an angel in comparison with the present court of Rome. The same hat!
to serve the supper table twelve naked girls." 41 It was rather a contrast
with the popular image of twelve apostles.

Phaedra
Daughter of the Cretan Moon-queen Pasiphae, who gave birth to the Minotaur. Phaedra married Theseus, who killed the Minotaur. She accompanied Theseus back to Greece and became his wife, and
simultaneously the stepmother of Hippolytus, a victim slain by horses al the instigation of the magic Bull from the Sea the Minotaur.
This tangled tale centering around Phaedra points to importation of the Cretan sacred-bull cult into Greece, where it merged with the |
local horse cult. Hippolytus was the victim dragged to death by horses j
after coupling with the queen (Phaedra). Apparently Hippolytus died as a surrogate for Theseus who, as the slayer of the bull-king in the
792



labyrinth, would normally have been the next victim. The classic Phaethon
nyth states that Theseus brought about the death of his son Hippolytus Phallus Worship
y laying a curse on him and praying to the sea god to implement it. 1 ^^^^^^^^^^
Some say Hippolytus was apotheosized and now appears in heaven s Auriga, the Charioteer.

haethon
Classic Greek figure of the solar Lucifer, a son of the sun. Phaethon ommitted the crime of hubris, offended his jealous Father, and was cast own from heaven like a lightning bolt.
Phaethon tricked his father Helios-Apollo into allowing him to
rive the solar chariot across the sky, playing the role of the great God
imself. But Phaethon lacked his father's skill. He lost control of the
orses and nearly set the world afire with his reckless driving. His
ither threw him down into the sea just in time to save the earth from
eing ignited by the fiery sun-chariot. 1 Phaethon's myth didn't originate in Greece. It was an old tale from Lhodes, the Island of the Sun, where white horses and a burning
hariot were annually thrown into the sea to propitiate the Hittite sun
od Tesup, whose cult had replaced that of the Moon-goddess )anae. 2 It seems likely that in primitive times there was also a charioteer
laying the role of Phaethon and giving up his life for the sake of a ost-mortem godhood.

hallaina
)ne of the titles of the Greek "female soul," also known as Psyche,
l her devouring aspect; literally, a yoni that which devours the hallus. 1 The same word was applied to the night-moth, as a
lysterious dark sister of the sun-loving butterfly that represented
syche's daylight aspect. Phallaina was Psyche paired with Eros,
.ccording to the classical myth, their matings could take place only in le dark. When Psyche saw her husband in the light, their marriage
'as dissolved.
1. Lindsay, A.W., 131.
hallus Worship
Ls Goddess-dominated religions made the yoni their holiest symbol, 3 God-dominated religions adored the phallus. Patriarchal Semites
worshipped their own genitals, and swore binding oaths by placing a
793



Phallus Worship hand on each other's private parts, a habit still common among the
Arabs. 1 Words like testament, testify, and testimony still attesf to the ^^^^^^^^^^^m oaths sworn on the testicles.2 Abraham's servant swore by placing his hand "under the thigh" of
his master (Genesis 24, 9) because "thigh" was a common euphe
mism for "penis," used in superstitious fear of mentioning the divine organ directly. Myths of male pseudo-birth like Zeus's fatherhood of Dionysus made the offspring come forth from the father's
"thigh." 3 But the meaning was "penis," as in the Hindu myth that substituted the lingam for the yoni: the god Sukra (Seed) came out of the stomach of the Great God by way of his penis. 4
Another Middle-Eastern euphemism for "penis" was "knee,"
genu, so often mentioned that some people came to believe the knee
was the source of seminal fluid. A father used to establish paternal rights
to a child by setting the infant on his knee, which is why "genuine"
(of the knee) came to mean "legitimate." In Mesopotamia the word birku meant both "knee" and "penis." 5 In Latin it became virtu,
"masculine spirit, virility, erect-ness."
The Bible calls Jacob's penis the sinew that shrank, lying "upon the hollow of the thigh." Scholars have tried to interpret this limp
penis as something else: a severed tendon, or a certain thigh muscle, which Jews were forbidden to eat (Genesis 32:32). But medieval
translators frankly recognized the phallic meaning of the "sinew." They said the god-man's blighting touch on Jacob's shrunken member was
"to cool the fires of concupiscence." 6
Biblical patriarchs worried inordinately about the vulnerability of the penis and avoided direct mention of it lest evil spirits be drawn to
it. Old Testament laws reveal a special fear of women's power over the penis. God's commandment was that a woman who grabs a man's genitals must have her hand cut off, even if she does it to defend her
husband against an enemy (Deuteronomy 25:1 1-12). The word "fascinate" is a relic of men's belief in the magic of their
own genitals. Latin fascinum meant an erect penis (presumably
"fascinating" to the opposite sex), especially in the form of a phallic amulet. Such amulets continued to be used through the Middle Ages
as antidotes to the evil eye. 7 In the 8th century a.d., the church forbade
men to pray to the fascinum. In the 9th century, the same prohibition
had to be repeated and again in the 12th and 1 3 th centuries, showing that the custom went blithely on. 8
The phallic principle was covertly worshipped in sacred posts and pillars, such as the Maypole and the "bride-stake" erected at weddings, about which "the guests were wont to dance as about a
May-pole." 9 Stubbes in 1 583 described common folk dancing and
hanging garlands on their Maypole, which he called a "stinking idol." 10 Women of ancient Rome used to hang flower wreaths on the erect
penis of the god Liber, to "have fruit of the seeds they sow," St. Augustine said. 11
794



The same sexual ceremony of encircling the phallus with a female Phallus Worship
wreath was perpetuated at Antwerp, where an ancient ithyphallic statue of Priapus stood before the sanctuary of St. Walpurga, once the ^^^_-^^^^^_
orgiastic Goddess of Walpurgisnacht or May Eve. Each year at the
Ispring festival, women hung wreaths of flowers on Priapus's penis. 12
Another image of the same god was carried through the streets of
(Naples in sacred processions, displaying a penis long enough to reach is chin. This excrescence was known as ilsanto membro, the Holy
ember. 13
A
1 3th-century Chronicle of Lanercost said that, at Easter, the
rish priest of Inverkeithing "revived the profane rites of Priapus,
llecting young girls from the villages, and compelling them to dance
circles to Father Bacchus. When he had these females in a troop,
ut of sheer wantonness, he led the dance, carrying in front on a poje a
epresentation of the human organs of reproduction, and singing and
ancing himself like a mime." H This priest was less eccentric than one
Wiight think; the same sort of thing was happening all over Europe.
Phallus worship was Christianized in ways that hinted at Christianity's krue nature: a cult of the male principle.
Giant phalli were adored up to the 17th century as saints, such as
Eutropius, Foutin, Guerlichon, Gilles, Regnaud, Rene, and Guiknole. St. Foutin de Varailles was a phallic pillar kept red with libations pf wine, as the phalli of Shiva were constantly reddened in Hindu temples. 15 Ithyphallic saints in Normandy and Anjou were believed to
Impregnate women who lay with them all night. The image of St.
puignole had a large erect penis from which women scraped splinters as
conception charms. So much scraping went on that the saint might
pave had his holy member whittled away entirely. But the priests, with commendable foresight, made his phallus of a wooden rod that
passed all the way through the statue to the back, where it was hidden by
a screen, and could be periodically thrust forward by a tap of a mallet
as it diminished in front. 16
Christ assumed the role of a phallic god in providing the most
popular of conception charms: the Holy Prepuce or more accuratey, Prepuces, for there were hundreds of them in Renaissance churches.
\t least thirteen examples still survive. 17 All had the power to make
vomen conceive. The most celebrated of the virile foreskins, housed at he Abbey Church in Chartres, was credited with thousands of
niraculous pregnancies. 18 St. Catherine of Siena went so far as to claim
hat Jesus used his holy foreskin as her wedding ring. She was bound
o Jesus as his bride, "not with a ring of silver but with a ring of his holy
lesh, for when he was circumcised just such a ring was taken from his
loly body." 19 Phallic saints were special patrons of virility, much entreated by nen with sexual problems. Sir William Hamilton described the cult
)f two phallic saints, Cosmo and Damiano, at Isernia in 1781: "Ex-voti
)f wax, representing the male parts of generation, of various dimensions
795



Phallus Worship ... are publicly offered for sale. . . . The Vow is never presented with
out being accompanied by a piece of money, and is always kissed by th
^
^_ devotee at the moment of presentation." The priests sold St. Cosmo's
holy oil as a virility charm:
The oil ofSt. Cosmo is in high repute for its invigorating quality, when the loins, and parts adjacent, are anointed with it. No less than 1400 Has! ofthat oil were either expended at the Altar in unctions, or charitably
distributed during the Fete in the year 1 780; and as it is usual for
everyone, who either makes use ofthe Oil at the Altar, or carries offa Us ofit, to leave an alms for St. Cosmo, the ceremony ofthe Oil becomes likewise a very lucrative one for the Canons ofthe Church. 20
A hint of the broad extent of phallic Christianity in England appeared after World War II when Professor Geoffrey Webb, of the
Royal Commission on Historical Monuments, investigated a bombdamaged altar of an old church and found a large stone phallus within Further researches showed that the altars of approximately 90% of
English churches built before 1 348 had hidden stone phalli. 21 By paga:
tradition, an altar symbolized the female body which is why witches were said to use a naked woman for their altar and the phallus within
it obviously represented the Hidden God. Sexual symbolism kept cropping up to embarrass scholars of
religion, like Georges Dumezil, who called "indiscreet" the Roman belief that the sacred Palladium in the temple of Vesta was the scepter
of Priam "in the likeness of a male sex organ." Yet Dumezil himself
wrote, "Some day it will be necessary to restore to the history of religions the idea of the symbol which is today so underrated and yet
of such capital importance." 22
An understanding of phallus worship is important for comprehen
sion of religious psychology, especially the fundamental insecurity of male self-worship: for the phallic God was useless without the Goddess Dr. Lederer says:
During the aeons offeminine dominance, women were well content in
the possession oftheir own particular magic, and did not envy men their little tool that was so easily borrowed when it was needed. Indeed, the Great Mother was never short ofa phallus . . . the phallus was at
her service. It was kept in evidence in the sanctuary ofthe Goddess, and
was not the phallus ofany particular God or mortal, was not a man or a
God with a phallus, but it was simply a phallus per se, a depersonalized instrument ofready and convenient use. Once used, it was no longer useful. For the Great Mother, as for certain ofher descendants today,
penises are expendable: one can always get more, and the new ones are probably better. The new ones, ofcourse, are younger; and the fear of
being spent, and doomed to replacement by a younger man both in . the sexual and in the general service ofthe Goddess may on occasion b a source ofdeep anxiety for the middle-aged male. 2*
Phallic anxiety was evident in all patriarchal systems, where fear
796



of the devouring vulva led to both ascetic avoidance and persecution of Phallus Worship
women. Phallic anxiety was the keynote of the one solitary joke in the Malleus MaleHcarum (Hammer for Witches), the Inquisition's official i^^^^^^^^^
handbook. The monkish authors took the joke seriously, though it
was given them by some sly peasant whose purpose was mockery. The story was that a witch stole a man's penis, but he caught her and
forced her to reveal its whereabouts. She told him to climb a tall tree
and look in a nest, which proved to be filled with penises. He chose
the biggest one, but the witch said he couldn't have that one; it
belonged to the parish priest. The pious authors swallowed all this with great solemnity, and
wrote: "What is to be thought of those witches who in this way
sometimes collect male organs in great numbers, as many as twenty or thirty members together, and put them in a bird's nest, or shut them
up in a box, where they move themselves like living members, and eat
oats and corn, as has been seen by many and is a matter of common
report?" 24 Even more to the point, what is to be thought of those churchmen who believed it?
Phallus worship often slid over the ill-defined line into homosex
uality, which was inevitable among men taught to adore the phallic principle in each other. Sometimes a homosexual kind of adoration was extended toward the superior male, or toward God. Among gypsy
men, the expression of ritual self-abasement was hav co kar, "I eat thy
penis." It was explained that "If one should, for example, petition God in prayer for a wish to be granted, he would precede his request by
saying, 'O God, I eat thy penis.'
" As with other eaten gods however,
"the question whether it might be the last remnant of a very ancient
practice of cannibalism must be considered." 25
Phallus worship is still evident in the symbols and sayings of the
modern world, though its meaning is less like impregnation and more like death. Guns, cannon, missiles and other weapons are the phallic
symbols. In underworld slang, "to get a hard-on" means to pull a gun. 26 "Hits" and "scores" describe both attacks and sexual encounters.
Dominant men are "big shots" or "big guns." The ancient image of
the fructifying Lord of Life is unhappily transformed into a Lord of
Death when male power is identified with the power to destroy. In its
worship of the masculine principle of aggression, the modern world
sorely misses the central idea of ancient Goddess worship: that true

Phanes Phanes
Phrixus
Orphic double-sexed deity, firstborn of the World Egg. He-she helped the Triple Goddess arrange the universe. Phanes was also
known as Eros, Ericipaius, or Phaethon Protogenus (Shining Firstborn). 1 Phanes means "Revealer."
1. Graves, G.M.I, 30; 2, 404.
Philosopher's Stone
See Alchemy.
Phoebe
"Bright Moon," title of Themis the oracular Goddess of Delphi, and her emanation Ar-temis. The title was taken over by Phoebus Apollo,
which gave him the self-contradictory name of "Lunar Sun." 1
Nevertheless, his priests insisted on this title. Sometimes he was called
simply Phoebus, indicating a moon god rather than a sun god.
1. Graves, G.M. 1,178.
Phoenix
Egyptians identified the Phoenician god Phoenix with their bennu
bird, a spirit of the benben or phallic obelisk. He rose to heaven in the
form of the Morning Star, like Lucifer, after his fire-immolation of
death and rebirth. 1 In Phoenicia as in Egypt he embodied the sacred
king cremated and reborn. Symbolic burning of the king continued
up to the present century in Upper Egypt, on the first day of each solar year by Coptic reckoning. 2 The king's soul released above the pyre assumed bird form, as ancient pharaohs at their cremation took the forr of the Horus-hawk. See Birds.
1. Budge, G.E. 2,97. 2. Frazer.G.B., 332-33.
Phrixus
Boeotian prototype of Isaac, a son almost slain as an offering to God
by his pious father, when a magic ram appeared to take his place. The ram carried Phrixus out of danger, then gave up its life and its
Golden Fleece, which became a sacred fetish. The myth "records the
annual mountain sacrifice of the king, or of the king's surrogate first a boy dressed in a ram's fleece, and later a ram." 1 Thus Aries-the-Ram (Egyptian Amen) became the god of New Year sacrifices. See Ram.

Pillar
The obelisk, Maypole, pillar, sacred tree trunk, upright cross, and
other male divinity-symbols probably originated in India where Shiva's
lingam (penis) was worshipped as a sacred pillar. Shiva's title Sthanu,
"the Pillar," revealed him as a personified phallus. 1 Some of his holy
pillars are still popular pilgrimage centers. Land within a radius of 100 cubits from such a pillar became known as the Kingdom of Shiva,
where many miracles occur, including instant remission of sins. 2
Seasonal festivals still feature a Maypole representing Shiva's "Great
Lingam." 3 Phallic pillars appear also in northern Asia and Siberia, where such erections are entitled Powerful Posts of the Center of the City, or
Man-Pillar of Iron. People pray to such pillars, calling them "Man" or
"Father," offering them blood sacrifices. 4
Blood was anciently considered essential to the lingam-pillar,
which Hindus frequently painted red or smeared with blood. Archaic
Egyptian myth said two pillars, called "trees that shed blood," stood at the entrance of the temple. The blood they shed could render women pregnant. 5 Here may be found a remnant of the primitive idea
that male blood, not semen, is the fertile essence, copied from Neolithic worship of female "moon-blood." The temple door repre
sented the yoni, entitled Er-per, the Holy Door of the Goddess. 6
As in India, where Shiva's lingam was painted red or anointed with
blood for religious festivals, so in Egypt the pillars in front of the temple door were "blooded" in memory of primitive sacrifices when
real men were hung on them to bleed. Jews picked up this Egyptian
custom and blooded their doorposts for Passover with the vital fluid of
the sacrificial lamb. The doorposts represented phalli, like the pillars in front of Solomon's temple, named Boaz and Jachin, "Strength" and "God Makes Him Firm" (1 Kings 7:19-20). At Hierapolis the temple of the Goddess had an enormous phallic
pillar on each side of the door. Every year, a man climbed to the top
of each pillar and remained there for seven days, symbolically recapitulating ancient sacrifices when the pillars were bathed in the blood of
human victims, who were evidently left hanging for one lunar week, perhaps in imitation of a menstrual period. 7 When Syria was Chris
tianized, the custom was continued by the "pillar saints" who, like their
pagan predecessors, thought themselves near enough to heaven for their prayers to be distinctly heard. 8 The most famous of them was St.
Simeon Stylites, "Simeon of the Pillar," who stayed aloft until his limbs became gangrenous and he died in a pungent odor of sanctity.9 A church was built around a sacred pillar in Athens and named St.
799

Pithos John of the Column. As pagans had previously come to tie their
Planetary Spheres illnesses to the pillar with silk thread, so the legendary St. John ordered
^
^^m^^^ "Let any sick come and tie a silk thread to the column and be
healed." 10
Pillars in conjunction with churches as a spire or campanile
not often recognized as male symbols in contact with a female one,
although the shikhara or spire associated with a Hindu temple is
generally viewed as a phallus. 11

Pithos
Female-symbolic Holy Vase, used in the Eleusinian Mysteries as a uterine receptacle for corpses, to give them a blessed rebirth. The
Goddess herself was represented by a vase or pot in the guise of
Pandora the "All-Giver." (See Pandora.) The identity of the Great Mother with this vessel of rebirth and regeneration was an idea
common to most ancient cultures, where the manufacture of pots and vases of all kinds was usually the business of women. 1
In Christian custom the pithos was transformed into the pyx or "box" that enclosed the body of Christ; and Erasmus confused the
two vessels in translating the patriarchal version of Pandora's myth.
1. Neumann, G.M., 132-33.
Planetary Spheres
The Chaldean astrological cosmology was generally accepted throughout the Mediterranean world in the early Christian era. Accord
ing to this cosmology, the earth lay under a series of nested, inverted j
crystal bowls, turned independently of each other by star-angels. This idea accounted for the independent movement of sun, moon, and
planets against the fixed stars. Each "sphere" had its tutelary deities. In Egypt these were known as the Seven Heavenly Midwives, emanations of Hathor, who guarded the seven gates of heaven. Souls seeking entrance must address them with hekau, words of power. The first of
them was greeted: "Lady of tremblings, surrounded by lofty walls, the
chieftainess, lady of destruction, the disposer of the words that drive away storms and deliver from destruction him that traveleth along the
way." 1 Under the earth lay the celestial spheres' mirror image, seven
nether spheres descending into the Abyss. These divisions of the
underworld were called Seven Recesses, Seven Gates, abysses, bothroi, antra, mychoi, pylai, or chasma (pits).
2 At the bottom lay the
800



"oundations of the earth, "the meeting of the mighty waters." Like the Planetary Spheres
.elestial gates, the underworld gates were guarded by special porters, he Assyro-Babylonian maskim or Anunnaki. Ziggurats were models of ^^^^_-^^^^_
ihe upper and lower planetary spheres. Ascending heavens were epresented by the terraces of the ziggurat, known as the Stages of the Seven Spheres of the World. 3 Underneath, inside the temple, were
even corresponding "deeps" or "pits." Initiations in the temple apparently mimicked the descent into the
inderworld pits and a journey through the heavenly stages also. \puleius described his initiation into the Mysteries of Isis as a descent
nto the land of death, to the threshold of Isis-Nephthys, or Persepho
le the Destroyer. He beheld the Black Sun, nether image of the solar ;od. Then he ascended through the lower and upper worlds and saw face to face" the deities of both. Finally he rose to the heights and was
xhibited to the congregation in the costume of the sun god. 4 The
ourney of each initiate was a theatrical performance, with priests and
riestesses wearing the costumes and masks of the appropriate spirits,
nd dramatic descents through dark caves and other specially decorated
ooms. The impressive effects may well be imagined. Early Christians believed all souls descended from heaven to enter
leir bodies of flesh on earth, during the descent taking faults and
assions from each sphere to sully their initial purity and cause tempta
on. This was the origin of the Seven Deadly Sins. "As the souls
escend, they draw with them the torpor of Saturn, the wrathfulness of
/lars, the concupiscence of Venus, the greed for gain of Mercury, ie lust for power of Jupiter; which things effect a confusion in the
juls, so that they can no longer make use of their own power and
leir proper faculties." 5 After living the right sort of life, the soul could
j-ascend after death, shedding its sinful qualities one by one.6
ometimes the spirits of the planetary spheres acted as inspectors after ie Egyptian manner: "As men ascend, they find custom-houses
uarding the way with great care and obstructing the soaring souls, each ustom-house examining for one particular sin, one for deceit, nother for envy, another for slander, and so on in order, each passion
aving its own inspectors and assessors." 7
Gnostic mystery-cults copied the pagans, in that they taught asswords and charms to propitiate the guardian spirits of each
)here. In the Pistis Sophia, Jesus told his followers: "Stay not your
and until ye find the cleansing mysteries which will cleanse you so
i to make you pure light, that ye may go into the heights and inherit
ie light of my kingdom." 8 The heights meant the Empyrean, where k)d lived in the highest heaven. Those who attained true enlightenlent would enter the Godhead and become God, just as Oriental iges believed they could enter Nirvana and become one with the
lfinite.9 In China, the successively higher heavens were even
raphically illustrated by the multiple roofs of the pagoda, one above
lother. 10
801



Pleiades The days of the week are still named after the planetary spheres.
Monday is the Day of the Moon (dies lunae). Tuesday is Tiw's Day, ^^^^^^^^^^^ named for the Saxon god who was the counterpart of Mars; it is the Day
of Mars in Latinate languages (French mardi). Wednesday is Woden's Day, dies mercurii, named for the Teutonic god considered the
equivalent of Mercury. The once-supreme Woden was ousted from the list in the very country of his origin, Germany, and replaced by a neutral Mittwoch, "Mid-week." Thor's Day was named for the thunder-god who was a Germanic
equivalent of Jove; Romans called it diesjovis. Friday was Freya's Day (Frea-Tag), Rome's dies veneris, the day sacred to Venus-Aphrodite-Freya the only wholly feminine day, which may be why so many superstitions were connected with it. The Goddess's day was
followed by Saturn's Day, then by the Day of the Sun (dies soh's),
associated with the "fiery" heaven of aether.
As the planets ruled various divisions of heaven, so also they were
believed to rule various places on earth according to their qualities.
Under the sun were "light places, the serene air, kings' palaces and
princes' courts, pulpits, theatres, thrones, and all kingly and magnifi
cent places." Under the moon were "wildernesses, highways, groves,
woods, rocks, hills, mountains, forests, fountains, waters, rivers, seas,
seashores, ships, and granaries for corn." Under Mars were "fiery and
bloody places, furnaces, bakehouses, shambles, places of execution, and places where there have been great battles fought and slaughters
made." Under Mercury were "shops, schools, warehouses, ex
changes for merchants." Under Jupiter were "all privileged places,
consistories of noblemen, tribunals, chairs, places for exercise, schools, and all beautiful and clean places, and those sprinkled with
divers odors." Under Venus were "pleasant fountains, green mead
ows, flourishing gardens, garnished beds, stews, the sea, the seashore,
baths, dancing places, and all places belonging to women." Under
Saturn were "all stinking places, and dark, underground, religious, and mournful places, as church-yards, tombs, and houses not inhabited by
men; and old, tottering, obscure, dreadful houses; and solitary dens,
caves, and pits; also fish-ponds, standing pools, sewers." 11

Pleiades
The convoluted symbolism of the Pleiades or Seven Sisters suggests
an extremely archaic tradition. The importance attached to this small
group of dim stars seems out of proportion to their apparent
insignificance. The sacrifice of the Mexican savior Xipe Totec, Our Lord the
Flayed One, took place on the Hill of the Stars at the moment when
802



the Pleiades reached the zenith on the last night of the Great Year Pleiades
cycle. It was thought if the Sisters were not propitiated by the sacrifice, the universe would fall to pieces and the world would come to ^^^^^^^^^^^
an end. 1
Pre-Vedic India also attached sacrificial significance to the Pleia
des, called Seven Mothers of the World, or Krittikas, "razors" or
"cutters." They were also seven priestesses who "judged" men a
cognate was Greek kritikos, "judge" and sometimes "critically" wounded them, for their razors were castrating moon-sickles. The fire god Agni copulated with the Seven Mothers while they were men
struating, the usual Tantric rite later outlawed by the Vedic priesthood.
They gave birth to a solar hero enveloped in a great red cloud
(female symbol) penetrated by bolts of lightning (male symbol). The hero was sacrificially slain, wounded in the side with a spear, and
from his body sprang his reincarnation, another hero like himself. 2 In
this myth may be discerned rites of great antiquity, predating the discovery of fatherhood, when blood was the essence of generation. The Pleiades were prominent in the early cult of Aphrodite, who was supposed to have given birth to them under her name of Pleione.
Aphrodite was a castrating Crone-goddess as well as a Holy Dove; and the Pleiades were "a flock of doves." 3 They were connected with sacrificial New Year ceremonies in Greece as in central America and
southeastern Asia. The Seven Sisters stood at the zenith on New
Year's Eve as if to select the god of the new Aeon. Old Babylonian texts
began the year with the Pleiades. Later, the zodiacal sign of the New
Year became Aries, the Ram. 4
Egyptian texts allude to the Pleiades' archaic significance as
Krittikas, judges of men, assigning them also to seven planetary spheres as the seven Hathors. The dead had to speak the names of these
Goddesses to pass their "critical" examinations and enter paradise:
"Hail, ye seven beings who make decrees, who support the Balance on the night of the judgment of the Utchat, who cut off heads, who hack
necks in pieces, who take possession of hearts by violence and rend the
places where hearts are fixed, who make slaughterings in the Lake of Fire, I know you, and I know your names; therefore know ye me, even as I know your names." 5 The reference to tearing out hearts is
remarkably evocative of Aztec religious customs. The Seven Mothers Who Make Decrees appeared also in Arabia as Seven Sages or
imams (from ima, "mother").6 In classical mythology the Pleiades represented the Maytime feast
of life and the November feast of death at opposite points of the year. They were emanations of the Moon-goddess "who was worshipped at the two solstices as the Goddess of alternatively Life-in-Death and
Death-in-Life and who early in November, when the Pleiades set, sent the sacred king his summons to death."7 Prayers for the dead were recited before the Pleiades on November 1 , which became All Soul's
Day. 8
803



Pluto Greeks said the leader of the Pleiades was the Dove-goddess
Alcyone, the "halcyon" bird who brought good weather for the ^^^^^^^^^^^ planting season. Another Pleiad was Electra, mother of Dardanus,
legendary founder of Troy, whose name is still preserved in the
Dardanelles. Another Pleiad was Merope, "Bee-eater," a title of Aphro^ dite's queen bee as devourer of the drone. Some said Merope was one of the Furies; others said she married the doomed sun-hero Sisyphus. Still another Pleiad was Maia "the Maker" or the "Grand
mother," mother of Hermes the Enlightened One, as her Hindu counterpart Maya mothered Buddha the Enlightened One.9
Classical writers seemed anxious to disguise the real nature of the
Pleiades. One story insisted they were all virgins. Orion the Hunter
tried to rape them, but Zeus protected them by turning them into doves
and placing them in the heavens. The story was obviously absurd, as all the Pleiades had lovers or husbands, and three of them had mated
with Zeus himself. In earlier myths, Orion the Hunter was their
victim, not their attacker. The Huntress of the Seven Stars, Artemis,
shot him to death in the sea, suggesting that victims were sometimes
riddled with arrows then consigned to the deep. 10
Artemis personified another set of seven stars, the much larger
constellation Ursa Major, the "Great She-Bear," who may have been another version of the Seven Sisters. Artemis and Aphrodite both were
associated with ancient cults of the Seven Pillars of Wisdom, seven
mantic priestesses of Seven-Gated Thebes, where the Seven Hathors once ruled, where sacred kings were slain every seventh year, and
where Teiresias was castrated and lived seven years as a temple woman. The same magic seven were called Seven Midwives in Egypt and the
Orient. They were probably represented in pre-patriarchal Jerusalem by the holy Menorah (seven-branched candlestick) symbolizing the sevenfold Men-horae or Moon-priestesses, as shown by its female
genital decorations, lilies and almonds (Exodus 25:33).
Medieval superstitions betrayed fear of groups of seven females, perhaps a relic of ancient images of the Sisters. East Frieslanders
believed that in any family of seven sisters, one of the seven was sure to
be a vampire or a werewolf. 11 The sevenfold grouping could also be
arranged in a vertical line of descent, e.g. in the ubiquitous belief that a
seventh daughter of a seventh daughter was always a witch.

Pluto
"Riches," underworld consort of Persephone in classical myth. An
earlier Pluto was not male but female, a daughter of the Cretan earth
mother Rhea, one of the Titans or elder deities. 1 She was apparently
804



the second person of the original Demeter trinity also called Rhea Poimandres
comprising Kore the Virgin, Pluto the Mother, Persephone the Pomegranate Destroyer. "Riches" typically meant the Mother figure whose breasts ^^^^^^^^^
poured forth abundance. Later, Pluto was masculinized, and in Christian times "he" became synonymous with the devil.
l.Graves.G.M.2,25.
Poimandres
'Shepherd of Men," a title of Hermes Trismegistus as psychopomp jr Conductor of Souls. According to the Hermetic scriptures called
Poimandres, the enlightened soul under the benevolent direction of Hermes could ascend to heaven by giving up its sins to each of the
olanetary spheres in turn, becoming one with the Heavenly Powers, hen entering the essential being of God. "This is the good end of those vho have attained gnosis: to become God." ' See Antinomianism. A medieval prophet named Giovanni Mercurio da Correggio issimilated himself to Poimandres who seems to have been, in this :ontext, a reincarnation of Jesus. He arrived in Rome one Palm
Sunday, riding a white ass and leading a procession. He wore a crown f thorns, topped by a crescent bearing the legend: "This is my son
'imander, [sic] whom I have chosen Thus speaks the Lord God nd the Father of every talisman in the world, Jesus of Nazareth." This iermetic hero marched to the Vatican to lay his magic tools on the
ltar, declaring that he had come down from heaven with power to idge the quick and the dead. He wandered about Italy for years,
reaching and working magic. He was suspected of heresy but as he was ponsored by Lorenzo de' Medici and other influential patrons, the
nquisition let him alone. 2

'ollux
,atin form of Polydeuces, twin brother of Castor. Together they
/ere the Dioscuri, born of Leda's egg along with their sister Helen of
roy. Castor and Pollux were worshipped as gods of the morning and
vening star, and attendants of the Moon-goddess, their mother. 1
ecause Pollux as a morning-star god became identified with Lucifer,
nd because he was revered by the pagans, his name gave rise to
pollution."
1. Graves, CM. 1,251.
omegranate
rnon, "pomegranate," was a biblical name of the Goddess's genital
ne (2 Kings 5:18), from rim, "to give birth." 1 The pomegranate
805



Pomona with its red juice and many seeds was a prime symbol of uterine fertilit)
Pooka Therefore pomegranates were eaten by souls in the underworld, to ^^^^^^^^mm^m bring about rebirth. Hellenic mythographers said both Kore and
Eurydice were detained in the underworld because they ate pome
granate seeds there. Nana, virgin mother of the savior Attis, conceived
him by eating either a pomegranate seed or an almond, another yonic
symbol. The Bible says the pillars of Solomon's temple were ornamented
with the female-genital symbols of lilies and pomegranates (1 Kings 7:18-20). Solomon himself impersonated the phallic god Baal-Rimmon, "Lord of the Pomegranate," when he was united with his divine
bride, the mysterious Shulamite, and drank the juice of her pomegranate (Song of Solomon 8:2).
Argive Hera was worshipped as Our Lady With the Pomegranate at Capaccio Vecchio near Paestum, formerly a Sybarite colony called Poseidonia. In ancient times the people laid at the Goddess's feet
offerings of little boats filled with flowers, as she sat enthroned with her
child on one arm, a pomegranate in her other hand, inviting contemph tion of the miracle of her bringing forth life. About the 12th century
a.d. the people of Paestum built her a new shrine, to which pilgrimages
are made to this day. There sits Our Lady With the Pomegranate still, enthroned with her child on one arm, a pomegranate in her other
hand. 2 The people lay at her feet offerings of little boats filled with
flowers.
Hera was Mother Earth, and the suit of pentacles in the Tarot
pack represented the earth element. Therefore it is not surprising to find this suit transformed in some medieval packs into a Suit of
Pomegranates, the fruit always opened in an oval orifice to show its moist red interior. 5

Pomona
Roman Apple-Mother, Goddess of fruit trees; a title of Hera or Eve
as dispenser of the apples of eternal life. Every Roman banquet ended with apples, as an invocation of Pomona's good will. See Apple.
Pooka
Irish version of Puck, from Old English puca, a fairy; also related to
"spook," a ghost or demon, as the old gods of the fairy-religion were called. 1 Ireland had several Puckstowns, a Puck Fair, and a Pooka's Ford. 2 See Bogey.

'oseidon Poseidon
Greek sea god corresponding to Roman Neptune. He was "greedy of Possession
earthly kingdoms" that is, his priests were and so his myths tell how "^^^^^^^"" he took territories from various forms of the Goddess. He pretended
to marry the Triple Goddess herself, under her name of Amphitrite, and demoted her to a mere sea nymph. He tried to take Argolis from Hera, and Athens from Athene. He claimed to have invented the horse
bridle, though Athene had already done it. He demanded that women be deprived of their vote in Athens, and forbade men to continue taking the surnames of their mothers as they had formerly
done. 1 He even claimed husbandship of the venerable Mare-Demeter on the ground that he had once raped her in the form of a stallion.
Yet Poseidon was an upstart god, transparently subject to the Goddess in his earlier myths. "He had, properly speaking, no name of his own, but was simply known as 'the spouse of Earth.' He only
became a great god when his original nature, and also the origin of his name, were forgotten." 2 When Poseidon sent a flood on the Xanthian plain, the Xanthian
women beat him off and saved their country by hoisting their skirts
and marching on him with their genitals exposed. The doughty sea god beat a hasty retreat. 3

Possession
The idea that a human body may be possessed by a supernatural personality, in addition to its own natural one, occurs in every religion.
Christians believed in several kinds of possession, both divine and
demonic. The Catholic church retains the office of exorcist because it
still considers demonic possession real. At the same time, god
possession was the central idea of Christ's incarnation, and it is believed
that a worshipper may be possessed by the spirit of Christ, often in the ecstatic manner of the primitive shaman. Some Christian sects
called this "getting the spirit."
Pagan mystery cults brought about god-possession by eating the god (as did Christians also), and by initiatory rites and formulae. The Mithraic initiate said he was "rendered immortal in this hour by the
good will of God in his abounding goodness . . . that I may be
initiated and that the Holy Spirit may breathe within me." A Hermetic
papyrus prayed the god to enter into the worshipper, "for thou art I
and I am thou I know thee, Hermes, and thou knowest me; I am thou, and thou art I." Possession by Hermes the Wise Serpent would have been "diabolic" possession from the Christian point of view;
but the principle was the same everywhere. People possessed by pagan gods sometimes created a tradition
directly inherited by Christianity. Worshippers of Attis castrated
807



Possession themselves when fully possessed by the spirit of their castrated god. Under the same influence "they flogged themselves until the blood
^^^^^^^^^^^ came. In Italy such processions of flagellants during Passion Week have
continued until the present day, the Madonna being the patroness of these Re penitenti (penitent kings)" instead of the Great Mother of the
Gods, who formerly governed their bloodlettings. 2 To be possessed meant to take the spirit into one's body, either as
the flesh of a sacrificial victim or as bread and wine representing that
flesh. For the same reason that Christ "entered into" those who ate
him, so possession by devils was thought to occur through incautious eating. St. Gregory the Great told of a nun who became possessed by a
devil after eating a bit of lettuce. The devil complained to the
exorcist, "What wrong have I done? Here I was sitting upon this lettuce, and she came and ate me!"' To speak a blessing over food
before eating was originally supposed to drive out whatever devils might
be lurking there.
Pope Gregory professed an ability to recognize the signs of demonic possession under any circumstances. When a horse kicked
and plunged and refused to let him mount, he instantly realized the
horse was possessed by a demon. He even knew the possession had
been caused by two magicians, whom he arrested, blinded, and tortured into confessions. Afterward, they were "cared for" at the church's
expense for the rest of their lives, meaning they were imprisoned for
life. 4
All primitive people think humans, animals, and inanimate objects may serve as vessels for spirits. "The Maori term waka clearly
indicates that the inspired man carries the god in him as a canoe carries
its owner." 5 Our own vocabulary expresses the same belief. Inspiration means breathing in a spirit; enthusiasm means the god within. We
say, "What possessed you to do that?" or "I don't know what got into
me." An obsessive person may be called devil-ridden or hag-ridden.
Euripides called Dionysus the god of prophecy, because he took possession of the body through divine madness, which "makes those
whom he maddens foretell the future." 6 We still speak of being
"possessed" by prophetic or poetic frenzy. Mediums are "possessed" by spirits of the dead, who speak through them as demons were said to
speak through their human hosts. Men never abandoned the notion of alien spirits within the human
mind. Not only was the god-within concept essential to the commu
nion rite, but the devil-within concept was also essential to discrediting other deities, whose communion rites were the same. Moreover,
diabolic possession was affirmed by the scriptures. Summers said, "We
have the authority of Christ Himself as to its reality. . . . [N]o reader
of the Scriptural narrative can deny that Christ by word and deed
showed His entire belief in possession by evil spirits. And if Christ
were divine how came He to foster and encourage a delusion?" 7
The third edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica gave the same official opinion under Demoniacs: "The reality of demoniacal posses
808



sion stands on the same evidence with the gospel system in general." A Possession
19th-century Catholic authority wrote, "To deny possession by devils is to charge Jesus and his apostles with imposture How can the ^^^^^_^^__
testimony of apostles, fathers of the Church, and saints who saw the
possessed and so declared, be denied?" 8
Seventeenth-century clergymen fought the "evil heart of unbelief" that led people to doubt the reality of demonic possession and the efficacy of exorcism. Priests vied with each other to see who could
cast out the most demons. In a highly publicized case, Sister Madeleine de la Palud of the Ursuline convent of Aix-en-Provence was found
to contain 6,666 demons including Beelzebub, Leviathan, Baalberith, Asmodeus, and Astaroth the cream of hell's celebrities.9 Jesuits at
Vienna claimed over 12,000 demons in a single case of possession.
One skeptic, Bishop Miron, suspected the possessed Martha Brossier of fakery when her demon sent her into convulsions at the reading of
what she thought was a Latin Bible; it was actually a copy of Virgil's Aeneid. Miron called the girl a fraud, but the Capuchin monks rejected his verdict as "Godless." 10
Fraud was a major ingredient of incidents of possession, often
deliberately fostered by clergymen to trump up a dramatic demonstration of their power over the forces of evil. At Salmesbury in 1612,
three women were accused of causing possession in a girl, who later admitted that she had been coached by a Roman Catholic priest who wanted the women prosecuted, because they had defected from his
church and turned Protestant. 11 Sir Walter Scott observed:
The Catholic church had much occasion to rally around her all the
respect that remained to her in a schismatic and heretical kingdom; and when her fathers and doctors announced the existence ofsuch a dreadful
disease [as possession], and ofthe power ofthe church 's prayers, relics, and ceremonies, to cure it, it was difficult for a priest, supposing him more tender ofthe interest ofhis order than that ofthe truth, to avoid such a
tempting opportunity as a supposed case ofpossession offered for displaying the high privilege in which his profession made him a partner, or to abstain from conniving at the imposture, in order to obtain for his church
the credit ofexpelling the demon. It was hardly to be wondered at, if the ecclesiastic was sometimes induced to aid the fraud of which such motives forbade him to be the detector. ,2
Some cases were not consciously faked. Symptoms of possession could be produced by such causes as hysteria, epilepsy, sexual frustra
tions, depression, or plain boredom. Ascetics in monasteries and convents were most prone to demonic possession, which seemed a way
to relieve the isolation, inactivity, and drabness of the cloistered life.
Nuns were often imprisoned in convents against their will, because husbands wished to be rid of them, or because their parents could
give them no dower and so compelled them to be brides of Christ. 13
The church's word for the depression that afflicted nuns and monks
was acedia, "abysmal apathy." H Screaming fits, blasphemies, sexual fantasies, and erotomania of
809



Possession the possessed sprang directly from hatred of convent life, as shown by j
the nun Jeanne des Anges:
^^^^^^i^^"" My mind was often filled with blasphemies, and sometimes I uttered them
without being able to take any thought to stop myself. I felt for God a continual aversion. . . . The demon beclouded me in such a way that I
hardly distinguished his desires from mine; he gave me moreover a strong aversion for my religious calling, so that sometimes when he was in my head I used to tear all my veils and such ofmy sisters
'
as I might lay hands on; I trampled them underfoot, I chewed them, cursing the hour when I took the vows. . . . More often than not I saw quite well that I was the prime cause ofmy troubles and that the demon acted only
according to the openings I gave him. . . . As I presented myselfat Communion, the devil took possession ofmy head, and after I had received the blessed host and halfmoistened it the devil threw it in the
priest's face. 15
There was a time when demonic possession was almost as
contagious as the common cold. It would sweep through a cloister like
an epidemic. A 1 5th-century German convent suffered an outbreak of possession in which all the nuns took to biting one another. In a
French convent, they began mewing like cats. At Aix in 161 1, a man
was burned at the stake for sending an extraordinary number of demons into the nuns; one nun alone was possessed by 6500 demons. 16
Possession served as an excuse for orgiastic goings-on at several
convents in the 1 7th century. Father confessors at Louviers from
1628 to 1642 instructed the nuns in lesbian intercourse, celebrated communion naked, and staged obscene masses where the officiating
priest would attach a host to his penis, and engage in coitus or sodomy.
Nuns were forced by their "demons" to frequent coupling with both
"devils" and prelates. At Auxonne, the Mother Superior was accused of
causing possession among the nuns by teaching them to masturbate with a dildo. At Nimeguen, possessed nuns claimed to be sexually
assaulted by black priapic creatures lurking in their beds. Even in the
late 19th century, erotic hysteria infected the sisters of Mont-Saint
Sulpice at the instigation of a "possessed" nun Cantianille, allegedly violated by a priest and dedicated to the devil at the tender age of 1 5. 17
Maria Renata Sanger, sub-prioress of a convent at Wurzburg, was executed for bewitching other nuns and causing them to be seduced by demons in the form of handsome young men. 18 One
would naturally suspect that these "demons" were made of quite solid material and entered the convent by night through some secret hole
in the wall, with a certain amount of assistance from within. Erotomania was the major ingredient of one of the most famous
cases of fraudulent possession, that of the nuns of Loudun in the
1630s, which ended in the legal murder of a priest, Urbain Grandier, whose misfortune it was to have made some powerful enemies.
With the Mother Superior setting the example, claiming possession by four major demons Leviathan, Balan, Iscaron, and
810



Behemoth the nuns accused Father Grandier of causing their fren- Possession
zies, which only grew worse with every attempt at exorcism. 19 The priest maintained his innocence though hideously tortured; his legs were ^_^^^^^^^^^
crushed to pulp in the boots. He refused to name any accomplices, as
the custom demanded. To build their case, his torturers said he was
really invoking the devil when he prayed aloud to God for deliver
ance from his sufferings. 20 At last a phony pact with the devil was forged and "found" to seal his doom. It said:
My Lord and Master, I own you for my God; I promise to serve you while I live, and from this hour I renounce all other gods andJesus Christ and Mary and all the Saints ofHeaven and the Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman Church, and all the goodwill thereofand the prayers which
might be made for me. I promise to adore you and do you homage at least three times a day and to do the most evil that I can and to lead into evil
as many persons as shall be possible to me, and heartily I renounce the Chrism, Baptism, and all the merits ofJesus Christ; and, in case I should desire to change, I give you my body and soul, and my life as holding it from you, having dedicated it forever without any will to
repent. Signed URBAIN GRANDIER in his blood. 2'
After Urbain Grandier was burned at the stake, possession of the
nuns continued. It had become a tourist attraction, and the sisters were
celebrities. They learned to show off for the crowds, like Sister Claire:
She fell on the ground, blaspheming, in convulsions, lifting up her
petticoats and chemise, displaying her privy parts without any shame, and uttering filthy words. Her gestures became so indecent that the audience averted its eyes. She cried out again and again, abusing herself with her hands, "Come on then, foutez-moi! [fuck me]!" 22
Possession was often achieved by children and adolescents, who knew with a sure instinct what would gain them the most attention. The
conveniently timed hysteria of adolescent girls, followed up by adults'
superstitious fears, created the notorious witch-craze at Salem, Massa
chusetts; the basic idea had long been common in England. Panicked
by any sign of fits in a child, parents and neighbors immediately began a search for the witch who was to blame." Needless to say, any child
who learned what a stir he could cause in this way was strongly
motivated to repeat it.
In 1 595 a thirteen-year-old Staffordshire boy learned to throw fits
at the sight of a woman named Alice Gooderidge, who was tortured by having her feet burned to induce her to confess sending a demon
into the child. Upon being faced with him, Alice pleaded, "Thomas,
I pray you forgive me and be good to me." But Thomas only fell into "a
marvelous sore fit," went into a trance, "saw a man come out of the chamber pot, flames of fire, and the heavens open." To Alice he said, "Yonder comes Mother Red Cap, look how they beat her brains out, see what it is to be a witch; see how the toads gnaw the flesh from her bones." Alice Gooderidge was convicted of witchcraft and died in
prison. 2

Possession Faked possession was used to condemn 80-year-old Ann Boden
ham in 1653. A servant girl caught with stolen silverware accused
^
m^^^^ Ann Bodenham of sending a demon into her in the form of a black man
without a head. The girl went into fits in Mrs. Bodenham's presence but was instantly relieved when the "witch" was removed from the room. She described how Mrs. Bodenham had transformed herself
into a black cat to tempt her into the devil's service. 25 Convicted and on
her way to the gallows, the old woman called for beer, and cursed all
who refused her. As was the custom, the hangman asked her forgiveness
before turning her off the ladder. She snapped, "Forgive thee? A pox on thee, turn me off," and died in her rage. 26 At Norfolk in 1 600, a woman named Margaret Francis allegedly bewitched a girl who exhibited the usual symptoms of possession:
Tearing her hair, and beating herself, and her head against bedsteads and
stools, sometimes foaming, sometimes dolefully shrieking and blaring
like a calf; groaning, howling, and barking like a dog; and biting like a mad dog. Her head, feet, and legs were drawn awry and almost backward;
and she stared, & gaped most fearfully and gnashed her teeth and lay as 1 dead and senseless many times a day and more sometimes together, without breath or panting, saving that her natural color remained still fresh; and yet, sometimes suddenly she did spit in the faces of them that stood by or at her friends or at the name ofJesus; and sometimes she did ,
smite at her parents also . . . sometimes storming at God and good
men, and sometimes blaspheming God, saying God is a good man I can I do as much as he; I care not for Jesus, etc. Some things were uttered, unknown before to the maid; and many times in a strange snappish voice; and sometimes in the tune and voice ofthe witch and in her phrases
and terms. 27
Exorcism rarely relieved such symptoms, but more often exac
erbated them, since the exorcistic ritual only increased the effect desired
by making the afflicted one all the more a center of attention. More
practical cures brought about the miracle that exorcism failed to pro
duce. In 1835 an epidemic of possession was well under way at a
French convent in Morzine. Professor Tissot investigated, and found
the nuns went into fits at the touch of holy water if they knew what it
was, but secretly they could be dosed with quarts of it in wine or food, without effect. The demons were cast out by the police, who
appeared with orders to treat the possessed as lunatics and remove them
to an asylum. Immediately, all symptoms vanished. 28
The Dutch physician Boerhaave found an epidemic of possession in a Haarlem hospital ward, with patients going into convulsions and
imitating each other in acts of frenzy. He ordered a brazier of coals and
a cauterizing iron placed in the ward, and promised to brand the next victim of possession. There were no more cases. A similar report from
Japan told of the miraculous cure of a possessed girl, whose father
tied her to a pillar and rushed at her with a drawn sword, crying,
812



picked spirit, if you do not forthwith leave this child I will kill you Possession loth!" The child was instantly cured. 29
Some authorities recommended flagellation as a cure for posses- ^^^^^^^^^^^
j.on. Bergomensi said a "prudent and moderate" whipping could |/ork wonders. 30 Of course it never worked in cases of illness caused by
jemonic possession. Demons were convenient scapegoats for ignojant doctors, and many diseases were attributed to possession. Some uthorities even insisted that every illness is caused by demons. 31
imong the long lists of "signs" of demonic possession were the
flowing: inability to retain food; sensation of weight in the stomach;
ain in the lower belly, kidneys, or head; lassitude; impotence; weakeniig or emaciation of the body; fiery pains in the entrails; sudden
felling of the stomach; yellowish or pale complexion; melancholia.
!)emonic possession was the proper diagnosis "if skilled physicians re not sure what the affliction is, and cannot form an opinion about it;
r if the medications prescribed do not help but rather increase the
ickness." 32 Since the medications of the period usually did make the
ick sicker, possession must have been a frequent diagnosis.
Aside from its usefulness to physicians, the theory of possession
/as useful to the possessed themselves. It provided an outlet for
(idden rage. This psychological function is still seen in groups who prmally court possession. In the zar, or demon, cult of modern Ethiopia, Moslem wives maintain a religion of demonism conducted by
patrilineal priestesses. It's the only religion the women have, where ven Coptic churches refuse to admit them, and the only feminist
istitution in the country. An observer reported that the zar cult is
normously popular, and most women participate despite opposition rom their husbands, "who fear the sexual and economic emancipa
ion of the wife." 33
Possession is induced by drumming, chanting, and rhythmic jfiovement. A woman is "ridden" by her demon or zar, a name
erhaps traceable all the way back to Osiris Zer. 34 The possessed
/oman shrieks, babbles, blasphemes, vents her sexual frustrations and eaps bitter abuse on her husband. She demands new clothes, gifts and
rnaments, which must be given her, as part of the cure. "The
pidemiology of possession starts a chain of events that enables them
the women] to escape from their social confinement" for a while,
t least. 35
The same forces used to operate in Christian society. Oppressed /omen used their "demons" to tell the Heavenly Father what they
lought of him, without incurring the punishment of heretics. Demonic
ossession was the confessional of the dispossessed.
Or again, the same theory of possession was used to excuse sadistic
ehavior. As late as 1895 one Michael Geary of Clonmel, Ireland, ortured and burned his young wife Bridget on the pretext that she was
assessed by a devil. 36 With the help of several other men, he poured
813



paraffin over her and set her afire. The men dragged her to the hearth and made her sit on the fire, while her husband recited exorcisms. 37 In 1966, a Swiss girl named Bernadette Hasler was beaten to death
by two religious fanatics who claimed they were driving out her demon. Churchmen's reaction to this case was interesting. Johannes Vonderach, bishop of Chur, seemed more concerned about the
murderers' usurpation of clerical prerogatives than about the fact that murder had been done. He announced, "Just as the Church sepa
rates itself from superstitious belief in miracles, it rejects a false belief in
the Devil. However, as it regards the Devil seriously, on the basis of
Holy Writ, it places itself doubly under the protection of the crucified Lord." 38
This is a notable example of theological doubletalk, making one wonder what can be the difference between "superstitious" belief in
miracles and nonsuperstitious belief in miracles; or between "false"
belief in the Devil and real belief in the Devil. What for that matter can
be the difference between a fanatic who believes in the Devil because
he reads the Bible, and a church that "regards the Devil seriously, on
the basis of Holy Writ"? In his haste to separate his church from the
two criminals, Vonderach betrayed his own ignorance of Holy Writ.
John said to Jesus, "Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us." Jesus
answered, "Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us"
(Luke 9:49-50). In August 1976 the following item appeared in the American
press:
The voice on the tapes was that ofa woman, but it was unnaturally deep and the words were incoherent screams mixed with furious profanities.
The tapes recorded the dying days ofa timid, 23-year-old epileptic named Annaliese Michel, and they were part ofthe evidence in a manslaughter case West German authorities were preparing last week against the
Roman Catholic Bishop ofWurzburg, JosefStangl, and two priests he appointed to exorcise the Devil from the young woman. When Michel died last month ofmalnutrition and dehydration, she weighed only 70
pounds. One ofthe priests, Father Arnold Renz, maintained that six
devils including Nero, Judas, Hitler and Lucifer himself possessed Michel and made her refuse to eat. }9
That such human tragedies can still occur in a purportedly
enlightened age is grim proof of the blindness that can be engendered
by "blind faith." Perhaps the definitive remark on the subject of
possession was made in 1970 by Dr. Henry Ansgard Kelley of the
University of California: "Diabolical possession is caused by belief in
diabolical possession."'10

Potter
I The Sumero-Babylonian Goddess Aruru the Great was the original | Potter who created human beings out of clay. She made man in the li image of a god, and infused him with the breath of heaven, which
1 brought him to life. 1 Aruru was also Ishtar, Inanna, Ninhursag, and Mami, Mama, or Mammitu; she made the first man (Adam) out of
clay (adamah, the female earth). Assyrians said she made seven clay
j
mother-wombs for females and seven clay mother-wombs for males:
"The creatress of destiny, in pairs she completed them; the forms of the people Mami forms." 2 The biblical story of God's creation of Adam out of clay was
plagiarized from ancient texts with the patriarchs' usual sex-change of the deity. Mesopotamian flesh-is-clay images were derived from the
primitive matriarchate, when all pottery belonged to women. "The
art of pottery is a feminine invention; the original potter was a woman. Among all primitive peoples the ceramic art is found in the hands of
women, and only under the influence of advanced culture does it
become a man's occupation." ?
The Goddess was worshipped as a Potter in the Jewish temple,
where she received "thirty pieces of silver" as the price of a sacrificial
victim (Zechariah 11:13). She owned the Field of Blood, Aceldama, where clay was moistened with the blood of victims so bought. Judas,
who allegedly sold Jesus for this same price, was himself another victim
of the Potter. In the Potter's Field he was either hanged (Matthew
27:5) or disemboweled (Acts 1:18), suggesting that the Potter was none other than the Goddess who both created and destroyed.
India's Kali Ma was the same creating-and-destroying Goddess, with a special incarnation as Kel Mari the Pot Goddess.4 Since she
made the first man out of clay, her people were Aryans, from arya,
"man of clay." 5 Kel Mari was related to Mari of Mesopotamia, or Mariamne, or Miriam, or Mary, whose name was connected with the deaths of both John the Baptist and Jesus. Her earth, which drank the blood of sacrificed men, might have been the same Aceldama that drank the blood of Judas.
Kali's other name Maya was the same as the central American
civilization whose women produced remarkable pottery. The oldest form of Maya pottery was known as Mamom, "the Grandmother." Von Hagen says, "Pottery was woman. All we see of the remains of the Maya ceramic art was done by women. It is a fact that should be
stressed. In almost every place where pottery making was on an
815



Prakriti archaic level Africa or Melanesia pottery was woman-made and its
Priapus design was woman-inspired. Throughout the area of the Amazon,
^^^^^^^_^^ pottery was a woman's task. Women were the potters, so far as we
know, in ancient Peru. Early Greek and early Egyptian pottery was also woman-made until the introduction of the potter's wheel. ... All
the superbly beautiful patterns found on pottery (as well as weaving) were conceived by women." 6 The biblical God couldn't give birth, so he copied the next best
creation technique and molded his first man out of clay, as the Goddess did before him.

Prakriti
"Nature," the Sanskrit title of Kali as the female Holy Trinity
commanding the Gunas, the white, red, and black threads of Creation, Preservation, and Destruction. 1 Prakriti embodied past, present, and
future; earth, sea, and sky; youth, maturity, and age; and other manifestations of the Triple Goddess.
I.emfcerty,3f0.
Priam
"One Who Is Redeemed," king of Homer's Troy, married to the
Moon-goddess in the person of Hecuba (Hecate). Some said Troy's sacred fetish, the Palladium, was Priam's scepter in the form of a
phallus. 1 Others said it was a female symbol; most likely it was a dual
lingam-yoni representing the sacred marriage. l.Dumezil,323.
Priapus
God of the phallus, a figure with enormous genitals, born of Aphro
dite by either Adonis or Dionysus, the latter perhaps an allegorical
statement that wine begets lust. Priapus was a primitive form of Eros,
based on the wooden ithyphallic idols worshipped in early Greece, later
translated into stone herms or temple phalli for deflowering brides. 1
See Firstborn. Some of Priapus's grotesque images lasted through the
Middle Ages, and were even worshipped as saints (see Phallus Worship).

Prisca, Saint Prisca, Saint
Mythical "virgin martyr" invented from an icon of the Mother
Goddess with her palm branch in her hand and a lion at her feet. The i^^^^^mmim^^^
Christian tale claimed that during the reign of Claudius, Prisca was condemned to be thrown to the lions for the crime of wanting to
preserve her virginity. Her innocence exuded such powerful magic that the beasts refused to eat her, and lay down at her feet like house
cats. Later she was beheaded. 1 Apparently human beings were better
able than lions to resist her charm.
Unfortunately for the legend's credibility, Christians weren't slain in the reign of Claudius. On the contrary, Claudius earnestly wished
to preserve freedom of religion in his empire, and begged warring Christian sects to "stop this destructive and obstinate mutual en
mity." 2 Claudius was, however, a devotee of Mother Cybele, who was
pictured on his coins with a lion at her feet, like the original icon of
Saint Prisca. 3
The only human Prisca who might be legitimately connected with early Christianity was a woman believed to have been the real author
of the Epistle to the Hebrews, sometimes called Priscilla, "Little Prisca." 4 There is no evidence that she was ever martyred.

Prometheus
Greek "Forethought," probably not the god's original name but the nearest vocal equivalent to Sanskrit pramantha, the swastika or fire-drill
sacred to Agni, the fire god who brought fertility to Kali's water
element. Prometheus brought fire or "light" to mankind as Lucifer did,
against the will of the Olympian heavenly father. Yet Zeus himself
appeared as Zeus Prometheus at Thurii, holding a fire-drill. 1 One of the Hindu notions of creation was that all things arose from
the action of male firesticks (Agni) twirling in the female groove
(Ambika-Kali). 2 The Sea Dyaks have the same image of sexual creation.
They say only one woman survived the Deluge. She made a fire-drill and used it as a phallus. By its motion in her body, she conceived the
human race. 3 Such myths obviously date back to the time before
semen was credited with the power of conception. One of the early
theories of fatherhood was that only sexual "motion" stimulated formation of life in the womb. The Greeks didn't know where Prometheus came from. Diodorus
said he was Egyptian. An Orphic hymn identified him with Saturn.
Lycophron called him "the Ethiopian god Prometheus."4 He was the
consort of Libyan Athene, who gave life to the human beings he molded out of clay (see Potter). From Athene he learned the secrets of
817



Prometheus the civilized arts, and passed them on to his proteges, along with the stolen "fire from heaven" identified with lightning, or enlightenment, or ^^^^^^^^^_ godly knowledge that Zeus wished to keep secret from humans. 5
Like Lucifer, Prometheus disobeyed the heaven-father by being more benevolent toward humanity than he was. Aeschylus's Prometheus Bound plainly showed more sympathy toward the disobedient one than toward the God he offended. Zeus punished Prometheus by having him chained to a Caucasian mountaintop where his liver was
daily devoured by his own totemic eagle and nightly restored to be devoured again. The sea nymphs wailed for Prometheus. The Daughters of Ocean cursed Zeus as an insolent despot. The other
lightning-god Hephaestus muttered seditiously, "The mind of Zeus knows no turning, and ever harsh the hand that newly grasps the
sway." Prometheus himself mused, "I rescued mankind from the heavy
blow that was to cast them into Hades. . . . Mankind I helped, but I
could not help myself." He prophesied Zeus's downfall at the hands of
ancient female powers of justice (or karma): "The Fates triform and
the unforgetting Furies." He told Io the Moon-cow, also oppressed by Zeus, that her offspring would be the instrument of Zeus's doom.
The Prometheus myth presaged the Gnostics' sympathy for Luci
fer, who was the same sort of hero a philanthropic anti-god unfairly
punished for giving "light" or "enlightenment" to humanity. Gnostic icons copied early pictures of Prometheus molding the first man out of clay while Athene stood waiting to infuse the figure with the spirit of
life. Behind her rose a tree encircled by a serpent, totemic symbol of her wisdom. 6 The story of Eden was based on just such icons.
According to another myth, Prometheus tricked Zeus into accept
ing the less edible parts of sacrificial animals, such as the fat and
bones, on behalf of the gods, while human beings were allowed to consume the meat. This was not what Zeus intended, and he swore revenge on both Prometheus and his human friends. 7 Still, he had made his choice and had to stick to it. The biblical Yahweh made the same
choice, and so received only the fat and guts of sacrificial animals
(Leviticus 4) while the priests ate the rest. The Greek sense of humor envisioned Zeus accepting such offal only because he was forced to,
having sworn by the Styx to keep to his choice; but the Jews simply claimed that Yahweh preferred it. Prometheus was made one of the Titans, the group of gigantic
earth-spirits who predated Zeus and his Olympian host, and were generally hostile to them. The battle between Zeus's Olympians and the
Titans, in which the latter were deprived of the status of gods and
chained under the earth, was one of the prototypes of the JudeoChristian "war in heaven."

phecy
tie ancients' chief standard of judgment for any holy man or woman
is his or her power to prophesy coming events. Conversely, anyone's iritual authority was dependent on fulfillment of prophecies that
already been made. This was so important in establishing Christian\f that the New Testament again and again relates events that were
jne only to fulfill some prophetic text from the Old Testament. By
temporary notions, the coming of Jesus or any other spiritual er was of no account unless it had been prophesied by a different
itual leader.
Prophets were sometimes carried away by the ecstatic spirit and
phesied too literally, so the prophecy could be too easily checked, us the prophetic God seemed to tell lies. Provision was made for this
culty in the Bible not to excuse the over-zealous prophet, but to
:cuse God: "When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the ling follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord
ath not spoken" (Deuteronomy 18:22). Of course this made it
npossible to tell, at the time, whether any given prophecy was enuine or not; and this rather defeated the whole purpose of prophecy.
Prophecy Prostitution
'rorsa and Postverta
Two faces of the Etruscan year-goddess Anna Perenna, who looked orward and backward in Time, therefore ruled both prophecy of the

Proserpina
Roman version of Persephone, queen of the underworld. Along with
Hecate and Diana, Proserpina was frequently designated "queen of witches" in medieval tradition. Christian Gnostics spoke of her as the
death-goddess whom every soul would meet soon after death. Christian
demonologists listed Proserpina among the dignitaries of hell, as the "arch she-devil." 1 She had a poetic appeal however for such as Swin
burne, who said she "gathers all things mortal with cold immortal
hands"; and in her mystic garden there was "only the sleep eternal in an eternal night." 2

cognate of the Persian houri and the Greek Hora, also the origin of "harem," which used to mean a Temple of Women,
or a sanctuary. 5 A similar meaning was once attached to seraglio, from Semitic serai, a shrine of
queens.
were often known as Charites or Graces, since they dealt in the
unique combination of beauty and kindness called chads (Latin caritas)
that was later translated "charity." Actually it was like Hindu karuna,
a combination of mother-love, tenderness, comfort, mystical enlightenment, and sex. Hesiod said the sensual magic of the sacred whores or Horae "mellowed the behavior of men." 1 Ishtar, the Great Whore of
Babylon, announced, "A prostitute compassionate am I." 2 Mary Magdalene said of her sisters in the profession, "Not only are we
compassionate of ourselves, but we are compassionate of all the race of mankind." 3 Ancient harlots often commanded high social status and were
revered for their learning. 6 As embodiments of the Queen of Heav
en, in Palestine called Qadeshet, the Great Whore, the harlots were
honored like queens at centers of learning in Greece and Asia
Minor.7 Some even became queens. The empress Theodora, wife of
Justinian, began her career as a temple harlot. 8 St. Helena, mother of Constantine, was a harlot before she became an empress-saint.9
In an Egyptian story, a priestess of Bubastis demanded all of a
man's worldly goods for one night of her love. She said, "I am a
hierodule; I am no mean person." 10 Until recently Egypt still had a class of women called ghazye, "sacred whores," who were greatly honored in the time of the Mamelukes and prized as brides when their period of service was ended. 11
Temple prostitutes were revered as healers of the sick. Their very
secretions were supposed to have medical virtue. A Sufi proverb still
suggests this opinion: "There is healing in a woman's vagina." 12 Even } their spittle could perform cures. Jesus's cure of blindness by spittle
(Mark 8:23) was copied from a matriarchal tradition. A clay tablet from
Nineveh says eye diseases can be cured by a harlot's spittle. 15 Harlots were also sorceresses, prophets, and seers. The Hebrew word zonah
means both a prostitute and a prophetess. 14
Holy Mothers designated the promiscuous priestess-shamanesses of Japan, also known as spirit-women. Becoming Brides of God, they entered the shrine to lie with a priest possessed by the god's spirit.
15
Similar customs distinguished the Indian devadasis, human copies of the lascivious Heavenly Nymphs. The profession was popular. Temples of Aphrodite at Eryx, Corinth, Cyprus, and other sites were served by a thousand sacred
harlots apiece. 16 When Hellenic Greeks reduced wives to the status of servants, the hetaerae or courtesans remained legally and politically
equal to men. Roman matrons of the highest aristocracy prostituted themselves in the temple of Juno Sospita when a revelation was
needed. 17 Every Babylonian woman prostituted herself in the temple before marriage. 18 By Amorite sacred law, "she who was about to marry should sit in fornication seven days by the gate (of the temple)." 19
Such laws were supposed to appease the Goddess, who disapproved
820



of monogamy in the era when there was no formal marriage and Prostitution
children didn't know their fathers. 20 In Greek myth, the Great Mother forbade the Heavenly Father Zeus to make a monogamous ^^^^^^^^^^^m
marriage, holding that only her own ancient system of group marriage was honorable. 21
The Tantric word for a sacred harlot was Veshya, probable origin of the Goddess's oldest names in Greece and Rome, Hestia or Vesta,
the Hearth-mother, served by the Vestal Virgins who were originally harlot-priestesses. 22 "Hearth" and "Earth" both arose from the altar
of the Saxon Goddess Ertha, or Heartha, the northern Hestia-Vesta. In
the matriarchal age, every woman's hearth-fire was her altar. 23 The
hearth was also the omphalos, feminine hub of the universe, navel-stone
of the temple, around which the sacred harlots performed their Dances of Time.
Dancing harlots came to be called Hours: Persian houri, Greek
horae. Egyptian temple-women also were Ladies of the Hour. Each
ruled a certain hour of the night, and protected the solar boat of Ra in
the underworld during his passage through her hour. 24 The Dance of
the Hours began as a pagan ceremony of the Horae (divine "Whores") who kept the hours of the night by dances, as Christian monks later
kept the hours of the day by prayers. The oldest authentic Hebrew folk
dance is still called hora after the circle dances of the sacred harlots.
The Horae also guarded the gates of heaven, ministered to the souls of
the blessed, and turned the heavenly spheres. 25 (See Houri.) The Hebrew word hor means a hole, cave, or pit, common
synonyms for both a sacred prostitute and the Goddess she served,
whose yoni was represented by a hole, cave, pit, or pool of water in the heart of the temple. 26 A similar Latin term was puteus, a well or pit,
source of the Spanish puta, "whore." Common folk the Romans buried
in puticuli, "pits," which like all graves used to stand for the womb of
rebirth. 27 The common root was Vedic puta, "pure" or "holy," and the
Avestan putika, a mystical lake of the waters of birth. 28 "Lady of the
Lake" was a title of the Great Goddess throughout Eurasia. In Aramaic,
her shrines were Athra qaddisa, "the holy place," literally a "heavenly
harlot-place," or genital pit or lake. 29 "To dive into water means to delve into the mystery of Maya, to
quest after the ultimate secret of life. . . . [T]he cosmic waters are at
once the immaculate source of all things and dreadful grave." 30 All
Asia called water a female element, the source of creation, the archeoi
Stoic philosophy. To dive into such water was a symbol of sexual
intercourse. Communing in this way with a holy whore, man could
realize the spiritual enlightenment called horasis. This word appears
in the New Testament (Acts 2:17), misleadingly translated "visions." 31 A Semitic clan, the Horites of Genesis 36, traced their descent from the Great Goddess as "Hora." 32 The Jews had cult prostitutes
in the time of King Josiah, when they lived next to the temple and wove
hangings for the sacred grove (2 Kings 23:7). Modern translations of

Prostitution
Nauplia Ancient city near Argos in the Peloponnese, site of Hera's sacred spring Canathos.
Pausanias Greek traveler and geographer of the 2nd century a.d. Living in a time of
declining culture, he was inspired by a desire to describe the ancient sacred sites for
posterity.
the Bible call them "sodomites," but the original wording meant holy harlots." Such holy harlots were often "brides of God," set apart to
give birth to Sons of God, i.e., prophets and sometimes sacrificial
victims.' 4 Holy whores were called "virgins" because they remained unmar
ried (see Virgin Birth). Like medieval nuns, they took veils as a
badge of their office. Ishtar-Asherah-Mari-Anath was not only the Great
Whore but also the Great Virgin (kadesha, holy one). Her Greek name was Athene, also described as a "virgin" (Parthenia); but Athene's
temple, the Parthenon, was served by promiscuous hierodules like all other shrines of the Goddess. Later myths rationalized the perpetual
"virginity" of lascivious fertility-goddesses by periodic hymen-renewing ceremonies such as sea baptism, annual bathing in sacred springs, etc.
The virginity of Great Mother Hera was annually restored by a dip in
the spring of Canathos at Nauplia. Pausanias said the myth was based
on a rite of bathing the Goddess's image. 35
Because whores occupied a significant position in paganism, Christians vilified their profession. Churchmen didn't want to stamp out
prostitution altogether, only amputate its spiritual meanings. St. John Chrysostom earned high praise from the Patriarch of Constantinople for robbing temple prostitutes of "the honors paid to them." 36 The triad
of heavenly Horae were mythically virginized as three maiden saints
martyred together, Agape, Chionia, and Irene (Love-feast, She of
Chios, and Peace). 37 Real horae were relegated to hora-houses, no longer temples. The traditional red light of the whorehouse descended from the houses of Roman venerii who displayed the sign of an erect
phallus, painted blood red. 38 Medieval Germanic law forbade a man to build a horgr, or to call
his house a horgr, on pain of forfeiting every penny he owned; because horgr meant a pagan shrine, a house of "holy whores" where
priestesses carried on the old religion. Such place names as Horgsholt
in Iceland still identify ancient shrines. 39
In the year 1000 a.d. the Icelanders agreed to become Christian in
name at least, and to be baptized; but all who wished were still legally
permitted to celebrate the rites of their ancestors in private houses called
horgr, for a while, until the church rescinded its promises of toler
ance. 40 In earlier centuries, the horgr seems to have been a mons veneris or omphalos in a sacred grove. 41
Sometimes the alternate word hus (house) carried the same sense
of "a place of worship," because every matriarch once worshipped the Goddess of her own hearth, which she could share with more than one hus-band. Hence the word hussy, Lady of the House, by Christian definition a promiscuous woman. 42
Promiscuity was appreciated, rather than deplored, by medieval
minnesingers who worshipped the Goddess under her new name of Minne, "Love." They objected to commercialized prostitution as a
degradation of their deity: "Love, the queen of all hearts, the free
822



born, the one and only, is put up for public sale! What a shameful Prostitution
tribute is this that our mastery has required of her! We cultivate Love
with embittered minds, with lies, and with deceit, and then expect from ^mammm^^^mmi^^
her joy of body and heart; but instead, she bears only pain, corrup
tion, evil fruit, and blight as her soil was sown." 4*
Theologians however accepted commercial prostitution as "a law
ful immorality," in St. Thomas Aquinas's self-contradictory phrase.
Aquinas said prostitution was necessary to prevent men from sodomizing each other: "Take away prostitutes from the world," he said, "and you will fill it with sodomy."44 Prostitution enabled man to look upon
promiscuous women as depraved, though their equally promiscuous clients were seen as helpless victims of compulsion. There was no
recognition of the truth, that most prostitutes acted under a more
telling compulsion than any man's sexuality: the need to earn wherewithal to keep alive. It was not an easy living. At best the prostitute
was forced to make herself a stranger's abject servant. At worst, she could become his tormented victim.45
Certain anticlerical writers maintained that prostitutes should be
respected for their willingness to be kind. Lorenzo Valla's 1 5th
century De Voluptate called for a return to ancient customs, echoing Horace's Omnia voluptas bona est Valla wrote: "Whores and
prostitutes deserve more from the human race than do nuns with their
chastity and virginity!" 46 Of course, such sentiments did not prevail. Two centuries later, English apprentices celebrated each Shrove Tues
day by breaking into whorehouses and beating the inmates. It also
became customary in England for men to "punish" the whores they
patronized by hamstringing: cutting the sinews of the legs to make the woman a permanent cripple.47 One might be reminded of the Chinese custom of crippling courtesans by footbinding. God punished the whores in hell even more severely than men
punished them on earth, according to God's spokesmen, whose asceticism engendered sexual fantasies of astonishing violence. 48 Monk
ish deprivations and repressions led to secret envy and fierce hatred of
the carnal folk who might be suspected of enjoying sexual activity. 49 The hatred poured out in a thousand nasty fantasies of hell. Abbe
Francois Arnoux, canon of Riez in 1622, provides an example:
And the light women, these shall have in their arms a dragon most cruel, flaming with Are . . . who shall bind and enchain their feet and their
legs with his serpent tail and shall clasp their whole body with his cruel
talons, who shall put his beslabbered and reeking mouth upon theirs, breathing therein flames ofAre and sulphur and poison and venom, who with his nose, glandered and hideous, shall breathe into theirs a breath
most stinking and venomous . . . this dragon shall make them suffer a
thousand agonies, a thousand colics and bitter twistings ofthe belly, and all the damned shall howl, and the devils with them, "See the wanton! see the strumpet! Let her be tortured indeed! To it, to it, ye devils! To it, ye demons! To it, ye hellish furies! See the harlot! See the trull! Hurl ye
upon this whore and wreak upon her all the torments ye can! " so
823



Prostitution
Kastoria The ancient
Celetrum, a town and nome in Greek Macedonia.
On the wall of the women's section of the Church of St. John
the Baptist in Kastoria, a painting showed God's punishment of a whore. Bound in hell, the woman had her legs stretched apart by two
demons, while a third demon plunged red-hot irons into her vagina.
Next to the woman punished for being sexually available, another
woman labeled the Vain Coquette was similarly punished for nor being
sexually available. 51 Women attending this church might well be excused for thinking they were damned if they did and damned if they
didn't.
Churchmen did not distinguish between a professional prostitute and a woman in love with a lover. Both were "whores." The whole
point of patriarchal morality was that women must not have the right to pick and choose men. For a woman to fall passionately in love was a tragedy under the medieval church: to pay for a few stolen hours of
love, both she and her lover were doomed to an eternity of suffering. 52 The point was illustrated by Grunewald's painting The Damnation
ofLovers, showing a sinful pair as emaciated corpses living in hell, with worms burrowing through their flesh, the woman crowned with a
coiled serpent, her genitals gnawed by a toad. According to a 1 5th
century illustration for St. Augustine's De Civitate Dei, lovers would be bound together on spits in hell and roasted over coals fanned by
devils. 53
With western religion envisioning such grisly punishments for sexual enjoyment, it is hardly surprising to find western civilization as
a whole seized by a sick compulsion to destroy all forms of pleasure. 54 Even in the Christian heaven however, whores had their special
protectors, modeled on pagan Roman harlot-goddesses like Venus and Meretrix. Official Catholic patrons of whores were St. Aphra, St.
Aphrodite, and St. Maudline (Magdalen), simple canonizations of former titles of the Goddess. 55 Chief protectress of whores was the
virgin Mary. In Antwerp up to the present century, prostitutes spent certain annual feast days marching in procession to the churches, to dedicate candles to the Holy Virgin whom they called their own
special deity. 56 An oft-told tale of the Middle Ages said when a nun decided to
run away from her convent, to live as a prostitute for a few days, Mary assumed the errant nun's appearance and took her place in the convent, so she wouldn't be missed and pursued. 57 A German variant
of the story said the nun, Beatrix, left the convent to live with her heathen lover for 1 5 years. When she returned, she found that Mary
had served as her stand-in all the while. 58
Medieval brothels were not always clearly distinguished from
convents. A trace of the pagan collegia of priestesses still clung to
both institutions. Early "double convents," with men and women
united in one community, sometimes housed consecrated prostitutes. Several popes maintained "holy brothels" in Rome; Queen Joanna of

Naples founded a religious house of prostitutes called The Abbey in Prostitution
the papal city of Avignon. In Victorian times, it was still a common custom to call the madam of a whorehouse "the abbess," though the ^^^^^^^^^^^^
historical precedent was forgotten. 59 See Mary Magdalene.
Outside the Judeo-Christian tradition, prostitution often became a
fully legitimate lifestyle. Black Africans never fully accepted missionaries' views on the matter. White men's laws deprived African women
of their property and their monopoly of farming, trading, and crafts y which they supported their children. African women suffered a
stating loss of self-respect, for in their society a woman without er own income was regarded with contempt. On finding that white men would pay for their sexual favors, many African women took up
prostitution as their last remaining chance to make an honest living.
Africans still regard a successful prostitute as a usefully employed businesswoman rather than a criminal.60
By contrast, Christian society seldom offered women any formal
pportunity to take up prostitution as a career, but half-deliberately looked the other way as many hundreds of young girls "fell" into it.
Eighteenth-century London swarmed with female children strug
gling to keep themselves alive by prostitution, according to a contemporary pamphlet denouncing "little Creatures piled in Heaps
upon one another, sleeping in the public streets, in the most rigorous seasons, and some of them whose Heads will hardly reach above the Waistband of a Man's Breeches, found to be quick with Child, and
become burdensome to the Parish." Far from extending sympathy to
these little girls, the pamphleteer called them wicked whores, "a most enormous Sin to lay Snares for the Unwary, and to be the Means of ruining both Souls and Bodies of so many innocent young Gentlemen." 61
According to the terminology of the time, a "wench" was a child
of either sex. Dryden's description of a gentleman as one who "eats,
drinks, and wenches abundantly" apparently meant a man who picked up homeless male or female children in the streets to service his
sexual idiosyncrasies. Later, "wench" came to mean only a lower-class
female, a servant or peasant available for a gentleman's sexual use. 62
By the 19th century, thousands of girls under the age of 14 were
listed on English police registers as "common prostitutes." London in 1860 had at least 500 registered prostitutes under the age of 1 3, and 1 500 more under the age of 16. Victorian gentlemen had a taste for
raping child virgins, who commanded the highest prices in whorehouses. Experienced child whores were taught to imitate the cries
and struggles of a newly deflowered victim, and to insert leeches or
broken glass into their vaginas to produce a convincing flow of blood. 63
Josephine Butler's investigations of the English system of prostitution led to legislation to raise the "age of consent" to 14; still, large
825



Providence numbers of younger girls were captured and immured in brothels. "The ! Psyche law was lax on the matter of abduction, and the punishment for
._____^__^_ trafficking in girls was derisory." Male authorities took an interest in
prostitution only after they clearly understood its connection with
rampant venereal disease. Legal regulation of brothels was instituted
then; but this didn't mean closing them. It meant subjecting them to
medical inspections, so they would be safe for male patrons.64 Whores were not considered full-fledged human beings. The 18th-century term for a whore was "a fleshy convenience." 65 The
word "convenience" also meant an outhouse. One might say that from
the revered sacred harlot of antiquity to this was a long road
backward.

Providence
Latin provideo meant "to foresee"; Providentia meant divinatory
magic. 1 It was a personification of female prophetic or mantic talents, the quality that enabled ancient matriarchs to "provide" for their
dependents through foreknowledge of the stars and seasons, agriculture and food storage. In Christian usage, Providence was sometimes a
synonym for God; but many mystics defined Providence as a female
deity. 2

Psyche
Greek "female soul," corresponding to Hindu Shakti. Classical myth
wedded Psyche to the love-god Eros: a union of soul with body.
Apuleius's version said Psyche and her bridegroom could come
together only in the dark. When Psyche insisted on seeing Eros by the
light of her lamp, he had to leave her forever. 1 As an allegory, this
said the passion of the soul might banish sexual passion. The original

story probably arose from a custom like that of ancient Sparta, where Psychopomp young husbands visited their wives only by night. "Sometimes children Pudens, Pudenziana were born before the pair had ever seen each other's faces by day."2 ^^^^^^^^^^^^
Psyche was incarnate in a butterfly, for the early Greeks believed
human souls could occupy flying insects while passing from one life to the next. The belief was not forgotten. At Carcassonne in 1 329 an amorous Carmelite monk was accused of witchcraft for hiding love
charms in women's houses. It was charged that he also called up Satan
and sacrificed a butterfly to him, in symbolic offering of the soul. 3

Psychopomp
"Conductor of Souls," title of Hermes and other "Good Shepherd"
gods who led human souls through the after-world. Angels, Valkyries,
certain birds and animals could also act as psychopomps. See Her
mes; Dog; Vulture.
Pucelle
"The Maid," French title of any woman who impersonated the Virgin Goddess of the druidic fairy-religion; a feminine form of Puck
(see Pooka; Bogey). It was the title of Joan of Arc, an indication that
her faith was basically non-Christian. British heathens called Maid Marian the pucelle or Maiden of the Coven. Her consort was Robin
Hood or Robin Goodfellow, known as the god of witches (see Robin). 1
1. Graves, W.G., 441.
'udens and Pudenziana, Saints
Naive Christian canonization of the symbolic genitalia of Rome's
God and Goddess (pudenda). According to the Christian legend,
Pudenziana was the usual virgin convert, a daughter of Pudens, a wealthy patrician. Peter and Paul lodged in the house of Pudenziana on their (mythical) visit to Rome. With the help of a holy man named Pastorus (Shepherd), St. Pudenziana soaked up the blood of Christian
martyrs in sponges, which she hid in a well. 1 This tale was often cited
to account for the numerous bottles of martyrs' blood used as healing relics in countless churches.
The well with its holy blood probably meant the yonic "pit"

Souls, sometimes called Shepherd of the Stars.

Purgatory Purgatory
One of several Christian doctrines derived more or less directly from ^i^""^"^""" Buddhism. Five centuries before the Christian era, Buddhist priests claimed to be able to deliver one's ancestors from pains of atonement in the underworld and to cause them to be born again in heaven, by
reciting magic words and performing sacrifices on their behalf for a
fee paid by the pious descendant. 1 "Above all," Buddhist scriptures said,
"it is necessary to obtain the aid of priests who deliver these bound
souls by the ritual." 2
The Christian doctrine of purgatory implied that priests had the power to send to heaven individuals who might otherwise have been
damned. Some stories hinted that the privilege could be carried too far.
Pope Gregory the Great succeeded in praying the emperor Trajan out of purgatory and into heaven, but God punished Gregory with gout, fever, and stomach pains for his sin of praying for a heathen. 3 The Catholic notion of purgatory was renounced by Protestants,
who were scornful of anything resembling the sale of salvation.
Reginald Scot remarked that in England the ghosts no longer pestered the living to be prayed out of purgatory: "Where are the spirits? Who heareth their noises? Who seeth their visions? Where are the souls that
made such moan ... to be eased of their pains in purgatory?" He
concluded that they had all gone to Italy, because masses had become
too expensive in England. 4 The word purgatory was often applied to the pagan womb-shrine or abaton used in initiations in pre-Christian times (see Abaddon). A
candidate would "descend into an underground chamber, simulate
death, undergo great trials, and experience a rebirth into a new life. The early Christian Church continued this custom, calling such pagan
shrines 'purgatories.' The most celebrated purgatory during medieval
times was the one at Lough Derg (Red Lake) in County Donegal, Ireland, to which pilgrimages were made in the twelfth century in
honor of St. Patrick, for whom the purgatory was named." Though Pope Alexander VI declared it a residence of devils and ordered it
closed in 1497, St. Patrick's Purgatory was still in use in 1790. 5
According to a 1 5th-century illustration for the Divine Comedy, purgatory was not a pit or cave but a mountain, constructed in wedding-cake levels very like a ziggurat. At the summit was the Earthly Paradise, where a nude male and female figure were joined together
in a sacred marriage: a peculiar link between the ancient King and
Goddess mating at the pinnacle of the ziggurat, and the conventional bride-and-groom dolls on the wedding cake. 6 The implication of the picture was that, once the sinner had expurgated his sins and moved
up the stages of the mountain, he too could enter the love-paradise at
the top: a strange image for a Christian article of faith.

,Purim Purim
Jewish festival based on the Book of Esther, which presented a Hebraic version of the Elamite cult of sacred kingship under the rule of the Goddess Ishtar, whose name was "Esther" in Hebrew. Yahweh is never mentioned in the Book of Esther, because the Elamite Jews
didn't know him. They worshipped Ishtar's spouse Marduk, who appears in the book as Mordecai.
Purim is the Feast of Lots, because the original Elamite festival
was based, in turn, on the Hittite Purulli, where a sacred-king-victim
was chosen by casting lots, or by a competition. 1 The victim in the
Jewish Purim was Haman, the same as the Libyan sacrificial god
Amon.
Haman lay with the Goddess, Ishtar-Esther, then was slain by Marduk-Mordecai (Esther 7:8). Afterward, his flesh was sacramental
ly eaten, as he is still eaten symbolically at Purim in the form of
hamantaschen, small triangular pastries in the Goddess's sacred delta shape. Egyptian bakers made similar three-cornered cakes to represent the Host or victim in festivals of Amon. 2
The story of Esther is an allegorical tale of the intercession of
Ishtar, whom the Jews worshipped at the time, with the king who was
supposed to be her consort, on behalf of the subject Jewish tribes. Interwoven with this theme is that of the ritual sacrifice. Haman was
given a Last Supper and a night of the Goddess-queen's love. Then he was hanged on the high gallows that was "prepared for Mordecai" that is, he became the god Marduk and assumed the trappings of
divinity (Esther 7:10). The Jews also worshipped Marduk, who had originally "divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament" (Genesis 1 :7) by splitting the Water-mother Tiamat. In the Book of Esther, Jewish scribes made Marduk one of
their own sacred ancestors. Marduk helped the Jews kill 75,000 of their
enemies, apparently by magic, for they "laid not their hands on the
prey" (Esther 9:16).

Purple
From Latin purpureus, "very, very holy," or sacer, or taboo. 1 The ancients' "royal purple" was not purple but a dark wine red, the color of
blood, especially the menstrual blood formerly considered the very
stuff of life. Royal purple meant the same as royal blood: matrilineal
kinship in a sacred clan. Some legends said royal purple descended
from Athene's "goatskin dyed red," the aegis of sovereignty. 2 The purple robe of a Roman emperor was said to have been "colored by
blood." 3 Purple still meant blood color in the time of Shakespeare, who

spoke of the "purpled hands" of Caesar's assassins, stained with "the
most noble blood of all the world."
When Mark's Gospel says Jesus's robe was purple (15:17) and
Matthew's Gospel says it was scarlet (27:28), they are really talking about the conventional sacred-king robe of moon-blood-color. Babylonian kings wore the same dark-red robe, called lamhussu. It was the
same sacred blood color that covered altars in Canaan and Israel
(Numbers 4), and dyed the "red carpet" trod by triumphal religious
processions/ Blood-purple was sacred to the pagans, as suggested by the First Book ofAdam and Eve, which says the art of dyeing crimson and purple was invented by Satan. 5
Actually, the art was invented by the Phoenicians, who obtained deep-blood-red dye from mollusks of the family Muricidae. These sea
snails were the source of the famous "Tyrian purple" worn by royalty. 6
In Roman society, people just below imperial rank were allowed to
wear stripes or borders of the holy color on their togas, in smaller widths
according to a descending scale of status.

Purusha
"Person," the World Body in Oriental imagery, originally the Great Mother as a colossal being, containing the universe. The earth plane lay
at her waist, seven concentric hells below in the pelvis, seven more in
the legs. Fourteen corresponding heavens mounted through the thorax and head: 28 in all, like the 14 levels descended by Osiris on his way to the Pit, and 14 more ascended into heaven one night for each
making a full lunar cycle. Egyptian priests said the World Body was the Goddess Neith. 1 However, ascetic Jain Buddhists rendered the
Purusha sexually neutral. Later, medieval Europe adopted the idea but made the World Body wholly male. 2
The highest heaven, which Greeks called the Empyrean, spread as a shining umbrella over the head of Purusha. On the earth plane,
continents and oceans were arranged in concentric rings, like a horizon
tal target. 3 This image was still found in medieval geographies.

Pygmalion Pygmalion
Greek version of Phoenician priest-kings called Pumiyathon, consorts
of the image of Astarte at Byblos. Pygmalion was a priest-king of ^^^^^"1^^^
Cyprus, receiving his right to rule through a sacred marriage with the Goddess's image, who was called Galatea (White Goddess or Milk
Idess). Aphrodite brought her to life that is, inhabited the
statue during the sacred-marriage ceremony. 1 l.Frazer,G.B.,38.
Pygmies
Homer spoke of OiPygmaioi, the pygmies who lived in a tropical garden of paradise near the Mountains of the Moon at the source of the
Nile. Pygmies still live as they did 3000 years ago, in the jungle near
the Ruwenzori Range (Mountains of the Moon). This area was
rendered virtually inaccessible from the north when climatic changes
created a vast swamp, now known as the Sudd, between Nilotic civilizations and the mountain headwaters. But in an earlier age,
Africa's topography was more congenial to travel and colonization. Pygmies say their ancestors came from the northern land of Kimi,
a Coptic name for Egypt, derived from Khemennu, "Land of the Moon." The pygmies' culture hero Efe was sometimes called Heru, an
old Egyptian name for Horus. He was crucified on a World Tree,
and received a revelation of holy law from a lunar spirit named Mara,
the old pygmy name for a tribal matriarch, then for any divine
personage. 1 Like their relatives the Bushmen, pygmies are caucasoid people:
thin-lipped, light-skinned, often blue-eyed. Anthropological investigations show the pygmies were not true primitives but remnants of a
formerly sophisticated race, the proto-Berber people inhabiting what Hallet called "old white Africa." 2 Pygmies have about the same stature
as Egyptian mummies; the ancient Egyptians were not large people. Egypt had a pygmy god, Bes, patron of music, dancing, and entertainment. He seems to have been an imported court jester to the
gods. "They delighted in his grotesque figure and contortions, just as the Memphite Pharaohs of the Old Kingdom enjoyed the antics of
their pygmies." Bes became almost as popular as Osiris. He protected
women, especially pregnant ones. He preserved families, looked after the dead in the underworld, and attended the infant sun god at his birth.
Later, Bes was diabolized along with all other Egyptian deities. He
was called a "wicked demon' exorcised by Moses. He is said to dwell still
in the southern gate of the temple of Karnak, whence he threatens
solitary travelers. 3
Pygmies retain matriarchal traditions from their original source.
They say the first human beings were made by the moon. The first woman, Mother of God, was Matu (Mother), who still dwells in caverns
831



P V ntia under the Mountains of the Moon. Sometimes she was seen as a cat
Python headed deity like Egypt's Bast. Her name was a cognate of Maat and
^^^^^^^^^ also of the Sumerian Matu, the primal womb, the underworld, and
^"^^^^^^^^^ the devourer of the dead. In Babylon the Death-goddess Matu was also
Lilith, or the yonic lotus lilu. Now the pygmies say their Goddess can take the form of a monster named Lulu, with a vast vulva-mouth that
opens vertically instead of horizontally, and swallows human beings
headfirst. 4 Not only are the pygmy myths and deities derived from those of
the ancient world, but their traditional stories plainly speak of the time
when their ancestors lived in a high state of civilization, in great cities, with wonderful tools to use, and skills that enabled them to work
miracles. 5
The true origin of these people cannot be known precisely, any more than the origin of any other nonliterate group. Yet it seems
clear that they did have a connection with Nilotic culture at a very early
date, possibly even as colonial villages along the upper reaches of the Nile. Even in dynastic Egypt there were half-forgotten stories about the "true source" of the Nile at the Goddess's lunar mountain with its
vast uterine cave. Later the ceremonial source of the Nile was located at
Elephantine, because it became too difficult to travel upriver beyond
this point. In the end, the pygmies were cut off.

Pyrrha
Wife of Deucalion, the Greek version of Noah. She and her spouse
repopulated the earth after the Flood by the instruction of the Goddess
Themis, magically creating human beings out of stones. Pyrrha, whose name means "fiery red," may have been the magic ingredient of the charm, embodying the Blood of Life. Her name was also
commonly applied to wine. 1
1. Graves, CM. 1,141.
Python
Great Serpent born of Mother Hera without the aid of Zeus, which
meant the Mother's firstborn serpent antedated all father-gods, like the
Ophion-serpent of the creatress Eurynome. Also like Lucifer, Python was the lightning-serpent who descended into the Deep to fertilize the Goddess. Mother Hera also bore Hephaestus without the aid of any
male god, and Hephaestus was the same lightning-god who "fell from heaven." '
Python personified the prophetic spirit of the Delphic oracle, whose priestess was always the Pythoness even when the shrine was
832



taken over by Apollo. Python lived in the earth-womb and knew its Python
secrets, which is why he was an oracle. Some myths said Python was a Lord of Death because Apollo had killed him. But, like all other light- ^mhii^^^mh^^
and-dark twins, Apollo and Python were really the same god. Sacred kings of Delphi always killed their predecessors, who were laid to rest in
the stone omphalos where the Pythoness sat to commune with the
oracular spirit.
2
Sometimes Python was the nether aspect of Apollo himself, the
Black Sun corresponding to the celestial sun. This serpent-figure was
the familiar Sata, Thoth, Ouroboros, Okeanos, Hermes, and other
subterranean oracle-gods.

Qadeshet Qadeshet
Quintessence Arabic qadisha, Hebrew kadesha meant a sacred harlot or Holy
wmi^^m^^ Virgin; qadeshet was also the title of Astarte and her temple women. The word meant "priestess." In the Koran it was used as a name for
Mohammed's rich wife Khadija, whose money supported the prophet's
endeavors. 1 Astarte-the-Qadeshet was the Syrian counterpart of Ishtar, Babylon's Great Whore, who declared herself the Mother of Compassion. 2 See Prostitution.

Queen
Old Norse kvaen, Old English cwene meant "owner," specifically applied to female owners of the land in the days of the matriarchate.
Ancient writers described many barbarian societies as nations of
"queens." ' See Matrilineal Inheritance.

Quetzalcoatl
Aztec savior-god with the same characteristics as similar gods of the
ancient Middle East. Quetzalcoatl was born of a virgin, one of three
mystic sisters (the Triple Goddess). He represented the corn. His death and resurrection were linked with planting, growth, harvest. Like
the serpent-and-dove deities of Mesopotamia, he combined avian and
reptilian attributes; he was called the Feathered Serpent.
He gave blood from his penis to re-create the human race after the Flood and so became one of the "castrated Fathers." l He was
sacrificed; he descended into hell; he rose again from the dead. His Second Coming was expected. Like the dead and living Shiva, like Njord and Frey, Horus and
Set, Apollo and Python, etc., Quetzalcoatl was a two-faced deity of creation and destruction, united back to back with his brother Death. 2
North American Indians also worshipped the same alternating rival
gods as the White Manitu and the Dark Manitu, lords of life and death. They were alternately sons or husbands of the Great Goddess whom the tribes named Divine Grandmother. 3 Aztecs called her the Lady of
the Serpent Skirt, receiver of Quetzalcoatl's sacrifice.

Quintessence
Blue blood was once supposed to be the sign of the gods' aristocracy. It was given by the Goddess to deified ancestors of the highest caste.
836



Blue blood was called quanta essentia by the Romans, the "essential Ra
fifth part" or quintessence, embodying a spirit of immortality (godhood). 1 Sometimes the quinta essentia was a sacred wine or ambrosia; ^^^^^^^^^^^^
sometimes it was more plainly designated the menstrual blood of the
Goddess. Worshippers of Aphrodite taught that the "essential fifth" came to a man during the lunar month called honey-moon, planned to span a menstrual period. Aphrodite's nectar was also called honey.
Horace said the kiss that sealed the marriage bond was mixed by
Aphrodite with "a fifth part of her own nectar." 2 Homer said the
blood that flowed in the veins of gods was a blue ethereal fluid, ichor,
prepared by Aphrodite's honeybees. 3 This blue essence evolved from a confused memory of Indo
European ancestral gods made immortal by their blue blood. Hindu
gods are still painted blue in sacred art which may shed light on the
custom of the Picts and other early British tribes to paint themselves
blue with woad for religious ceremonies, and sometimes for warfare, to
insure their resurrection in case of death in battle.4
The blue-blooded god filled with quintessence was well known to
Gnostic thinkers. Porphyry said the Demiurge or creator of the
material world was shaped like a man, with a dark blue complexion,
exactly like Shiva, Vishnu, and other Hindu gods. 5 Aristotle taught that quintessence was a fifth element after earth, water, air, and fire of which the bodies of gods were made. Sometimes this fifth element was said to be the same as ether, the fluid of heaven.6
Medieval alchemists described the quinta essentia as a blue elixir,
able to confer spiritual illumination and resurrection of the body. 7
Later, the mystic Essential Fifth was represented by the fifth trump suit
of the Tarot deck, the Major Arcana (Great Secrets), whose figures conveyed mystical doctrines to the initiated.

Ra
Egypt's royal sun god, said to beget every pharaoh by coupling with the queen mother. 1 He was a late addition to Egypt's pantheon. His origins were greatly confused by his own priests, who called him the
supreme deity, though the Goddess's priests insisted that Ra was only
her dependent child. Many scriptures demonstrate the ideological battle.
During the Ptolemaic period, some of Ra's votaries rejected the
idea that Ra was born of the Mother of the Gods; they called him
"self-begotten and self-born." 2 A hymn addressed him as "divine
divinity, that came into being of himself, primeval god, that existed at
the beginning." But this passage was an interpolation. The same hymn
also said, "Thou art fair, O Ra, every day thy mother Nut embraceth thee." 3
837



Ra One source called Ra "the divine man-child, the heir of eternity, self-begotten and self-born"; but the same source also said he was
^^^^^^^^^_ "the Disc within thy mother Hathor . . . made strong each day by thy
mother Nut." Sometimes, Ra's divinity depended on identifying him with the Mother herself. He was told, "Thou art indeed Isis," or "Thou art the Great Cat," i.e., the Goddess Bast-Hathor.4 Some writers mocked Ra's pretensions to divinity and considered him subordinate to the Goddess Mother. He was "born yesterday
from the buttocks of the goddess Mehurt ... the Great Celestial Wa
ter." He was told, "Thy mother brought thee forth upon her hand."
Apparently the average Egyptian wouldn't tolerate priestly efforts to erase the Goddess and replace her with the kings' solar Father.
Budge says, "it is quite certain that there was something in the doctrines
of the priests of Ra, or in the worship that was the practical expression of them, which was contrary to the instincts of the Egyptians as a
nation." 5
Wrestling with the problem of bringing their god into being without a mother, Ra's priests took refuge in abstractions beyond the
understanding of ordinary folk: "The god hath formed himself and his
form is not known. He hath joined his seed with his body, so that his
egg existed in his secret self. ... He had no mother, who might have
given him his name. ... He who hath shaped his egg himself, the
mighty one of mysterious birth, who (himself) created his beauty." Such abstractions failed to satisfy the literal-minded Egyptian, who wanted
to know how Ra did it. Priests responded with the same evasiveness that
modern priesthoods also exhibit:
His image is not spread out in books. . . . He is too mysterious that his
glory should be revealed, too great that men should question concerning him, too powerful that he should be known. One falleth down dead on
the spot for terror, ifhis mysterious, unknowable name is pronounced.
No god can address him by it, him with the spirit, whose name is hidden, for that he is a mystery. 6
Yet Ra was not only the Goddess's child; he may even have been a masculinized version of the Goddess herself. One of her ancient
names was Ra with a feminine ending -r: "Ra-t of the two lands, the
lady of heaven, mistress of the gods . . . mistress of Heliopolis." Her full
name was Rat-taiut, "Ra-t of the world." 7 Her city, translated into
Greek as Heliopolis, was the Egyptian Anu, which the Bible calls On. The Goddess really controlled Ra by means of his secret soul-name.
Each day she laid on him an unbreakable spell, forcing him to grow old and senile as he limped on his cane toward his death at sunset. She
forced him to stand still at the summit of heaven while she resurrected her son Horus from the dead, a feat on which the Jews modeled their
myth of Joshua's arrest of the sun at the battle of Jericho. 8
The Jews enthusiastically adopted Ra and identified him with Yahweh, especially in his Babylonian form as the sun god Shamash
838



(Chemosh). Beth-Shemesh, House of the Sun, was a biblical version of Rabbatu
the sun god's shrine, corresponding to Egyptian per Ra. The God of Ragnarok
Moses followed Ra's custom, demanding that his worshipper go bare- >^1^m
foot in his presence. "Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place
whereon thou standest is holy ground" (Exodus 3:5).9 Sometimes the
Jews called their sun god Elias, a corruption of the Greek Helios.
Elias was the "father" Jesus called upon from the cross (Matthew
27:47-49). 1. Book of the Dead, 165. 2. Budge, G.E. 1, 341. 3. Erman, 139. 4. Budge, G.E. 1, 339-45. 5. Book ofthe Dead, 385, 501, 167. 6. Erman, 296, 299-300. 7. Budge, G.E. 1, 328. 8. Budge, E.M., 135. 9. Book of the Dead, 25, 203, 231.

Rachel
"Womb," personification of rachamin, "mother-love" or "compassion," comparable to Sanskrit karuna. 1 Rachel's totemic form was the
divine Ewe, mother of the Holy Lamb: an important symbol of early Hebraic tribal motherhoods. Rabbinical writings admitted that during
this tribal period, the Four Matriarchs Rachel, Sarah, Rebecca, and Leah were more important than the Three Patriarchs Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob. 2

Radha
"Cow elephant," the Shakti of Krishna. Her name doubtless arose
with the ancient bull-elephant cult. Krishna was considered an avatar of
the elephant god Ganesha. 1 According to the Kama Sutra, the
elephant represented maximum sexual capacity and unflagging desire.

Ragnarok
Norse doomsday, the end of the present universe. Heimdall would

original state of chaos.

Rainbow
Upanishads Buddhist scriptures representing the final stage in Vedic thought, dealing with the
philosophy known as Vedanta. The Katha Upanishad discusses
transmigration of souls, the nature of eternal life, the doctrine of maya, and an account of a visit to Yama, Lord of the Dead.
Rainbow
Myths often associate the rainbow with the dream-time or Golden Age when earth and heaven were in easy communication with one
another. Deities, spirits, and mortals might pass back and forth on the rainbow bridge, which was also the axis mundi, or ladder of heaven, or necklace of the Great Mother who ruled the Golden Age. The Pot of
Gold at the rainbow's end was another form of the Celts' Holy Grail, a
womb symbol related to the pots where Mother Moon (Mana) kept
the souls of the dead in her western paradise. 1
The rainbow's seven colors represented the seven celestial spheres and the rainbow-hued veils of Maya, the Goddess working behind
the veils to manifest the material world in its many-colored complexity.
Her priestesses wore the colors of the veils, which appeared in
Egyptian mythology as the seven stoles of Isis, and in the Bible as the
seven veils of Salome.2 The rainbow veils of the Goddess Ishtar were sometimes gar
ments, sometimes jewels. The rainbow was called her necklace, of which she made the bridge to heaven for the souls of her chosen ones. Her rainbow necklace had selective power. If the Goddess willed,
neither man nor god could cross it. On one occasion she placed her
rainbow to block the Heavenly Father from receiving the food laid on
earth's altars, to punish him after he sent the Flood to destroy her
earthly children. 3 Biblical writers re-interpreted this Babylonian myth to omit the Goddess and make the rainbow represent God's promise to
Noah not to do it again.
The rainbow's selectivity is a common motif. The glowing bridge was a broad way for the chosen, a razor-edge for the wicked. The
Katha Upanishad said the rainbow bridge to heaven is as difficult to
traverse as the edge of a razor. 4 The Persians said the same of their
Kinvad or Cinvat rainbow bridge: "For the just it is nine lance-lengths
wide, for the ungodly it is as narrow as the edge of a razor. The
Cinvat bridge is at the 'Center' ... the bridge connects earth and heaven at the 'Center.'" 5 Christian tradition spoke of the same
selective bridge of heaven: "Narrow is the way . . . and few there be that
find it" (Matthew 7:14). The Japanese said the rainbow is "the road of the gods and the
bridge between sky and earth." As in India and Mesopotamia, its
seven colors were associated with the seven heavens. "The throne of the Supreme Being is surrounded by a rainbow, and the same symbolism persists into the Christian art of the Renaissance." The sex of
the Supreme Being was changed by patriarchal theology, but the symbol still suggests the archaic Maya-Shakti enveloped in her rainbow veils. "Shamanic drums are decorated with drawings of the rainbow
represented as a bridge to the sky In the Turkic language the word for rainbow means bridge."6
Northern pagans also said the Goddess's rainbow necklace and the
840



rainbow Bridge of Heaven were one and the same. 7 Freya's magic necklace Brisingamen was the same as the rainbow bridge called Bifrost
or Bilrost, the "trembling way," also known as Asbru, "bridge of the gods." 8 During the Christian era, this rainbow bridge became one of
the features of Fairyland. Heathen legend said as doomsday approached, the bridge would be broken down so there was no more
communication between earth and heaven. In effect this meant
mortals would no longer go to heaven, neither in the shamanic trance
nor in the spirit after death.
Greeks personified the rainbow as the Goddess Iris, usually called Hera's messenger, one more instance of the Great Goddess's associa
tion with the garment of many colors, Maya's or Isis's veils. As the
"bridge," Iris carried Mother Hera's messages to earth as the rain
bow-hued peacock carried the messages of Mother Juno. Iris also bound
the Nemean Lion with her colorful girdle and carried it to the sacred cave in the Nemean mountains.

Ram
The Nemean Mountains were the location of an ancient temple, near the city of Nemea in
Argolis, in the Peloponnesus.9
Ram
One of the "horny" animals embodying the phallic god along with the bull, stag, and billygoat. The ram was often selected for the dubious
honor of sacrifice, being identified with the god who immolated
himself to himself for the sake of humanity.
Solar gods were linked with the heavenly ram Aries, who began the sacred year, dead and reborn as the new Aeon. Egyptians called
him Amen-Ra, "the Ram, the virile male, the holy phallus, which
stirreth up the passions of love, the Ram of rams." ' The Ram Caught in a Thicket was a sexual metaphor and a common religious icon in Abraham's legendary home, Ur of the Chaldees. The same Ram Caught in a Thicket appeared in the Bible as
a surrogate victim to replace Isaac, whose father Abraham was about
to sacrifice him on the altar at Yahweh's command (Genesis 22:13). The story marked a transition from ancient customs of human
sacrifice to the classical rule of animal sacrifice, as shown also in the
substitution of the ram of the Golden Fleece for the king's son in a Boeotian sacrifice to Zeus. 2 An older Midrashic version of the Abraham-Isaac story said Abraham's hand was not stayed, the ram did not
appear. Isaac was slaughtered, buried, and rose again on the third day. 3 Rams were sacred in Israel as consorts of Rachel, the Holy Ewe,
whom the biblical narrative later married to Jacob, A reincarnated
Isaac. Jews sacrificed the paschal lamb each year as a firstborn son of the ram god who was identified with Yahweh. At one time the biblical
God wore ram's horns, later assigned instead to the devil. Joshua's
841



Rama priests used ram's horns to make victory magic (Joshua 6:4), showing Rape that they were led by the divine ram in battle.

Rama
Hero of the Ramayana, whose name meant "sexual pleasure" or "enjoyment of virility" one of the phallic avatars of Krishna as consort
of the female-genital Goddess Sita, "the Furrow." l Their story was constructed on the framework of titles for the male and female elements
of the lingam-yoni. l.Avalon,607.
Rape
Classical mythology abounds in rapes: the rape of the Sabine women,
Zeus's rape of his mother Rhea, Apollo's numerous rapes of nymphs, even of his sister Artemis. One gets the impression that the Greeks
thought women always had to be forced into sexual relationships, even with gods. But the word translated "rape" usually meant seduction.
Teiresias, who lived as both a man and a woman, announced his
discovery that a woman's pleasure in sex was nine times that of a man. 1
True rape was not common in the ancient world. Like the males
of all other mammalian species, the ancients believed sexual activity
should be initiated by the female. The modern conventional description
of a rapist as an "animal" is a slur on the animal kingdom; animals do
not rape. Only man forces sexual attentions on an unwilling female. The Bible tells of a Levite who gave up his concubine-wife to a
mob to be gang-raped to death in order to save himself from
molestation, and then cut her to pieces. "All who saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel
came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day" (Judges 19:30). A war
was fought over the incident, showing that it was highly unusual.
A change in the attitude toward rape was one of the contrasts between the ancient world and the medieval one in western Europe.
The Romans and Saxons punished rapists by death. Normans cut off a
rapist's testicles and gouged his eyes out. 2 The gypsies' Oriental
heritage demanded the death penalty for a rapist.
3 Hindu law said a
rapist must be killed, even if his victim was of the lowest caste, an
Untouchable; and his soul should "never be pardoned. "4 The Byzan
tine Code decreed that rapists must die and their property must be
given to the victim, even if she was no better than a slave woman. 5
Christian laws changed the picture. Serfs' wives, sisters, or daughters were always sexually available to their overlords under the new
842



ime.6 Peasant brides were raped by the baron before being turned Rape
er to their bridegrooms probably to be raped again. The Church made it illegal for any wife to refuse sexual intercourse unless it was a ^^^^^^^^^^^^
holy day when marital sex was prohibited. Therefore, marital rape was encouraged. Victorian England almost achieved one of patriarchy's most
sought-after goals: total male control of female sexuality. Until 1884 a
wife could be jailed for trying to deny her husband his "conjugal rights." She was as much a sexual slave as any inmate of an eastern harem. 7 Forced to consent to frequent rape by husbands who neither knew nor cared about women's sexual enjoyment, 19th-century wives became
predictably indifferent to the delights of the marriage bed, in such numbers that medical authorities described women as "largely devoid
of sexual pleasure." It was said in a standard marriage manual used for
decades, and translated into 1 2 languages: "Wives seldom seek the
closer embraces of their husbands. They are generally indifferent; often
absolutely averse. . . . God has made the passivity of the wife the protection of her husband and a source of manifold blessing to their children." Having thanked God for a world of unaroused women, the author went on: "There can be little doubt that much marital indiffer
ence upon the part of wives is due to chronic constipation, which is so
prevalent among women. "8 The implied assumption would be that God foresightedly afflicted women with chronic constipation in addition to the other curses on Eve.
Societies retaining the idea of Goddess-worship seldom demonstrate marital or extramarital rape; female sexuality is nearly always
fully developed. Sadistic, violent sexual fantasies do not appear in the imagery of India. 9 The matriarchal Semai held it illegal for a man
even to try to talk to a woman into sexual relations if she said no in the
beginning. 10 Anti-rape rules inspired warmer relationships, as G.B. Shaw said: "The desire to give inspires no affection unless there is also
the power to withhold." n
The laws of Shaw's culture, however, were designed to deprive women of the power to withhold. Before 1653, any Englishman
could kidnap and rape a child heiress, after which the law viewed him as her legal husband. He was rewarded for rape with the acquisition of
the victim's property. In 1653 the law was changed not to help the
victim, but to cut the government in on the loot. A man could be
imprisoned for raping a young girl for her money, but half the victim's estate was taken by the government. 12
Victorians never held men legally responsible for debauching adolescent girls, since the legal "age of consent" for females was
twelve. A child under the age of eight was not allowed to give evidence
against a man who violated her, on the ground that she was too
young to understand the legal oath. 13 Yet in the 16th century, authori
ties set the "age of consent" at six years. 14 Raping children was a
common enough pastime of Victorian men, who maintained that sexual
843



Rape intercourse with a virgin child was a sure cure for syphilis. As late as
the 1930s, the madam of a West End whorehouse advertised, "In my j ^^^^^^^^^^mB house you can gloat over the cries of the girls with the certainty that
no one will hear them besides yourself." 1S
Victorian pornography reflects an obsessive fascination for vio
lence and rape, often describing sexual partners as "adversaries," though they were certainly not evenly matched. One male writer fantasized a female experience of defloration by a rapist who "quickly
buried his tremendous instrument too far within me to leave me any
chance of escape. He now paid no kind of attention to my sufferings,
but followed up his movements with fury, until the tender texture
altogether gave way to his fierce tearing and rending, and one merciless, violent thrust broke in and carried all before him, and sent it
imbrued, reeking with blood of my virginity, up to its utmost length
in my body. The piercing shriek I gave proclaimed that I felt it up to the
very quick; in short, his victory was complete." The same male writer
mused complacently: "How magical is the influence of our sex over the feelings of the softer one." 16
The magic was not apparent to a modern rape victim who,
nevertheless, displayed an almost catatonic acceptance of the victim's role, in effect giving her attackers the right to abuse her:
They were just taking advantage ofme because I was alone and available. That's just the way men relate to women. Ifthey 're alone and available,
well, use them. Audit's nothing perverted. It's just their normal way of
relating to a woman. . . .
After it was over, I was aware ofpain and dirtiness in my body, and I
was hurt in my pride and confused about why they had raped me and
why they were laughing at me and making fun ofmy body and taunting
me. And I was also very sure that God was watching the whole thing
and shaking his head and saying what a horrible person I was for allowing
myselfto get raped. ' 7
Studies have shown that raped women often were reluctant to
hurt their assailants, e.g. by gouging eyes or twisting testicles, even when
they had a chance. "Women often take the responsibility when men
treat them as prey. This isn't just an odd female quirk. The attitude is deeply entrenched Women are taught to make themselves attractive to men. Those who don't are ignored by men or incur their
displeasure. But if they become victims of sexual assault, they are
immediately suspected of collusion. No man is ever guilty." 18
In San Francisco in 1971, a gunpoint rapist was acquitted because his unmarried victim admitted having a lover. Women picketers
protested the decision in vain, handing out leaflets which said:
When a person is robbed, the robber is put on trial. When someone is murdered, the murderer is tried. But when a woman is raped, it is the
woman and not the rapist who is put on trial. . . . Ifshe can be shown to
have any sexual history, the rapist must be acquitted, for by their definition it is then no rape at all. For a woman to allow herselfto be a sex- \
844



ual person, to enjoy her sexuality in her own way in her own time, is for Rape her to lose all protection from being forced to commit sexual acts with any man at any time. ' 9 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Sometimes the culture forces on men a pseudo-rapist stance vis
a-vis women, where men in groups gang up on a woman verbally or symbolically, to injure her sense of self. One young woman wrote: "When I first started to live in the city, I would walk by the construction
workers having lunch and hear all those horrible comments. I didn't quite know how to deal with it. I was embarrassed because I had breasts.
I felt it was my fault for having them, and that of course I deserved to
be commented upon. Now I know that's not true. It's they who have to
change, not me." 20 A recent investigator wrote:
The virility mystique . . . predisposes men to rape. If women were physically stronger than men, I do not believe there would be any instances
offemale raping male, because female sexual socialization encourages a
woman to integrate sex, affection, and love, and to be sensitive to what her partner wants. Ofcourse, there are many women who deviate from
this pattern, just as there are men who have managed to reject their
socialization for virility. But cultural trends make these cases exceptional. Ifour culture considered it masculine to be gentle and sensitive, to be responsive to the needs ofothers, to abhor violence, domination, and
exploitation, to want sex only within a meaningful relationship, to be attracted by personality and character rather than by physical appearance, to value lasting rather than casual relationships, then rape would indeed be a deviant act. . . . Iflynching is the ultimate racist act, rape is the ultimate sexist act. It
is an act ofphysical and psychic oppression. . . . [L]ike lynching, it is cowardly, and like lynching, it is used to keep individual women, as well as
women as a caste, in their place. And finally, as with lynching, the rape victim is blamed for provocation. Rape is an abuse ofpower, and the increase in rape shows that men
are increasingly unable to handle their excessive power over women. . . .
Eradicating rape requires getting rid of the power discrepancy between men and women. 2'
From the Inquisition's torturers, who usually raped their victims first, to Victorian doctors who attacked female genitals with leeches,
many kinds of rape could be traced to what has been called "the
virulent woman-hatred in fundamentalist Christianity." 22 Recent stud
ies show that most rapists were professed members of a religious sect
and learned to regard sex as evil, in the traditional Christian manner. 23
One rapist said, "I've always been brought up that sex was dirty, sex was not to be practiced." Another said he was "confused about just what the sex act was and how they went about it." Another was so naive he didn't know where babies came from, and another was ignorant of the
word "vagina," calling it 'Virginia" instead. 24 "Sex offenders as a
group were extremely naive about sexual matters, felt inferior, had suffered in childhood from anxiety and fears about sex . . . and had
lacked accurate sex instruction." 25

Rati In some areas, the laws of both church and state actually encour
aged rape until very recently. Up to 1978 in Italy, a rapist could go unpunished if his victim agreed to marry him. By a combination of
violation and coercion, it was quite possible for a man to force
marriage on a woman who had every reason to fear and hate him. And,
since patriarchal society in effect forbade women to hate men,
especially as wives, once again the victim would be blamed for her victimization.

Rati
Balinese name of the Goddess, called "Erotic Delight," perhaps a
cognate of ancient Egyptian Ra-ti of the World, "Lady of Heaven, Mistress of the Gods." J There may have been a connection with the
Greeks' Erato, "Passionate One," the Muse of erotic poetry. 2 Images of
Rati displayed the overflowing sexuality and fertility admired in ancient matriarchies: huge breasts, a pregnant belly, a mouth twisted to one side and shaped like a vulva. Zimmer's description shows the
typical uneasiness of the western male in the presence of such exaggerated symbols of the Eternal Feminine:
The goddess ofmaternity and fertility . . . is indicating, with a traditional twofold symbolic gesture, the two main functions ofthe female
principle. One forearm lifts the breasts that nourish the creatures she
brings forth, while the other hand, placed at the lower abdomen,
immediately above the organ ofgeneration, presses the ever-pregnant womb. The sensual mouth, with its half-open lips and broadening gap at the left corner, has a voluptuous, dolorous trait, suggesting simultaneously the delights oflove and conception and the pangs and throes of birth. The figure exhibits, frankly, all the innocent shamelessness of archaic mother figures, but in addition or so it seems the challeng
ing, calm, watchful, and consciously exhibitionistic attitude ofa curiously demonic, suprahuman harlot. The hideous and grotesque features are suffused with a sinister, devilish allure ofsex. . . .
The image, though by no means isolated in the art ofBali, is one of
its most challenging and meaningful specimens . . . rawly protesting, as it were, against the lofty doctrines ofrelease and transcendent redeeming wisdom, which, in the forms of Buddhist and yogic asceticism, were the most conspicuous and forceful products, in that period, ofthe masculine
spirit. After milleniums ofthe struggle ofthe gurus to disengage man from the brutish thrall of the demonic powers ofsheer nature, these unabated, unconquered, and unreconciled still were there. And they
are both shocking and attractive. *

Raven
In its black plumage, the raven was a natural totem of the deities of
death. Many forms of the Lord of Death were incarnate in a raven.
Chukchi shamans called their ancestral wizard-king Big Raven, he
who was ceremonially castrated and killed. 1 Danes spoke of a Valraven who was Hel's king in the underworld. As a son and mate of the
nether Goddess, he was sometimes personified as King Morvran, "SeaRaven." 2
Valkyries could take the form of ravens to drink the blood of slain
warriors, which is why Norse skalds called blood "the raven's drink." 3
Like a Valkyrie-psychopomp, a raven was supposed to perch on the shoulder of the Orphic initiate as he entered the temple for the
ceremony of mock death and rebirth. 4 According to the Mithraic
Mysteries, the initiate received the title of Raven when he attained
the first degree of enlightenment, which corresponded to ascent to heaven's lunar sphere, the domain of the Moon-goddess who received and cared for the dead. 5
So constant was the death-and-resurrection symbolism of the raven in Germanic tradition that the new Germanic hero of the Second
Coming, Emperor Frederick, was said to be guarded by ravens as he
waited, sleeping, in his underground sanctuary for the day of his return to earth. According to the Armenian version, the emperor still
sleeps under a magic hill called Rock of the Raven.6 In fairy tales, a
raven is often the soul-bird who conducts the hero into mysterious
underground places and out again, or gives information concerning the after-world.

Reincarnation
Literally, "re-fleshing," the basic Oriental view of cyclic rebirth after
each death; the original meaning of being born again. In the role of
Fate-goddess, the Great Mother governed the Wheel of Becoming (Greek, kyklos geneseon) which meant the cycles of successive lives, like the wheel of karma governed by Kali. 1
Patriarchal thinkers tended to deny the doctrine of reincarnation in

from Jewish sources) giving additional details or alternative versions of the Genesis myths.
favor of the one-way trip to heaven or hell after only one life on
earth. They sought eternal stasis rather than cycles. Yet reincarnation
was the standard belief of all the ancient nations, with the patriarchal
principle of eternal stasis appearing only as a late development. Pythagoras believed in transmigration of souls from one body to another: "The spirit wanders, comes now here, now there, and
occupies whatever frame it pleases. From beasts it passes into human
bodies, and from our bodies into beasts, but never perishes." 2 Plato
had the same idea. His Republic depicted Greek heroes in the underworld choosing bodies for their next incarnation on earth. The rebirth
doctrine prevailed among cultured Greeks who had been initiated into the Mysteries. Their idea was the same as the Tantric idea, which
promised free choice of subsequent bodies to the Enlightened Ones in the Intermediate State between death and the next life. 3
Even Jewish tradition retained traces of the reincarnation doctrine.
In the First Book ofAdam and Eve, Adam offered God a sacrifice of
his own blood, saying, "Be favorable to me every time I die, and bring
me to life." 4 Orthodox Jews made it a rule not to name a newborn
child after a living person, lest untimely transmission of the name-soul should bring death to the elder. The rule stemmed from the ancient
belief that every infant possessed the soul of an ancestor in a new body. 5
The Jewish belief that a woman could conceive by bathing in water
used to wash a corpse clearly points to a belief in reincarnation. 6 Indeed, the Talmud says Adam was reincarnated in the person of David, and then again in the Messiah. 7
Reincarnation was the general belief not only in the Orient but
throughout pagan Europe. Caesar said the druids taught this doctrine
of cyclic rebirths. 8 It is still the prevailing opinion among "primitive"
peoples who imagine their own souls to be temporary bits of the World Soul that animates all living things. The Poetic Edda demonstrates a belief in the karmic wheel of reincarnations, from which one
may be released only by self-destruction. Brynhild's suicide insured that "born again she may never be." 9 Among the Eskimos as among ancient Greeks and Hindus, cycles of reincarnation include all forms of
life. They say the Goddess of Animals looks after all creatures and doesn't like to see too many of them killed, since they are of the same
spiritual substance as human beings. "Life is endless," the shamans
say, "only we do not know in what form we shall reappear after death." 10
Reincarnation was necessarily bound up with motherhood in all
societies, since mothers were its agents and carriers. It was the mother of Lemminkainen, hero of the Kalevala, who gave him another life after
he was killed. 11 In northern India, dead infants were buried under the
threshold of the house, so their spirits might enter the bodies of mothers
who passed in and out and so be born again. 12 Reincarnation seems to have been a secret tenet of some of the
early Christian churches, not explained to ordinary congregations but
848



ivealed in secret after the preliminary stages of initiation into an inner
;roup of "elect" or "perfected" mystics. Later, the exoteric church repudiated the doctrine of karmic rebirth. In 553 a.d. the Second
Council of Constantinople laid down a decree: "Whosoever shall
support the mythical doctrine of the pre-existence of the soul and the
consequent wonderful opinion of its return, let him be anathema."
Origen, once accounted a saint and a father of the church, taught the
doctrine of reincarnation; but three centuries after his death he was officially excommunicated "on account of his beliefs." 13 The concept of reincarnation made nonsense of the Christian
doctrine of reward and punishment after death. If all souls returned to
the same Cauldron of Regeneration, including animal souls mingling with human ones, logically they were not differentiated for eternity
into "evil" and "good" souls. The West's traditional denial of soul-stuff
to animals, and its insistence that man alone was immortal and stood
at the pinnacle of all creation, led to abuses contributing to the present
day ecological crisis. At a symposium of theologians in California, 1970, "virtually all the scholars agreed that the traditional Christian
attitude toward nature has given sanction to exploitation of the
environment by science and technology and thus contributed to air and
water pollution, overpopulation and other ecological threats." Lynn White wrote, "One of the causes of our present crisis is to be found in
the Judeo-Christian traditions . . . which speak of man's dominance
over nature. ... By destroying pagan animism, Christianity made it possible to exploit nature in a mood of indifference to the feelings of
natural objects." M It is odd that even here, those living things with
feelings are called "objects." Eastern opinions on reincarnation mitigated man's cruelty to his
fellow creatures, at the price of attributing to them a psychic content
indistinguishable from that of human beings. It is no great moral victory to refrain from killing a spider if one sincerely believes the spider could contain the soul of one's grandmother. It might be more moral to
refrain from killing a spider simply because it is alive, and wishes to
remain so; and all will to live deserves respect.
Perhaps the best one could say for reincarnation was that it was not
wasteful. Its soul-stuff was preserved and recycled. The Christian
theory was less tidy, with constant new creation of supposedly "immor
tal" souls, since the world began: a vast accumulation, still increasing
daily. In practice, however, many Christians secretly believed in some form of the forbidden reincarnation. Like Orphics, some even claimed they could remember their former lives. The conspicuous
absence of proof for such claims only seems to strengthen the faith of those who wish to believe.

Religion
Latin rehgio meant re-linking or reunion, a restoration of the umbilical bond between nature and man, or between the Mother Goddess and
her son-consort, typified by human sexual union. The Sanskrit
equivalent was yoga, which also meant linking or joining, root of the
English "yoke." 1 A need to re-establish the mother-child bond in symbol may have
been the source of all religion, which Schleiermacher defined as an
infantile "feeling of absolute dependence." 2 Gaylin says "the helplessness of infancy" is transmuted in religious imagery to "a plea for a
solution to the problem of survival." 3 Significantly, the mature, caretak
ing figure even in patriarchal religious imagery was the female, not the male. God nearly always had a baby stage, appearing in his Mother's arms. But the Goddess, even in her virgin form, was full grown and
maternally capable. This curious fact may be based on the attitude of
worshipper to deity as a child to parent, and the true biological parent recognized by all mammals is the mother. Thus, even patriarchal religions conceal the "strong unconscious trend towards mother
worship." 4 Freud defined religion as an attempt to control the mental world
"by means of a world of wishes." Religious images are "fulfilments of
the oldest, strongest, most compelling wishes of mankind." 5 Apart from the wish to control the Mother figure, and the wish not to die, the
gods made in the image of men expressed a rather paltry, self-seeking series of wishes obviously drawn from limited imagination. Santayana remarked, "It is pathetic to observe how lowly are the motives that
religion, even the highest, attributes to the deity, and from what a hard-pressed and bitter existence they have been drawn. To be given
the best morsel, to be remembered, to be praised, to be obeyed
blindly and punctiliously these have been thought points of honor with the gods." 6 Of course these were points of honor with men first. As Sir Richard Francis Burton said, "The more I study religions, the
more I am convinced that man never worshipped anything but
himself." 7
Buddhist ascetics concurred, saying a man's self is "nearer to us than anything else, indeed dearer than a son, dearer than wealth, dearer than all beside. Let a man worship the Self alone as dear, for if he
worship the Self alone as dear, the object of his love will never
perish." Children were of no interest to the male ascetics: "Realizing
the glory of the Self, the sages of old craved not sons nor daughters. 'What have we to do with sons and daughters,' they asked, we who have known the Self, we who have achieved the supreme goal of
existence?' " 8
With the advent of male gods, religions tended to become obsessive about guilt and sin, worried about what the gods might punish as
hubris, fearful of giving offense by a careless word or deed. In short, the
850



gods behaved like not particularly loving fathers, or elder males Religion
seeking to maintain ascendancy over younger ones. The Judeo-Christian deity became one of the foremost examples of Oepidal hostility ^^^^^^^^^^^^
in the world pantheon. He punished the whole human race for one sin
of its remote ancestor, with a punishment so terrible that it would last
forever in merciless agony. The fear of so irrational and vindictive a
deity drove a whole civilization into neurosis. Social evils that might
have been remedied were left unchecked, on the theory that all human
beings were sinful wretches who deserved to suffer especially wom
en, the primary sinners. Serfdom, slavery, legalized brutality, economic oppression all were excused in the name of a vengeful God, whose
priesthood insisted on his hostility toward humanity, to the point where unspeakable atrocities were committed to the greater glory of reli
gion.9 Christian history shows that religion may follow a humane course
in response to social trends; but it does not lead the way.
With its doctrine of inherited sin, for which no man could atone by
himself without the intercession of the Son whose death the Father
commanded, Christianity set out to formalize the hostile parent figure in its insistence that the only way to righteousness was to fear God.
Accordingly, fathers of the church emphasized this point. Lactantius
claimed all religion depends on fear; Tertullian asked, "How are you going to love, unless you are afraid not to love?" ,0 The horror story of
God's hostility toward his wretched children was treated as a literal
reality, not a psychological image. This "fiction of timeless truths has
taxed the ingenuity of even the ablest of rationalizers who seek by
means of subtle taxonomic devices to fit embarrassing new discoveries
into the framework of the old beliefs." n As the old beliefs were
products of primitive ignorance, their framework has had to be stretched to cover an immense body of fact that it was never meant to cover.
The fit is still poor:
No ethics and no religion can contain any wisdom that can transcend man 's own knowledge about the immediate and future consequences ofhis own behavior. Every religion and every ethical system must recognize that it might well be made obsolete by an extension of
human knowledge in almost any area. . . . Far from any evidence of far-sighted and consistent leadership, the
clergy has shown nothing other than all too human tendency to fill their sails with whatever winds ofpublic opinion may blow, and always with their vested interest firmly at the helm. '2
The clergy's vested interest now dictates revision of traditional
illusions to suit more modern thinking. Augstein says theologians now admit that "Christianity has been on the wrong track for sixteen
hundred years, ever since Constantine, that it has had a wrong conception of God all that time and is only now in a position to disclose its
social mores in short, that it must start all over again. But when
religion was powerful, it never wielded any positive influence on

social mores; so why should it do so today, when it is a survival sinking
out of sight?" " Churches have not shown any inclination to reform
themselves except when sales of their nonproduct decline to the danger point, and few take much active interest in social issues. Farm worker
Roberto Acuna spoke bitterly of his church's indifference: "I could tear
the churches apart. I never saw a priest out in the fields trying to help
people [I]t's always the church taking from the people." M James Martineau, professor of moral philosophy at Manchester New College, summed up the dilemma of conventional religion in
The Seat ofAuthority ofReligion:
Christianity . . . has been mainly evolved from that which is unhistorical
and perishable in its sources; from what is unhistorical in its traditions,
mythological in its preconceptions, and misapprehended in the oracles of its prophets. From the fable ofEden to the imagination ofthe last trumpet, the whole story ofthe divine order ofthe world is dislocated and deformed. . . .
The spreading alienation ofthe intellectual classes ofEuropean
society from Christendom, and the detention ofthe rest in their spiritual culture at a level not much above that ofthe Salvation Army, are social phenomena which ought to bring home a very solemn appeal to the consciences ofordinary churches. ,f
Some scholars find it baffling that man seems unable to found
an ethic or a philosophy on perceptions of reality, but instead must cling to crude myths even to the point of filling his own life and the lives
of others with unnecessary horrors. 16 Among the worst of these is the
real violence with which man attacks the questioners or doubters of
his myths: as if to kill his own reasonable doubts before they rise up to the surface of his mind and become fully conscious.
To purvey an unenlightened education, teaching myths as if they were facts, is another abuse of cultural communication, inflicting on children a confusion between truth and fantasy that may haunt them all
their lives and prevent them from developing clear thought on any
subject. It isn't always easy for a child to know where the real world
stops and his own imagination begins. If adults can't help him draw the line, because their own minds are muddled by an age-old ignorance,
the next generation will repeat the errors of centuries.
Religions affect to purvey "higher Truth," but all too often their
capital-T Truth bears an uncanny resemblance to a capital-L Lie. One
theologian said the objective of religion is "to know the truth and to
live by it"; but the same theologian defined religion as "believing things that do not seem to be so, and always it is believing what cannot be
proved to be so." A less subtle seminarian once defined religion as "the power that enables us to believe what we know to be untrue." 17 No
wonder the Rev. Kirsopp Lake lamented that a clergyman is "apt to have a lower standard of intellectual honesty than would be tolerated
in any other profession." A noted historian writes: "The churches have
long brought up the intellectual rear of our civilization, and . . . their
852



I claims to spiritual leadership are still weakened by their engrained Religion I tendency to resist new knowledge and aspiration. Most are still disposed to a dogmatic supernaturalism that saps the intellectual honesty ^^^^^^^^^^^^
and courage essential for a responsible idealism." 18
It is often taken for granted that religion helps to keep the ordinary citizen honest, presumably through fear of divine punishment. This
may be a misapprehension:
Every survey ever undertaken ofthe composition ofthe criminal popula
tion reveals a percentage ofthe avowedly religious higher than a random sample of the population will show. . . . Little or no relationship was found between the presence or absence, intensity, or kind of expression ofreligious faith, and conduct or moral standard. Some of those who were most skeptical, or who denied all need offaith or
concern with religious problems, were unimpeachable in behavior, kind and helpful to others, and ofhigh integrity. . . . The many attempts to find evidence that religion or its practice have
[sic] desirable consequences in crime prevention have without exception ended in failure . . . there seems to be no convincing evidence that
conventional religion, ofitself, has proved an effective antidote to crime. ' 9
Unfortunately, in the western world religion has proved more often an instrument of oppression than a guide to more honest or more
tolerant living. Churches generally supported the powerful at the expense of the powerless. For example, the church helped even the
crudest monarchies in history by formulating and upholding the doctrine of the divine right of kings. In the present century the world
has seen cardinals praying for the success of dictators. 20
The common symbol of religious organization is "the shepherd and the herd he must tend . . . and at the bottom of it lies the childlike
concept that our elders run the world for our benefit." 21 Of course, the
shepherd doesn't tend the herd for the benefit of the sheep. He tends
them for his own benefit. He makes his living from them. In some ways
the analogy is apt. Ecclesiastical "shepherds" in the past have resorted
to every imaginable crime to increase their profits: land-grabbing,
vandalism, false advertising, defamation of character, forgery, plagiarism, even all-out war and murder, ever since Pope Leo the Great endorsed the death penalty for "erroneous beliefs." There is still a
tendency among Christians to "assume that theirs is the only true
religion, and that their Christian duty is to convert the rest of the
world. The rest of the world, which happens to include the great
majority of mankind, still resents this assumption." 22 Christian elitism allowed theologians to "believe that they speak
for everyone when they lecture about things like guilt, love, sin, and grace. This naivete allows them to make definitive statements about the
true way in which all people should live and think about these
matters. Theologians are ignorant of what every anthropologist knows i.e, that the forms of our thought derive from the forms of
853



Renenet our culture." It has been demonstrated often enough that women
particularly suffered from the suppression of their own natural reli
^^^^^^^^^^^ gious imagery in favor of an imposed masculine, alien, hierarchical
system. "For women to become intellectually responsible and creative members of society, they have to outgrow Oedipal dependence on
paternal authority whether that authority is embodied in a paternalistic husband, or father, or God." Feminists have shown "how important the demise of Yahweh and Christ is to the intellectual independence
of Western women. Freud was certain that Judaism and Christianity
stunted the intellectual maturity of men. It is probable, however, that
these religions are even more damaging to the intellectual growth of
women." 23
One might hope that, if women again become free to create their
own religion as they were in the distant past, it would be a religion
less sullied by the profit motive, the cruelty, hostility, and Oedipal
jealousy that disfigures the religious images of men. One might hope, also, that it would remain open to correction by new scientific discover
ies, as Christianity has never been. Thomas Aquinas warned long ago that the faith would become a matter of ridicule "if any Catholic, not
gifted with the necessary scientific learning, presents as dogma what scientific scrutiny shows to be false." 24 Later churchmen forgot this
advice. In consequence they can offer no reason other than the
church's decree at present to endorse such impossibilities as a virgin
birth, transubstantiation, resurrection of the flesh, and all the biblical miracles. At the same time they must deny the very same impossibilities
claimed by Christianity's historical rivals, on equally credible (or

perhaps more realistic and humanistic ones.

Renenet
Egypt's "Lady of the Double Granary," Goddess of suckling, who
gave each baby its ren (secret name-soul) along with its mother's milk. Sometimes she wore a lion head, like Hathor; sometimes a serpent head, Uraeus; sometimes she wore the plumes of Mother Maat, the
Goddess-Named-Truth. 1 Renenet represented the ancient matriarchal theory that a child's soul is bestowed by its mother after she has
given birth to its body. The ren soul was kept secret, since an enemy

Repanse de Joie
"Dispenser of Joy," the Fairy Queen who kept the Holy Grail in her temple-palace at Montsalvatch. 1 She was identified with Elaine the Lily
Maid in the Arthurian cycle, and with several other versions of the
White Lady, showing that she was simply a medieval transformation of
the Moon-goddess with her Cauldron of Regeneration. Her title was
a traditional epithet of a harlot-priestess. See Grail, Holy.

Restituta, Saint
"Restored One, " a saint whose legend probably was based on a vandalized and half-burned statue of the Goddess found on the isle of
Ischia and replaced in her temple. According to the Christian myth, Restituta was a "virgin martyr" slain in Africa and consigned to a boat
filled with burning pitch. The boat drifted ashore on Ischia where her
remains were taken up by Christians and "reverently cared for." ' The
more likely possibility was that the Ischians took up the damaged
image of their Goddess and restored her to her temple after an attack by
fanatical iconoclasts.

Revelation
Latin revektio meant to draw back the veil (velum). 1 It was the
Goddess's rainbow veil that concealed the future and the secrets of the
spirit under the colors of earthly appearances. After death, men might see her "face to face." A vision of the naked Goddess was vouchsafed to
her sacred kings, who could draw back the veil of her temple, the
hymen, pierce her virginity and die in their mating, to become gods. But, as the Goddess said on her temple at Sais, "No mortal has yet been able to lift the veil which covers me." 2 Those who saw her
unveiled were no longer mortal.
In time, the word revelation was applied to every religious vision
or opinion. It even described the stereotyped pronouncements of fortune-tellers.
The Bible's Book ofRevelation purports to be a doomsday-vision
experienced by St. John the Divine, but it is in fact a collection of
images and phrases from many sources. Literature of this kind was

Rhadamanthys
"Diviner," one of three Cretan god-kings born of the Full-Moon goddess Europa, fathered by Zeus. The other two were Sarpedon and Minos.
Rhadamanthys was said to have been so wise and just that in the
underworld he was made a judge of the dead, like the similar bull
king Yama in India. Some myths said when Rhadamanthys was installed in the paradise of the Elysian Fields he married Alcmene, "Moonpower," the virgin mother of Heracles. 1 Thus he was another form of the Moon-bull king, like Zeus himself as consort of the Moon-cow
Europa a son identified with his divine father, like all other versions of the Lord of Death.
1. Graves, G.M. 1,294.
Rhea
Cretan name of the Aegean Universal Mother or Great Goddess,
who had no consort and ruled supreme before the coming of patriarchal
Hellenic invaders. Rhea was the archetypal Triple Goddess, with
several titles suggesting her separate functions: she was Britomartis the
Sweet Virgin, and Dictynna the Lawgiving Mother of Mount Dicte, and Aegea the foundress of Aegean civilizations. 1 Another of her names
was Coronis, both a carrion crow (death-goddess) and a virgin mother
(life-goddess) of the great hero of healing, Asclepius, whose Titan cult
the Hellenic Zeus angrily destroyed. Rhea was not restricted to the Aegean area. Among ancient tribes
of southern Russia she was Rha, the Red One, another version of Kali as Mother Time clothed in her garment of blood when she devoured all the gods, her offspring. 2 The same Mother Time became the Celtic Goddess Rhiannon, who also devoured her own children one by one. 3 This image of the cannibal mother was typical everywhere of the Goddess as Time, who consumes what she brings
forth; or as Earth, who does the same. When Rhea was given a
consort in Hellenic myth, he was called Kronus or Chronos, "Father
Time," who devoured his own children, in imitation of Rhea's earlier
activity. He also castrated and killed his own father, the Heaven-god
Uranus; and he in turn was threatened by his own son, Zeus. 4 These
myths reflect the primitive succession of sacred kings castrated and killed
by their supplanters. (See Kingship.) It was originally Rhea Kronia,
856



Mother Time, who wielded the castrating moon-sickle or scythe, a Rhinemaidens Scythian weapon, the instrument with which the Heavenly Father vas "reaped." Rhea herself was the Grim Reaper. Pre-Roman Latium knew her as Rhea Silvia, "Rhea of the
Woodland," an early form of the Moon-goddess Diana, called the irst Vestal Virgin and the mother of Romulus and Remus. Under the
rule of Rhea Silvia, the Vestal Virgins were neither celibate nuns, nor
servants of the state, as they became in later ages. They were choosers
and deposers of the early Latin kings, a college oimatronae who ruled the rulers and took no husbands. Consequently all their children
were begotten by "gods," not by men, as were the children of Rhea Silvia herself. Once born, Rhea's children were cared for by Acca
Larentia, a "holy harlot" or high priestess who also mothered all the ancestral spirits (lares) of Rome. See Akka.
Hellenic myth assimilated Rhea as both mother and wife of the Great God Zeus. Zeus "raped" his mother Rhea because she forbade
him to make a monogamous marriage (her own people had practiced group marriage). Then again, Zeus "raped" his sister-bride Hera,
Rhea's daughter, alter ego, and virgin phase, whose name was really the same as Rhea's He Era, the Earth. 5
Having forced Rhea-Hera to marry him, Zeus became a symbol of Greek wife-abuse. The Mother and Father of the Olympian gods
despised one another, constantly bickered and argued; mythographers always carefully described Hera's hostile "jealousy" of Zeus's many
impregnations of mortal virgins to provide the earth with god-begotten heroes. To spite her twin-brother-son-husband, Rhea-Hera returned to her ancient birth-magic and parthenogenetically conceived and bore
the serpent god Python just as under the archaic title of Eurynome she had created the world alone and given birth to the serpent god
Ophion. Another name for Rhea was Pandora, "the All-giver," which
Hesiod converted into an Eve-like giver of disasters to mankind,
through her excessive curiosity. 6 The myth had its origin in the idea that the Goddess did indeed give all kinds of fate, death as well as birth,
suffering as well as joy, in her endless time-cycles.

Rhinemaidens
Teutonic river-nymphs, original owners of the golden treasure of the
Nibelungs. Since the Nibelungs were "shades," or spirits of the dead, the Ring symbolized the karmic wheel and the Rhinemaidens were
keepers of the dead who were consigned to water, like aquatic Valkyries. They resembled eastern Vilas and Homeric Sirens; hearing their sweet songs could mean death to men. In antiquity, such songs were

Robin sung by priestesses in connection with sending a corpse to the Watermother by way of the funerary boat.
Robin was Saracenic, from Rah-bin, "a seer," cognate with the Semitic rabba, "lord," reb or rabbi, a priest. Robin's cult penetrated northern Europe from roots in Moorish Spain.7 The Iberian
peninsula was not Christianized until the overthrow of its
Arab governors in the 11th century. Like Scandinavia in the
same period, it was a fount of pagan ideas
and practices.
Robin
God of the Witches, with numerous variations: Robin Goodfellow, Robin son of Art, Robin the Bobbin, Robin Hood, or Robin Redbreast the last apparently derived from memories of the Norman
sacred king with blood-runes or gens-odd carved in the flesh of his
breast on his "red-letter day" (see Runes). As Lord of the Hunt and
a dying god he became the slain Cock Robin, whose executioner in the nursery rhyme did him in "with my wee bow and arrow" a Saxon
version of the Celtic Cu Chulainn who died at Mag Muirthemne
bound to the sacred pillar and riddled with arrows. 1 The red-breasted bird of spring was Cock Robin's soul; the red was
his blood, shed by a pagan sacrifice, though a pseudo-Christian
legend tried to explain it in a different way. A robin tried to pluck away
the thorns from Christ's crown, but only succeeded in tearing its own
breast, so all robins had red breasts thereafter. 2 This fable failed to
remove the curse of Cock Robin in the opinion of Christian authori
ties who knew quite well that he was a phallic god. In Cornwall, Robin meant a cock in the other sense: a penis. His
surname Hood, or Hud, referred to the symbolic pine log, planted in Mother Earth as a sacred pillar. A pamphlet of 1639 showed Robin as a
horned, hoofed, ithyphallic satyr, leading witches' revels in the company of a black dog and an owl. 3
Robin Hood, Wizard of the Greenwood, was a real person or
persons leading Sherwood Forest covens in the early 14th century,
with a wife or paramour taking the role of the Goddess Maerin, or
Marian, or Mari-Anna, the Saxon wudu-maer, literally the Mary or the Mother of the Grove. Great sacramental feasts in honor of Robin
and his lady were remembered in popular rhymes nearly three centuries later, when he was "Robin the Bobbin, the big-bellied Ben, who ate more meat than fourscore men." 4
Family names can be found dating back to the "greenwood
marriages" performed by heathen shamans, symbolized by the renegade Friar Tuck. Morrises and Morrisons descended from orgiastic Morris-dancers, also called Marian's morrice-men. 5 Like Robin (or Robinson), Morris dancers' May Day rites came from Moorish Spain. The original word was morisco, "Moorish." 6
The common folk of England liked Robin, which is why they called him Goodfellow, or Puck, which descended from a word for
"God." He was supposed to right the wrongs inflicted on the peasants by the church. He stole the treasures of the rich clergy and nobles and bestowed them on the poor. By force of arms he maintained a
heathen preserve in the wildwood, a sanctuary for heretics and others

persecuted by the church. Popular legend said Robin was born of a Roch, Saint
virgin impregnated by Oberon, King of the Fairies. He traveled to Romance fairyland, and was shown "many secrets which he never did open to the ^^m^mm^^^^m^
world." 8 Like the Greeks' Pan, Robin defended unspoiled land against the
encroachment of towns. In country districts, each village set aside a plot of raw woodland, which was not to be disturbed, because it belonged to The Goodfellow, or the Good Man.9 Elders of the Scottish church in 1 594 exerted their utmost influence to abolish this
Goodfellow's Croft, which they called the devil's acre, claiming it gave "great offence." 10
Mystery plays of the 1 6th century still continued to celebrate
Robin, Maid Marian, Friar Tuck, Little John, and the other heathen heroes. A Churchwardens Account Book lists the prices of costumes for
Robin and Marian as King and Queen of the May. The lady
impersonating Marian wore a crown, a purple coif, a blue surcoat, a yellow skirt, and red sleeves. 11 In such a way did the church ingest
pagan ceremonials by sponsorship, and eventually deprive them of
serious meaning.

Romance
Poets of the Middle Ages kept alive many druidic and other pre
Christian sacred tales, orally transmitted from generation to generation in the manner of the Vedas, under the guise of "romances." Earlier
rhyme-makers were priests of the Goddess, who gave them the gift of
inspiration from her magic cauldron, or Holy Grail. 1 A poet was like a seer or wizard, able to deal in "words of power," to create by the charms
of speech, a blessing of the Muse. Medieval poets were worshippers of Art and Woman, founders of the cult of courtly love, singers of
mansongr, the "woman-songs" beloved by the Goddess; and they were mockers of the church.
Poets seem to have regarded themselves as a dispossessed priesthood of the Goddess Love (Minne), who inspired the church's

hostility. Before the 13th century, poets were denied Christian communion, and denounced by churchmen as "ministers of Satan." Later,
they won acceptance by using biblical and theological motifs in their songs, but romantic poetry remained suspiciously heretical. 2 Old romances depicted the clergy as rude, brutish fellows who
mistreated delicate ladies, and even displayed sadistic behavior toward their own brethren. 3 The pagan gods were credited with warmer
personalities. Frithiof 's saga suggested that, though Christ despised lovers, the god Balder did not. Lovers could meet in the temples of
Balder, "the pious god," because "Is not his love for Nanna part of
his own nature, pure and warm? " Romantic heroes generally avoided
the Christian paradise and went to the earthly one, governed by the Goddess Morgan, or the Fairy Queen.4 According to the Lay of Gudrun, the poet had more magic power than any priest. Like the poet-savior Orpheus, he could charm birds and beasts with his music, and even raise the dead. His songs were
better liked than clerical sermons:
Whate'er he might be singing, to no one seemed it long; Forgotten in the minster were priest and choral song,
Church bells no longer sounded so sweetly as before, And every one who heard him longed for the minstrel sore. s
Minstrels' ballads have been praised as works that seem "to have
looked deepest into the human heart," excluding their occasional
Christian moralizing which is always "manifestly a later addition."
Steenstrup calls attention "to what small degree the ecclesiastical, or the
strictly Catholic, element . . . gets leave to appear. . . . [T]he religious, the ecclesiastical, the Catholic element has been clapped on later, and ... it is a disturbing and jarring force." 6 The bards invoked not God but Erda Mother Earth and the Goddess Minne, whose name was a
synonym for Love. 7
To churchmen, love was "nothing." To play at a game of chance "for love" was to play for nothing. 8 The expression "for love or
money" began with this distinction between pagan and Christian motivations. The troubadours and minnesingers acted for Minne
dienst, the "service of love." 9 Of course, donations were always
acceptable. The cult of Love rarely included marriage, which was usually
arranged by the couple's elders, for economic reasons. Ladies of the Courts of Love in southern France said true love couldn't exist between
married people. True love could exist only between a lady and her
chosen knight, who was expected to prove "gallantry" in combat before
he could be a "gallant," or lover. Ladies told their suitors, "It is
necessary that for love of me you should do deeds of chivalry I will
give you all my love as soon as I have seen you fight your first joust."
Chansons de gestes advised warriors to strike their enemies squarely in \
the bowels, so as to win the love of "the most beautiful ladies of the court." 10

This was a curiously mammalian-biological system, in which women watched men in combat and rewarded the winners with
sexual favors. Bishop Jacques of Vitry complained that knights fought in tournaments only to gain "the favors of the shameless women whose
tokens they wear." The monk Gildas described the barbarian aristocracy
as "addicted to vice, adulterous, and enemies of God." u
Old ballads and romances depict a society in which men constantly
showed off to excite women's admiration, almost like male birds and
beasts displaying themselves to females. Norse skalds said everything
men did was to impress the ladies. When women were watching,
they spurred their horses to go faster, so "readily will look the ladies and
lasses, as we are passing." 12 Geoffrey of Monmouth said the noble
women were celebrated for their wit, and "esteemed none worthy of
their love, but such as had given proof of their valor in three several
battles." 13 There arose a corollary belief that no man could fight well unless
inspired by the promise of his lady-love. Tristan said a man couldn't be a warrior unless he was a lover. Lancelot became invincible only
because Elaine gave him her sexual-symbolic love-token, a red silk sleeve as "sheath" for his "sword." Minnesinger Wolfram von Eschen
bach wrote of the love-trance that made a knight invincible, like a
berserker. Wolfram's Parsifal asserted that for every kind of spiritual aid,
including courage in battle, "it is better to trust a woman than God." 14 This Germanic Parsifal incorporated no Christian ceremony but
was written as if the church didn't exist. Parsifal's prayers were
addressed to his lady, who magically protected him in battle and gave him success as if she were a sacred agent of the ancient Lady of
Victory. He fought in a love-trance of communion with her spirit,
which made him virtually superhuman. 15 This pagan knight fought his own alter ego, a Christian knight who fell back before the onslaught of the "heathen man" made invincible
by his lady's love. "The heathen never wearied of love; his heart, therefore, was great in combat." When he cried the name of his
queen's dwelling place, "his battle strength increased." 16 For a while, certain sects of warriors undertook to defend the
beleaguered rights of women, in the name of the Goddess. From this
period dated romantic stories of knights who rescued "castles of women" from robber barons who had seized their property. About the 12th century, when the church began to arm its laws with the teeth of
the Inquisition, emphasis shifted from defense of women to defense of
the church. Sir Parsifal, or Perceval, presented a typical example of the pagan hero who finally turned Christian and renounced women.
At first he was a champion of Love; but later he was "purified," and described by an ecclesiastical writer as "one of the men of the
world at that time which most believed in our Lord Jesus Christ, for in
those days there were but few folks who believed in God perfectly."
Perceval set out to rescue "a gentlewoman which is disherited," but

changed his allegiance in mid-adventure, and renounced her as a seductress and witch. 17 Romantic literature reveals continual conflict between the min
strel's love-oriented philosophy and the church's anti-love attitude.
Churchmen said lovers became "vile" by forgetting God and making
the beloved woman a divinity. One priest said the bards "sinfully love women, whom they make into deities," and this was exactly the same as loving Satan. 18 Professor Huizinga noted that "from the side of
religion, maledictions were poured upon love in all its aspects." Yet the
poets insisted that "Love was a divine visitation, quelling mere animal
lust. . . . The lover, whose heart was rendered gentle by the discipline of
his lady, was initiate to a sphere of exalted realizations that no one
who had experienced such could possibly identify (as the church identified them) with sin." 19
Modern scholars have struggled to define the later stages of the
courtly-love movement, when the Meistersinger school was founded by men with the title of Frauenlob, "Lover of Women." The obvious
spirituality of the movement led some to interpret it as a sentimental
asceticism inspired by adoration of the virgin Mary. Yet some of the
minstrels' poetry was intensely even grossly erotic, focused on a real female body, not an ethereal vision. Scholars failed to understand
this combination of spirituality and carnality because they failed to
discover its historical root: the penetration of Europe by yet another
wave of Tantric sex-worship.
The most mysterious element in courtly love was the secret
technique of lovemaking known as drudaria, druerie, or karezza. It can only have been a western version of Tantric maithuna, the sacra
ment of coitus reservatus. This alone can explain its blend of erotic
and spiritual ecstasy. Significantly, one of the heroes of courtly love most revered as a model for poets was Tristan, who had reversed his
name and called himself Tantris for the secret understanding of his ladylove. 20 See Tantrism.
The poets kept their secret but obliquely referred to it when
defending themselves against charges of lechery. They claimed their aim was not selfish pleasure but only gratification of the lady. Montanhagol wrote, "A lover should on no account desire what would
dishonor his lady-love," probably meaning an unwelcome pregnancy. "Desire never had any power over me to make me wish her to whom
I have given myself aught that should not be. I would not reckon that a
pleasure which might debase her." Another poet said, "A true lover must seek the interest of his beloved a hundred times more than his own." 21
The poets were angered by certain ignorant men who copied
courtly-love behavior without understanding its basis. Men who pursued women for their own sexual satisfaction were regarded as
vulgar boors who "confounded everything by their behavior, which is no better than that of dogs." Men who didn't understand the true
862



initiation of love "adopted other maxims, which bring about shame."
Marcabru said scornfully, "If they call that drudaria, they lie." Arnaud Daniel claimed to have renounced the love of wealthy women, who knew only pleasures of the shameful sort. "From such love as moves me
are debarred those disloyal seekers of women who destroy courtli
ness." 22 Courtliness was synonymous with Minnedienst, the service of women who knew how to be served.25 Where did the bards learn of maithuna? Probably from several
sources. The gypsies practiced it, and gypsies infiltrated Europe from at least the 1 1th century on. 24 Even more influential was the Moorish
Saracen tradition emanating from Spain and the Middle East after
the crusades. Yoni-worship was preserved by such sects as the Sufis, whose "Sufi Way" involved a sexual initiation by a fravashi, an occult
love-priestess like the Tantric shakti. Sufi sages taught that a man can
find spiritual fulfillment only in love, realizing Woman as "a ray of
deity." The word Sufi contained "in enciphered form, the concept of
Love." Deciphered, it reduced by the Arabic numerological system to three letters: FUQ, meaning "that which is transcendent." 25
Under the same language system, the title of a singer was Ta Ra B, which picked up the Spanish suffix -ador and became "troubadour."
Thus the troubadours' worship of Love was a synthesis of pagan and Oriental themes, founded on the idea of Woman as the true source of benevolence. Troubadour Bernard de Ventadorn wrote to his be
loved: "Noble lady, nothing do I ask of thee but that thou shouldst
take me for thy servant. I would serve as one serves a good lord,
whatever reward I might gain. Behold, I am at thy command: sincere
and humble, gay and courteous. Neither bear nor lion art thou, to kill
me, as I here to thee surrender." 26 Gentleness and sensuality reigned
together in the mythical fairyland visited by Aucassin, a French romantic hero based on the Arabic "sultan of love," Al-Kasim. 27
Minnesingers worshipped their Goddess Minne as Love, but mocked the syncretism of Christian dogmas. Gottfried von Strassburg
wrote: "The very virtuous Christ is as yielding as a wind-blown sleeve;
he adapts himself and goes along whatever way he is pressed, as readily and easily as anyone could ask." 28 Wolfram von Eschenbach
parodied the pope as a eunuch named Clinschor ("Clergyman") who
offered his services to the devil. 29 Walther von der Vogelweide repri
manded the clergy for their condemnation of love:
Whoever says that Love is sin, Let him consider first and well:
Right many virtues lodge therein With which we all, by rights, should dwell. *
Minnesinger Konrad of Megenburg wrote a scathing satire which he presented in the form of a debate between Lady Church
(Mary-Ecclesia) and her servants, the clergy, who only pretended to serve her, but actually served her rival, Lady Avarice-and-Vainglory.

Romulus and Remus
Offspring of Rhea Silvia, nurslings of the Etruscan wolf bitch Lupa, these familiar twins were generally regarded as founders of Rome.
Remus was killed by his jealous brother, in a myth that placed fratricide at the beginning of Roman patriarchy just as the myth of Cain
and Abel placed fratricide at the beginning of Jewish patriarchy. 1 According to legend, the followers of Romulus were all men, having no right to own land under the old matriarchal law, forced to
marry Sabine property-owning women to acquire community standing and the sanguis ac genus, blood of the race, which was transmitted only on the female line. 2 Some said Romulus's men were criminals and
outlaws who could not participate in the sacred succession of clans. 3
They had to abduct Sabine women, to establish curiae (clans); but each clan continued to carry the name of its original ancestress.4 Roman writers claimed Romulus named the clans in honor of the Sabine women; but in fact the Latin clans had been named after their women for as long as anyone could remember. See Motherhood. Romulus himself was a patriarchal invention based on an ancient
feminine clan name: the Etruscan gens Romulia, the real founders of Rome. 5

Rosalia; Saint
I Patron saint of Palermo, a loosely Christianized Venus Rosalia, the
j pagan Goddess symbolized by the Holy Rose, a yonic symbol. The j usual virgin martyr myth was invented for Rosalia, but not even her
: bones were real. The osteologist Buckland studied Rosalia's relics and
I found them to be the bones of a goat. 1 Nevertheless, even after this
! discovery, the goat's bones retained an undiminished power to perform
j healing miracles that had been the speciality of Rosalia's shrine for
j many centuries.

Rosary
Rosary
Dominicans pretended that the rosary began with St. Dominic's "beatific vision" at the church of St. Sabina in Rome. Actually,
Christians copied the rosary from eastern pagans. Its real origin was
the Hindu japamak, "rose-chaplet," called the Rosary of the Mantras worn by Kali Ma. Its alternately red and white beads symbolized her
Mother and Virgin forms (see Gunas). The Rosary Upanishad said the sounds of her mantras were white, the bead-touchings were red. 1 Arab poets viewed both white and red roses as emblems of the female
principle, and called their rosaries wardija, "rose-garden." The same word in Latin, rosarium, described early rosaries associated solely with
the cult of the virgin Mary up to the 14th century. The Litany of Loreto calls Mary "Queen of the Most Holy Rosary." The German term Rosenkranz, "rose-wreath," was sometimes shortened to Kranz
lein, "little wreath," a symbol of virginity or "flower of maidenhead." 2
In the east, the flower-wreath represented sacred marriage, circling the "head" of the phallic god. 3
Like a portable prayer-wheel, the rosary was used everywhere to count repetitive prayers or mantras. Constant repetition of such
verbal charms was believed to bring about blissful after-life, automatic
ally. The Book ofthe Dead said the spoken formula of the rosary (in
Egypt hung with an image of Horus) was "a protection upon earth, and it will secure for the deceased the affection of men, gods, and the
Spirit-souls which are perfect. Moreover it acteth as a spell in Khert
Neter, but it must be recited by thee on behalf of the Osiris Ra,
regularly and continually millions of times." 4
Early Christians at first rejected rosaries and denied the efficacy of
constantly repeated prayers counted on the beads. Jesus said, "When ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that
they shall be heard for their much speaking" (Matthew 6:7). Despite
this Gospel directive, however, Christians eventually adopted the heathen custom of "vain repetitions" along with the heathen rose-wreath
Upanishads Buddhist scriptures representing the final stage in Vedic
thought, dealing with the philosophy known as Vedanta. The Katha Upanishad discusses
transmigration of souls, the nature of eternal life, the doctrine of maya, and an account of a visit to Yama, Lord of the Dead.
Book of the Dead Common name for the
collection of
Egyptian funerary papyri written between 1500 and 1350
B.C., including Vignettes, Hymns, Chapters, and descriptive Rubrics. Among the best
preserved, and most
typical, copies of the Theban Recension of the Book ofthe Dead is the muchstudied Papyrus of Ani.

itself, relating both to their own version of the Great Mother just as the Hindus related them to Kali Ma. To this day, the user of the rosary
appeals most often to Mary, imploring her to be present at his death, just as the Tantric sages implored Kali-Shakti.
Association of the rosary with death is still found in the archaic religion of Tibet, where rosaries sometimes had beads made of
human skull bone, recalling the rosary of skulls worn by Kali the Destroyer. In a remarkable parallel, Christian rosaries were some
times made of tiny skulls carved from bone or ivory. Many eastern
rosaries had a retaining bead formed like a vase, said to give birth to
the other beads. In the west, both the pagan Goddess and the virgin
Mary the primary object of rosary worship were known as the Holy Vase. 5
Mohammedan rosaries usually contained 99 beads, one for each ol Allah's miracle-working names (see Name). Smaller rosaries were
made of 33 beads, with 3 groups of 1 1 set apart by markers, probably in imitation of the Vedic tradition of 33 gods divided into 3 companies
of 1 1 each. 6 Arabs sometimes called the rosary Gulistan, the Rose
Garden, which was also the title of a mystical work by Sufi poet Saadi
of Shiraz, a Goddess-worshipper of the 13th century a.d. Europe's heraldic "gules," meaning red, came from the Arabic word for "rose." 7

Rose
The rosary was an instrument of worship of the Rose, which ancient Rome knew as the Flower of Venus, and the badge of her sacred
prostitutes. 1 Things spoken "under the rose" (sub rosa) were part of Venus's sexual mysteries, not to be revealed to the uninitiated. 2 The red
rose represented full-blown maternal sexuality; the white rose or lily
was a sign of the Virgin Goddess. Christians transferred both of these \
symbolic flowers to the virgin Mary and called her the Holy Rose.
Rose windows in Gothic cathedrals faced west, the direction of the
matriarchal paradise, and were primarily dedicated to Mary as the
female symbol opposing the male cross in the eastern apse. At Chartres, the window called Rose of France showed "in its center the Virgin in
her majesty Round her in a circle, are twelve medallions; four
containing doves; four six-winged angels or Thrones; four angels of a lower order, but all symbolizing the gifts and endowments of the Queen of Heaven." Beneath, the Marian number of five windows centered on Mary's mother, "the greatest central figure, the tallest and most commanding in the whole church." 3 Five was the Marian number because it was the number of petals! in the rose, and also in the apple blossom another virginity-symbol
866



giving rise to the five lobes of the mature apple, the corresponding Rose
symbol of motherhood, fruition, regeneration, and eternal life. Five was considered "proper to Marian devotion" because Rose-Mary was the ^^^mm^^mi^^^m
reincarnation of Apple-Eve. Christian mystical art showed apples and
roses growing together on the Tree of Life in Mary's "enclosed garden"
of virginity. The fivefold rose and apple were also related to numerous pre
Christian images of the Goddess, the witches' pentacle, the
five-pointed Star of Ishtar, and the Egyptian symbol of the uterine underworld and cyclic rebirth. Mysteries of the Rose belonged to
Aphrodite, according to the poet Nossis: "Anyone the Cyprian does not love, knows not what flowers her roses are." Aphrodite was repre
sented by a Rose-Mary plant, named for her as rosmarina, the Dew of the Sea.4
In the great age of cathedral-building, when Mary was worshipped as a Goddess in her "Palaces of the Queen of Heaven" or Notre
Darnes, she was often addressed as the Rose, Rose-bush, Rose-garland, Rose-garden, Wreath of Roses, Mystic Rose, or Queen of the Most
Holy Rose-garden. 5 The church, the garden, and Mary's body were all mystically one; for she was Lady Ecclesia, the Church, as well as "the
pure womb of regeneration." Like a pagan temple, the Gothic cathedral represented the body of the Goddess who was also the universe,
containing the essence of male godhood within herself. This was largely
forgotten after the passing of the Gothic period. In later centuries, "Gothic" became an epithet of contempt, synonymous with "barbarous." The symbolism of the Palaces of the Queen of Heaven was no
longer understood. By the 18th century, its secrets were as obscure as
the crypto-erotic art of the temples of India. 6 In fact it was in India that the Great Mother, whose body was
the temple, was first addressed as Holy Rose. 7 The "Flower of the Goddess" was the scarlet China rose. 8 This was sometimes identified
with the mystic Kula flower, source of a virgin's menstrual blood,
representing the life of her future children and her bond of union
with the past maternal spirit of her clan.9
The eastern World Tree was often envisioned as a family rose
tree, a female Tree of Life and Immortality. In central Asia the tree
was called Woman, the Wellspring, Milk, Animals, Fruits. "The Cosmic Tree always presents itself as the very reservoir of life and the
master of destinies." Mongols knew the tree as Zambu, whose roots
plunge to the base of Mount Sumer; it is the Mother-tree whose
fruits feed the gods. 10 Zambu was undoubtedly the same as the Hindu
paradise, Jambu Island, home of the cosmic Rose-Apple tree. The
island was shaped like a yoni. In its "diamond seat" (a symbolic clitoris), one could be reborn as a human being with keen intelligence. 11
Judeo-Christian tradition associated this tree of ancestors with a
male Tree of Life (genitalia), regarding male ancestry as the only important kind. The genealogy of Christ was depicted in medieval art as
867



Rose a tree-phallus rising from the loins of a recumbent Jesse, with its
flowers and fruit surrounding the figures of David, Mary, and Jesus.
Still, mystics generally assigned feminine gender to the rose-tree,
rose-garden, rose-wreath, etc., fully realizing that these were genital symbols. The medieval scholar Pierre Col said the Gospel of Luke
represented the Holy Rose as a sign of the vulva. 12 Britain had a traditional Mummers' dance known as The Rose:
five dancers formed a five-pointed star of swords over a victim, called
the Fool, who was symbolically slain and resurrected with a mysterious elixir, the Golden Frosty Drop, or Dewdrop in the Rose. This was simply a western version of the Jewel in the Lotus: i.e., a seminal drop
in the female flower. It is said the "
'garden' may symbolize the uterus, as 'scarlet flower' may signify the vulva." The Frosty Drop, or
dew, signified the semen of the God reincarnating himself in the Goddess. The Bible says dew was a poetic synonym for semen (Song of Solomon 5:2). Meister Eckhart understood quite well the sexual
significance of both dew and rose when he wrote, "And as in the
morning the rose opens, receiving the dew from heaven and the sun,
so Mary's soul did open and receive Christ the heavenly dew." 1? The dance called The Rose seems to have been a pagan ritual so
vital that it couldn't be suppressed. The accompanying chant was
"ring-around-the-rose-wreath"; in German, Ringel Ringel Rosenkranz; in English, Ring-Around-A-Rosy. 14 The "pocket full of posies" in the nursery rhyme probably referred to the cave of flowers, an old
symbol of the underground Fairyland. The final instruction, "All fall down," was the behest of Morgan the Grim Reaper, or Mother Death
bringing an end to the fertility season. According to Danish folk custom, roses decorated sacred groves for the dances of Midsummer
Eve, which had to be guarded by armed men against possible intruders:
Midsummer night upon the sward,
Knights and squires are standing guard; In the grove a knightly dance they tread With torches and garlands ofroses red. I5
The Rose was likened not only to Mary but to other surviving
forms of the pagan Goddess. As Spenser's Faerie Queene she had a
Bower of Bliss signifying her sexual nature, where the central holy of holies was the Rose of Love. 16 Medieval myths of Lady Briar Rose
pictured the Virgin as a rose in the midst of a thorn bush, a sexual
image established long ago by the poet Sedulius:
As blooms among the thorns the lovely rose, herself without a thorn, The glory of the bush whose crown she is, So, springing from the root ofEve, Mary the new Maiden Atoned for the sin of that first Maiden longago.' 7
No matter how consistently the Rose was assimilated to Mary, it
was obviously a sexual symbol of Goddess-worship brought back to
868



Europe from Arabia with the returning crusaders. 18 Sufi mystics in Rudra
Arabia wrote romantic-religious works centering on the rosary and the Rose. Fariduddin Attar's Parliament ofthe Birds explained the ^^^^^^^^^^^m
symbol in the words of the "passionate nightingale":
I know the secrets ofJove. Throughout the night I give my love call . . . It is I who set the Rose in motion, and move the hearts oflovers. Continuously I teach new mysteries. . . . When the Rose returns to the world in Summer, I open my heart to joy. My secrets are not known to all but the Rose knows them. I think ofnothing but the Rose; I wish
nothing but the ruby Rose. . . . Can the nightingale live but one night without the Beloved? ' 9
This Eros-nightingale reappeared in European romances as the Spirit of the Rose, or a "devil" named Rosier in the 17th century.
According to the exorcist Father Sebastien Michaelis, the devil
Rosier whispers sweet words that tempt men to fall in love. Rosier's
heavenly adversary was St. Basil, "who would not listen to amorous
and enchanting language." 20 Still later, the same devil became the hero
of the classical ballet Le Spectre de la Rose in which he tempts a
young girl to fall in love.
Sometimes the male Spirit of the Rose was a briar rose with
"pricking" thorns. "Pricking flesh to acquire blood artificially is the only way that men can 'produce' it. In the European romantic legend of two heterosexual lovers, the female red rose is paired with the male
briar, or 'prick.' Prick, when used as a slang, taboo name for the penis, is
a descriptive-magical term for access-to-power. . . . The briar is the male rose." 21

Rudra
Pre-Vedic "red god," a primitive form of Shiva, sometimes known as The Howler. 1 Both his redness and his howling link him with the death
by flaying of the sacrificial beings called Maruts, of whom he was the
founding ancestor. The Maruts became similar flayed gods or red gods
in the west e.g. Mars the red god, and his Phrygian counterpart
Marsyas, the flayed satyr, hung on a pine tree and sacrificed to Apollo.
Satyrs were goat gods, and goats were typical victims of flaying
sacrifices for atonement in Rome (e.g., the Lupercalia), Phrygia, Syria,
and Mesopotamia.
Rudra was also called Tryambaka, "He Who Belongs to Three Mother Goddesses." 2 Like Shiva after him, he seems to have been
offered to the original female trinity. Like Shiva also, he merged with
869



Runes her or them and became known as an androgynous Lord Who is Half Woman.' His name passed into Latin as "rude," meaning a primitive deity of
wild animals and woodlands, a typical satyr.4 Thus it might be said
that Rudra was the prototype of all the primitive Aryan gods of fertility and death.

Runes
The runic alphabet seems to have been invented by the "wise
women" of northern Europe. Runic letters appear first in the hands of
the Goddess Idun, keeper of the gods' magic apples of immortality. She gave runes to her consort Bragi by engraving them on his tongue;
thus he acquired the magic of words and became the first wizard-king
of skaldic poetry.
Odin received knowledge of the runes by his self-sacrifice, hanging
on the gallows-tree Yggdrasil for nine nights that is, for a nofnden, the traditional lying-in period for a woman in childbirth. In the old
myths, self-sacrifice or suicide was often demanded as the price of male acquisition of feminine wisdom. This also meant a journey to
paradise (Fairyland), and godlike immortality. Odin died to acquire the runes for men; but men were expected to
imitate his sacrifice, as Christian martyrs imitated that of Christ. If a
Norse hero couldn't die in battle, which would automatically make him a son of Odin, then he could commit a kind of hara-kiri by carving
the runes in his own flesh and bleeding to death. 1 In this manner Sigurd
Ring summoned the Valkyries to take him to Valholle: "Bravely he slashes Odin's red letters, blood-runes of heroes, on arm and breast." 2
The festal day of a hero's death thus became a "red-letter day,"
marked in red on runic calendars, as modern calendars still print
Sundays and holidays in red. Special sacrificial runes called geirs-odd were recommended for ceremonial suicide. These enabled the hero
to compose his own death-song in his final "inspiration" (literally, "breath"). Skaldic tradition associated poetry with blood. The Mead
of the Poets was also called the Sea of Odin's Breast, meaning the blood that flowed from his breast when he was pierced on the Rood. The nursery-rhyme figure of slain Cock Robin Redbreast descended from the folklore of the geirs-odd. Robin was the God of the
Witches, frequently identified with Odin, sacrificed in a sacred grove to Marian the Virgin, whom the Northmen called Maerin and wor
shipped with blood sacrifices at Trondheim as late as the 1 1th century. 3 Robin Redbreast appeared as a human martyr in an old Danish
ballad. He won the love of a bird-maiden (Valkyrie) by cutting slices of flesh from his breast for her, and she took him to paradise. "The
870



youth has now got his reward, safely has he won from harm; at night he Rusalki
sleeps full joyously within his truelove's arms." 4
The death song composed by Ragnar Lodbrok for himself presents ^^^^^^^^^^^
a pagan version of a runic epitaph, supposed to be sung by the bleeding man with his final breath, like the song of a dying swan;
indeed, runes and swan-princes were often associated. Ragnar sang, with a certain gallantry:
Cease, my strain! I hear a voice From realms where martial souls rejoice; I hear the maids ofslaughter call, Who bid me hence to Odin 's hall:
High seated in their blest abodes
I soon shall quaffthe drink ofgods. The hours oflife have glided by;
I fall, but smiling shall I die. 5
Knowing the runes of heathen alphabets were connected with
death charms and mysterious curses, Christians came to regard the
runes as devilish. They believed witches could cause death by
"casting the runes." But the original purpose of casting runes was
divination, in a system not essentially different from casting yarrow stalks of the I Ching, or casting "the lot of rods" in medieval churches,
or casting dice as magic knucklebones, or shuffling Tarot cards. The runes were scratched on wooden shingles or chips, like dice, and these
were thrown in certain patterns. The process of interpreting them was raedan, "reading"; the result was raedelsox "riddles." In old
fashioned usage, "reading" meant to solve a riddle.6 From the runes
came such English construction as "read me this riddle," and the use of
"reading" to mean fortune-telling.

Rusalki
Russian water witches and psychopomps, named after Mother Rus
sia; formerly her priestesses of rivers and springs. Rusalki were feared as
sirens who could lure men to a watery grave. Yet their old function as
fertility-spirits was not forgotten. During Rusalki Week at the beginning of summer, they would emerge from the waters by moonlight and dance. Peasants said "where the Rusalki trod when dancing, there the
grass grew thicker and the wheat more abundant." * They were the
same as the Wilis, Vilas, or Valkyries.

Sa Sa
Sabbat, Witches' Egyptian word for the holy blood of Isis, which made pharaohs and
other selected heroes immortal; counterpart of the Hindu soma, the
divine fluid of sovereignty and eternal life, manifested in many ways, but basically derived from the Goddess's menstrual blood. As the
Egyptian Great Mother's "wise blood," sa was said to contain the
spirit of all intelligence.

Sabazius
Phrygian serpent god identified with Attis, with Dionysus, and in the
first century B.C. with the Jewish Jehovah. 1 Plutarch said worshippers of the Hebrew God in Jerusalem called him also by the name of Sabbi. 2
Jews living in Asia Minor said their Jehovah was another form of Zeus
Sabazius. 5
Phrygians said the ancestor of their tribes was a great serpent who
lived in a Tree of Life in the primal garden; therefore they were
Ophiogeneis, "Snake-born people."4 Such pagan traditions led to the
Gnostic sects' confusion of Jehovah with the serpent in the garden of
Eden; sometimes one was the enemy of mankind, sometimes the other
(see Gnosticism). Some have suggested that the nocturnal rites of Sabazius gave rise
to the name of the Sabbat or Sabbath, for both Christians and pagans
(e.g. the "witches' sabbat"), but there were also other suggested origins for this lunar festival. Sabazius seems to have been just another form
of the ubiquitous serpent-deity who was the first companion of the Great Mother of the Gods.

Sabbat, Witches'
Some derive "sabbat" from the Moorish zabat, "an occasion of power," at which Berber descendants of north African "Amazons" still
perform sacred dances in groups of 1 3 the traditional number of the witches' coven for the 13 annual lunations. 1
The European sabbat or festival was fabricated largely by judges of
the Inquisition during the 14th and 1 5 th centuries, on a foundation of pagan precedents. Churchmen said witches held four Great Sabbats a year "in derision of the four annual festivals of the Church"; but the
church had copied these from the pagans in the first place. 2 They were:
(1) Candlemas Eve; (2) May Eve, or Walpurgisnacht; (3) Lammas Eve; and (4) Halloween. Some lists included Midsummer (the Feast of
874



St. John) and the solstitial festival on December 2 1 (the Feast of St. Sabbat, Witches'
Thomas). 3 Details were drawn from classical descriptions of Roman fertility ^^^^^^^^^^^m
festivals, such as the Bacchanalia, Saturnalia, Lupercalia, etc. At the ancient ceremony of purification for the New Year, in the Lupercal grotto where Lupa the She-Wolf was said to have suckled Romulus
and Remus, he-goats were sacrificed and youths were touched with the
blood; priests in raw goatskins struck women's hands with strips of
goatskin as a fertility charm; men and women exchanged clothing and
engaged in orgiastic sex. Late in the 5th century, this Lupercalia was adopted into the Christian calendar and renamed the Feast of Purifica
tion of the Virgin.4
Other pagan practices supposedly incorporated into the witches' sabbat included widdershins (counterclockwise) dancing in a ring, in
honor of the Moon-goddess; wearing masks; jumping over fires; sacrifi
cial feasting; worshipping trees, springs, and sacred stones; and
making lewd jokes and horseplay in a carnival atmosphere. Indeed the Carnival, or Feast of Fools, descended from pagan holidays when the
social order was temporarily reversed, and everything was done backward, a prototype of the "reverse Christianity" of the Black Mass.
The Saturnalia was still kept by medieval Christians in this manner:
The priests ofa church elected a bishop offools, who came in full pomp, placing himselfin the episcopal seat in the choir. High mass then
began; all the ecclesiastics assisted, their faces smeared with blacking, or covered with a hideous or ridiculous mask. During the course ofthe celebration, some of them, dressed like mountebanks or in women 's clothes, danced in the middle ofthe choir, singing clownish or obscene
songs. Others ate sausages or puddings from the altar, played at cards or at dice in front ofthe officiating priest, incensed him with the censer, or, burning old shoes, made him breathe the smoke. s
Such carnival clownishness was "simply the last form which the
Priapeia and Liberalia assumed in Western Europe, and in its various
details all the incidents of those great and licentious orgies of the
Romans were reproduced."6 However, certain authorities came to
perceive such revels as profoundly evil. In 1445 the Paris Faculty of
Theology called for reform, writing to the French bishops a puritanically shocked description of pre- Lenten customs: "Priests and clerks may be seen wearing masks and monstrous visages at the hours of office.
They dance in the choir dressed as women, panders or minstrels.
They sing wanton songs. They eat black puddings at the horn of the altar while the celebrant is saying Mass. They play at dice there.
They cense with stinking smoke from the soles of old shoes. They run
and leap through the church, without a blush at their own shame." 7
Copies of letters like this one, drawn from the archives, surely gave
the Inquisition's judges many ideas for details of the Sabbat that they
put in the mouths of their victims, and confirmed by torture. With only
875



Sad minimal imagination, a judge could reverse any ordinary church Sacred service and accuse his victim of kissing the devil's anus (instead of the
bishop's ring), eating children's corpses and drinking menstrual blood (instead of bread and wine), saying the prayers backward, making the sign of the cross with the left foot instead of the right hand, addressing
subterranean deities instead of celestial ones, and so on.
Weekly sabbats were supposed to be held on Friday, once a lunar "Eve" of the original sabbath, the day of Saturn or of Zeus Sabazius.
Friday was the day sacred to Venus-Freya, and after sunset it was the
Jews' sabbath day, both of which made it a bad or unlucky day in
Christian opinion. Friday the 13th was especially ill-favored.

Saci
"Power," title of the Hindu Goddess as the wife of Indra, who
received his essence of divinity from her. 1 She was probably related to the Egyptian Goddess as Sakhmis or Sekhmet, "the Powerful One,"
one of the titles of Hathor as the blood-drinking battle-goddess or divine
lioness, Lady of Victory. 2 The name Saci or Saki was also applied to the Arabic spirit of the Cupbearer who gave gods and men the wine of life, as Indra received the Goddess's blood-wine of sovereignty.
1 . O'Flaherty, 351. 2. Larousse, 36.
Sacred
Derivation of Latin sacer, which meant "untouchable" in the dual
sense of both holy and unclean. A sacer person or thing was set aside for
a divine purpose; it was taboo, dedicated to the other world, shunned
by ordinary folk because of its dangerous charge of spiritual mana. A case in point is the biblical story of Uzzah, who dared to seize the ark
of the covenant to keep it from falling off its oxcart. Though Uzzah's
intentions were entirely honorable, God struck him dead for touching
the sacer object (2 Samuel 6:3). Priests knew a special insulating charm whereby they could approach the Holy of Holies without deadly risk:
"When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash
with water, that they die not" (Exodus 30:20). This same insulating charm was used throughout the centuries in Catholic churches, where
people dipped their fingers in the stoup of holy water and made a self
protective sign of the cross. The biblical word "unclean" also meant sacer. Menstrual blood
and parturient women were "unclean" because filled with mysteri
ous, dangerous magic (Leviticus 15). Sacrificial victims, set aside for consumption by the gods, were sacer. Certain animals were "unclean"
876



except when eaten on ceremonial occasions, like the sacred bulls of Sacrifice
Egypt and the pigs of Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine. Lucian said the
pigs kept in the temple at Hierapolis were taboo in the typical ^^^^^^^^^^^
dualistic sense, both "unclean" and sacred. 1 Simple people everywhere
still demonstrate fear in the presence of whatever they consider
sacred: the common emotion Coleridge called "holy dread."
1. Crawley 1,1 14.
Sacrifice
Human or animal, the sacrificial victims of ancient cultures were
almost invariably male. Worshippers of Shiva sacrificed only male animals; the god himself ordered that female animals must never be
slain. 1 Males were expendable, for there were always too many for a
proper breeding stock. The same was true even of human sacrifices, which were men, not women. "The fertility of a group is determined by the number of its adult women, rather than by its adult men." 2 Therefore male blood
only was poured out on the earliest altars, in imitation of the female
blood that gave "life." That is why totemic animal-ancestors were more
often paternal than maternal. The animals' blood and flesh, ingested
by women, was thought to beget human offspring; and the rule was "Whatever is killed becomes father." 3 The victim was also god, and
king. Amazonian Sacae or Scythians founded the Sacaea festivals of
Babylon, where condemned criminals died as sacrificial surrogates for
the king, to mitigate the earlier custom of king-killing. The chosen
victim was a sacred king, identified with the real king in every possible
way. He wore the king's robes, sat on the king's throne, lay with the
royal concubines, wielded the scepter. After five days he was stripped,
scourged, then hanged or impaled "between heaven and earth," in a prototype of the crucifixion ceremony later extended to sacred kings
of the Jews. 4 The object of scourging and piercing was to make the pseudo-king shed tears and blood for fertility magic. 5 Babylonian scriptures said, "If the king does not weep when struck, the omen is bad for the year."6 The king or pseudo-king "became God" as soon as he was dead. He ascended into heaven and united himself with the
Heavenly Father, i.e., the original totem father, or first victim. 7
Probably the promise of apotheosis and privileged immortality induced victims to accept death willingly, even as the same kind of promise
attracted Christian martyrs.
When ritual murder of kings or human king-surrogates came to be considered crude and uncivilized, then animal victims took their
place. Ceremonies were invented to identify the animal with the man.
The Egyptians, for instance, "put off their dead with counterfeits, offered an animal to their gods instead of a man, but they symbolized
877



Sacrifice their intended act by marking the creature to be slain with a seal
bearing the image of a man bound and kneeling, with a sword at his ^^^^^^^a throat." 8
Pigs were often set aside as sacer victims in Egypt, India, and the
Middle East, which explains why their flesh was taboo to the Jews.
The sacrificial boar-god Vishnu had many western counterparts, such as
Ares, the boarskin-clad consort of Aphrodite, whose children Phobos
(Fear), Deimos (Horror), and Harmonia (Peace) may have represented the three stages of the sacred drama from the victim's point of
view.9
Meat was not to be wasted, so early theologians were anxious to
invent ways to pretend the sacrifice was politely offered to the deity,
while they actually kept it for their own consumption. The usual method was to offer the deity only inedible portions of the animal, or portions that couldn't be readily collected and used, such as blood.
"Kosher killing," draining the blood from a sacrificed animal, was not
a Jewish idea. It was a common Oriental method of offering the animal's blood to the Great Earth Mother while the worshipper kept
the meat for himself. 10 The Jews, like the Hindus, taught that the
animal's soul was in its blood (Leviticus 17:1 1).
Greeks assumed their gods resented being deprived of the best part
of the sacrifice, but they avoided guilt by blaming Zeus's ancient rival,
the titan Prometheus. When the first sacrificial bull was butchered,
Prometheus sorted it into a portion of bones concealed under fat, and another portion of meat hidden under the entrails, and invited Zeus to choose his portion on behalf of all the gods. Zeus chose the fat, and
later raged helplessly when he found he had been tricked. 11 But this became the standard fare for the gods, even Yahweh: "the fat of the
beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord"
(Leviticus 7:25). Jews were even more parsimonious with their offerings than the Greeks. Sometimes Yahweh didn't even get the fat of the beast. All
he got was a smell of it. Levite priests legalized the "wave offering," which meant the goodies were waved in front of the altar, then eaten
by the priests: "the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the
Lord . . . but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons' "
(Leviticus 7:30-3 1). The Jews however did retain a custom of human sacrifice, for
special occasions, longer than any other people in the sphere of influence of the Roman empire. 12 Out of this tradition arose the figure
of the dying Christos in Jerusalem.
Concerning the biblical concept of sacrifice, E.C. Stanton wrote: "The people have always been deluded with the idea that what they
gave to the church and the priesthood was given unto the Lord, as if the maker of the universe needed anything at our hands. How incongru
ous the idea of an Infinite being who made all the planets and the inhabitants thereof commanding his creatures to kill and burn animals
for offerings to him. It is truly pitiful to see the deceptions that have
878



been played upon the people in all ages and countries by the priests Saga
in the name of religion." n Saints

Saga
Literally, "speaking-woman" or "sayer," an ancient Norse Goddess in Asgard. 1 Her name also meant a priestess learned in sacred poetry,
charms, words of power. In the Middle Ages, saga or "female sage" became a synonym for "witch." 2

Saint Elmo's Fire
This electrical phenomenon, usually seen on shipboard, was formerly sacred to Helen, the Moon-goddess, or else to Hermes, god of magic. The French called it Feu de S. Helene, or Feu de S. Herme: Fire of
the Holy Helen or the Holy Hermes. In Spain it was known as St.
Helmes or St. Telmes fire, regarded as a form of witchfire, like the
Fata Morgana (marsh gas).
1 In fact it is a static discharge from points
such as masts and spars of a ship, or from the wings of earlier
airplanes. According to some sea stories, if one flame appears, it is Helen,
who presages bad weather; if two flames appear, they are Helen's brothers Castor and Pollux, who indicate that the weather will clear, and
also that even sea-myths demonstrate patriarchal bias. Other names
for the mysterious light are Corposant from Italian corpo santo, Christ's body St. Anne's Light, and even Saint Electricity. 2 Saint Elmo was entirely mythical. Some scholars claimed he was
the same as St. Erasmus of Syria, who was also mythical, his legend based only on a spurious "Acts" written three centuries after his alleged
martyrdom. It was claimed that he died of having his intestines
wound out of his body onto a windlass; therefore his symbol in sacred
art was a windlass. Through this tenuous link, he became a patron
saint of sailors. 3 But since he probably never existed at all, the point is
only academic.

Saints
Canonization of saints was a Christian extension of the ancient Greco
Roman custom of apotheosis (god-making), whereby mortals could become immortal and live forever in heaven through identification with
879



Saints a deity. The liturgy and forms of canonization were taken from the
pagans, including the ceremonial release of bird-souls to represent the
deified one flying to heaven to join the other immortals. 1
The canon of saints made Christianity in effect a form of polythe
ism, just as the similar system of multiplying bodhisattvas created a
Buddhist polytheism. Medieval Europeans wanted many deities, not one. Thus, in medieval churches, "the life of Christ fills a smaller
place and is told with far less complacence than are the lives of the
saints." 2 Much time and effort were expended to ascertain the right
saint or saints to answer any particular kind of appeal.
The mythical saints included numerous transformations of the Great Goddess under names that were only her various pagan titles,
in the same way as the Judeo-Christian God was called "Almighty" or "Ancient of Days" or "Lord." Among the sainted Goddess-names
were Mari, Marina, Margaret, Aphra, Venerina, Martina, Mary of Egypt, the Three Marys, Aphrodite, Demetra, and such title-names
as Irene, Philomena, Reine, Pelagia, Corona, Rosalia, Sophia, Eugenia, Viviana, Columba (Peace, Moon-lover, Queen, Sea, Crown, Holy Rose, Wisdom, Health, Life, Dove). 3 Diana Ilithyia was canonized as St. Yllis. Artemis became St. Artemidos. Keraunos the thunder-serpent became St. Ceraunos. Castor and Pollux were transformed into Sts. Cosmas and Damianus,
whose images replaced those of the pagan Heavenly Twins in their
healing shrine at Aegaeae. Sts. Sebastian and Hubert, patrons of archers
and hunting dogs, were once pagan Lords of the Hunt; so was St.
Eustace, allegedly converted by Christ who spoke to him from the horns
of a magic stag. 4 The sun god Helios became St. Elias. Gods and heroes like
Bacchus, Dionysus, Hyacinthus, Narcissus, Nereus, and Achilles were canonized under their own names. Mercury became a warrior
saint, supposedly sent from heaven to assassinate the emperor Julian, "the Apostate." Under his other name, Hermes, he was canonized by
the spurious passio of Pope Alexander I. The satyr-god Silvanus was
canonized, and called a son of the equally fictitious St. Felicity. 5 Even
Buddha became a Christian saint, disguised as St. Josaphat (Bodisat).6
As St. Aphra or Afra, Aphrodite appeared in the role of a repentant prostitute, embracing martyrdom to atone for her promiscuous behavior. She was quoted as saying, "My body has sinned, let it suffer." She was burned to death on an island in the river Lech meaning
that the Goddess's image was burned in its former Temple of Lechery.
A late absurdity was the canonization of the Goddess's Holy Vial
as an anthropomorphic saint, which one 18th-century historian referred to as St. Ampoule. 8
About the beginning of the 9th century, bones, teeth, hair, garments, and other relics of fictitious saints were conveniently
"found" all over Europe and Asia and triumphantly installed in the
reliquaries of every church, until all Catholic Europe was falling to its
880
7



knees before what Calvin called its anthill of bones.9 Martyrs' remains Saints
became extremely valuable, as Gibbon says: "The satisfactory experience that the relics of saints were more valuable than gold or precious ^^^^^^^^^^^^
stones stimulated the clergy to multiply the treasures of the church.
Without much regard for truth or probability, they invented names for skeletons, and actions for names." 10 Myths invented for the fictitious
relics of the evangelists provide typical examples. Some Venetian merchants pretended to find the bones of St. Mark
in Alexandria in 81 5. They brought their find home to Venice and
sold it to the municipal treasury. A great church was built over the bones
in the Square of St. Mark who was only associated with the city in
the first place because the original municipal totem was a lion, and the evangelist was assigned to the season of Leo in the pagan calendar. The bones remain in Venice to this day, for the fiction has not yet been
renounced. In like manner, the bones of "St. Matthew" were dug up in
Parthia at Hierapolis, and carried to a church in Salerno in 1080 a.d.,
at the height of the early saint-making fad. Matthew's legend was invented by Pope Gregory VII, who claimed to have learned by
divine inspiration of the apostle's travels through Egypt, Ethiopia, and other places, and of the miracles he worked to shame the poor magic of pagan magicians. 11 St. Luke was touted as one of the ancient world's
most prolific artists, to judge from the numerous portraits of the
Virgin, painted by him, that appeared in many churches. Some still
remain, despite ample proof that all such portraits were actually
painted during the Middle Ages. 12 Conversion of pagan gods and goddesses to saints usually accompanied the church's takeover of their shrines. An example is the
so-called Isle of Saints whose sacred inhabitants were not saints at all but
women called Gallicenae, former priestesses of the Gallic oracle.
Pomponius Mela, Latin geographer of the 1st century a.d., said they were "holy in perpetual virginity, said to be nine in number, with singular powers, so as to raise by their charms the winds and seas, to turn
themselves into what animals they will, to cure wounds and diseases
incurable by others, to know and predict the future; but this they do
only to navigators who go thither purposely to consult them." 15
Like pagan oracles and wise-women, sacrificial gods were also
converted into saints. The Blutritt (blood rite) of northern heathens was
easily transformed into a Christian ceremony by simple substitution
of the blood of Christ or the relic of a local saint, the former god. A
10th-century ecclesiastical decree in Westphalia ordered that "every
year, on the second day of Whitsuntide, with the grace of the Holy Ghost, ye shall bear the patron saint of your cloister church in a long
procession through your parochial district. . . . This processional will cause the seed of the fields to grow more abundantly, and the
harshness of the weather will be subdued." H
In the old shrines of Great Mother Cybele at Acrae in Sicily,
881



Saints rock-cut niches dating from the 3rd century B.C. sheltered numerous
figures of the Goddess, some dating from a much earlier period. After ^^^^^^^^^^^ Christian conquest of the area, the Goddess's figures became known as
Santoni, "saints," and are so called to this day. 15
Pseudo-saints often retained jurisdiction over those departments of
nature that they ruled as pagan deities. St. Medardus controlled the
rain, and during droughts his statue was drenched with water to
stimulate him to action. St. Caesarius of Aries was identified with
Boreas, god of the north wind. In the valley of Vaison his holy glove was
said to hold the air that let loose winds and storms, so his power
actually approximated that of Satan who was Prince of the Power of the Air. 16
The church that slaughtered the heathen for worshipping false
gods was itself guilty of worshipping false saints which, sometimes, were even the same deities as those of the heathen. This became so
obvious in the 8th century that the Synod of Leptinnes had to
prohibit the offering of sacrifices to saints instead of to God. 17
Christians surpassed their pagan ancestors in credulity, propagating
and believing saintly miracle-tales apparently without any limitations. Pope Gregory the Great wrote a book of saints' lives filled with
impossible feats. St. Honoratus for example halted in mid-air a giant boulder that was rolling down a mountainside toward his monastery
simply by making the sign of the cross at it. The monk Maurus walked on water, like Jesus and St. Peter. 18 In fact, the miracles
attributed to Jesus were negligible compared to the wonders performed by saints. Angobard wrote in the 9th century, "The wretched
world lies now under the tyranny of foolishness; things are believed by Christians of such absurdity as no one ever could aforetime induce the heathen to believe." 19
The church never lost sight of practical common sense on one point, however; saints were leading sources of its income, thanks to
the mandatory pilgrimage system, donations, and tithes. Gold, silver, and gems were collected to house and adorn the precious relics. An ecclesiastical chronicler of Trier related how the priests buried the
church's treasures to hide them from attacking Norsemen, "so that
the relics might not be mocked and jeered at by the barbarians." 20 Of
course the real fear was not mockery of the relics, but robbery of their valuable vessels.
Some genuine flesh-and-blood saints achieved their canonization by adding to the wealth of the church through trickery. A common
trick seems to have been manipulation of the popular belief in ghosts. St. Fridolin of Sakingen claimed for the church the property of a
deceased Count Urso, on the ground that Urso had promised it to the
church while receiving the last rites from Fridolin. But the property
had passed into the hands of Urso's heir, his brother Landolf, and there
882



was no document to prove Fridolin's claim. However, the saint won Saints
his case by summoning Count Urso himself to rise from the grave and
appear before the judges, testifying "in sepulchral tones" that Lan- ^^^^^^^^^^^m
dolf 's holdings must be turned over to the monastery. The unfortunate
Landolf lost not only his inheritance, but also his life. Fridolin
became the patron saint of Sakingen and was buried in the church he
built with the dead man's money. 21
The same thing happened in the case of St. Stanislaus the Martyr,
Bishop of Cracow, who managed some "very ample estates" belonging to a man named Peter. After Peter's death, his heirs claimed the
| estates, but the bishop refused to part with them. As he was unable to
show any documents of ownership, a court ruled in favor of Peter's
heirs. Then the bishop went to Peter's tomb, touched the body, and commanded it to rise and follow him to the court. The corpse then
"confirmed the statement of the bishop in every particular, and fearful as they sat the judges reversed their former decision." 22 The wily
saint kept the estates, doubtless contributing a share to whatever
accomplice it was who impersonated the dead Peter. Such miracles were more common than might be expected. The
same thing happened in the time of St. Augustine the Apostle of England, according to his biographer John Brompton. "St. Augustine had long been endeavoring to persuade a certain nobleman of great wealth to pay the appointed tithes, but out of obstinacy these were constantly refused, which did great mischief and caused others to
become discontented and impudently follow so bad an example." One
day during High Mass, St. Augustine directed all who were excom
municate to leave the church. A tomb in the crypt suddenly opened,
and a corpse came forth, explaining that it had been excommunicated
by a priest now dead. St. Augustine led witnesses to the dead priest's tomb, and asked why the revenant had been excommunicated. The
priestly ghost replied, in "a low, far-off" voice, "I excommunicated him for his misdeeds, and particularly because he robbed the church of
her due, refusing to pay his tithes." 25 Through this elaborate charade,
the saint was able to improve economic piety in the district.
The multitudes of phony or commercial saints are treated by
modern Catholic scholars with a rather amused tolerance, as if the
saint-makers' fantasies held something of the same charm as tales
invented by bright children. It is rarely admitted that these fantasies
were not intended to charm but rather to defraud. The saints were
made up to earn money for the church, and many of the made-up saints are still doing so, for the church refrains from publicizing their
spurious origins lest such publicity might disappoint the faithful which, translated, means the donations might cease.

Sais
Capital of Egypt during the 7th century B.C., where the Great Goddess (Isis-Neith) ruled supreme in her temple carved with the words later copied by the biblical God: "I am all that was, that is, and
that is yet to come" (see Revelation 1:8).' A thousand years later, the temple of the Goddess at Sais was taken over by Christians and
converted into a church of the virgin Mary.
1 . Larousse, 37.
Saki
Arabic "Cupbearer," based on the Hindu Goddess as Saci or Power, whose wine meant life and energy for all the gods. Saki was sometimes
female, like the Greek gods' cupbearer Hebe; sometimes male, like Hebe's replacement Ganymede, the boy lover of Zeus. According to Arabian symbolism, death came for each man when Saki turned
down his empty cup; his life was "drained to the lees."
Sakyamuni
One of the earlier incarnations of Buddha as "Sage of the Sakyas,"
bearing approximately the same relationship to the Buddha Siddhartha as King David to Jesus. Sakyamuni dwelling in heaven perceived that he would become incarnated again in the offspring of a queen of the
Sakyas, the role assigned to the Goddess Maya in the Buddha legend. 1 His semen was deposited by the god Ganesha.
1 . Larousse, 348.
Sala
Sacred cherry tree, symbol of virginity, under which the Virgin Maya gave birth to Buddha; celebrated in a similar Christian legend by the
Cherry Tree Carol. See Cherry. The "feminine" qualities of red
ness, roundness, and fruition made the cherry everywhere sacred to the
Goddess, along with other red fruits like the apple and pomegranate.
Salacia
"Salacious" Sea-goddess, Venus-Aphrodite worshipped in Rome as the feminine abyss "with fish-teeming womb." ' The name probably
was related to Greek Thalassa, "Sea," which also gave rise to the holy cry Takssio raised by wedding guests in honor of the Goddess of
884



Marriage, or maritare. Romans didn't know the origin of this wedding Salem cry but continued to use it nevertheless. 2 See Fish. Salome
1. Neumann, A.P., 6. 2. Rose, 192.
Salem
Semitic "Peace," with variations like Shalem, Shalom, Selim, Solo
mon, Shalman, Salmon, Shalmaneser. Jeru-salem was "the House of Peace," or of the god Salem, whose earlier city was ruled by
Melchizedek (Genesis 14), the "King of Light" called Melek or Molech in Phoenicia. "Peace" was the word spoken daily to the
dying sun, and also to the dying sacrificial victim who impersonated him
in the rites that "brought forth bread and wine" (Genesis 14:18). See
Lucifer.
Saliva
Both Mohammed and Jesus claimed to restore sight to the blind by
applying saliva to their eyes (Mark 8:23). This was an imitation of cures
previously attributed to priestesses of the Goddess. A clay tablet from
Nineveh says eye diseases could be cured by the mixed saliva and milk
of a temple harlot. Romans thought blindness could be cured by the
saliva of a mother of sons. As late as the 19th century, Italian folk
healers were still trying to cure blindness with the saliva and milk of
the mother of a premature child. 1 Notions of the wonderful curative power of female saliva may be traced back to Tantrism and its Chinese offshoot, Tao, whose
scriptures called women's saliva "a great medicine," one of the three
wonderful yin juices, the others being breast milk and menstrual
blood. 2
European pagan heroes also cured blindness with saliva so many of them that medieval churchmen had to say this was one of the
recognition signs for Antichrist. 3

Salome
The Bible presents the Dance of the Seven Veils as a mere vulgar
striptease performed by Salome to "please Herod" (Matthew 14:6-8). Actually, the Dance of the Seven Veils was an integral part of the
sacred drama, depicting the death of the surrogate-king, his descent into
the underworld, and his retrieval by the Goddess, who removed one of her seven garments at each of the seven underworld gates. The
priestess called Salome or "Peace" (Shalom) impersonated the de
scending Goddess, passing through seven gates in the temple of Jeru-salem which meant House of Peace. "Josephus records that the
885



Salt first name of the city was Solyma. Salma, or Salim, was evidently the Semite god of the rising or renewed sun; Salmaone was the Aegean goddess from whom he took his titles, as did Salmoneus the Aeolian." '
Salome represented Ishtar as the third of her three high priestesses or "Marys." Her name was a translation of the Greek Irene,
"Peace," the third of the sacred harlots called Horae. 2 She may have
been identical with the sacred harlot Mary Magdalene, or Mary of the Temple, whose so-called "seven devils" were the same underworld
gatekeepers to whom the temple dancer gave her veils. These veils,
like the rainbow veils of Maya, signified the layers of earthly appearances or illusions falling away from those who approach the central
Mystery of the deeps. Isis too had seven stoles with the same mystical
significance.
3
The dancing priestess was more than a trivial entertainer. Salome's
husband Joseph was killed after he lay with the queen, Mariamne or Miriam (Mary). 4 Salome was present with the virgin Mary the same Mary? at the birth of Jesus; some said she was the midwife who
delivered the holy child. 5 Salome was present with all three Marys at the
death of Jesus (Mark 15:40). Obviously she was also involved in the death of John the Baptist, which seems to have been not a murder but a
ritual sacrifice.
Some early Christian sects (the Mandaeans) ignored Jesus, and worshipped John the Baptist as the true sacrificed Christ. 6 An early
Greek epiphany hymn said it was the blood of John the Baptist that "bedewed" i.e., fructified the mothers and children of Jerusa
lem. 7 As an initiated Essenic prophet, John would have been sacer and
"chosen" to die as a surrogate for the king, whose blood was required
for fertility of the land. John was beheaded, a common form of sacrificial
death throughout the early Aegean and Levantine cultures, still practiced to this day in some of the eastern temples of the Goddess, though the victims are now animals instead of men. 8
Though only a fragment in its present form, the story of Salome presents evidence for the survival of the Tammuz-Ishtar cult in
Jerusalem, where someone periodically died in the role of the god, and the women raised the ancient lament for the victim in the temple
(Ezekiel 8:14).

Salt
One of the few substances known to the ancients that could preserve foodstuffs and dead bodies was salt. Egyptian mummies were preserved
in a brine solution called natron, "birth-fluid." Salt was accepted as a
substitute for the Mother's regenerative blood; it came from the seawomb and had the savor of blood. Therefore salt became a symbolic
886



instrument of kinship, like maternal blood. The Roman rite of confar- alt
reatio (patrician marriage) had the bride and groom share a cake of
flour and salt, which stood for flesh and blood respectively, and magically transformed them like those who in older times shared
real flesh and blood into blood kin, unable to harm one another. 1
The Arabs signified a similar bond of good faith by sharing a meal of bread and salt, which created the binding portion of any covenant.
The Bible speaks of a "covenant of salt" (Numbers 18:19) as one that cannot be broken, even when it is a covenant between man and God.
Salt was an acceptable substitute for blood also in dedicating an altar,
either Jewish or Christian (see Blessing). A common Semitic metaphor for enlightened seers was "salt of the earth," i.e., true blood of the Earth Mother. The term was applied to
Christ's followers (Matthew 5:31) to suggest that they could prophesy
truly. Christian uses of salt were copied largely from Roman pagans, who
used salt to bless every public sacrifice. "Immolate" came from mola,
the flesh-and-blood-symbolic combination of salt and flour prepared by the Vestal Virgins to sprinkle over every beast that was led to
sacrifice. 2
Church bells were solemnly anointed with salt and water, wiped
with linen, blessed, and christened. God was requested to give the
bells power to dispel demons by their sound, and to send thunder and
lightning far away from the vicinity of the church though bellringing was never very successful in the latter endeavor, since church
bell-towers were struck by lightning more often than any other
structure. 5
Christian infant baptism often involved rubbing the infant with salt
to repel demons. It was said that heretics carefully rubbed the salt off. 4
Superstitious fear of spilling salt was directly related to the idea of
spilling blood. Throwing a pinch of salt over the shoulder to take off
the curse was a symbolic way of putting bloodshed "behind," or turning one's back on it.
Natural salt pillars in the vicinity of the Dead Sea proved profitable to enterprising medieval Saracens, who learned that Christians would
pay good money to be guided to the exact spot where "Lot's wife"
stood, to behold a biblical miracle with their own eyes. Eroded by
wind, the salt pillars often assumed fantastic shapes. One may well have
been shaped like a woman; if not, a few touches of the chisel could
make it so.
Cabalistic tradition suggests that the biblical Lot's wife was really a
form of the Triple Goddess. Hebrew MLH, "salt," is a sacred word
because its numerical value is that of God's name of power, YH WH,
multiplied three times. 5 The same word is also a root of Malkuth, the
cabalistic Queen Mother Earth.

Samjna Samson
Samjna
Hindu "Sign," "Letter," or "Name"; title of the Goddess as inventor
of writing and pictographic alphabets; also a title of the moon. 1 See Motherhood.
1.0Tlaherty,352.
var. Samuel Sammael
"Dread Lord," Semitic version of the Asiatic Sama, Samana, or
Samavurti, "the Leveller," Judge of the Dead, identified with the underworld king Yama. 1 The Sama Veda called him a storm god,
clothed in black clouds. 2 Like his later incarnation Satan, he was Prince
of the Power of the Air; also the Celtic god of Samhain, the Feast of
the Dead, Christianized as All Souls. Medieval Gnostics were accused
of worshipping his as Sammael or Satanael.
In Britain he had a feminine counterpart, Samothea (Death
Goddess), queen of the mysterious land of the Hyperboreans, where Pythagoras traveled to learn the arts of letters, astronomy, and science from this all-wise lady. 3 She seems to have been another form of
Skadi or Scatha.

Samson
Hebrew version of the sun god called Shams-On in Arabia, Shamash
in Babylon, identical with Egypt's Ra-Harakhti and Greece's Heracles.
Samson's lion-killing, pillar-carrying, and other feats were copied
from the Labors of Heracles, signifying the sun's progress through the zodiac. Samson's "mill" was the same as Omphale's wheel, to which
Heracles was bound. His loss of hair meant the cutting of the sun god's rays, in the season when he became weak. As Heracles was controlled by Omphale, and Ra was "made weak"
by Isis, so Samson was deprived of his strength in due season by
Delilah, "She Who Makes Weak." Another interpretation of her name
was Lily of the Yoni, that is, the female principle that deprived the
phallic god of strength by drawing his "rays" or energy into herself.
Hair-cutting was a common mythic symbol of castration, since phallic power was supposed to reside in a man's hair, according to ancient
eastern beliefs. 1 The castrating priestess Delilah was a Semitic copy of
Heracles's deadly consort Deianira, the instrument of his destruction.
Blinding, also, meant putting out the "phallic eye." Talmudic tradition viewed Samson's "grinding" in Philistia as a
symbol of fornication suggesting a sacred-king cult in which a strongman assumed the role of the sun hero, deflowered all the virgins
until his strength was gone, then faced castration and sacrifice. 2 It has
888



been supposed that Samson's wrecking of the Philistine temple stood for Sanguis ac Genus

Sapientia
Latin "Lady Wisdom," corresponding to the Greek Sophia, the Gnostic Goddess worshipped by Hermetists, alchemists, cabalists, and medieval "philosophers" whose doctrines were disguised heresies. In
fact Sapientia was sometimes represented as "the Siren of the Philosophers," pouring the red-and-white wines of enlightenment from her
breasts, rising from the sea like a crowned Aphrodite. 1 Renaissance mystics depicted Sapientia as the Shakti of God, identifying her sometimes with the virgin Mary, sometimes with Mother Nature, sometimes with God's "inner mind" or Goddess
Within (I-dea). She was described as God's wisdom; indeed, as "all
the wisdom he had." 2 Spenser said Sapientia dwelt in God's bosom, as
his spouse, "the sovereign darling of the Deity, clad like a Queen in royal robes." She was described as "the basic and primordial foundation
of all things ... the being, life, and light of intelligible things," and a
Triple Goddess: Sapientia creans, the Creatress; Sapientia disponans, "who unites all things in harmony"; and Sapientia gubernans, "otherwise known as Divine Providence." 5
The Christian writer pseudo-Dionysius credited Sapientia with
creation itself, calling her "Thou unbegun and everlasting Wisdom,
the which in thyself art the sovereign-substantial Firsthood, the sover
eign Goddess, and the sovereign Good." 4

Sappho
Poet-priestess of Lesbos, the "isle of women" dedicated to the
Goddess. Once married, mother of a daughter Cleis, Sappho devoted her later life to the love of women. She was called the Tenth Muse
and revered even above Homer; but only fragments of her work remain because her books were later burned. See Lesbians.
Sarah
"Queen," also rendered Sarai, Sara, Serah, Serai. Persian forms
referred to a matriarchal government, evolving into "temple of women," seraglio, or harem. 1 Sarah was the maternal goddess of the "Abraham" tribe that formed an alliance with Egypt in the 3rd millenium b.c. 2 This was
the real meaning of the embarrassing biblical story about Abraham's
pimping for his wife (Genesis 12). According to Jewish tradition, Sarah ranked higher than her husband, and her death brought "confusion" to a nation that was in good order while she lived. 3 She was
interred in the holy cave of Machpelah, a womb-necropolis of the Goddess of the Anakim. Votive idols in this cave were later adopted
by the Jews and called by the names of deified ancestors: Sarah,
Abraham, Isaac, Rebekah, Leah, and Jacob. 4

Sara-Kali
"Queen Kali," the Goddess worshipped by gypsies, who came
originally from Hindustan. Some gypsies appeared in 10th-century Persia as tribes of itinerant dervishes calling themselves Kalenderees,
890



"people of the Goddess Kali." ! A common gypsy clan name is still Sara-Kali
Kaldera or Calderash, descended from past Kali-worshippers, like the
Kele-De of Ireland.2 ^^^^^^^^
European gypsies relocated their Goddess in the ancient "Druid Grotto" underneath Chartres Cathedral, once the interior of a sacred mount known as the Womb of Gaul, when the area was occupied by
the Carnutes, "Children of the Goddess Car." Carnac, Kermarjo,
Kerlescan, Kercado, Carmona in Spain, and Chartres itself were named
after this Goddesss, probably a Celtic version of Kore or Q're,
traceable through eastern nations to Kauri, another name for Kali. 3
The Druid Grotto used to be occupied by the image of a black
Goddess giving birth, similar to certain images of Kali. 4 Christians
adopted this ancient idol and called her Virgo Paritura, "Virgin Giving Birth." Gypsies called her Sara-Kali, "the mother, the woman, the sister, the queen, the Phuri Dai, the source of all Romany blood." They
said the black Virgin wore the dress of a gypsy dancer, and every
gypsy should make a pilgrimage to her grotto at least once in his life.
The grotto was described as "your mother's womb." A gypsy pilgrim was told: "Shut your eyes in front of Sara the Kali, and you will know
the source of the spring of life which flows over the gypsy race." 5
A gypsy prayer to the Goddess demonstrates her Kali-like trinity of
Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer:
Thou destroyest and dost make everything on earth; thou canst see
nothing old, for death lives in thee, thou givest birth to all upon the
earth for thou thyselfart life. . . . Thou art the mother ofevery living
creature and the distributor ofgood; thou doest according to thy
wisdom in destroying what is useless or what has lived its destined time; by
thy wisdom thou makest the earth to regenerate all that is new. . . . [TJhou are the benefactress ofmankind. 6
Sara-Kali was also known as Bibi, "the Aunt," a Destroyer
Crone corresponding to Russia's Baba Yaga. Like the Kalika who
created fatal illnesses, Bibi "has the power to cause all kinds of
disease, especially at the beginning of a new month when there is a full moon." 7 Bibi dressed in red, recalling the red-clothed Kali at the final
dissolution of the world when her garment is made of "a red mass of
blood" from all the gods she devours. 8 As Kali's dakinis identified
themselves with the Destroyer at ceremonies of death, so gypsy women
wore red for funerals.9
Gypsies also used the Indo-Egyptian Yoni Yantra (triangle) as a sign for "woman," practiced Tantric sexual rites like those of the east,
and believed in reincarnation according to Hindu doctrines of karma
governed by the Goddess. The gypsy said, "The sands of truth will
deposit me on the bed of earth from which I came. . . . [Njaked, I shall return to the womb of my mother." 10
Some gypsies insisted that Sara-Kali was Queen of Heaven and
Earth. According to a secret tradition, all the cathedrals in France
were arranged to form an earthly reflection of the constellation Virgo,
891



Sarama Sara-Kali's true home in heaven. 1 ' After being semi-Christianized,
Saranyu gypsies identified Sara-Kali with the virgin Mary. Gypsies celebrated th
^^^^^^^^^^ Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin by piling up the heads
of sacrificed fowls in front of her church, as Kali's votaries in India piled
up the heads of sacrificed animals. 12
Further Christianization inspired legends to provide Sara-Kali witl
a Christian background. Some claimed she was not a mother goddess
but a saint, the patron saint of the gypsy people. She accompanied the three Marys from the foot of Jesus's cross on their sea voyage to the west. They landed at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer. Another story said
Sara-Kali was a gypsy queen from the Rhone delta, who swam from
Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer to meet the boat carrying Mary Salome,
Joseph of Arimathea, Mary and Martha and their brother Lazarus, and other Christian celebrities, whose bones were displayed at the site
throughout the Middle Ages. 15

Sarama
Vedic bitch-goddess, mother of the brindled Dogs of Yama, who were westernized first as the Celtic Hounds of Annwn and then as the
Christian Hounds of Hell. 1 Sarama was the eastern form of the
Huntress, known in classical mythology as Artemis, Diana, or Hecate.
(See Dog.) Like other Huntress-figures she symbolized the deathdealing function of the Goddess who implacably hunted down all whos
time of dissolution had come, according to the cycles of karma.

Saranyu
The Vedic Goddess as a mare, mother of the Asvins or centaurs. Her
western counterparts were Leukippe, Melanippe, Epona, or Mareheaded Demeter. (See Horse.) Saranyu also gave birth to Yama and Yami, the Lord of Death and Lady of Life, when she occupied the form of a woman instead of a mare. According to one story, Saranyu created a shadow-woman exactly like herself, and left this simulacrum with her husband while she departed in the form of a mare. When
her husband Vivasvat realized the deception, he turned himself into a
stallion and followed her, as Poseidon became a stallion in order to
mate with Mare-headed Demeter. However, Saranyu's mating took
place in a peculiar way. Vivasvat spilled his semen on the ground, and Saranyu snuffed some of it into her nostrils. In this way she became
pregnant, and later gave birth to the physician-gods, the Asvins, from
892



iher mouth. 1 The myth evidently came from an early period when the Sarapis
(mechanism of impregnation was thought to be variable and the orifice of birth not always exclusively genital. ^^^^^^^^^^^^

SarapiS Var. Serapis
i Syncretic god worshipped as a supreme divinity in Egypt to the end of the 4th century a.d. The highly popular cult of Sarapis used many trappings that were later adopted by Christians: chants, lights, bells, vestments, processions, music.
Sarapis represented a final transformation of the savior Osiris into a
monotheistic figure, virtually identical with the Christian God. The
(religion of Sarapis was founded in the 3rd century B.C. by Ptolemy Soter ((Ptolemy the Savior), the Macedonian pharaoh who identified him
jself with the deity in traditional pharaonic style.
1 This Ptolemaic god
(was a combination of Osiris and Apis, called Osarapis, or Sarapis. As
Christ was a sacrificial lamb, so Sarapis was a sacrificial bull as well as a
god in human form. He was annually sacrificed in atonement for the
[sins of Egypt, with the words: "If any evil be about to befall either those
who now sacrifice, or Egypt in general, may it be averted on this head." 2
In his later development, Sarapis picked up the qualities of every Egyptian deity and became both Father and Son, ruler and victim.
He was called lord of Death, Good Shepherd, creator, healer, sun,
fertility god, impregnator of the Goddess his image carried in holy
processions was a huge phallus. His greatest temple, the Sarapeum at Alexandria, was a cathedral of pilgrimage and medicine. The philosopher Demetrius of Phalerum testified that Sarapis had cured him of
blindness; his paeans to the god were still sung as hymns centuries later. 3 Alexandrian psalms declared: "There is only one Zeus Sarapis."4
Sarapis became a great patron of arts and letters. The Sarapeum included a vast library of literary treasures from all over the Roman
empire, a storehouse of contemporary learning. When Christianity came to power in Alexandria, the library was attacked, though it was desperately defended for three years. 5 Finally, in 389 a.d., Theodosius gave a direct order that the building must be wrecked and the books
burned. Christians therefore destroyed the Sarapeum and its library,
thus eliminating most of the ancient world's important literature in
one holocaust.6
The "deceased" pagan god was later assimilated into the canon as
an artificial saint or saints. Among several Egyptian St. Sarapions, the
most notable was called a companion of St. Anthony, but a legend of his
martyrdom was constructed from the destruction of Sarapis's temple.
The late official canonization of St. Sarapion at the end of the 19th
893



Sarasvati century was based on an ecclesiastical literary hoax, the "discovery"
Satan of some texts alleged to be copies of material in the lost Sarapean
^^^^^^^^^^ library.7

Sarasvati
"Flowing One," the Vedic river goddess whose water conferred
divinity on kings when it was used in their baptism. Sarasvati was also
the Queen of Heaven assimilated to Brahmanism as Brahma's wife, a
combination that suggests the biblical A-brahm and Sara(h). Sarasvati
really predated the cult of Brahma. She was said to have invented all
the arts of civilization: music, letters, mathematics, calendars, magic, the Vedas, and all other branches of learning. Sometimes she bore the
name of Savitri, listed by some scholars as a male god, even though
ancient records called Savitri "wife of Brahma" and "Daughter of the
Sun." 1 Frequently she was identified with the holy waters of Ganges.

Sargon
King of Akkad (now northern Iraq), 2241-2186 B.C.; a typical god
king, born of a "virgin bride of God" or temple maiden, secretly placed in a basket of rushes and sent away on the river to foil the incumbent
king who wished to kill him; drawn forth by a magical personage, the
Water-Drawer or midwife-goddess Akki; raised in seclusion in the
wilderness; returned to the court in triumph to marry the Goddess Ishtar and rule her lands. 1 Many other hero-myths were based on the ]
details of Sargon 's story.
l.Jobes,375.
Satan
Like all so-called devils, Satan began as a god. Early Egyptians called him the Great Serpent Sata, Son of the Earth, immortal because he was regenerated every day in the Goddess's womb. A man could become '
immortal, like Sata, by repeating prayers to identify himself with the
god: "I am the serpent Sata, whose years are infinite. I lie down dead. I I am born daily. I am the serpent Sata, the dweller in the uttermost parts
of the earth. I lie down in death. I am born. I become new, I renew
my youth every day." 1 Sata seems to have been an underground aspect of the sun, Horus-s
Ra, corresponding to Apollo's underground serpent-form Python,
whom the Jews called Apollyon, Spirit of the Pit. He was a phallic
894



consort of the archaic Goddess Sati, or Setet, whose name was the Satan
same as that of a virgin aspect of Kali, and who once ruled Upper Egypt
which was known as the Land of Sati. 2 The god was also called Set ^^^^^i
the biblical Seth, who may not have been immortal but did manage to
live 912 years (Genesis 5:8). The snake's communion with the life-giving fountains of the deep
was still an important image in dynastic times, when Sata became the
keheret-snake, living in a yonic orifice in Isis's temple and giving oracles, like Python at Delphi. It was felt that disasters would strike the
country if the serpent should leave the Goddess's sacred hole. 5
The serpent was often a symbol of the sun god's alter ego, the
Black Sun, spirit of night or of death. He combined with the solar disc
as the god during his dark hours. The pattern was the same in Osiris
Set, Apollo-Python, Anu-Aciel, Baal-Yamm, etc. The dark god was
the light god's adversary not because he was originally viewed as evil,
but because he represented a sleeping or quiescent phase of the same
god. Sata dwelling forever in the underworld reappeared in Russian folk
tales as the great underground serpent Koshchei the Deathless. 4 In
his "adversary" role he eventually became the immortal Dragon whom the sun-hero had to slay, as men wished to slay the spirit of death
dwelling within their own bodies, the archetypal "betrayer" who led them sooner or later to destruction.
To the Hebrews, a "satan" was an adversary in the sense of a
judge: one who tested the faith of another by asking trick questions or
posing problems to be solved. The "satan" first appears in the Bible as
one of the sons of God, advising God to test the faith of Job (Job 1:6).
In the original wording, Satan was one of the bene ha-elohim, sons of
"the gods"; but Bible translators always singularized the plurals to conceal the fact that the biblical Jews worshipped a pantheon of
multiple gods. 5 This "son of God" was identified with the lightning-serpent Lucifer by the words of Jesus, who claimed to have seen Satan
descending into the earth as lightning (Luke 10:18). This repeated Persian myths concerning Ahriman, the lightning-serpent cast from heaven to the underworld by the god of light. Persians held that God
and the Great Serpent were twin brothers, an idea that entered into
Gnostic tradition and led to medieval magic books that called upon
Satan by the mystic names of God, such as Messias, Soter, Emman
uel, Saboth, Adonai (Messiah, Savior, Immanuel, Lord of Hosts, the
Lord). 6 Satan not only answered to God's names, he even assumed a
divine appearance when he wished. The medieval church insisted
that Satan "transfigures himself into an angel of light," so anyone claiming an unofficial angelic vision could be charged with devil
worship at the discretion of inquisitors who, naturally, always knew the difference between a real angel and a devil in angelic disguise. 7
895



Sati Islamic writers called Satan Shaytan, or Iblis. He governed the race
oidjinn, the "genies" who were once ancestral spirits, like the _^^^^^^^^ Roman genius. The djinn scorned Allah's prophets, so an army of
angels attacked them, killed many, and took the rest prisoner. Among
the prisoners was Iblis-Shaytan, also called Azazel, to whom the Jews
used to offer scapegoats on the Day of Atonement. Iblis-Shaytan had rebelled against Allah when Allah created Adam and ordered all the
angels to worship his creation. Allah says in the Koran, "We said
unto the Angels, Worship ye Adam, and they worshipped except Iblis who was of the Jinn."8
The background of this story may have come from the early Gnostic Gospel ofPhilip, which the church censored for obvious
reasons: "Human beings make gods, and worship their creation. It
would be appropriate for the gods to worship human beings!
"9
Satan's worst offense seemed to be that he was not disposed to respect
man, whose faults he well knew; nor did he have any good to say of
God, who had governed heaven too harshly and stimulated rebellion.
Medieval Christians interpreted everything apart from their own
orthodoxy as a manifestation of Satan-worship: astrology, magic,
pagan ceremonies, divination, etc.
Service ofSatan is everything dealing with paganism, not only the sacrifices and the worship ofidols and all the ceremonies involved in
their service, according to the ancient custom, but also the things that have
their beginning in it. Service ofSatan is clearly that a person should follow astrology and watch the positions and motions ofthe sun, the
moon, and the stars for the purpose oftraveling, going forth, or undertaking a given work, while believing that he is benefited or harmed by their motion or their course; and that one should believe the men
who, after watching the motions ofthe stars, prognosticate by them. w

Sati
Kali as the dangerous Virgin Bride of India's svayamara ceremony.
The same name was applied to Egypt's similarly archaic Virgin Huntress, once the ruler of the first nome of Upper Egypt, called "The
Land of Sati." Her holy city was Abu, the City of the Elephant (the
Greeks' Elephantine), where she was worshipped in conjunction with the elephant god, who also mated with the Hindu version of Sati under
her "magic" name of Maya, to beget the Enlightened Son of God, Buddha. 1
India still has pilgrimage centers known as Footprints of Sati, memorials of the time when the Goddess walked on earth. 2

Saturn Saturn
Roman name for Cronus, the primitive earth god associated with
Great Mother Rhea and credited with her own Destroyer function of mmh^hmmmmmm devouring her own children. Saturn was the same as the Black Sun
(Aciel) of Chaldean astrologers, the Lord ofDeathjit the nadir of the underworld, representing the sun at his lowest aspect in the midwinter solstice. Sometimes he was called Sun of Night.
At Harran, near old Edessa in what is now Turkey, Saturn's
worship included the wearing of black clothing, and burning candles made of incense, opium, goat's fat, and urine, with the prayer: "Lord,
whose name is august, whose power is widespread, whose spirit is
sublime, O Lord Saturn the cold, the dry, the dark, the harmful . . .
crafty sire who knowest all wiles, who art deceitful, sage, understand
ing, who causest prosperity or ruin, happy or unhappy is he whom thou makest such." '
As a rule the Lord of Death was both a god and a demon, like
Shiva the Destroyer. He was the negative side of the summer sun,
propitiatedJajnidwinleiiso he might allow spring tocomejgain. This important festival became the Roman Saturnalia, which contributed many of its customs to Christmas. At Saturn's festival, death and
atonement were featured as well as joyous celebration of the sun's
new birth.
A sacrificial victim was chosen to represent both the god himself
and the king-surrogate. He was slain and sent to the underworld to
merge with his divine counterpart. "It was the universal practice in ancient Italy, wherever the worship of Saturn prevailed, to choose a
man who played the part and enjoyed all the traditionary privileges of Saturn for a season, and then died, whether by his own or another's
hand, whether by the knife or the fire or on the gallows-tree, in the
character of the good god who gave his life for the world." 2
Though the real killing of the victim was gradually replaced by symbolic killing, the festival was never abandoned, and in Christian times it became part of the midwinter Carnival. "The mock execution
of King Carnival is a vestige of the ancient Saturnalia, when the man who had acted as king of the revels was actually put to death at the end
of his reign. This practice continued in parts of the Roman army well into Christian times." 3
Saturn gave his name to Saturday, the sabbath of the week's end,
before the coming of the new sun on Sun-day (Latin dies soli's). To the Jews this was the seventh day when God "rested," like Saturn
quiescent in darkness before the sun rose again. Saturn was identified
with the seventh planetary sphere, whose astrological influences partook of "saturnine" qualities such as somberness, heaviness, darkness,
passivity, coldness, etc. The Babylonian name of the planet Saturn was Ninip, which was also a name of the underworld god: "the black Saturn, the ghost of the dead sun, the demoniac elder god." 4 But Saturn was not altogether
897



Savior demoniac. Like most chthonian deities, he was ambiguous. He was
often revered as a healer. Our medicinal symbol Rx began as the planetary sigil of Saturn, which was often written on paper and eaten
as a cure for disease. 5

Savior
Greek Soter, "Savior," was often affixed to the name of a god or
divine king, e.g., Dionysus Soter, Antiochus Soter. Its literal meaning was "one who sows the seed," i.e., a phallic god, like Rome's Semo Sancus Holy Seed consort of Mother Earth. 1 After sowing or plant
ing, the Soter was "born again" in the new grain as a Divine Child,
and his advent was hailed with the formula, "He is risen." 2
It was usual for the Savior to sow his "seed" three times, like the
Persian Messiah who spilled his seed three times into the womb of
Mother Earth (Hvov). 3 At Eleusis the savior Iasion bore the title of
Triptolemus, "Three Plowings," ostensibly because he lay with Mother Demeter "in a thrice-plowed field"; but the field was Demeter
herself, as Mother Earth, and the Savior was the plow. 4 Ptolemy, the
royal name of the Macedonian line of Egyptian pharaohs, meant
"plower" or "sower," like the Greek Soter. 5
Since most kings were gods made flesh, many bore the title of
Savior. Antiochus Soter (Antiochus the Savior) ruled Babylon from
280 to 260 b.c, and was identified with the sacrificial god Nabu,
"exalted Son, powerful leader of the gods." 6 In 48 B.C., Julius Caesar was hailed as "God made manifest and universal Savior of human life."
His successor Augustus was "Ancestral God and Savior of the whole human race." 7 The emperor Nero was immortalized on his coins as "Savior of Mankind." 8 Roman emperors were routinely deified and
made "saviors," as shown by the address prepared for the birthday celebration of Augustus in 9 b.c.
This day has given earth an entirely new aspect. The world would have gone to destruction had not there streamed forth from him who is now
born a common blessing. Rightly does he judge who recognized in this birthday the beginning oflife and ofall the powers oflife. . . . The providence which rules over all has filled this man with such gifts for the salvation of the world as designate him the Savior for us for the coming
generation: of wars he will make an end, and establish all things worthily. By his appearing are the hopes ofour forefathers fulfilled: not only has
he surpassed the good deeds ofmen ofearlier times, but it is impossible that one greater than he can ever appear. The birthday of God has brought to the world glad tidings that are bound up in him. From this
birthday a new era begins. 9
Such speeches were often copied by followers of less exalted
898



"saviors," of which the early Christian era had many, especially in the
Middle East. "Palestine was seething with eschatological (i.e., salva
tional) movements. . . . [T]he emergence of the Christian sect was
anything but an isolated incident." One of the greatest problems of
early Christianity was to decide what the savior was supposed to be
saving humanity from. Among the many theories put forth were: Christ saved mankind from (1) death, or (2) sin, or (3) demons, or (4)
the fleshly world and its evil demiurge. 10
Celsus quoted a typical speech of the kind of self-styled savior
currently prevalent in his day:
lam God (or a son ofGod, or a divine Spirit). And I have come. Already
the world is being destroyed. And you, O men, are to perish because of your iniquities. But I wish to save you. And you see me returning again with heavenly power. Blessed is he who has worshipped me now! But I
will cast everlasting fire upon all the rest, both on cities and on country places. And men who fail to realize the penalties in store for them will in vain repent and groan. But I will preserve for ever those who have been
convinced by me. "
Gnostics believed in a Buddhistic succession of saviors. Some
Gnostic leaders said "the savior does not come just once into the world
but that from the beginning of time he wanders in different forms
through history." n The belief of Jewish Essenes in a savior of this type
probably contributed to the medieval legend of the Wandering Jew.

Savitri
Scold
Aulus Cornelius Celsus Patrician Roman scholar of the
first century a.d., who wrote at length on the subjects of medicine, agriculture, philosophy, jurisprudence, and religion.
Savitri
A name of the Hindu Goddess as mother of civilization, she who
brought forth music and literature, rhythm, time, measurements, day
and night, memory, conquest, victory, yoga, and religion, as well as many spirits of civilized arts; she also brought forth The Maiden Death,
dissolution, and all diseases. 1 The same acts of creation were attribut
ed to the Goddess under another name, Sarasvati, inventor of
alphabets, wisdom, language, the Vedas, etc. Both Goddess-names were applied to "the wife of Brahma," though the creative Goddess
preceded Brahma, and became his consort only after the Brahman cult claimed her as a source of his power.
1. O'Flaherty, 49-50; Lurousse, 344.
Scold
Probably derived from Skuld (Skadi), the Norse Goddess of cursing,
third of the Norns, who spoke the deadly words that condemned every
899



Scorpion man to death sooner or later. Even after Christianity discredited
Skuld, men continued to believe that women's curses had effective
^^^^^^^^^ power to injure them, to cause bad luck, disease, or death.
Certainly Christian laws displayed fear of women's maledictions.
Men were permitted to curse women, but a woman could be jailed or
tortured for "scolding" a man. In England, "a common scold" was
considered a criminal, like a thief. The ducking stool, frequently used to drown witches, was also used to punish a scold. 1 In 1632 the English brought from Scotland an instrument of
torture called a brank, or "scold's bridle": an iron head-cage with a
tongue piece to be inserted in the mouth, the cage being locked around
the head. Sometimes the tongue piece was shaped like a spoon; sometimes it was a sharp spike. A brank with four sharp spikes, two to pierce the tongue and two to pierce the cheeks, was used to fasten the
"witch" Agnes Sampson to the wall of her cell, as part of the torment to
make her confess to the crime of witchcraft. 2
The brank was still in use as a punishment for "scolding" women up to the middle of the 19th century. In 1856 a woman locked into
one of these devices was paraded from the town cross to the church at
Bolton-le-Moors, in Lancashire. 3

Scorpion
The constellation of the Scorpion is one of the links between the
cultures of central America and those of the ancient east, possibly
Mesopotamia, whose ziggurats were so similar to the Mexican
pyramids. Scorpio was the same in Babylonia, India, and Greece; and the Maya of Yucatan also called the same constellation "scorpion
stars." 1
Astrological myths everywhere placed Aquarius the Water-drawer at the winter solstice, Taurus the Bull at the spring equinox, Leo the
Lion at the summer solstice, and Scorpio at the autumnal equinox. 2
Therefore it was said in Egypt that the Scorpion killed Horus, the
sun, sending him to his midwinter death and resurrection as his Mother
Isis gave him rebirth; and Pharaoh's daughter apparently played the part of the Water-drawer or divine midwife on the banks of the Nile, as shown by the myth of Moses. Spirits of the four points of the year were sometimes called Sons of
Horus, and placed as small images in the four corners of a pharaoh's
tomb. As man, bull, lion, and scorpion (or serpent) they were adopted by Christianity and converted into the four totems of the evangelists
and the four angels of the Apocalypse.

Pagan images of the dying god were simply renamed St. Sebastian, as in the ancient stone temple at Knockmay in Galway that is, Gaul's

Gaul." His legend is now described as "simply a romance," the
Catholic scholar's term for a faked sainthood. Nevertheless, he has not
been officially eliminated from the canon. 2

seed into the dark. The Arab's word for "penis," zekker, came from
the god's name. 2 The same Lord of Death was the tutelary deity of the necropolis at
Sakkara, another variation of his name. 3 He also appeared in Babylon as Zaqar, a messenger from the moon that is, from the land of death. 4 In Hebrew he was zakar, "maleness, virility." His medieval descendant

priestesses called shemat, "singing-mothers," who knew the hymns and words of power. 1

From Latin se-natus, "self-born," in earliest times probably a group oimatrones or tribal mothers thought to be reincarnated in their
daughters by matrilineal succession. The later patriarchal gods also
claimed to be "self-born," like Ra in Egypt. 1 Providing any god with a

mother implied that there was an older, greater female authority over Serpent

Serpent
It was a general belief in the ancient world that snakes don't die of old
age like other animals, but periodically shed their skins and emerge renewed or reborn into another life. Greeks called the snake's cast
skin geras, "old age." The Chinese envisioned resurrection of the dead
as a man splitting his old skin and coming out of it as a youth again, like a snake. Melanesians say "to slough one's skin" means eternal life.
A basic serpent-myth said the dual Moon-goddess of life and death
made the first man. Her bright aspect suggested making him immortal
like a snake, able to shed his skin; but her dark aspect insisted that he
should die and be buried in the earth. 1 Eternal life and serpenthood are
still equated in the Italian expression averpiu annid'un serpente
"being older than a serpent." The ageless serpent was originally identified with the Great Goddess herself. Hinduism's Ananta the Infinite was the serpentmother who embraced Vishnu and other gods during their "dead"
phase. 2 She was also Kundalini, the inner female soul of man in serpent
shape, coiled in the pelvis, induced through proper practice of yoga to uncoil and mount through the spinal chakras toward the head, bringing
infinite wisdom. The Serpent-goddess occupied the famous Khmer temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia where she embraced the king every
night. If one night the Goddess did not appear, it was a sign that the king must be killed and a new king chosen. 3
The Negritos said the divine people called Chinoi (Chinese) were
descended from a mighty Serpent-goddess named Mat Chinoi, Mother of the Chinese. In her belly lived beautiful angels who received
the souls of the dead. Since her womb was Paradise, shamans
underwent their death-and-rebirth initiations by entering the serpent's
belly. 4 The ancient Aegean world worshipped primarily women and serpents. Men didn't participate in religious ceremonies until late in the Bronze Age, when Cretan kings were allowed to become priests of
the bull-god. Even then, the priest's role was subordinate to that of
the priestess, until the priest himself took the title of "serpent." 5 The
word for "priest" among ancient Akkadian peoples literally meant "snake charmer." 6
The Indian Serpent-goddess Kadru gave birth to all the Nagas or cobra people, and made them immortal by feeding them her divine
lunar blood. 7 She had a Babylonian counterpart, the Goddess Kadi of Der, worshipped as a serpent with a woman's head and breasts. 8 Her
children like the Nagas were depicted as water-serpents, human from

the waist up, like mermaids and mermen. The Nagas guarded "great
treasures of wealth and precious stones, and sometimes books of secret
teachings in underwater palaces." 9 A similar serpent guarded the wonderful Book of Thoth, which
was hidden in an underwater palace. 10 Like his Greek twin Hermes,
Thoth was often incarnate in a snake, signifying his magical wisdom.
Egypt agreed with India in depicting the first serpent as a totemic
form of the Great Mother herself. Egypt's archaic Mother of Creation was a serpent, Per-Uatchet or Buto. The Egyptian uraeus-snake was
a hieroglyphic sign for "Goddess." " Incongruously, "Uraeus" later became one of the most popular "secret names of God" listed in
Magic Papyri and medieval texts of sorcery. Egypt's Serpent-goddess also had the title of Mehen the Envelopes similar to Kundalini or Ananta. Each night, Mehen enfolded
the ram-headed god Auf-Ra (Phallus of Ra) during his sojourn in the
uterine underworld. This was a mythic image of the king's sexual union with his Goddess, reminiscent of the custom of Angkor Wat. 12 At
Philae, the Serpent-goddess received the title of Anqet, from anq, to surround, to embrace. 13 "Serpent of the Nile" was the title, not only of
Cleopatra, but of all Egyptian queens who represented the nation and the Goddess embracing the king. The birth-and-death Goddesses Isis and Nephthys became identi
fied with the dual Serpent-mother of life and after-life. Only they
could help the soul through the section of the underworld inhabited by
serpent deities, Egypt's version of the Nagas. 14 The Mahabharata
depicts a hero seeking immortality in a similar underworld called "city of serpents," where the dual Mother of Life and Death wove the web of
nights and days with black and white thread, binding them with the red thread of life. 15 The Akkadian Goddess Ninhursag, "She Who Gives Life to the
Dead," was also called "Mistress of Serpents" as yet another form of Kadru or Kadi. 16 Babylon's version of her made her a dark twin of the
Heaven-goddess Ishtar, calling her Lamia or Lamashtu, "Great Lady, Daughter of Heaven." Cylinder seals showed her squatting, Kalilike, over her mate, the god Pazuzu, he of the serpent penis. 17 As another Lord of Death, he gave himself up to be devoured by the Goddess. The image of the male snake deity enclosed or devoured by
the female gave rise to a superstitious notion about the sex life of snakes,
reported by Pliny and solemnly believed in Europe even up to the 20th century: that the male snake fertilizes the female snake by putting his head in her mouth and letting her eat him. 18
The male serpent deity became the phallic consort of the Great Mother, sometimes a "father" of races, because he was the Mother's
original mate. In some myths, he was no more than a living phallus she: created for her own sexual pleasure. In other myths, she allowed him
to take part in the work of creation or to fertilize her world-producing
womb. When the serpent-creator turned arrogant and tried to pre
904



tend that he alone made the universe, the Goddess punished him, Serpent bruising his head with her heel and banishing him to the underworld. 19 On this version of the creation myth the Jews based their ^^^^^^^^^^^^
notion of Eve's progeny bruising the serpent's head, and the rabbini
cal opinion that the serpent was Eve's first lover and the true father of
Cain. 20
Actually, the serpent was worshipped in Palestine long before Yahweh's cult arose. Early Hebrews adopted the serpent-god all their
contemporaries revered, and the Jewish priestly clan of Levites were
"sons of the Great Serpent," i.e., of Leviathan, "the wriggly one." 21 He was worshipped in combination with his Goddess, the moon. 22 The
Bible shows that Yahweh was a hostile rival of the serpent Leviathan,
for the two gods battled each other (Psalms 74:14; 89:10, Isaiah 5 1:9).
They would engage in another final battle at doomsday (Isaiah 27: 1 ;
Revelation 12).
Another Jewish name for the Great Serpent was Nehushtan,
described as the god of Moses. Hebrew nahash, "serpent," descended
from an ancient Vedic serpent-king, Nahusha, once "the supreme ruler
of heaven," until he was cast down to the underworld by a rival. 23 Nehushtan was the same god whose image Moses made: a "fiery
serpent" according to Numbers 21:8. The Israelites worshipped him
until the reign of Hezekiah, when the new priesthood "cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made"
(2 Kings 18:4). Yet serpent worship continued in Israel. Seraph, the Hebrew word
for the divine fiery serpent, used to mean an earth-fertilizing lightning-snake, and later became an angel. 24 The seraphim were originally serpent-spirits, like those of the caduceus created by Hermes the
Great Serpent and copied by Mosaic tradition. Jewish medallions of the
1st and 2nd centuries B.C. represented Jehovah as a serpent god, like the "snake-tailed winds" of the Greeks. 25 Jews of Asia Minor said their
Jehovah was the same as Zeus Sabazius the serpent god of Phrygia. 26 Some Jewish Gnostics early in the Christian era maintained that the
post-exilic Jehovah was no god, but a devil, the usurper of the original Kingdom of the Wise Serpent. 27 Much Gnostic literature praised the serpent of Eden for bring
ing the "light" of knowledge to humanity, against the will of a tyrannical God who wanted to keep humans ignorant. 28 This view of the Eden
myth dated back to Sumero-Babylonian sources that said man was made
by the Earth Mother out of mud and placed in the garden "to dress it
and to keep it" (Genesis 2:1 5) for the gods, because the gods were too
lazy to do their own farming and wanted slaves to plant, harvest, and
give them offerings. 29 The gods agreed that their slaves should never
learn the godlike secret of immortality, lest they get above themselves
and be ruined for work. Therefore, as the Epic of Gilgamesh reports, the gods gave death to humanity, and "Life they kept in their own hands." 50
905



Serpent
Hypostasis ofthe Archons ("Reality of the Rulers") A Gnostic Gospel written about the 3rd centu
ry A.D., incorporating one of the alternate versions of the Adam and Eve myth.
In one of the interwoven Genesis stories, God was not one but
many, the elohim or "gods-and-goddesses." 31 The God of Eden
remarked to his divine colleagues, "Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil"; therefore he must be ejected from the garden at once, lest he "take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for
ever" (Genesis 3:22). The serpent's teachings would have led man to conquer death and become godlike, against the will of the elohim. The Hypostasis ofthe Archons showed that the serpent was a
totemic form of the Goddess, apparently taking pity on her doomed creature and seeking to instruct him in the attainment of eternal life:
"The Female Spiritual Principle came in the Snake, the Instructor,
and it taught them, saying, 'y u snaH not die; for it was out of jealousy
that he said this to you. Rather, your eyes shall open, and you shall
become like gods, recognizing evil and good.'
" Then "the arrogant Ruler" (God) cursed the serpent and the woman. 52 Some Gnostic sects honored both Eve and the serpent for their efforts on behalf of
humanity. 33 The present form of the biblical story is obviously a much-revised
version of the original tales of the Great Mother and her serpent.
Babylonian icons showed the Goddess attended by her snake, offering
man the food of immortality. The Pyramid Texts said it was the
serpent who offered the food of eternal life. 34 As Ophion, or Ophi, he
was the ancestor of the African serpent god Obi, whose name is still
preserved in the voodoo-magic system, oheah?^ The Bible uses a Hebrew version of the name, obh, for the familiar spirit of the Witch
of Endor, and the Vulgate renders this word "python." 36 In Dahomey, the primal Mother-Creatress Mawu was supported by a Great
Serpent. 37 Gnostic accounts of the Eden myth used the Aramaic pun
identifying Eve, the Teacher, and the Serpent: Hawah, Mother of
All Living; hawa, to instruct; and hewya, Serpent. 38 Eve's name in Arabic still combines the idea of "life" (hayyat) with the name of the
serpent (Hayyat). 39 Hippolytus viewed the serpent as a feminine Logos, "the wise Word of Eve. This is the mystery of Eden: this is the river that flows out of Eden. This is also the mark that was set on Cain, whose
sacrifice the God of this world did not accept whereas he accepted
the bloody sacrifice of Abel: for the lord of this world delights in blood.
This Serpent is he who appeared in the latter days in human form at the time of Herod." *
Arabian tradition identified the food of immortality with the female
uterine blood, colored "royal purple"; and the Mother's uterine
garden with the moon temple at Marib in Sheba. Legend said the
serpents of Sheba were purple with the divine essence, and lived in
trees; the people were serpentlike, with forked tongues, great wisdom, and longevity.41 From Sheba might have come the mysterious life
giving substance called shiba in the Epic of Gilgamesh, dispensed by the wife of Uta-Napishtim (Noah), who had become the only immortal
906



man; his wife therefore was a Goddess. When this holy matriarch gave Serpent
shiba to Gilgamesh, he shed his old, diseased skin like a snake, and
emerged from it reborn.42 ^^^^^^^^^^^
Persians also maintained the symbolic connections between men
strual blood and the serpent's secret of longevity. Mithraists claimed
immortality was conferred by the blood of the sacrificial bull, but a serpent was there to collect the blood as it flowed from the bull's
body; and this blood was imitation-menstrual blood in that it was "delivered by the moon." 43
Immortality was the special province of the skin-shedding Serpent and the blood-bestowing Goddess from earliest times. Some of the very oldest traditions of the Great Serpent identified him with the
Earth's intestines. Archaic serpent gods like Egyptian Apep and
Sumerian Khumbaba were said to "resemble intestines." 44 In this
connection, the biblical phrase for birth or rebirth was "separation
from the bowels." Serpents understood how to restore life to the dead,
according to the myths of Crete, where the sorcerer Polyidos learned the serpents' secret and won great honor at the Minoan court by
bringing the dead prince Glaucus back to life. 45
Many Gnostic traditions identified the Serpent with Jesus. In the
Pistis Sophia, Jesus was the serpent who spoke to Eve "from the tree of knowledge and the tree of life, which were in the paradise of Adam."
Jewish Naassians (Serpent-worshippers) said the serpent was the Messiah. Magic Papyri called him "World Ruler, the Great Serpent,
leader of gods ... the god of gods." 46 Some Christians held that the
serpent was the father of Jesus, having "overshadowed" the bed of the
virgin Mary and begotten the human form of the Savior.
These traditions were still extant, though hidden, in Renaissance
times. Barrel Bruyn's Gnostic-symbolic painting of the Annunciation showed an unmistakably Hermetic serpent-caduceus as the rod extend
ed toward Mary by the impregnating angel Gabriel. The Dove
poised in a halo in its tip, making a sign like a cross between a fairy-wand and the emblem of Venus.47 This made a combined symbol of the
male-and-female mystery of the Serpent and Dove, which was inserted
into the mouth of Jesus according to Matthew 10:16. Many theolo
gians claimed the crucified serpent Nehushtan was a prophecy of Jesus:
"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must
the Son of Man be lifted up" (John 3:1 5). In the 16th century, German
smiths made golden thalers with a crucified Christ on one side and a
crucified serpent on the other, hinting that they were two faces of the same redeemer.48
Every mythology had some form of the World Serpent. Like the Hermetic or Gnostic serpent encircling the World Egg, he was a
basic Indo-European religious symbol. Norse myth called him the Midgard-Worm, who encircled the whole round of Middle-Earth (Midgard), his tail in his mouth. 49 Russians called him Koshchei the
Deathless, encircler of the underworld. 50 This seems to have been a
907



Serpent variation of the Japanese dragon of sea-tides, Koshi. 51 Egyptians called
him Sata (Satan), or the Tuat, on whose back the sun god rode through the underworld each night. Greeks called him Okeanos, the sea-serpent of the outermost ocean.
Often the Heavenly Father assumed this serpent form, like Zeus
Meilichios, worshipped as a gigantic serpent in the 4th century B.C. 52 In the shape of a serpent he became the consort of chthonian Persephone." He also begot heroes on mortal women. Alexander the Great
was allegedly fathered by God who in the form of a serpent impreg
nated his mother, Queen Olympias. 54 The Pyramid Texts spoke of the serpent as both subterranean and
celestial. In his heavenly aspect, he was a dispenser of immortality. 55 As the divine phallus in perpetual erection he was the Tree of Life, or axis mundi, a Pole passing through the center of heaven and earth that is, Father Heaven coupled to the Goddess's "hub." His eye was
seen as the pole star. In 3000 B.C., the pole star was Alpha Draconis,
the Serpent's Eye. 56 The Mahabharata said the pole star to which the yoke of the world
was fixed was "the supreme snake, Vasuki." The same snake was the
phallic god who stirred the uterine Abyss at creation, according to the Vedas. 57 Like the God of Genesis, the Vedic deity Indra claimed to have cast down the Great Serpent from heaven into the world
encircling abyss of the outer ocean. 58 Like the Bible story, this myth
re-interpreted the original meaning of the serpent as a descending,
fertilizing phallus. The sexual image of the phallic serpent's head as the Jewel in the Lotus ramified into many versions of the myth of menarche: the
belief that menstruation was initiated by copulation with a supernatural
snake (see Menstrual Blood). According to this imagery, the divine
male serpent acquired a "blood-red jewel" in his head. Hindus said all
the great snakes carried blood-red rubies of immortality in their
heads. 59
Germans remembered this Aryan lore, and said a serpent with a magic stone in its head would be found at the root of a hazel tree
witchwood near mistletoe. The serpent's stone was sacred to the
moon, and was identified with the Philosopher's Stone, which could
bring eternal life. 60 Remnants of the serpent's phallic symbolism appeared in medieval magic charms, such as the conviction that "female
diseases" could be cured by applying to the sufferer a staff with which
a snake had been beaten. 61
In 13th-century France, a snake on a pole like the Ophites' image of Christ was carried in triumphal procession during Easter Week to the baptismal font of the church. 62 Sometimes the fetish was an
enormous stuffed serpent, like a Chinese carnival dragon. Church
men tried to assimilate the custom by saying the serpent was the devil
"driven from his kingdom by the Passion of Christ"; but this was but
908



a lame explanation for a rite that was already old when Christianity was new. 63
Early Ophite Christians adopted serpent worship and claimed Moses as the founder of their sect, alleging that Moses taught the
Jews to worship the serpent in the wilderness. 64 Besides, the serpent had certainly given knowledge to Adam and Eve, and therefore was a savior of humanity, an earlier incarnation of Christ who also suffered at
God's hands for the enlightenment he brought. The Ophites' holy serpents were made to twine around the bread of the Eucharist, and
were adored hanging on crosses. Ophite "colleges" still existed in
Bithynia in the 5th century a.d., when bishops began leading mobs to wreck the Ophite churches. 65
Medieval Hermetists worshipped the serpent as Ouroboros, king of
magic, a syncretic mixture of the Ophites' Christ-Ophion, the Greeks' Hermes, the Phoenicians' Taaut, the Egyptians' Tuat, and other ancient snake-tailed gods including the underground oracle Python.66 Ouroboros was linked with the Chinese p;-dragon, symbol of
the universe, carved on jade discs as a dragon or serpent eating its own tail. 67 This may have been the prototype of the serpent Python and
the Pythagoreans' worship ofp/as the mystic numerical principle of the circle. Two serpents eating each other's tails combined the yang
and-yin mandala with the caduceus, expressing the bisexual nature of
Hermes and all cyclic alternations: birth/death, summer/winter, light/ dark, etc. The Ouroboros was still pictured under the earth in certain
European areas, and some people claimed to be able to feel his slow
movements through their feet when they stood in the ancient shrines.

Sex
Rev. Dr. Joseph Fletcher of the Episcopal Theological School wrote, "The Christian churches must shoulder much of the blame for the
confusion, ignorance, and guilt which surrounds sex in Western
culture [T]he Christian church, from its earliest primitive begin
nings, had been swayed by many Puritanical people, both Catholic
and Protestant, who have viewed sex as inherently evil." '
Others have been less forgiving, and stated bluntly that Christian churches must shoulder not just "much of the blame, but all of it.
R.E.L. Masters declared, "Almost the entire blame for the hideous
nightmare that was the witch mania, and the greatest part of the
blame for poisoning the sexual life of the West, rests squarely on the Roman Catholic Church." 2 The rest of the blame presumably
devolves upon Protestantism, for there was no institution in western
culture other than Christianity that made any effort to teach human beings to hate or fear sex.
Christian abhorrence of sex began with the fathers of the church,
who insisted that the kingdom of God couldn't be established until
the human race was allowed to die out through universal celibacy. 5 Marcion announced that all propagation must be abandoned at once.
St. Jerome ordered: "Regard everything as poison which bears within it
the seed of sensual pleasure." 4 St. Athanasius declared the great
revelation and blessing brought by Jesus was knowledge of the saving
910



grace of chastity. 5 Tertullian said chastity was "a means whereby a man will traffic in a mighty substance of sanctity," whereas the sex act rendered even marriage "obscene." 6
Numenius of Apamea proclaimed that only total cessation of all
sexual activity could bring about the union of the soul with God. 7 St.
Augustine pronounced the doctrine that "concupiscence" is the root of
original sin and the means of transmitting Adam's guilt to all generations. Thus he sealed the church's commitment to asceticism, at
least in theory, for the next 1600 years. 8 Augustine said sexual
intercourse is never sinless, even within marriage.9 Augustine didn't invent this doctrine. He got it from Gnostic Manicheans, to whose
sect he belonged before his conversion to orthodoxy. Gnostics taught
that souls are entrapped in flesh by "the mystery of love and lust, through which all the worlds are inflamed." This teaching probably
came ultimately from ascetic Jain Buddhist yogis, who enjoined the same precept as the First Book of John: "Love not the world, neither
things that are in the world ... for all that is in the world, the lust of
the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father." 10 These views became more entrenched as time went on. Medieval theologians said sex "caused the damnation of humanity, which was
on its account put out of Paradise, and for its sake Christ was killed." 1 1
Officials of the Inquisition taught in their handbooks that women's
"carnal lust" was the cause of witchcraft and Satanism, since God
"allows the devil more power over the venereal act, by which the
original sin is handed down, than over all other human actions . . .
because of its natural nastiness." 12
The church promulgated legends about saints so devoted to
chastity that they preferred extreme physical torment to sexual pleasure. St. Paul the Hermit was tied down by the wicked emperor
Decius and subjected to the lascivious caresses of a harlot. As soon as
he felt his penis rise, "having no weapon with which to defend himself, [he] bit off his tongue and spat it into the face of the lewd woman."
The sainted Pope Leo was so pure that when "a woman kissed his
hand, and aroused in him a violent temptation of the flesh," he cut
his hand off. By singular good fortune it was restored by the Holy Virgin so he could continue to perform religious ceremonies. 13
The early church attacked most bitterly the many pagan faiths
that made sex a central holy sacrament, enacting union of the Great Goddess and her phallic consorts. Tertullian denounced "the whoredoms of Eleusis," and Eusebius condemned "the unnameable rites of
the mysteries, adulteries and yet baser lusts." Yet Plato and his
contemporaries had worshipped Eros, god of sexual love, as "the most venerable of the deities, the most worthy of honor, the most powerful
to grant virtue and blessedness unto mankind both in life and after
death." 14
From the most primitive period, European pagans incorporated

Sex sex into their religion. The word Lust in old Germanic languages
meant "religious joy." 15 At their holy feasts, Norsemen sang songs the
^^^^^^^^^^_ Christians called "lewd and shameful," and danced hip-swinging
dances the Christians called "female gyrations." 16 The people refused
to give these up, believing them essential to general fertility. When seasons went awry and crops failed under the first Christianized kings,
the peasants were sure the cause was neglect of the old deities' rites. 17
Sexuality was reverenced in cultures where the female principle was accorded freedom and honor, as in Egypt, where women chose
and wooed their lovers at will. 18 Egyptians described carnal knowledge
as "knowing a woman perfectly," and regarded it as a joy. Sages counseled men never to be rude to a mistress or wife, nor to try to order
her about; it would be unseemly in one with whom she shared
"joy." 19 This was like the Tantric identification of sexual bliss with the
bliss of the Goddess and God as they continually engendered life in the universe. 20 Hindus said intercourse with any woman is like union
with the Goddess herself. Far from being sinful, "to have carnal
intercourse with the Goddess Parvati is a virtue which destroys all sin." 21
But in the Christian view, woman brought death into the world and sex perpetuated it. 22 It was claimed that Adam was made to be
immortal, but he lost both his innocence and his immortality when Eve
taught him about sex. All women were copies of Eve, said Tertullian;
"the unsealer of that Tree," her very existence bringing destruction to
"God's image, man."25 Women were dangerous even when dead. An early church edict ordered that a male corpse must not be buried
next to a female corpse until the latter was safely decomposed. 24
St. John Chrysostom said a man "cannot endure" looking at a
woman. 25 A biographer of St. Augustine assumed automatically that "because of his great holiness, he was unwilling to look upon a woman's face." 26 St. Augustine's doctrine of original sin was destined to crucify not only Christ but the whole of the western world with its anti
pleasure, pro-pain philosophy. 27 Even today it is hardly possible for anyone brought up in one of the western nations to comprehend the
ancient world's opinion of sex as an experience of divine pleasure or a
preview of heaven, without deliberate, laborious intellectual progress toward such an opinion.
Not only was Europe crucified by Christian antisexuality but also
much of Oceania, Africa, and the Far East. Wherever Christian missionaries went which was everywhere people were told their
own generally healthy sexual attitudes were wrong and sinful. One
missionary described Bantu harvest festivals as Bacchic feasts: "It is impossible to witness them without being ashamed. Men and women, who in ordinary circumstances are modest in behavior and speech, then abandon themselves to licentiousness." Another missionary
wrote: "I have seen the most indelicate performances in the shape of
dances or theatrical pieces in front of the Badago temples, and on bearing witness to their wickedness have been told that the god delighted in them." 28
912



A missionary in Malaya observed that the natives engaged in all of
what he called the carnal sins except one: rape. 29 He didn't follow up
the thought to the prevalence of rape in his own society; but today's psychologists are beginning to understand the leading role played by sexual repression in developing the kind of woman-hatred that leads to
rape. Western thinkers have only recently caught on to the fact that
cultural suppression of the need for bodily pleasure will inevitably result
in perverted expression through cruelty. 50 Cruelty to both women and children was the early Christian
substitute for the affection usually shown them in less ascetic societ
ies. The Apostolic Constitutions called for severe physical punishment
of children. Fathers (not mothers) were told: "Do not hesitate to
reprove them, chastening them with severity. . . . Teach your children the word of the Lord, straiten them even with stripes and render
them submissive, teaching them from infancy the Holy Scriptures." 31 Recent experiments have shown that inhibition of sexual responses
(in animals) is associated with aggressive cruelty, whereas sexual
permissiveness goes with peaceful co-existence. While some investigators theorized that aggression and lust rise together from a common
source, experiments don't support this belief. Instead, it seems one alternative inhibits the other. 32 Christianity made all Europe a vast
experiment in sexual inhibition, with predictable results. In one of history's most cruel ages, Thomas Browne spoke of a nearly total
rejection of sex: "I would be content that we might procreate like trees,
without conjunction, or that there were any other way to perpetuate the World without this trivial and vulgar way of union." 33
In 1721 Beaumont ordered the pious to reject any and all
sensual pleasures, even the most subtle or involuntary ones:
Ifye perceive a sudden sweet taste in your mouths or feel any warmth in
your breasts, like tire, or any form ofpleasure in any part ofyour body, or . . . ifye become aware by occasion ofpleasure or satisfaction derived
from such perception, that your hearts are drawn away from the
contemplation ofJesus Christ and from spiritual exercises . . . then this sensation is very much to be suspected ofcoming from the Enemy; and therefore were it ever so wonderful and striking, still renounce it and do not consent to accept it. **
Inhibition of sensual impulses was the keynote of western
morality up to and including the I9th century, when Dr. Alcott authoritatively stated that even marital sex should never be indulged
more than once a month. Any greater frequency was "prostitution of the matrimonial life." 35 For many centuries the church insisted that
marital sex should be as barren of sensual pleasure as possible, and that
orgasms in women were unseemly or even devilish. The "missionary
position" was the only permitted sexual position, because it afforded the
least pleasure, especially to the wife.
In consequence of such socialization, "good" women were frequently sex-haters. Bertrand Russell said of his first wife that "she had

been brought up, as American women always were in those days, to
think that sex was beastly, that all women hated it, and that men's
brutal lusts were the chief obstacle to happiness in marriage." 36
A Christian scripture falsely attributed to St. Dionysius, Ofthe Names ofGod, said the name of Love was not suitable for God,
"because one could only honor God, not love Him." 37 Love was left to
the sinful, bearing out Nietzsche's observation that "Christianity gave
Eros poison to drink; he did not die of it but degenerated into a vice." 38
Only recently has it even been suggested that love, or Eros, is essential to the moral development of a man, in a sense that was never
hinted at by the moralists of the west. A man may rise to "a new
moral plane" by falling in love, a process that cannot be pursued
through any rationally established program. Western society doesn't understand how to instill a comfortably "instinctive" morality into any
individual, even with the opportunity to work on the problem from earliest childhood let alone to improve the moral outlook of an adult. But a man's emotional commitment to a beloved, if sincere, may
radically alter and improve his whole view of the world, of himself, of right and wrong, and of the individual's relations with and responsibil
ities toward others. 39
Patriarchal religion was devoted to destruction of the sensual
female nature that elicited and responded to such emotional commit
ments. Women's sexual desire or pleasure was generally considered
detrimental to the marital relationship.40 A standard Christian work
on sex dedicated to Cardinal d'Este, Sinibaldi's 1 7th-century Geneanth
ropeia, said no woman could conceive if she enjoyed sex.41 Before
the turn of the last century, it was expected that "good" women would
know nothing of sexual pleasure. If they showed an inclination to
learn, they might be cruelly teased. Thomas Branagan's advice to young
men was to test the virtue of a fiancee by trying to seduce her, to
make sure she would react with "becoming abhorrence." If she seemed
too compliant, she must be jilted. 42 The name of John Bowdler became a byword for his pious labors
in removing all risque words from the Bible, Shakespeare, etc. He even objected to any mention of women's traditional care of the sick or
of infants, on moral grounds: "Few women have any idea [Bowdler's
italics] how much men are disgusted by the slightest approach to these
in any female. ... By attending the nursery or sick bed, women are
too apt to acquire a habit of conversing on such subjects in language
which men of delicacy are shocked at." 43 Male "delicacy" even dictated that the books of male and female authors must be kept on
separate bookshelves unless the authors "happen to be married." 44
The Victorian authority on sex was Dr. William Acton, who
couldn't heap too much praise on "all those mysterious sensations which make up what we call VIRILITY," a quality that "seems
necessary to give a man that consciousness of his dignity, or his
character as head and ruler and of his importance, which is absolutely
914



essential to the well-being of his family, and through it, of society itself. Sex
t is a power, a privilege, of which the man is, and should be, proud." 3ut women were permitted no such pride in their sexual nature. "As a ^^^^^^^^^^^
general rule," said Acton, "a modest woman seldom desires any
exual gratification for herself. She submits to her husband, but only to
jlease him; and, but for the desire of maternity, would far rather be elieved of his attentions." Acton admitted however that there were a
jew sad exceptions to his rule, who might be found either in the
livorce courts or in lunatic asylums, suffering from "the form of insanity
railed nymphomania." 45 Those women labeled nymphomaniacs and imprisoned in Victoriin asylums were frequently women who had somehow stumbled
lpon discovery of their own orgasmic capacity and found to their lismay that men neither knew nor cared anything about it. Even
"reud's view of female sexuality was all wrong. For over fifty years,
loctors slavishly followed Freud's interpretation and wondered why here were so many "frigid" women, whose sexual readiness was
:onstantly aroused to no purpose until they rejected sex out of sheer
rustration. "It is remarkable that only recently has Freud's classic theory
>n the sexuality of women the notion of the double orgasm been
ictually tested and found just plain wrong." 46 The 20th century was not much more enlightened than the 19th.
Stall's marriage manual, the ultimate authority at the turn of the
entury, blamed women themselves for the sexual ignorance society mposed on them. If a wife failed to understand her husband's sexual
leeds, she was to blame "for her lack of knowledge and consider
ition." 47 But men's lack of knowledge and consideration was part of
he culture.
The oft-heard complaint directed by women at the clumsiness, crassness, and incompetence ofmen in their sexual approaches and in sexual intercourse itself, men 's lack ofskill in foreplay and their failure to
understand its meaning, almost certainly substantially reflects the lack oftactile experience that many males have suffered in childhood. The roughness with which many men will handle women and children constitutes yet another evidence oftheir having been failed in early tactile
experience, for it is difficult to conceive ofanyone who had been
tenderly loved and caressed in infancy not learning to approach a woman or a child with especial tenderness. The very word "tenderness"
implies softness, delicacy oftouch, caring for. The gorilla, that gentle creature, is the most frequently slandered when women wish to describe the sexual approaches ofthe average male. Sex seems to be
regarded as a tension releaser rather than as a profoundly meaningful act ofcommunication in a deeply involved human relationship.'18
One modern woman a rape victim thus expressed her own view
of sex:
Sex, for men, is totally oriented toward the man $ orgasm and isn 't
successful unless it involves intercourse and orgasm, which is ridiculous,
915



e~ because sex to me is a much more sensual, much more emotional
experience. It doesn 't involve just one particular spot on the body getting excited and aroused, and then it's over, and it 's either a success or
^^^^^^^^^ failure.''9
Men culturally trained not to pay attention to women seldom
understood what women meant by "love," even when they tried to
explain. The celebrated Kinsey reports on American sexual behavior didn't mention "love" in their index. 50 Certainly there was no such idea
in America as the Tantric karuna, which combined all forms of love in communion with the female, though modern women sometimes try to grope toward this concept, unaware that it was elucidated long ago:
Gestation . . . is a complex inner process in which sexuality is fed by everything else a woman has at her disposal, much in the same way that she might feed a fetus. When there is no fetus, an inclusive kind ofsexual
intimacy fills up a comparable inner space. But when sex is separated from that context, the disparity between a penetration that is no more than
an "action " and a penetration that reaches into complex inner space
can become quite overwhelming. . . . To most men the problem . . . does not seem very real. To them the
clearest aim ofsex is orgasm, that moment ofintense physical intimacy and satisfaction which so often serves as a substitute for other kinds of
intimacy. Perhaps that is one ofthe reasons why men seem to be so
concerned with satisfying women sexually and interpret that satisfaction in terms of what they think would satisfy them if they were women. It may also be one ofthe reasons why men seem to think that many women
can never be completely satisfied sexually. The terrain where a woman remains forever unsatisfied or even, as they say, "insatiable,
" is probably the area where her sexuality borders most closely on that more complex
psycho-sexual area ofher being. 5I
In Oriental countries where an image of the Goddess was
retained, broader ideas of sexuality were retained also:
Western attitudes . . . look on sexual intercourse as a matter oftension,
appetite and relief. . . according to the simplistic biological conception which is still current. . . . It is well known that the man who, in the Kinsey Report on the Human Male, recorded a frequency above thirty times a day for many years became a kind offolk-hero in America. Sexual love, in such a context, becomes at best a matter offrequently happily shared
orgasms. To the traditional Indian mind this attitude is grotesque and pathet
ic. Even the ordinary man recognized that such banality was absurd. ...
Eighteenth-century Indian harlots mocked European men for their miserable sexual performance, calling them "dunghill cocks" for whom the act was over in a few seconds. Despite recent advances in sexological knowledge, the West's chosen external explanations ofsex, attached as
they are to a provisional and impoverished rationalization of the infinite
complex ofhuman experience, still tend to regard sex as the pursuit of orgasm Traditional India did not."
A mystical or poetic view of sex, like the Indian one, seemed to
916



jar the puritan consciousness even more than a "dirty" or degraded Sex view. Dr. Marie Stopes's Married Love was imported from England in 1918 but banned for obscenity in the U.S., chiefly on account of ^^^^^^^^^^^
such delirious passages as the following:
The half-swooning sense offlux which overtakes the spirit in their eternal
moment at the apex ofrapture sweeps into its flaming tides the whole essence ofthe man and woman, and as it were, the heat of the contact vaporizes their consciousness so that it Alls the whole ofcosmic space.
For the moment they are identified with the divine thoughts, the waves of eternal force, which to the Mystic often appear in terms ofgolden
light."
Some progress has been made since the sexual obtuseness of
western men made them a laughingstock in India. But recent investiga
tors found "a view of sex that is as distorted as the Victorian, for it is
still shrouded with the unrealistic expectations and outmoded standards
of gender behavior of the past. Fantasy rather than reality is its
keynote; hostility, anxiety, and guilt are aggravated rather than alleviated." 54 Significantly, a male author characterizes male sexuality as
loveless and death-centered, capable of destroying the foundations of
society:
Contemporary eroticism attempts to free woman sexually but according to a masculine conception ofsexuality. . . . The present rehabilitation of
the erotic in its purely sexual, loveless aspect is completely at variance with
the truly feminine conception . . . an ultimate striving toward disloca
tion, destruction, and death Thanatos as against Eros, the love-filled
erotic, unifying and conservationist. . . . Ultimately, this overemphasis ofthe masculine component in Western society threatens to destroy its foundations. fs
To counterbalance the destructiveness of male-dominated soci
ety, nothing could be effective except recognition of the feminine
principle, according to George Sand: "It will be in the female heart
par excellence, as it always has been, that love and devotion, patience and pity, will find their true home. On woman falls the duty, in a
world of brute passions, of preserving the virtue of charity. . . . When woman ceases to play that role, life will be the loser." 56 Modern
thinkers also regret the loss of cultural emphasis on the feminine
morality that can integrate sex with affection, tenderness, and sensitivity toward others' emotional needs. It has been often said that
male-dominated societies tend to burden the sexual impulses of both
women and men with basically unrelated guilts, fears, angers, and their
resulting aggressions. Some forms of "entertainment" for example
take advantage of the new frankness to introduce disturbingly sadistic
elements into mass socialization for sexual adulthood. "Rather than
lament the fact that sexual appetite is now being encouraged, we might more profitably spend our time trying to ensure that the emotions
that are integrated with it are the ones we approve of." 57
917



Sex As recently as 1966, an anthropological study of the Irish
islanders of Inis Beag revealed a mini-culture of 19th-century Christian
patriarchal patterns in sexual life. Female orgasm was unknown.
Women were trained to endure rather than enjoy sex. Men habitually
ejaculated within seconds. Modesty was the overwhelming preoccupation of both sexes; husbands and wives didn't see each other naked.
Sexual foreplay consisted of rough fondling outside the sleeping garments. No coital position other than Venus observa was used.
Premarital sex was virtually unknown, since young couples were never alone together. Not even "walking out," the old-fashioned version of dating, was allowed. Young people received no instruction in
sexual matters. The islanders said after marriage "nature would take its course" without the embarrassment of discussion. Though the men were often at sea in small boats, they never
learned to swim, being unwilling to undress in public for this purpose. "Bathing" in the sea meant wading, fully clothed. The sexes were
rigidly separated for this activity. Men were known to die of disease or
injury rather than to go to a hospital on the mainland, where they thought their bodies would be bared to the eyes of female nurses.
Even the dogs of Inis Beag were whipped for licking their genitals or other "obscene" behavior. Imported copies of American magazines such as Life or Time were denounced from the pulpit as
pornography. Fear of female "mysteries" was overt: women were not
approached sexually for many months after childbirth, or during men
struation, when men thought them especially dangerous. Predictably, severe repression exacted a severe toll in quarrelsomeness, alcoholism, violence, and frequent mental disturbances. 58
Paradoxically, the more sexuality is banned and ignored, the more fear it seems to engender in men. A patriarchal-ascetic ethic seems to
arrange sexual attitudes according to the way men would like them
arranged, but it doesn't work well even for men. A psychiatrist says, "In the privacy of our consulting room we do from time to time see strong men fret, and hear them talk of women with dread and horror
and awe, as if women, far from being timid creatures to be patronized,
were as powerful as the sea and inescapable as fate. . . . Man, con
fronted by woman, does seem to feel, variously, frightened, revolted,
dominated, bewildered, and even, at times, superfluous." 59 One male author in a revealing passage on men's sexual feelings refers to a woman
as "it," but also admits "general helplessness in the face of her," and a sense of her "awesomeness and power" seemingly overblown terms
for an ordinary human female:
We cannot relate to the total object as it [sic] is, and thus we need
standardized definitions ofsexual attractiveness. These we get in the
form of "cues" that serve to cut the object down to manageable size: we look at the breast or the black underwear, which allow us not really to
have to take account of the total person we are relating to. . . . [W]e strip
918



the partner ofawesomeness and power and so overcome our general Sex helplessness in the face ofher. 60
The symbols of "sexiness" are created and instilled by the HmHi^Hi
society, however odd it may seem to realize that human physiological
responses can actually be keyed to abstract images. "It is now quite clear that how a person behaves sexually is largely determined not by
inborn factors but by learning."61 The prevailing conventional wisdom and its influence on the growing child determine whether most
people will enjoy sex or hate it, perceiving their own bodies as heaven
or hell. Western anti-sexuality has created many individuals tending
toward the "hate" or "hell" end of the spectrum, epitomized by a
psychiatric patient who said, "Somehow I always think that sexual
i intercourse is a great disgrace for humans." A female patient called
her body an "abhorrent envelope," and said, "I wish I could tear this
skin off. If I didn't have this stupid body, I would be as pure outside as
I feel inside." 62
Women have an especially difficult time with the body-image in a
society that attaches little value to their complex body-oriented roles
of wife, mother, nurturer, or comforter; and may even cease to play these roles when they have fully accepted the value system of the dominant sex. Women don't reject traditional "feminine" roles out of
perversity, nor because of that Freudian absurdity, penis envy. Like men, most women prefer to do what their society values and rewards. If the wife-and-mother role is undervalued or even deprecated, as it
has been throughout the past two millenia in the western world women can hardly be blamed for seeking valid achievement in other
fields. 63 In our society the universal standard of valuation is money, and
the so-called "career" of wife-and-mother earns none at all.
Underevaluation of the mother affects sons as well as daughters,
since the mother's reaction to social expectations of her inevitably
creates a deep impression on her children. "Psychiatric observation
suggests that human sexual behavior is subtly shaped by the nature of
the social attachments formed during a person's development"; and the mother is the primary social attachment. 64 Chodorow says the mod
ern civilized male "is in the unhappy position of being able to attain
masculine identity almost solely through efforts to distinguish himself from the person closest to him [the mother], with whom he might most
naturally identify. His efforts commonly take the form of a rather
primitive rejection of all that is 'feminine' in women and in himself." 65
Sexual development is further hampered by conventional religions which still attach fear and guilt to almost every stage of the process.
Ignoring recent proofs that masturbation is necessary for development of normal orgasmic capacity in both sexes, Pope Paul VI's 1976
declaration on sexual ethics pronounced masturbation "a grave moral
disorder." Moreover, within the framework of marriage, only the
"finality" of procreation could "ensure the moral goodness" of sex in
919



Sex other words, sex must make babies, not pleasure.66 As for premarital
sex, Norman Vincent Peale declared it a dreadful sin even for persons
deeply in love; they cannot be forgiven without prolonged spiritual
"treatment." 67 It is now said that sexual appetites have "little or no relation to
biological or physiological needs [Ejrotic urges stem more from
socio-cultural factors than from those of the strictly physiological nature." 68 Therefore the broad extent of ugly or cruel sexual behavior
patterns in modern society should stimulate serious thought about what
the society is teaching. In 1972, the Chief of the Sex Section of the
Washington D.C. Police Department reported: "The newspapers print only what they want to. I tell them about little girls of seven or eight
who come up with venereal diseases inflicted on them by male mem
bers of their own families. An appalling number of 1 1- and
12-year-olds are giving birth after being raped by their own fathers. But
they won't print things like this. They're only heart-breaking and
horrible not sensational." 69
A report of the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography concluded: "Failure to talk openly and directly about sex . . . overem
phasizes sex, gives it a magical nonnatural quality Such failure makes teaching children and adolescents to become fully and ade
quately functioning sexual adults a more difficult task The very
foundation of our society rests upon healthy sexual attitudes grounded in appropriate and accurate sexual information." 70 In other words, the
foundations of society rest on dissemination of precisely the kind of
information that Christian morality insisted on withholding from one
and all men, women, and children.
Churches today have largely renounced all their responsibility to
establish guidelines for sexual development or sexual behavior, leaving
their congregations in an area of confusion. Theologians stress "the
personal responsibility of the Christian to find God's will for himself." 71
In which case, he hardly needs a church.

Sexism
The Catholic Encyclopedia declares, "The female sex is in some
respects inferior to the male sex, both as regards body and soul." ' This is a somewhat modified version of the opinion of St. Thomas
Aquinas, who insisted that every woman is birth-defective, an imperfect male begotten because her father happened to be ill, weakened, or in a state of sin at the time of her conception. 2 Knowing nothing of the human ovum, the church taught the doctrine of Augustine and
Aquinas that a mother contributes nothing to her child's genetic
inheritance, but acts only as "soil" for the male soul-bearing seed. 3
Nevertheless, churchmen claimed the birth of a true freak was not the
father's fault, but the result of "the heated and obstinate imagination"
of the mother during sexual intercourse. 4
Fathers of the church were earnest woman-haters. St. John Chry
sostom said men suffer "a thousand evils" from having to look at
women; "the beauty of women is the greatest snare." St. Odo of Cluny
refused to be ensnared; he said, "How should we desire to embrace what is no more than a sack of dung!" According to Walter Map,
"Even the very good woman, who is rarer than the phoenix, cannot be loved without the loathesome bitterness of fear and worry and
constant unhappiness." A 19th-century Anglican churchman said women are "intrinsically inferior in excellence, imbecile by sex and
nature, weak in body, inconstant in mind, and imperfect and infirm
in character." 5 In the 1890s, the president of a leading theological
seminary declared, "My Bible commands the subjection of women forever." 6
So it did. Through the centuries, the Bible supported sexist sentiments which were echoed by all churchmen. St. Paul said: "The
head of every man is Christ; and the head of every woman is the man" (1 Corinthians 1 1:3). St. Peter said in the Gospel of Thomas:
"Women are not worthy of life." 7 Clement of Alexandria quoted the
words of Christ from the Gospel According to the Egyptians: "I have come to destroy the works of the female." 8 He added: "Every woman
ought to be filled with shame at the thought that she is a woman." 9
Up to the modern era, clergymen continued to appeal to biblical
authority to maintain the political subjection of women. "The clergy
were often in the forefront of the fight against suffrage, dredging up quotations from the Bible to prove that the natural order of things was female obedience to man." Simone de Beauvoir says: "For the Jews,
Mohammedans and Christians among others, man is master by divine
right, the fear of God will therefore repress any impulse towards revolt in the downtrodden female." As late as 1971 an Episcopalian
bishop confirmed these views: "The sexuality of Christ is no accident
nor is his masculinity incidental. This is the divine choice." Feminists
believe that even if the churches should destroy themselves in the
effort, they will cling to their notion of male supremacy to the very end,
for this was their primary foundation in the beginning. 10 Theology's

Sexism entire conceptual system was invented by men to serve the interests of
men and, not incidentally, to restrict and suppress the interests of women."
Church fathers long ago laid down the principle of woman's guilt
for the existence of death and sin. Augustine blamed the perpetuation of original sin on the "concupiscence" that united male bodies with
female ones under any circumstances, including marriage. 12 Christianity was the first religion to announce that it was sinful just to be alive, on account of having been sexually conceived and born of a wom
an. 13 St. John Chrysostom commanded every Christian father to instill
into his son "a resolute spirit against womankind Let him have no converse with any woman save only his mother. Let him see no woman." 14 Sometimes the writings of Christian men revealed an almost
hysterical fear of woman. Her very glance could "infect, entice, bewitch." Her eyes "poison and intoxicate the mind: yea, her company
induceth impudency, corrupteth virginity, confoundeth and consumeth the bodies, the goods, and the very souls of men. And finally her
body destroyeth and rotteth the very flesh and bones of man's body." Vairus said women become witches because "they have such an
unbridled force of fury and concupiscence naturally. . . . And they are so troubled with evil humors, that out go their venomous exhala
tions, engendered through their illfavored diet, and increased by
means of their pernicious excrements, which they expel." 15
John Aylmer labeled all women "tale-bearers, eavesdroppers, rumor raisers, evil tongued, worse minded, and in every wise doltified
with the dregs of the Devil's dung hill." 16 Similar opinions have been
offered by modern woman-abusers, such as the rapist: "I thought . . . women were trashy, low-down and scummy because that's what I had
been taught." 17 Andrew the Chaplain said woman is "by nature a miser, envious, a
slanderer . . . greedy, a slave to her belly, inconstant, fickle . . . disobe
dient and impatient of restraint, spotted with the sin of pride and
desirous of vainglory, a liar, a drunkard, a babbler, no keeper of secrets, too much given to wantonness, prone to every evil, and never loving any man in her heart." 18
John Scotus Erigena taught that human beings were once without
sin and without sexuality; but after they disobeyed God, they were divided into two sexes. The sinless part was embodied in man, the sinful
part in woman. 19 Other theologians said woman was "the confusion
of man, an insatiable beast, a continuous anxiety, an incessant warfare, a
daily ruin." The church ostensibly made war on the devil, but in actual practice made war on women. "Woman was the Church's rival,
the temptress, the distraction, the obstacle to holiness, the Devil's decoy." 20 Official church literature said:
All wickedness is but little to the wickedness ofa woman [T]he
natural reason is that she is more carnal than a man, as is clear from her
922



many carnal abominations. And it should be noted that there was a defect in the formation ofthe first woman, since she was formed from a bent
rib, that is, a rib of the breast, which is bent as it were in a contrary direction to a man. And since through this defect she is an imperfect animal, she always deceives. 2'
Curiously enough, modern genetic research indicates that the
truth may be something like the reverse of this view. The XY chromo
some that produces a male is physiologically an "incomplete" female
chromosome. Some individuals are born with an XYY chromosome
abnormality, making them genetic super-males. They are said to be
tall, below average in intelligence, and strongly disposed to criminal behavior. 22
This would have surprised men like Orestes Brownson, who
insisted that woman's "ambition and natural love of power" must be
subject to masculine control, otherwise "she is out of her element, and a social anomaly, sometimes a hideous monster, which men seldom
are, excepting through a woman's influence." 23 Such men never bothered to notice that their denunciations of women were self
contradictory; as in this case, for instance, if woman's love of power was
"natural," then in exercising it she would be in her element, not out
of it.
Martin Luther claimed the physical differences between men and women demonstrated God's plan for sexism. "Men have broad and
large chests and small and narrow hips and more understanding than women who have but small and narrow chests and broad hips, to the
end that they should remain at home, sit still, keep house and bear and
bring up children." 24 But if their bearing and bringing up children
wore them out, it was no matter, Luther said: "If women get tired and
die of bearing, there is no harm in that; let them die as long as they
bear; they were made for that." 25
Schopenhauer, who detested women, found nothing likeable about their physical appearance: "It is only the man whose intellect is clouded by his sexual impulses that could give the name of the fair sex
to that undersized, narrow-shouldered, broad-hipped, and shortlegged race. . . . [T]he sympathies that exist between them and men are
skin-deep only, and do not touch the mind or the feelings or the
character." 26 Hartley tends to agree that thanks to Christian tradition,
"An extreme outward sex-attraction has come to veil but thinly a
deep inward sex-antipathy, until it seems almost impossible that women and men can ever really understand one another." 27 Those few Renaissance men who would speak on behalf of
( women were outside the church, and usually suspected of heresy, like Agrippa von Nettesheim, who wrote that women "are treated by the
men as conquered by the conquerors, not by any divine necessity, for any reason, but according to custom, education, fortune, and the
tyrant's opportunity."

slays by law the liberty of woman, abolishes it by use and custom, and extinguishes it by education. For the woman, as soon as she is born, is
from her earliest years detained at home in idleness, and as ifdestitute
ofcapacity for higher occupations, is permitted to conceive ofnothing beyond needle and thread. Then when she has attained years of
puberty she is delivered over to the jealous empire ofa man, or shut up forever in a shop of vestals. The law also forbids her to fill public
offices. No prudence entitles her to plead in open court. 28
There was sex discrimination even in the penalties imposed for
witchcraft. Female witches were more severely punished than male witches. A law of 1683 said that for the crime of causing death by witchcraft, a man may be hanged, but a woman must be burned at the
stake. Men could with impunity kill their wives (e.g., by beating) in the 1650s, but women were burned for killing their husbands, a crime
defined as "petty treason." 29 A self-perpetuating belief in woman's inferior intellect was fostered
by the almost universal custom of keeping women out of schools, all
but a few aristocratic ladies who could receive an expensive private
education. Queen Elizabeth I of England was unsexed by several
historians who thought she was too clever to be female. They claimed
she died in infancy, and a boy was secretly raised in her place. The small minority of educated women were seldom accepted as such. On
one occasion a learned lady was presented as a curiosity to King James I, and he was told she was fluent in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew.
He only inquired, "But can she spin?" 30 The church controlled most schools, and the church would have
no truck with women unless it was unavoidable. St. Columkille made
a rule that no woman could even be buried in the vicinity of a Christian
church, alleging that this was the custom from Christianity's begin
nings. County Tyrone in Ireland still has a Reh'g-na-man, "cemetery of women," located a half-mile from the church where only men were buried in the churchyard. 31 Some churchmen opined that women didn't even have any souls to save. Ockham claimed women did have souls, and on that account should be allowed to vote in church councils.
The pope instantly condemned this as heresy. 32
Josephine K. Henry castigated the churches for their consistently antifemale attitudes over the centuries:
Has the Church ever issued an edict that women must be equal with man before the canon or the civil law, that her thoughts should be incorporated in creed or code, that she should own her own body and property in marriage, or have a legal claim to her children born in wedlock, which
Christianity claims is a "sacrament" and one of the "holy mysteries"!' . . . No institution in modern civilization is so tyrannical and so unjust to woman as is the Christian Church. It demands everything from her and gives her nothing in return. The history ofthe Church does not
contain a single suggestion for the equality of woman Through tyranny and falsehood alone is Christianity able to hold woman in
subjection. n
924



Indeed, women were better served by pre-Christian laws nearly Sexism everywhere. Under the ancient Byzantine code, inheritance laws made no distinction between heirs on the basis of their sex; and although ^^^^^^^^^i
adulterous men were executed, adulterous women were not. 54 After
centuries of Christian revision, the laws freely allowed men to
commit adultery, though their wives could be imprisoned or beaten to death for it. Until 1857, no English woman could obtain a divorce on
any grounds without a special Act of Parliament, which meant only
upper-class women with plenty of political leverage could even hope for a divorce. 35
In 1835, a Mrs. Caroline Norton left her husband after he
repeatedly subjected her to beatings, mental abuse, and infidelity. He kept his mistress in the same house with her. A court ruled that the wife
need not return to the house, but the husband was given their three
children because the wife had "condoned his actions" by staying with
him through all his cruelties. In 1839, the Infants' Custody Act
introduced a slight modification. At his own discretion, a judge in equity
could allow separated mothers to keep children under seven years of
age, or to have visiting rights to older children, provided the mother was not guilty of adultery. 36 Fathers suffered no such restriction, of
course.
Women who refused to submit to the "discipline" of marriage, but
instead played the dangerous game of promising without delivering, were known as jilts. Such women aroused the most violent outbursts of
sexist sentiment, according to an old pamphlet:
Their tricks and devices are numberless, and not to be paralleled by any
thing but their Ingratitude and Inhumanity; there indeed they exceed themselves; nothing in Nature being so perfectly brutish and cruel as one ofthese kind [sic] of Creatures ... a Vermin so ravenous and malicious, and withal so subtle and designing, so formally chaste and
hypocritically virtuous, and yet so scandalously common and impudently lewd, so proud, and yet so mercenary, and above all, so insolently ill natured, that in the short character ofa Jilt, are comprehended all the
Vices, Follies and Impertinences of the whole Sex. . . . In short, I cannot
but fancy them a Colony ofHell-Cats, planted here by the Devil, as a mischiefto Mankind. 37
Noting that women often refused to play fair in the game for
which men made all the rules, even Freud failed to transcend the sexist
attitudes of his time. He wrote: "One cannot resist the thought that
the level of normal morality is different for women. Their superego
never becomes so unshakeable, so impersonal, so independent of its affective origins, as we demand it of a man. Critics since time immemo
rial have reproached women of certain character traits: that they
exhibit less of a sense of justice than men do; that they are less prepared
to submit to the great necessities of life." Since Freud regarded male
domination as one of the great necessities of life, he should hardly have
been surprised to find women resisting it. Simone de Beauvoir said

State University.
every woman knows that "masculine morality, as it concerns her, is a
vast hoax. Man pompously thunders forth his code of virtue and
honor; but in secret he invites her to disobey it, and he even counts on
her disobedience; without it, all that splendid facade behind which he
takes cover would collapse." 38 Since women weren't told the rules of the game, many of them
became losers while they were still too young to figure it out for
themselves. Commenting on Oscar Wilde's homosexuality trial, W.T. Stead remarked, "If Oscar Wilde, instead of indulging in dirty tricks of indecent familiarity with boys and men, had ruined the lives of half a
dozen innocent simpletons of girls, or had broken up the home of his
friend by corrupting his friend's wife, no one could have laid a finger on
him. The male is sacrosanct: the female is fair game." 59
Though women were scorned for being "simpletons," they were even more violently scorned when they tried to develop their minds.
Florence Nightingale's popularity inspired many women to seek educations in medicine, but male students ganged up on them. In 1870 a
group of student doctors formed lines to prevent five women from
entering classes in Surgeons' Hall in London. Medical examiners
tried to embarrass female students with indecent questions. When
women received high marks in examinations, they were passed over, and scholarships were awarded to the men immediately below their
level.
It was the same in other professions. In 1879, Birmingham schoolmasters barred women from employment as teachers of small
boys, on the ground that it would encourage "immorality." Lawyers denied women admission to the Inns of Court. Determined feminist
efforts brought about admission of some women to classes at Queen's College in 1 848; but the Bishop of London excluded women from
Wheatstone's classes on electricity, because they had "congregated too
abundantly" in Sir Charles Lyell's geology classes, keeping more deserving students (i.e., men) from finding places in the classroom. In the field of religion, the Church of England found it "unthinkable"
that women should ever be admitted to the ministry.40 The basic fallacy of sexism in employment or education was
pointed out by Christine Pierce: "We need not fear that women will do what they cannot do." 41 If women were really unable to learn
medicine, law, theology, science, or any other field of endeavor, it would hardly have been necessary for men to exert such efforts to keep
them from learning. The theory of feminine intellectual inferiority began to recede from view when women managed to receive education.
But many men still clung to the belief that women must be less able to think than men.
In 1913 T.E. Reed wrote a book called Sex, Its Origin and
Determination, to prove "scientifically" that women were biologically inferior to men. The author said coitus during an incoming tide
always conceived boys, while coitus during an outgoing tide con
926



ceived girls proving that the female was weaker, born of "waning"
energy. Despite the fact that incoming and outgoing tides differed on every one of the world's coastlines, and infants conceived inland
couldn't be identified with any tide, the theory proved popular. 42
In many ways, sexist thinkers have tried to pretend male domi
nance is "natural" or is a divinely ordained biological mandate. Yet as
other mammalian species demonstrate, such an arrangement could
serve no biological purpose. Any animal species in which males were biologically programmed to attack and injure the females would be at a disadvantage in terms
of species survival, since mammalian young can't grow to maturity without healthy, competent mothers. 43 Thus it is found that, in most
species, males are biologically inhibited from attacking females, even under strong provocation. And the one virtually unbreakable male animal taboo is any kind of interference between a female and the
young she protects.
Karen Homey suggested that men's antagonism may have devel
oped as a result of sexual envy: "The male is sexually dependent on the female to a higher degree than the woman is on him, because in
women part of the sexual energy is linked to generative processes. Could it be that men, therefore, have a vital interest in keeping women
dependent on them? M44 Judith Antonelli says, "Patriarchy is based on the 'phallacy' that the male is creator. Man's original awe and envy
of woman becomes, under patriarchy, resentment and hostility. The only way man can possess female power is through woman, and so he colonizes her, suppressing her sexuality so that it serves him rather
than being the source of her power. . . . Patriarchy is indeed a male

death. Pagan Europe generally described the ghosts of ancestors as
black, like shadows, and desirous of blood, the elixir of rebirth. The shadow was a vulnerable soul because it was external and had
to be carefully preserved from accident. Many superstitious people

posterity.
even today think it dangerous to let their shadows fall across an open
grave, rocky cleft, or swift stream. 1
The Bible shows Joshua and Caleb placing a death-curse on their enemies by saying "Their shadow is departed from them" (Numbers 14:9). This was a typical "doom-saying," supposedly a prophecy to be
fulfilled by its very utterance. One could also give one's soul to a god by dedicating one's shadow to him. Pausanias said human bodies lost their shadows in the sanc
tuary of Zeus Lycaeus (Wolfish Zeus). 2 From such beliefs descended the shadowless "werewolf" or vampire of medieval superstition. Soullessness was indicated by lack of a shadow or a reflection, both of
which were anciently identified with souls.
Like those who pretended to give their shadows to the ancient
gods, those who gave their souls to the devil could be distinguished by
lack of a shadow, according to medieval superstition. The most famous
shadowless man in Jewish folklore was Peter Schlemihl, whose name became a byword for a fool because the devil tricked him into parting
with his shadow. 3 He was apparently based on the biblical patriarch Shelumiel, whose name meant "friend of God," possibly because he gave God his shadow-soul. In Bohemia, Peter Schlemihl was known
as Prschemischl, a hero mated to the legendary Queen Libussa. This
may have been a garbled recollection of the sacred marriage of Pater
Liber and the Goddess Libera. 4
Another version of Pater-Peter and his shadow-soul appeared in
Acts 5:15-16. People troubled by sickness or demonic possession
were brought into a street where the shadow of St. Peter passing by "might overshadow some of them"; and with this kind of soul-contact
"they were healed every one."
In the pagan context, a shadowless man was not a demon, a
werewolf, or a "Schlemihl" but one whose soul had gone into eternal bliss. Plutarch said at the end of the world, the blessed ones would be
happy forever "in a state neither needing food nor casting a shadow." 5
On earth, however, a shadowless state was to be feared. Jews lived
in terror of the "noonday devil" (Keteb), a stealer of shadows. It
made the shadow-soul small and weak at noonday, leaving the owner
vulnerable to demons of disease.6 This shadow-stealing devil also
entered into Christian superstition as the demonium meridianum
(noonday devil).

Shakta Shakta
A male worshipper of the Tantric image of the Great Goddess,
Shakti; a man versed in the techniques of Tantric yoga and identified ^i
with the Goddess herself through sexual union with her earthly
representative. A shakta was also known as a sadhaka or sadhu, possible origin of the "Sadducees" mentioned in the Bible. See Tantrism.
Shakti
Tantric title of the Great Goddess ( Kali Ma), realized both as a
sexual partner and as the innermost, animating soul of man or god, like the Greek Psyche, Roman Anima, Gnostic Sophia, Cabalistic She
kina, all based on the Shakti. Jung said she was the figure known as My
Lady Soul: "Every mother and every beloved is forced to become the
carrier and embodiment of this omnipresent and ageless image, which
corresponds to the deepest reality in a man." '
Shakti is translated "Cosmic Energy." She implies "power, ability,
capacity, faculty, strength, prowess; regal power; the power of com
position, poetic power, genius; the power or signification of a word or term; the power inherent in cause to produce its necessary effect. . . .
[S]hakti'\s the female organ; shakti is the active power of a deity and is
regarded, mythologically, as his goddess-consort and queen." 2 Every god needed his Shakti, or he was helpless to act. The Tantras say "the
female principle antedates and includes the male principle, and . . .
this female principle is the supreme Divinity." ? Tantric doctrine said mortal women are "life itself," and Goddess
like, because they embody the principle of Shakti. The sages "hold women in great esteem and call them Shaktis and to ill-treat a Shakti,
that is, a woman, is a crime." A Tantric synonym for "woman" was
Shaktiman, "Mind of Shakti" or "Possessor of Shakti." 4
A Shakti was also a spirit-wife, or female guardian angel, who could be incarnate in the earthly wife or mistress, or a wholly
supernatural figure. "An important division of the 'mythology of woman' is devoted to showing that it is always a feminine being who helps
the hero to conquer immortality or to emerge victorious from his
initiatory ordeals. . . . Every Teleut shaman has a celestial wife who lives in the seventh heaven, where he meets her and makes love to her
during his ecstatic journeys." 5 Final union with the Shakti occurred at the moment of death,
according to Tantric mystics. She was both the individual and the
cosmic Goddess, absorbing the soul and body of the dying sage into
herself, an experience of unsurpassable bliss on his part. "The possession of her, the cosmic Shakti, the living embodiment of the
principle of beauty and youth eternal, is the ultimate quest, the very
highest prize." 6 The Kulacudamani Nigama said not even God could become the

supreme Lord unless Shakti entered into him. All things arose from
their union, but she said, "There is none but Myself Who is the Mother to create." The Lalita Sahasranamam said "The series of universes
appear and disappear with the opening and shutting of Her eyes." As the god required her power before he could do anything at all, so her
worshipper on earth required the power of his own Istadevata, Shakti or
lady-love. 7 The same system was followed by Middle-Eastern mystics like the
Sufis, who deemed the mystic lady-love or fravashi essential to any man's enlightenment. Early Christian Gnostics also worshipped Shakti under such names as Sophia, Pneuma, Eide, or Anima. Gnostic writings show that post-mortem union with one's own soul was per
ceived in sexual symbolism, as in the Mandaean Liturgies for the
Dead: the soul or "image" (Eide) embraces and caresses the dead man
like a beloved woman. This Tantric idea came into the west by way
of the Avesta doctrine that, after the death of a believer, his own conscience would welcome him "in the form of a fair maiden." 8

before Christianity appeared in their land. It stood for her triple "door," and her God sometimes bore the title of Trefuilngid Tre

Carved representation of a naked woman squatting with her knees
apart, displaying her vulva, shown as a vesica piscis or double-pointed oval. Sometimes the figure presented the vesica with both hands or
drew it open with one. Sheila-na-gig figures appeared all over old Irish churches built before the 16th century. 1 Many were still in place
during the 19th century, but Victorian prudery defaced or destroyed large numbers of them. Some have been found buried near the
churches they once embellished. 2
Sheila-na-gig figures closely resembled the yonic statues of Kali which still appear at the doorways of Hindu temples, where visitors
lick a finger and touch the yoni "for luck." Some of the older figures
have deep holes worn in their yonis from much touching. 3
The protruding ribcage on many examples of the sheila-na-gig
imitates the figures of Kali as the death-goddess, Kalika, evidently remembered in Ireland as the Caillech or "Old Woman," who was also
the Creatress and gave birth to all races of men. 4 Celts generally
protected doorways with some female-genital fetish, which is why they settled on the horseshoe, classic Omega-sign of the Kalika. In India it
stood for the feminine cosmos within which Shiva ever performed his
creative sexual dance, although he was assimilated to the Kalika and
given her title of Destroyer. 5 Derivation of the term sheila-na-gig is obscure. It meant something like "vulva-woman." Gig or giggie meant female genitals and
may have been related to the Irish "jig," from French gigue, in
931



Shekina pre-Christian times an orgiastic dance. In ancient Erech a gig seems to Shfol have been a holy yoni; the sacred harlots of the temple were known
^^^^^^^^^^^ as nu-gig.6

Shekina
Jewish-cabalistic version of Shakti; the female soul of God, who couldn't be perfect until he could be reunited with her. Cabalists said it
was God's loss of his Shekina that brought about all evils. The
Hebrew Sh'kina meant "dwelling-place," a hint that God had no "home" without her. Like her Tantric counterpart the Shakti, the
Sh'kina was the source of all "soul" in the universe. Gnostic Christians
of the 4th century spoke of the Sh'kina as a "spirit of glory" in whom Beings of Light lived, as children in their mother's body or house. Mani
referred to the Aeons as sh'kinas, or female spirits of the sacred year. 1
Cabalists taught that it was essential to bring male and female
cosmic principles together again, which might be done by sexual magic, signifying union of the sun (man) and moon (woman). This was
graphically expressed by the hexagram. Philosophy of the Cabala said the supernal mother Shekina is manifested in the earthly mother,
with whom her husband should lie on the Sabbath, because "all the
six days of the week derive their blessing" from this coupling. Rabbi
Eliahu di Vidas said, "Who has not experienced the force of
passionate love for a woman will never attain to the love of God." 2
Jewish mystics said the "outer garment" of the Shekina is Torah,
"Holy Law." A man became a Bridegroom of Torah by study, symbolized in erotic imagery. He must court her like a beautiful
maiden. "She begins from behind a curtain to speak words in keeping
with his understanding, until very slowly insight comes to him." The Shekina as "Indwelling One" might be compared to the Latin I-dea, or Goddess Within. "She opens the door of her hidden chamber ever so
little, and for a moment reveals her face to her lover, but hides it
again forthwith He alone sees it and he is drawn to her with his heart and soul and his whole being." 3
As a man required his Shekina for enlightenment, so God required his Shekina for wisdom and creativity. This crucial tenet of cabalistic doctrine is seldom emphasized or even mentioned today.

Sheol
Hebrew "Pit," cavern, womb, or underworld; related to the uterine paradise-garden called Shal-Mari in Tibet and Shalimar in India. 1 In its
932



earliest forms, Sheol was the Virgin's "enclosed garden" of flowers,
fruits, fountains, and fairy-nymphs. Sacred kings who died on trees went to this other world. The Markandeya Purana mentioned an underground realm where men's souls were impaled on trees. 2 Shal-Mari probably became Sheol-Mari in the Middle East, where
Mari was Ishtar, and there was a long tradition of hanging human
sacrifices on trees.

Shibboleth
Hebrew "ear of corn," the mystical object displayed as the Ultimate Revelation in temples of Astarte and Demeter: present food and future
seed, current life and life yet to come. At Eleusis, the central Mystery
was "an ear of corn reaped in silence." J
Old Testament writers supposed that the shibboleth was Astarte's
dying-and-reborn god Baal. Shibboleth was used as a password because some tribes couldn't pronounce it (Judges 12:6). Patriarchal
opposition to the symbol later made it synonymous with a false deity, a meaning that remained up to the present time.

Shin-Mu
"Mother of Perfect Intelligence," China's Holy Virgin, who miracu
lously conceived her firstborn son, a Savior and spirit of the grain. Her
infant "came like a lamb, with no bursting or rending, with no hurt or
harm," and was tenderly adored by sheep and oxen. 1 After producing this child, Shin-Mu resumed her archaic Great
Mother character and gave birth to 33,333 creatures. Patriarchal
myths deprived her of a vagina, and so insisted all these creatures were
born from her arms or breast. A Christian traveler in China explained Shin-Mu's miraculous motherhood: she had "no place on her body
whence to bring them forth as other women of the world, whom for
sin God hath subjected to filthiness of corruption, to show how filthy
sin is." 2
After she was virginized and even deprived of a vagina, Shin-Mu's
only remaining connection with sexuality was similar to the virgin
Mary's: she continued to be the divine patroness of whores. 3
Persians diabolized her and called her Shimnu, the "Great Devil,"
so called in a Manichean Confession-Prayer found at Turfan and in
the Cave of a Thousand Buddhas, at Tun-huang. 4

Ship Ship Teutonic Schiff, "ship," descended from Old Norse skop, meaning
^^^^^^^^ "Fate" and also "genitals."
1 It was a symbol of the Goddess Frigga
(Freya), whose name also gave rise to "frigging" and "frigate"; she
ruled the ship-shaped burial mounds. 2 From these mounds evolved the Norman temples, laid out in the form of a ship, navis, on which the nave or "belly" of a Christian church was modeled. Both "navel" and "naval" once referred to the
burial shrine likened to a ship and the Mother's womb at the same
time. The Norse death ship vessel of the famous "Viking funeral"
was called ludr, meaning boat, coffin, and cradle. 3 It took the dead
back to their Mother-sea; the Norsemen's expression for "death" was
"to return to the mother's womb." 4 The pagan Welsh similarly sent their dead back to the marine womb and called their funeral dirges
marwysgafen, "Giving-back-to-the-Sea-Mother." 5 The vessel of death and rebirth was always feminine, which may be why a ship is still
"she."
Egypt's Lord of Death, Osiris-Seker, was carried away in a boat under the auspices of a priest entitled "great chief of the hammer,"
the same title held by Thor. The god came to life again in the "morning
boat," tended by a spirit named Matet, evidently the same as Mater Matuta, the Dawn-Mother. 6 Matet was an emanation of Isis the
Mother, to whom the solar boat was dedicated.
Romans worshipped Isis as a ship-goddess, the boat being a symbol of her womb, each of her temples having a "bark of Isis" carved in
stone at the entrance. The Roman temple where Isis's holy boat was kept became a Christian church under the name of Santa Maria della
Navicella: Our Lady of the Boat. 7 Isis-figures in boats, kept in pagan
temples throughout Europe, gave rise to the curious fairy tale collected by Grimm under the title of "The Witch in the Stone Boat."
Many "witches" or Goddess-figures appeared in boats even during| the nominally Christian era. A 1 2th-century chronicler spoke of
singing, dancing processions that followed sacred ships mounted on wheels, containing as he put it "I know not what evil genius."8 One suspects the chronicler knew perfectly well that the wheeled ship contained a pagan Goddess. Up to the late Middle Ages, the Goddess's wheeled ship was drawn through the streets of Flemish town*
by the weavers' guilds, accompanied by half-naked male and female dancers whose behavior, churchmen said, was "scandalously bacchanalian." 9 The Midsummer festival at Douai in 1770 featured a huge
Wheel of Fortune, emblem of the Fate-goddess, and a dry-land ship
filled with people who made "strange gestures," recalling the images of ancestral spirits in the ship of Arianrhod which was also a starwheel. 10 See Wheel.
Ships were associated with orgiastic rites from the earliest manifes
tations of the ship as a womb symbol and an earthly imitation of the
934



crescent moon. Oriental sages called the moon "the Ark or vessel of
boat-like shape, symbol of fertility or the Container of the Germ of all
life." 11

Shiva
Shiva
Oldest god of the Vedic male trinity (Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva) formed in imitation of the older female trinity. Like the Great Goddess whose son, lover, and victim he was, Shiva had many names. Sometimes he alone was a trinity, or a three-headed god, bearer of the trident or triple phallus which enabled him to mate with the Triple Mother. 1
Shiva was "in a state of actualization because he is in bodily
contact with his own universal energy, the Shakti, the Goddess, the
feminine active principle, the efficient and material cause of the uni
verse, the Maya that evolves the differentiated elements and beings.
Sakala Shiva bears on his head the crescent of the moon." 2
Shiva was called Lord of Yoga, i.e., of the "yoke" that bound him
to the Goddess. He was also Lord of Death, called Shava, the
Corpse, prostrate under the feet of Kali as she devoured his entrails a
Hindu parallel of the dead Osiris shown as the Still-Heart, a mummy,
dead and yet alive. 3
Among Shiva's many other titles were Great Lord, Lord of the
Dance, Lord of Cattle (Pasupati), Beneficent One (Sankara), Lord Who Is Half Woman (Ardhanarisvara), God with the Moon in His
Hair (Candrasekhara), He Who Belongs to the Triple Goddess, He
Who Gives and Takes Away, Consort of the Goddess Uma, Condemned One, Destroyer, Howler. 4 Tantric yogis insisted that their supreme Shiva was the only god,
and all other gods were only inferior imitations of him. He was
certainly older than the Vedic heaven-gods. A deity like Shiva was shown under the feet of a Kali-like squatting Goddess on Sumerian
cylinder seals of 2300 B.C. 5 Cultures of Sumeria and the Indus valley
were in contact at very early periods. Shiva's worshippers may have been literally correct in viewing other gods as recent upstarts. Some of their scriptures claimed that Brahma and Vishnu were so puny that
they couldn't even realize the limits of Shiva's cosmic lingam (phallus).6
As a sexual god, Shiva epitomized the Tantric ideal of maithuna,
insuring the orgasmic pleasure of his partner while controlling his own, to partake of her sexual energy. He advocated the female-superior position also favored by such Middle-Eastern Goddesses as Hecate,
Lilith, and Asherah the position usually forbidden by patriarchs. 7 The Brahmana Purana said the female-superior position was a "reversal"

935



Skkfurttu Gautama practiced by Shiva and lusted after by the "daughters of the sages" of
old; but proper Brahmans must regard it as a perversion. 8
Vedic myths portray hostility between Brahma and Shiva, even though the two were eventually regarded as components of the same trinity. Shiva's priests claimed that Brahmadeva (Brahma-god) was nothing more than a servant of Shiva under his archaic name of
Rudra Mokshakala, "Liberated Black Rudra." Brahmans retaliated by
belittling Shiva as "an evil yogi," whose cult was only "worship of the lingam"; if Brahma was Shiva's servant, at least the servant didn't take
up the same "self-indulgence" or "hideous activities" as the master.
Like western underground gods, Shiva was easily diabolized because he was already the Great Black One (Mahakala), confused with Yama
and Ganesha, the Lord of Hosts, who begot his reincarnations on
Maya-Kali. 9 As Lord of the Dance, Shiva represented one of Hinduism's most
subtle concepts. He copied Kali's Dance of Life, supposedly directing and controlling by its rhythm the constant movement in time and space
of all material things. Shiva performed this dance in a place called
Chidambaram, the "Center of the Universe"; but the location of this
place is within the human heart. 10 The sages' implications were that
(1) the heartbeat is the basic rhythm to which all human music is
related, because it is heard even by the unborn infant in the paradise
state of intrauterine life, and it is never forgotten; and (2) each human
being secretly regards his own heart as the center of the universe
indeed, therefore the god is located within the core of man's own self.
Shiva was seldom depicted alone, for his power depended on his union with Kali, his feminine energy, without whom he could not
act. The puzzling vision of Shiva as Shava the Corpse, under the
Goddess's feet, illustrated the "doctrine that Shiva without his Shakti
can do and is, so far as the manifested is concerned, nothing." Yet
joined to the Goddess, he became the Bindu or spark of creation.
Every human orgasm was believed to share in this creative experience
as "an infinitesimally small fragment and faint reflection of the creative act in which Shiva and Shakti join to produce the Bindu which
is the seed of the universe." n A Tantric yogi in sexual union with his
yogini or Shakti could attain the experience of yoga, "linking" himself
with godhood, and in his ecstasy exclaim Shivaham "I Am Shiva." 12

Siddhartha Gautama
Seventh in a line of reincarnated Buddhas, still to come to earth once
more as the eighth avatar Maitreya, who awaits beyond space-time, in
936



the form of a bodhisattva, his next and final Coming at the end of the Siduri Sabitu
world. 1
Siegfried Siddhartha literally means "rich in magic," siddhi being the magic ^^^^^^^^^^^
power controlled by a master yogi. Tantric texts claimed such a sage
could walk on water, make himself invisible, create and destroy matter, and turn base elements into gold, as credulous alchemists tried to do
for many centuries. 2
Siddhi was an international word. The Sufi word for the magic power of an enlightened sage was sihr} The Kalmuks descended from "Mother Kali" called their sacred tales and magic formulae
Siddhi-Kur. 4 Norse myths said the gods learned from Mother Freya
their magic power over elements and spirits, the seidr. In the Loka
senna, Odin was reproached for practicing seidr because it was a
female craft, property of the Goddess. 5 The Lapps worshipped the seidi
(spirit-power) of their deities. 6 The Celts called their matriarchal
fairy-lore sidh, pronounced "she." The center of the Celtic otherworld was Caer Sidi, the revolving hub of the Goddess's karmic wheel.

Siduri Sabitu
Babylonian Goddess of the wine of eternal life. She advised Gilga
mesh to give up his quest for immortality, for the gods kept her "wine' for themselves and refused to share it with humans. 1 She became the
Saki of Arabian Sufi mystics, serving the wine of paradise to the
enlightened.

Siegfried
Teutonic hero par excellence: dragon-slayer, warrior, winner of the
Queen of the Valkyries, strongman, and ritually-slain sacred king. One legend said Siegfried's father was King Sigmund of Tarlungaland, his
mother Queen Sisibe, a prototype of Snow White; for, suspected of adultery, she was sent into the forest with a huntsman who had orders
to cut out her tongue, but he did not. The queen died in giving birth to
Siegfried, who was set afloat on the river in a vessel of glass and taken ashore by a doe, who nursed him until he was found by the smith
Mimir, who raised him. According to another story, Siegfried was nursed by a she-wolf, and his early name was Wolfdietrich. 1
Siegfried's later adventures are the subject matter of the Nibelung
enlied and other epic romances: how he slew the dragon Fafnir and
married Brunnhilde ("Burning Hel"), and was slain in a typical Liebes
tod (Love-Death) after which he was reunited with his mystic bride.
He was a Germanic Heracles, with many elements of the sun-hero.

Sige Simon Magus
Sige "Silence," Gnostic name for the Creatress, sometimes called the grandmother of God. Out of her was born the first Word; this was the
Logos of creation. Like Mother Night, she stood at the beginning of all things and represented the state of chaos or nonexistence before the
universe took form. See Sophia, Saint.
Clementine Homilies Greek writings falsely attributed to a
first-century bishop of Rome; actually composed by an anonymous Christian apologist toward the end of the
4th century.
Simon Magus
"Simon the Mage" was one of the principal rivals of the Christians'
cult-hero in the first century a.d. The Clementine Homilies said Simon
was one of the Essenes, and a disciple of John the Baptist, and the founder of Gnostic Christianity. Simon was said to have appeared in Samaria as God the Father, in Palestine as the Son, and in the rest of
the nations as the Holy Spirit. He was even canonized, in the guise of a
"St. Simon" allegedly chosen "bishop of Jerusalem" in 62 a.d., after leading a group of Essenic eremites in the village of Pella, beyond Jordan. Followers of Simon were still numerous in the 4th century
A.D.' From the orthodox viewpoint, the trouble with Simon was that his
sect welcomed women and held that the world-creating power was as much female as male. Simon's heaven was sevenfold, after the classic
pattern, and ruled by three pairs of male-and-female Powers, Roots,
or Aeons, all born of a great female source with the power of concep
tion, the origin of all things. Simon said God the Father came out of her, and was not called Father until she had named him Father. 2
Simon traveled with a sacred harlot named Helen, whom he called
his First Thought (Ennoia). She was a reincarnation of Helen of Troy, Inanna, Athene, and other Goddesses. Simon claimed that, with her, in his former god-incarnation he had created the world. Simon
ians worshipped her as Sophia, the Gnostic Virgin of Light, and insisted
that she had mothered Jesus. As a Holy Whore (Prunikos), she represented the fallen Ennoia for whose sake God descended and clothed himself in flesh, in the person of Simon. "World salvation was bound up with her redemption by him." 3
Simonians said those who placed their faith in Simon and Helen
would be saved by this grace, without need of works. The relationship between Simon and Helen was like that of the Gnostic Christ and his
sacred harlot Mary Magdalene, who was similarly called Pistis
Sophia-Prunikos (Faith-Wisdom-Whore). She embodied Sophia, who
was Jesus's spouse in heaven. 4 Gnostic Gospels said Jesus gave the mystic secret of the keys to the kingdom of heaven not to Peter, but to Mary; and Peter reacted with jealousy and hostility toward Mary and all women. 5
Peter was also hostile toward Simon Magus. According to the Acts
938



of the Apostles, Peter rebuked Simon for trying to buy the apostles' Simon Magus
secret of "laying on of hands" to cure diseases and cast out devils (Acts
8:18). From this biblical tale came the term simony buying and ^^i^
selling priestly benefices and powers a sin to which the medieval heirs
of "Peter" were especially prone. The author or authors of Acts had
no good to say of Simon, who was called a false prophet, one who "bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some
great one: to whom they all gave heed . . . saying, This man is the great
power of God" (Acts 8:9-10). Like Peter, Simon was supposed to have visited Rome and
impressed the crowned heads with his miracles. Christians invented a
story about Simon to explain the inscription on a statue of the old Sabine god Semo Sancus. The inscription was Semoni deo sancto,
which some semiliterate "authority" rendered The Holy God Simon,
claiming that the statue was raised by Nero in honor of Simon Magus, after Simon allowed himself to be beheaded by Nero's execu
tioner. Then, by magic art, he substituted a ram for himself, and on
the third day rose from the dead before Nero, after the manner of all
savior-gods. 6 The Acts of Peter and Paul asserted that Simon flew over the
Campus Martius in a chariot drawn by winged demons. In the midst
of his triumph, his enemy Peter recited a magic formula that caused him
to fall and break his neck. 7 During the 8th century, Pope Paul I built
a church "on the exact spot" where Simon Magus fell to his death the
exact spot having been discovered through a private revelation from
the Holy Ghost. In 850, Pope Leo IV reconstructed this church and
named it Santa Maria Nova the New Holy Mary. After his death, Simon was succeeded by another Gnostic hero, Menander, "Moon-man." 8 This seems to have been a reincarnated Simon, assimilated to the moon. The rivalry between Peter and Simon
Menander suggests the battles between those Christians who
worshipped the Essenic sun god whose priests were Pater, Petra, or Peter and those who worshipped the lunar hero. The controversy
suggests a schismatic breaking away from a parent cult: it must be remembered that Peter's name was Simon before Jesus changed it to
Peter (Matthew 10:2), and that Peter too was a "Mage."
The Magi discovered the advent of Jesus by astrological magic, according to the Christian story; this was put forth as one of the
proofs of Jesus's divinity. Therefore, Christians were reluctant to discredit any of the Magi. In Simon's case however, the early fathers
were implacably opposed to the main feature of his doctrine: "the
earthly incarnation of the heavenly mother. . . . Leaders of the ortho
dox Church fought from the very beginning of Christianity against such glorification of women." 9 Writings attributed to Simon made extensive use of feminine symbols: paradise was the womb, Eden the
placenta. "The river that flows forth from Eden symbolizes the navel,

which nourishes the fetus [T]he Exodus, consequently, signifies the passage out of the womb, and . . . 'the crossing of the Red Sea refers
to the blood.' " 10 Such feminine imagery linked Simon with priests of the Old Religion. In Ireland he was known as Simon the Druid. 11 The Latin cognomen Faustus, "Favored One," was bestowed on
Simon early in the Christian era. "The fact that he was accompanied by a Helena whom he claimed to be the reborn Helen of Troy shows clearly that we have here one of the sources of the Faust legend of the early Renaissance. Surely few admirers of Marlowe's and Goethe's
plays have an inkling that their hero is the descendant of a gnostic
sectary, and that the beautiful Helen called up by his art was once the
fallen Thought of God through whose raising mankind was to be
saved." 12

Sign of Sin
Sin
The original Moon-god of Mount Sinai, "Mountain of the Moon." He was born of the Virgin Queen of Heaven, Nanna or Inanna. He ruled the Land of Sinim (Isaiah 49:12), which meant "land of the lunar mountain" and was an older form of Zion. His Chaldean name
was Kingu. He was the god who received the Tablets of Law from
the primal Mother of Creation, Tiamat. As Moses's god, he still had the same mountain-throne and the same tablets. A biblical scholar has
pointed out that "the Jehovah of the Hebrews" was merely another transformation of "the primitive lunar deity of Arabia." ' The god Moses met on Mount Sinai claimed to be the god of
Abraham, though he said Abraham knew him by a different name
(Exodus 6:3). In fact, Abraham may have been the same deity. Very ancient documents used the name Abraham or Ab-ram as a synonym
for Ab-Sin, Moon-father. 2 In the 1 2th century B.C., the Babylonian
heaven was ruled by a trinity consisting of Shamash, Sin, and Ishtar, represented by the sun, moon, and stars. 3

Sirens
Homer's word for the magic women of Cyrene, who cast spells on ships to cause them to be wrecked on the rocky coast. The "sweet
songs" by which the Sirens lured Odysseus's sailors were spells to
draw foreign ships into the Cyrenian shallows, where natives apparently carried on a profitable trade as wreckers.
940



Sita Sita
"Furrow," the Goddess Earth as the wife of Rama (Krishna) in the a '
Ramayana. A personification of the yoni, mated to the phallic "ram" ^^^^m
whose name meant "sexual enjoyment." See Furrow.
Skadi var. Scatha, Scotia
The Celto-Teutonic Goddess in her "Destroyer" aspect. Like the
Greek Persephone, "Destroyer," she was Queen of the Shades, Mother Death. Her name was the root of Gothic skadus, Old English sceadu, "shadow, shade." She was the Shadow into which all the gods went at
doomsday, called Gotterdammerung, or Going-Into-the-Shadow-ofthe-Gods. 1 As Scotia, she was the Dark Goddess like Black Kali, the Caillech after whom Scotland was named. 2
Like Kali, Skadi had to be propitiated each year with an outpouring of male blood in primitive sacrificial rites. Her annual victim was
assimilated to the god Loki, who became a "savior" by fertilizing Skadi
with his blood. Loki's genitals were attached by a rope to a goat, and a
tug-of-war ensued, until Loki's flesh gave way and he fell into Skadi's
lap, thus bathing her loins in his blood. The gods watched anxiously
to see if Skadi smiled; and when she did, it means spring could return
once more to the land. 3
Similar blood-rites were practiced all over the ancient world, when
men sought godhood by giving their blood to the Goddess, before animal sacrifices replaced human ones, and even afterward. It was not
uncommon for priestesses representing the Goddess to bathe in
sacrificial blood, like the women who sacrificed Apis the bull-god in
Egypt, hoisting their skirts as they dismembered him so his spurting
blood would quicken their wombs. 4 Like many death-goddess figures, Skadi collected the penises of her castrated heroes, and in this character she was named Mornir, "troll-woman." 5
Remnants of the bloody sacrifice of Loki and the goat could still be
found in Norway and Sweden in the late 1 7th century. Churchmen
vainly denounced the masquerades, sexual promiscuity, and "goat games" associated with Easter and other religious festivals.6
Skadi was a dark twin of Freya, therefore virtually identical with
the underground Goddess Hel. She was once all the Earth, birthgiver and devourer of her children. The entire land mass of Scandinavia
was named after her. Originally it was Scadin-auja, the land of Skadi. 7
A variation of her name, Skuld, was given to the third of the three
Fates, or Norns, in the role of destroying Crone. Naturally she became the patroness of witches, whose activities came to be called
"skulduggery." To the Celts, she was Scatha or Scath. Her underground realm of the dead was "the Land of Scath." Like Persephone's underworld
941



SkakJ within seven loops of the Styx, the Land of Scath was a city of seven Slavery walls. 8 It was variously located under the earth, or in heaven, or far
^^^^^^^^^^ away over the sea on a western island, the land of "Sky." Cu Chulainn
and other Celtic heroes learned magic skill in martial arts from a visit
to Queen Scatha's island of Skye. She kept the hero for "a year and a
day," the usual mythic image of the old 1 3-month lunar year with its
intercalary day. When she had taught a man all she knew, she sent him back to earth a fey man, set apart and sacer, fated to do great deeds
and die a sacrificial death.9 The legend suggests that the real island of
Skye was a cult center of the Goddess, and warriors went there to be
initiated into their heroic profession.
Skadi is still invoked by place names in Sweden, such as Skadave
(Skadi's temple) and Skadalungr (Skadi's grove). 10

Scandinavian poet-shaman, probably derived from Skadi or Skuld, as
a Goddess of inspiration. A great skald was believed to have words of
power; what he sang or prophesied would come true. He was able to
address the death goddess herself, via funerary ballads, and appeal to her to treat the deceased well. Norse sagas and eddaic poetry were the
work of skalds who belonged to a priestly class, like druids. See
Romance.
Slavery
The de Paors wrote naively of the life of a slave in early Christian
Ireland: "Even if he was a slave he had the advantage of living in a
society which had accepted the teachings of Christianity." ' This
wasn't much of an advantage, considering that in pagan society he would not have been a slave at all. The United States in the 19th
century had also accepted the teachings of Christianity, but this was of little benefit to the slaves on southern plantations.
In effect, the feudalism upheld by the Christian churches was a
slave state. Serfs were at the mercy of their overlords, who held the power of life and death over them. Serfs could be bought and sold with the land. Though they were taxed to support the church and the
nobility, they were without legal rights. The "teachings" of Christianity paid no attention to the plight of the serfs, nor did the churches make any effort to alleviate their sufferings.
Church fathers were even more concerned to keep women in a
state of subjection throughout all social strata, so that each male even
at the slave level had at least one slave of his own: a wife. St. Augustine
942



lid wives should be slaves to their husbands, and husbands had the Sleipnir right to beat and abuse them. To a wife who had been beaten he would Smashana-Kali
say, "It is the duty of servants to obey their masters. . . . [Y]ou have ^^^^^^^^^^
made a contract of servitude." 2 St. Thomas Aquinas said a male slave
was superior to a wife, because a male slave was not in subjection
"according to the law of nature," but a wife was "subject to the man on account of the weakness of her nature, both of mind and body." 3 In other words, Aquinas believed that might makes right; weakness must be
dominated by strength. Of course this was not always the rule in all
male relationships, only in male-female ones.
The combination of slavery and sexism in Christian societies made
the lot of female slaves particularly onerous. They were completely
helpless in the hands of their masters, and could be raped, tortured, or
murdered with impunity. Even in "enlightened" 19th-century America, female slaves were in a singularly unenviable position.
Dr. James Marion Sims, known as the American "father of
gynecology," was famed as the inventor of a surgical technique for curing vesicovaginal fistula. He also performed hundreds of clitoridectomies and ovariotomies to cure "sex-related diseases" in women.
What is usually not told about his career is the way he developed his
techniques. Before the Civil War, he kept women slaves in a disused
jailhouse and made them his guinea pigs, performing hundreds of
experimental and exploratory operations on them until they died off one by one and were replaced by fresh victims. 4 Sims's career and
writings bear out what some psychologists have suspected, that early
gynecological surgeons were fundamentally women-haters with a sadistic bent.
In patriarchal societies, said Marx, "Woman's true qualities are warped to her disadvantage, and all the moral and delicate elements in her nature become the means for enslaving her and making her
suffer." 5

Sleipnir
Odin's eight-legged gray horse, a Norse symbol of death, likened to
the gallows-tree on which Odin hung. Skalds called the gallows "highchested rope-Sleipnir," carrying men to the land of death. The same
word meant "gallows tree" and "horse" (drasil).
1 See Horse; Odin.
l.Turville-Petre,48.
Smashana-Kali
Kali Ma as the Goddess of cremation grounds and other places of death. The yantra (symbol) of Smashana-Kali was doubly yonic: an
943



Smith eight-petaled lotus with multiple repetitions of the inverted triangle
that meant "female genitals."
1 The meaning of the yantra of Smashana
Kali was rebirth following death. Her priestesses, called dakinis, arranged funerals and tended the dying. In the after-world they became
psychopomps. 1 . Muhnnirvunatantm, 360.
Smith
A recurrent story about Amazons was that they deliberately crippled certain men, members of a special caste of metalworkers and smiths whose deformity became their caste mark. The Amazonian smithgod Hephaestus was lame. Some said he was lamed when Zeus cast him down from heaven to the underworld for trying to defend his mother
Hera. Others said he was lamed by Hera herself. Hephaestus shared a
temple with Athene, renowned as an instructress of smiths. She
taught smithcraft to Daedalus, the builder of the Cretan Labyrinth. 1
Many myths point to a continuing relationship between smithcraft and the worship of the Goddess. Egyptian priests of Isis were mesniu, "smiths." 2 Aphrodite ruled the copper mines and metalworking schools
of her sacred isle, Cyprus ("Copper"). Medieval alchemists contin
ued to call copper the Metal of Venus. The lame smith Hephaestus also
claimed Aphrodite as his bride. The primal sea-goddesses loved him,
despite his deformity. "Golden women" helped him in his workshop on the isle of Lemnos, traditional home of militant Amazons. 3
Smiths often claimed magic powers stemming from secret connection with the feminine forces of nature. Roman faber meant both
"smith" and "magician." Russian folk tales portrayed smiths as assistants
of witches. Exorcisms attributed to St. Patrick claimed to avert the
spells of "women, smiths, and druids." 4 The Yakuts said "Smiths and shamans are from the same nest," believing smiths could heal,
prophesy, and work miracles. Secret societies linking metallurgy and
magic appear in the traditions of China and Japan, as in those of medieval alchemists, craft fraternities, and German Mannerbunde. 5 The German name Schmidt (Smith) once referred to a priestly
caste of metalworking shamans, who were also bards. Their apotheosized founder was Wayland the Smith in Scandinavia, Volund a consort of the Triple Goddess. He encountered her in totemic form, as three doves flying above a sacred spring.6
English tradition said Wayland the Smith lived within the Berkshire hill marked by the 370-foot image of the White Horse of
Uffington. If horses were brought to him at night and left, with money, at one of the standing stones, he would shoe them before the coming of the dawn. 7
Mongols said the seven stars of Ursa Major which the Hindus called Seven Rishis were the skulls of seven smiths who had been
944



raised to the sky by the Goddess. The constellation was a special patron Snake
of smiths. 8 Christian folklore said the man in the moon was Cain, Sneeze
whose name meant "smith"; the Cainites or Kenites were the special ^^^-^^^^^^
caste of metalworkers in ancient Palestine, until they were driven out
of the country (1 Samuel 13:19). See Cain.
The Irish said the celestial smith was Luno (Moon-man), a lame
craftsman like Hephaestus. He made Fingal's magic sword.9 Merlin
too was a smith; he forged Arthur's magic armor. 10 Christian syncretism
even represented the God who impregnated the virgin Mary as "the Smith from above" who threw his hammer into her breast probably a
new version of Thor, as an apotheosized Wayland. 11 When the old gods were made devils, smithcraft was associated with devil's work. Numerous cathedral bells were said to have been
forged by the devil. 12 The devil was also the Master Smith who forged the original ironwork doors of Notre Dame de Paris, which were replaced by new doors in I860. 13
Gypsies were often described as smiths, and many adopted the surname of Smith. 14 The prejudice against ironworkers included
gypsies. This prejudice was particularly notable in Abyssinia where ironworkers were restricted to a special caste, excluded from the rites
of the church, and believed to possess the evil eye. 15
Along with the smiths, other medieval European craft guilds were considered subversive by Christian orthodoxy. The guild of free
masons, for example, maintained their own ceremonies, secrets, and semi-religious doctrine. "The Church, not without the semblance of reason, will regard the Masonic brotherhood as her most treacherous and dangerous enemy, which aims to dismantle her work and reconstruct it in another spirit." 16 The smiths' guilds were even more
suspect at one time, to the point where the church even felt it
necessary to dissolve some of them.

Sneeze
Roman paganism contributed the traditional "God bless you" or Gesundheit (May you have health) offered to one who sneezed. The
old expression was "Jupiter preserve you" or "Jupiter help me." ' Its basis was the ancient Indo-European concept of the air-soul or breath
soul (Atman), which might be expelled from the body by a violent
945



Solomon and Sheba rush of air unless prevented by a verbal charm. Covering the mouth during a yawn arose from the same fear of losing the soul. Medieval
^^^^^^^^^^ churchmen accepted the superstition, and taught that both sneezing and
yawning should be immediately protected by the sign of the cross, because "Ofttimes a man sneezed, and expired at the moment of sneezing. ... In like manner it often befell that a man yawned, and
fell dead." 2
The primitive idea of the air-soul was closely associated with
sneezing by the Polynesians. The first man on earth was kneaded of red clay moistened with the deity's blood that is, the same combination of menstrual blood and earth that ancient Semites called
adamah and was animated by the deity's breath. Then the clay effigy came to life and sneezed. The name of this first man was Tiki-ahua,
or The Creator's Sneeze. Ahua, or "likeness," was a sound-word for "sneeze." 3 Thus the man made "in God's image" was the same as a man made "by God's sneeze."
The Christian custom of saying "God bless you" to a sneezer was
meant to serve as shorthand for extreme unction, in the event that
the soul happened to leave the body. Hindus still take similar precau
tions when someone yawns. They snap their fingers to frighten the soul away from the open mouth and back down the throat where it
belongs.

Solomon and Sheba
Solomon meant Sun God of On, the Jewish version of Ra of
Heliopolis. 1 Solomon was the one Jewish king with pretensions to ruling a Golden Age of glory. The wonders of his reign were attributed to
his wisdom, supposedly the gift of Yahweh, though the Bible inconsistentfy declares that Solomon didn't worship Yahweh. Solomon's famous temple was built not by himself but by King Hiram of Tyre, to
whom Solomon was forced to pay tribute (1 Kings 5:1 1). The deities
worshipped in that temple were the Tyrian sun god Melek or Heracles
Melkart (biblical Molech); Shamash the sun god (biblical Chemosh);
and the Goddess Astarte, or Ashtoreth, whom Yahweh's priests called
an abomination (1 Kings 1 1:5-7).
In reality, there was no Golden Age of Solomon. No contempo
rary nation took any notice of Israel's alleged glory. The "great cities"
Solomon was supposed to have built were small mud-hut villages. The
"city" of Megiddo covered less than 13 acres. "The standard of living
was far from luxurious when compared to that prevailing in other parts
of the ancient Near Eastern world." 2
Solomon's reign was set in the middle of the 10th century B.C., but \
the Hebrew manuscript used as a basis for the biblical account was
written in the 10th century a.d., 2000 years later though a few early
946



medieval copies of a Greek text might have gone as far back as the
I 3rd century B.C. There were no records whatever traceable to Solo
mon's own time, not even the king lists that were customary in the
I nations that amounted to anything. Like David, Solomon was arbitrarily
assigned a reign of forty years because that was the traditional span of
, a generation. 3 Solomon's reign and deeds must be interpreted as a collection of
legends from Egypt, Phoenicia, and especially from southern Arabia, the land of Sheba, where a true Golden Age was flourishing under a
succession of matriarchal queens. Sheba was the primary source of
frankincense and other valuable spices, in great demand not only for
food preservation but also for religious and funerary use. Eutychius said the whole Sinai peninsula had been governed by wealthy Sheban queens for as long as anyone could remember. In the alleged time of Abraham, Queen Shabib (Sheba) had "built Nisib and Edessa and surrounded them with walls. She founded also the
sanctuary of Harran, and made an idol of gold, called Sin." 4 This was
the Moon-god of Mount Sinai, the god of Moses. Semitic tribes of
Arabia worshipped the moon and her earthly embodiment, the queen, since at least the 16th century B.C. 5 Sheba was the lunar queen's
capital, also known to the Egyptians as Punt or Ophir, famous as a land of fabulous wealth. 6
There were king consorts in Sheba's capital city of Marib (Mar
iaba), but they were forbidden to leave the queen's palace on pain of
death by stoning. 7 The city, hub of the spice trade, had a great moon temple at Almaqah, laid out in the feminine-symbolic oval characteristic of matriarchal religious centers. Priestesses of this temple appear in
the Old Testament as "Sabeans" (Shebans). They were described as
holy harlots from the "wilderness," the biblical name for any place
outside of Israel, having crowns on their heads and jeweled bracelets
on their arms (Ezekiel 23:42). Sheban priests were called mukarrib, "kindred of the moon," from which descended the Hebrew kerubh
(cherub, angel) and the Arabic muqanibin, "close kindred," a title of medieval Sufi mystics. 8
The Bible presents a highly improbable picture of a rich Queen of Sheba coming with a caravan of spices, gold, and precious stones to
visit a king of poor, backward Israel. She loaded Solomon with gifts because she was so impressed by what he already owned and by his
clever answers to her questions (1 Kings 10:5). Needless to say, this
was only mythic name-dropping. Solomon was placed on his throne and crowned by a Sheban moon-priestess called Bath-Sheba (Daughter of
Sheba), said to be his mother (Song of Solomon 3:1 1). The king whether his name was Solomon or not clearly lived in a more
dependent relationship to the Sheban matriarchate than the account of
the queen's visit might suggest. According to the Koran, Solomon stole his throne from Balkis,
Queen of Sheba.9 The name Balkis, Bilqis, or Balqama is thought to
Solomon and Sheba
Eutychius Greek historian, author of a series of Annals.
947



Solomon and Sheba be related to Greek pallakis, "sacred harlot." The Marib temple was Mahram Bilqis, Moon-Mother Bilqis, the formal name of the God
^^^^^^^^^^ dess-queen. Set in the doorway of the temple was a large bronze
baptismal basin filled with water, the prototype of the "brazen sea" in
Solomon's temple, copied from Sheban antecedents. 10 This mighty womb-symbol was decorated with the female yonic emblems of
knops and lilies, also "cherubim," derived from the Sheban
mukarribim. n Solomon's temple featured a pair of phallic pillars named Boaz
(eagerness, strength) and Jachin (God makes him firm), surmounted by female symbols of lilies and pomegranates (1 Kings 7:19-20). By thi ancient symbolism, the two pillars at the temple door represented the king and his tanist, both craving entrance into the Enclosed Garden or temple-body of the Goddess. The hieros gamos between Solomon
and his mysterious black queen a marriage arranged by Bath-Sheba
was a mating of the king to his land, signalized by pornographic hymns like the wedding-poems of ancient Sumeria. 12
The fragment of love-liturgy now called Solomon's Song has beei
an embarrassment to theologians, even though they strenuously insisted it was an allegory of Christ's love for his church, Lady Ecclesia.
It was hard to explain why such a love should exude such a steamy air
of obviously erotic sensualism. Yet the 18th-century scholar Herder was
persecuted and hounded from one pastorate to another for daring to
suggest that Solomon's love poem should be accepted at face value, as a
piece of Oriental erotica. 13
When the metaphors of this poem are unraveled, they prove to b< more, not less, frankly sexual. The hortus conclusus or "enclosed
garden" is the internal genitalia of the virgin bride, where her spouse
"enters paradise" from Hebrew pardes, "garden." 14 Solomon says, "A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain
sealed." He proposes to unseal her, unlock her door, and "drink of
spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate" (Song of Solomon 8:2).
This metaphor is explained by the contemporary image of the pomegranate, rimmon, as a female-genital symbol. Spiced wine meant the secretion of the Goddess representing the blood of life: i.e.,
menstrual blood, of which only kings and gods could taste. 15 Solomon's bride said invitingly, "Let my beloved come into his
garden, and eat his pleasant fruits." Solomon answered, "Open to
me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night. I have put off my
garment; how shall I put it on?" The king's dew-filled "head" was the
common symbol of the penis, in royal wedding hymns of Sumer and
Akkad. A king's union with the Goddess Inanna, Queen of the Universe, was so described: "The king goes with lifted head to the
holy lap, he goes with lifted head to the holy lap of Inanna." Every king's divine bride was Inanna "the queen, the vulva of heaven and earth." 16
948



A priestess impersonated the Goddess on the royal wedding night. Solomon and Sheba Solomon's mysterious "black, but beautiful" bride, the Shulamite,
seems to have been no more than an ancient Canaanite title of the ^^mwm
Goddess, Zulumat, "Darkness." 17 Like the Goddess she was not
only the night and the moon; she was also the land and its crops. Her
stature was like a palm tree, her breasts like clusters of grapes, her
mouth like honeycomb, her teeth like flocks of sheep, her belly a heap of wheat set with lilies, and so on. In short she was the Enclosed
Garden-paradise of Oriental kings, like Shalimar in the Far East the
Semitic Sheol-Mari, or Mary of the enchanted garden underground. Similarly the Enclosed Garden became a Christian symbol of the
same Mary. The Litany of the Virgin jumbled together many of the old fertility symbols, calling Mary the Enclosed Garden, Well of Water, Gate of Heaven, Chosen Vessel, City of God, Beautiful Moon, Beloved of the Sun, Rose, Lily, Olive, and Palm. 18 Within the Virgin's
hortus conclusus dwelt such phallic symbols as the Tower of David, Tree of Life, enchanted unicorn, and Exalted Cedar of Lebanon,
always called "tall." The ancient meaning of "tall" combined the
concepts of "prompt, quick, docile, comely, handsome" flattering
descriptions of the divine phallus. 19 Mary or Mari was linked with the Sheban moon-temple at Marib, having the same name and the title of almah or moon-woman, once a
priestess of the Almaqah. Solomon's mother Bath-Sheba, who crowned
him, apparently represented the elder queen of Sheba, who was also the Naked Goddess when viewed in her bath by the next king. Her
spouse David had come to kingship by viewing her in her bath and
showing a satisfactory reaction. Prior to Solomon's reign, the king's defeated tanist was Absalom or "Father Salomon," variants of Salem,
Salma, Shalem, or Solomon. After lying with the royal concubines to
prove his virility, Absalom died a sacrificial death on an oak tree, and
a phallic pillar was erected in his honor (2 Samuel 18:18). Bath-Sheba
meant literally the daughter of Shaybah, an ancient Arabic name of the Goddess. 20 See Zenobia.
In one year Solomon received 666 talents of gold (1 Kings 10:14),
the mystic number of the Triple Goddess, later re-interpreted by her enemies as "the number of the beast" (Revelation 13:18). Clearly,
Solomon worshipped the Goddess (1 Kings 1 1:5) and paid little or no
attention to Yahweh. Apocryphal texts said Yahweh never forgave Solomon's paganism, but after his death condemned him to perpetual
punishment, like that of Prometheus: to be daily devoured, forever, by 10,000 ravens. 21
The gold that came to Solomon was probably a symbol of his
wisdom; for kings' wisdom was generally ascribed to their union with the Goddess who represented "mother-wisdom" (Hebrew hok-mah,
after Egyptian hek-maa). Sargon II also claimed to have received
"gold" form the Arabian queen. 22 Centuries later, Arabian alchemists
talked in highly esoteric terms of the acquisition of mystic gold, which
949



Son of Man may have meant something different from the usual interpretation of
material gold from base metal. In medieval alchemy much was made
of the occult link between gold and the Wisdom-goddess, variously named Sophia, Sapientia, Anima Mundi, Athene, or Luna.
Solomon's legendary wisdom brought him almost as much rever
ence from medieval occultists as Thoth-Hermes Trismegistus, god of
magic. Several grimoires purported to have been written by his hand; The Key ofSolomon was one of the most popular. Magic signs like
the pentacle and hexagram were often called Solomon's Seal. "Of a
truth," the Grand Grimoire said of Solomon, "what other man, save this invincible genius, would have had the hardihood to reveal the
withering words which God makes use of to strike terror into the rebellious angels and compel them into obedience?" 23 Thus wizards
invoked Solomon's help in calling up demons for magical purposes. The Bible is remarkably uncommunicative concerning Solomon's
death, considering the intimate detail that describes his wedding
night, his temple furnishings, his household, etc. The Arabs said
Solomon lost his magic ring while bathing in the Jordan, and forgot his wisdom, so he was killed by a djinniwho ruled in his place. Rabbinic
writers said Solomon's corpse was stuffed and shown to the people on
holy days to make them think he still lived. One day the royal mummy
embarrassingly fell apart, which ended the deception. 24

Son of Man
Narayana, "Son of Man," originally meant Vishnu, not Jesus. It was coined to prove Vishnu a god made wholly in the image of man, having no need of a mother. 1 Yet Vishnu himself finally adopted the worship
of Mother Kali, saying in his hymn to her divinity, "The gods themselves are merely constructs out of Her maternal substance." 2
"Son of Man" was subsequently applied to the Persian Messiah, then to the Essenic Christ, both of whom were "born" at the hands of men, "of water and of the spirit." Men so born were supposed to be able to defeat death, whereas man born of woman was fated to die. The Persian Son of Man, Yima the Splendid (copied from the Vedic
Yama) became a Lord of Death, "the good shepherd, the most glorious of those who were born, the sole mortal possessor of the solar eye." He alone could "render men and beasts non-mortal." ?
Repeating a bit of Persian eschatology, Jesus promised that on the Last Day "the Son of man shall come in the glory of the Father with
950



his angels" to judge the world (Matthew 16:27). Theologians have never really decided who was the Father of the Son of Man.

Sophia, Saint
Canonical adaptation of the Gnostic Great Mother: Latin Sapientia,
Greek Sophia, the spirit of Female Wisdom. Symbolized by the Dove
of Aphrodite (later transformed into a sign of the Holy Ghost),
Sophia once represented God's female soul, source of his power, just as Kali-Shakti served to vitalize the Hindu gods. 1
The Trattato Gnostico said Sophia was God's mother, "the great revered Virgin in whom the Father was concealed from the begin
ning before He had created anything." She was identified with Isis-Hathor, whose seven emanations gave each Egyptian his seven souls. Irenaeus said Sophia like Hathor was the mother of the seven
planetary spirits, whose names were listed in Gnostic papyri as the
magic-working secret names of God. 2 The Clementine Homilies called Sophia the All-Maternal Being,
The Queen, Lady Wisdom. Early Gnostic Christians held that, like
Krishna and Shiva, or like Dionysus and Zeus, Christ and God together
merged with Sophia as an androgyne: "The Son of Man agreed with Sophia, his consort, and revealed himself in a great light as bisexual. His
male nature is called 'the Savior,' the begetter of all things, but his
female, 'Sophia, Mother of All.' " ? A Gnostic creation myth said Sophia was born from the primordial
female power Sige (Silence). Sophia gave birth to a male spirit, Christ, and a female spirit, Achamoth. The latter gave life to the
elements and the terrestrial world, then brought forth a new god
named Ildabaoth, Son of Darkness, along with five planetary spirits later
regarded as emanations of Jehovah: Iao, Sabaoth, Adonai, Eloi, and
Uraeus. These spirits produced archangels, angels, and finally men. Ildabaoth or Jehovah forbade men to eat the fruit of knowledge, but his mother Achamoth sent her own spirit to earth in the form of
the serpent Ophis to teach men to disobey the jealous god. The serpent was also called Christ, who taught Adam to eat the fruit of knowledge
despite the god's prohibition.4 Sophia sent Christ to earth again in the shape of her own totemic
dove, to enter the man Jesus at his baptism in the Jordan. After Jesus died, Christ left his body and returned to heaven. Sophia gave Jesus a
body of ether, and placed him in heaven to help collect souls. 5 Some
said Jesus became Sophia's spouse and his glory depended on this sacred marriage; for he was only one of the Aeons, a minor spirit, the common fruit" of the Pleroma.6
Some said Sophia was also Jesus's mother, for she was the Virgin of Light whose spirit entered into the body of Mary to conceive him.
Sophia, Saint
Clementine Homilies Greek writings falsely attributed to a
first-century bishop of Rome; actually composed by an anonymous Christian apologist toward the end of the
4th century.
951



Sophia, Saint She also entered the body of Elizabeth to conceive John the Baptist.
Some said Sophia was to God as Metis to Zeus: his "mind." But
Sophia wasn't acceptable to the all-male church. Of the three mighty
female powers in the Gnostic creation myth, all preceded Jehovah, and two of them opposed Jehovah as a tyrant, overruled his taboo, and saved humanity from ignorance. It was a version that the Pauline
churches found lacking in appeal.
Nevertheless, Sophia was passionately adored by Eastern Christians. Her greatest shrine was erected in Constantinople during the 6th century a.d., and was one of the wonders of the world: the Church
of Holy Sophia (Hagia Sophia). Embarrassed by this magnificent monument to the Great Mother, Roman Christians claimed it was dedicated to a minor "virgin
martyr," St. Sophia, whose phony legend lacked even a date. Despite her virginity she was the mother of three daughters, also "virgin
martyrs": St. Faith, St. Hope, and St. Charity. The legend may have arisen in personification of the saying that Wisdom gives birth to
Faith, Hope, and Charity. Hagiographers took it literally, confusing the three virtues with the three Charites. Catholic scholars now claim the
church of Hagia Sophia was never dedicated to the Great Mother in
any form, not even that of a female saint. They say its name which means "Holy Female Wisdom" in plain Greek really meant "Christ, the Word of God." 7
Jewish "Wisdom" literature owed much to the cult of Sophia, who] was to reappear in medieval Jewish cabalism as the Shekina of God.
Yet the 8th and 9th chapters of Proverbs demonstrate the early conflict
between followers of Sophia and those of God. The first of these
passages urges the benefits of Sophia's worship; the second belittles her
and her priestesses:
Doth not Sophia cry? and understanding put forth her voice? She standeth in the top ofhigh places, by the way in the places ofthe paths. She crieth at the gates, at the entry ofthe city, at the coming in ofthe
doors. Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons ofman. O
ye simple, understand Sophia: and, ye fools, be ye ofan understanding heart. Hear; for I will speak ofexcellent things; and the opening ofmy
lips shall be right things . . . for Sophia is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to her. I Sophia
dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions. . . .
Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom; lam understanding; I have
strength. By me kings reign, and princes decree justice. By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges ofthe earth. Hove them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me. . . . I lead in the way of
righteousness, in the midst ofthe paths ofjudgment: that I may cause
those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures. . . .
Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts ofmy doors. For whoso findeth me findeth life. . . .

presented by the following chapter, wherein God scorned the worship of the Goddess:
Sophia hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars: she hath killed her beasts: she hath mingled her wine: she hath also furnished her table. She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the
highest places of the city. Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither; as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, Come, eat ofmy bread, and drink ofthe wine which I have mingled . . . [but] the fear ofthe Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge ofthe holy is
understanding. For by me [God] thy days shall be multiplied, and the years ofthy life shall be increased. . . . A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing. For she sitteth at the door ofher
house, on a seat in the high places ofthe city, to call passengers who go right on their ways: whoso is simple, let him turn in hither. . . . But he
knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths
ofhell. 8
The "high places of the city" meant temples, therefore the 'woman" was the Goddess, who met with much resistance from Followers of the God. Yet she was still in evidence during the Middle
\ges, as Sophia-Sapientia, Lady Wisdom, ruling deity of the Gnostic jhilosophers who said the World Soul was born of her smile.9

Soteira
'Savioress," a title of Persephone; feminine form oisoter, meaning 'savior" or "sower-of-seed." The word came from primitive images of
he Savior as a phallic god who died in the act of fertilizing the earth.
3ersephone acquired the title as an annual bride of Pluto, or Hades,
vho took her underground.
Sothis
Sreco-Egyptian name of the star Sirius, which "rose in the east" to innounce the advent of the Savior Osiris each year at the onset of the
^lile flood. "Three Wise Men" announced the rising of Sothis the
hree stars in Orion's belt which point directly toward Sirius. As the
'Eye" of the Great Dog (Canis Major), Sirius was sometimes called
2anopis or Dog- Eye, the same as the holy city of Anubis who, as Dog
953



Soul of Death, kept Osiris's soul in the star Sothis until his rebirth. See
Dog.
Soul
Germanic Seek, "soul," was feminine, used by mystics like Eckhart and Goethe in the same sense as Shakti'm India: i.e., "the feminine
Ultimate Reality." ' Most ancient words for the soul were female:
psyche, pneuma, anima, alma. God-souls were Goddesses: Kore, So
phia, Metis, Sapientia, Juno. The ancients believed every man had a female soul derived from the Mother Goddess through his earthly
mother. Each Egyptian had seven souls, bestowed by the Seven Hathors
who guarded the planetary spheres and were fairy godmothers at the birth of every child. The souls were aakhu, ab, ba, ka, khaibut, khat, and
ren: (1) primordial life spirit, resident in the blood; (2) the heart, formed from the mother's heart's blood; (3) the ghost that appeared after death and flew in and out of the tomb, sometimes as a bird; (4)
the semblance or image, the other self seen in reflections; (5) the
shadow; (6) the material living body, supposedly resurrected "in the flesh" after death; and (7) the secret name or soul-name. 2
Greeks connected different aspects of the soul with different
deities. Psyche, the spirit, was married to Eros, the body, until they
were separated by death: this was the philosophical meaning of the romantic myth of Psyche and Eros. Souls belonging to Persephone in the underworld were shadows, or "shades" the umbra corresponding
to the Egyptian khaibut (see Shadow). Reflection-souls in water
seem to have been connected with the water-goddess Echo, as shown !
by the myth of Narcissus.
Patriarchal writers tended to emphasize the soul called "breath,"
pneuma, since this was the kind of soul that could be given by a
father. The idea came from Vedic India. Patriarchal Brahmans called
the vital principle, self, or soul Atmen, "breath," cognate of the Greek atmos, "air." Brahman fathers gave their children breath-souls as
opposed to the souls of blood, heart, name, flesh, mind, shade, etc., contributed by mothers. Therefore Brahmans regarded the breath-soul
as the only important one. A Brahman father pretended to bring his
newborn infant to life by breathing on it three times, putting a soul into
its body. 3 Like all Aryan notions, this one reappeared in Europe centuries later, in a superstitious belief about lions. "For three days after
birth the cubs of the lioness gave no sign of life, but on the third day the lion came and with his breath restored them to life." 4
The biblical God performed the same miracle with breath, restoring life to slain warriors who had become heaps of dry bones. At the
invocation of Ezekiel, God sent his breath into them from the winds,
and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great
army" (Ezekiel 37:10). We are always astonished at the ease with which
954



the ancient prophets ordered up impossible miracles, such as have Soul
never appeared within living memory. Jesus's assertion that "the kingdom of God is within you" (Luke ^^^^^^^^^^^^
17:21) filtered down from Ionian philosophers of the 6th and 5th
centuries b.c. They identified the air-soul as God, and proposed that the
divine spark within man was precisely the air he breathed, the
"finest" element, forming the personal soul and the Oversoul at the
same time. Diogenes of Apollonia set forth this doctrine:
Mankind and the other animals live on air, by breathing; and it is to them both soul and mind. The soul ofall animals is the same, namely air which is warmer than the air outside, in which we live, though much colder than that near the sun.
In my opinion that which has intelligence is what men call air, and
by it everything is directed, and it has power over all things; for it is just this substance which I hold to be God. s
The philosophers reasoned that if God=air=soul, then the air
within a breathing person was an inner God judging his actions an interior conscience. So said the poet Philemon:
lam he from whom none can hide, in any act which he may do, or be about to do, or have done in the past, be he god or man. Air is my
name, but one might also call me Zeus. I, as a god should be, am
everywhere here in Athens, in Patrae, in Sicily, in all cities, in every home, in every one ofyou. There is no place where is not Air. And he
who is present everywhere, because he is everywhere ofnecessity
knows everything. 6
Christians largely accepted the air-soul theory, drawing out of it their ideas of invisible ghosts that could be felt but not seen, like air; and
the notion that the soul can depart from the body through the nose or
mouth, like breath. Yet older ideas of the soul also hung on.
The Egyptian doctrine of the seven souls, descending from the
seven planetary spheres, passed into Gnostic Christianity as seven qualities of souls drawn from, and influenced by, the planetary spheres. Coming down from heaven to enter a newborn body, the soul had its
original purity adulterated by sins and passions as it passed through the spheres: "As the souls descend, they draw with them the torpor of
Saturn, the wrathfulness of Mars, the concupiscence of Venus, the
greed for gain of Mercury, the lust for power of Jupiter." Seven deadly sins were acquired from the seven spheres, but they could be
shed again after death as the soul ascended through the same spheres
in the reverse direction, enroute to heaven. Christians generally restrict
ed the number of souls to one, but some Gnostics held that every
man has two souls, one emanating from the First Mind, and one called
the God-seeing soul, "put in from the revolution of the heavens." 7
Theories on the physical seat of the soul in the body have been
many and various. The ancients usually placed the soul in the heart
or the liver. Patriarchal thinkers declared that a man's testicles held the

Sow souls of his future children; St. Thomas Aquinas and other Christian
authorities concurred in this. Some souls were external; they dwelt in
umbilical cords, placentae, nail clippings, or shorn hair; any injury to
these articles would injure the person. A more recent theory, dating
from the early Age of Enlightenment, was that the seat of the soul is
the pineal gland. 1 BardoThodol,xxx\. 2. H. Smith, 24. 3. Hays, 223. 4. Male, 15. 5. Guthrie, 136. 6. Guthrie, 142. 7. Jonas, 157, 160.
Sow
The white corpse-eating Sow-goddess represented the death aspect of the Great Mother in cults of Astarte, Demeter, the Celts' Cerridwen, and the Teutons' Freya. As a death goddess, Freya had the title of
Syr, "Sow." l Demeter-Persephone or "Demeter the Destroyer" was sometimes called Phorcis the Sow, mother of the Phorcids or Fatal
Women. One of these was Circe, swine-goddess of Aeaea, who could turn men into sacrificial pigs. 2 Her island Aeaea meant literally
"Wailing," a reference to the ritual laments accompanying sacrifices of
the god in pig form. The self-sacrifice of Vishnu in the form of a boar was repeated in
western Indo-European myths, where the god was Porcus, Phorcus, or Orcus, a Lord of Death. Ore means "pig" in Irish; and the Orkney
Islands were once sacred to the devouring Sow. 3
In Tantric Buddhism the Goddess is still worshipped as the Diamond Sow, Marici. She sits on a lotus throne drawn by seven
pigs. On earth she is incarnate in a real woman, the female counterpart of the Dalai Lama. 4 See Boar; Vishnu.

Spartacus
Thracian slave who led a short-lived uprising against the Roman
government in 73 B.C. Spartacus was a would-be Orphic savior, viewing himself as an incarnation of the god. His wife, a priestess of Orpheus
Dionysus, saw in a dream the Orphic serpent coiled around Spartacus's head, indicating that he would do great deeds and would die a hero's
death. 1 Her prophecy was fulfilled. Spartacus's revolt was soon put down, and he was caught and executed in the manner of a sacred
king.

Speaking in Tongues
Glossolalia, "speaking in tongues," was often seen in episodes of
religious ecstasy or trance and was anciently considered a proof of divine
grace. St. Paul was proud of his ability to "speak in tongues" more
956



than any of his followers (1 Corinthians 14:18). Early Christians Sphinx
actually believed the speaker in tongues was expressing himself in Spider another language or languages not known to his conscious mind, ^^^^^^^^^^^m
through temporary possession by the divine spirit. The idea came originally from Buddhists who claimed that when Buddha addressed
gods, demons, men, and animals, each heard the Enlightened One speak in the language he could understand. 1
In reality, glossolalia is only meaningless babbling that may pour forth from an entranced person. Not one authenticated case of
speaking in tongues has ever been observed, where any real language was spoken and identified by a native speaker of the same language, together with evidence that the same language was wholly unknown to
the possessed one.
l.Waddell, 159.
Sphinx
Mother Hathor as a lion-headed sphinx asked men her mystic riddle,
and killed those who couldn't answer, until King Oedipus solved her riddle and cast her out of Thebes. The riddle was: "What goes on
four legs at dawn, two legs at midday, and three legs at sunset, and is weakest when it has the most support?" The answer was either man
or god. The sun god Ra, Hathor's offspring, grew old and feeble at the end of each day and walked with a third leg: a cane. 1 Some said Ra's weakness was the result of his mother's curse.
As the two-faced Goddess of birth and death, the Sphinx sometimes looked in two directions, with two heads and two foreparts. This glyph was called xerefu and akeru, "the Lions of Yesterday and
Today," similar to the Goddess's Greek designation of Alpha and
Omega. 2

Spider
Arachne the Spider was a totemic form of the Fate-spinner, otherwise known as Clotho or Athene or the Virgin Moera. The classic myth of Athene's jealousy of the maiden Arachne, which caused her to
turn Arachne into a spider who continued to practice her incomparable
skill in spinning and weaving, was mistakenly deduced from an icon
showning Athene with her totemic spider spinning the web of Fate, from which the future could be foretold. An English writer of the
17th century still thought "Minerva" (Athene) gave spiders a special ability to foretell the weather. 1
In Hindu myth, the spider represented Maya, virgin aspect of the
Triple Goddess, spinner of magic, fate, and earthly appearances. 2 The spider's web was likened to the Wheel of Fate and the spider to the
Goddess as a spinner, sitting at the hub of her wheel.

The female spider's habit of devouring her mate led to identifica
tion of the spider with the death goddess, Maya transformed into
Kali-Uma In Aztec myth, with its mysterious archaic relation to India,
spiders represented the souls of warrior women from the pre-Aztec
matriarchate, like the Amazonian Fate-spinners. At the end of the
world these women would descend from heaven on their silken
threads and eat up all the men on earth, like eight-legged Valkyries.
Indeed there were Scandinavian associations, too. Odin's horse
Sleipnir (Slippery) was gray and had eight legs, like a spider; it also
represented Odin's "Fate" in that it was associated with the gallows
on which he was hanged. _
Medieval Europe usually associated spiders with witches. The folk
tale of the Spider and the Fly suggested the once widespread belief
that flies are souls in search of a female entity to eat them and give them
rebirth.' See Arachne.

Starkad
Archaic Scandinavian god of many arms. Thor tore off all but two of
Starkad's arms to "make him more comely," but his body always bore
the marks of former supernumerary limbs. He was one of the elder gods or giants named risi, a derivation from Sanskrit rishi, "a sage";
therefore he was obviously a Hindu idol of the many-armed type still seen in India. 1 His myth indicates the Asiatic origin of northern Aryan
peoples.

Stations of the Cross
Image-galleries picturing key events in Christ's life and martydom, with recommended prayers and meditations for each stop. The gallery
of "stations " was based on ancient Oriental picture galleries within
the temple, to be traversed by pilgrims enroute to the central Holy of
Holies. 1 The idea of separate, progressive meditations was taken
directly from the Oriental tradition, in which the pilgrim's mind was
supposed to be prepared for the inner revelation by slow stages during
progress through the gallery or labyrinth. 1 . Zimmer, 1 27.
Stella Maris
"Star of the Sea," an epithet of Isis, Ishtar, Aphrodite, Venus, MariAnna, and the virgin Mary. St. Jerome was said to have been the first to steal the title from the old Goddesses and bestow it on Mary. 1 The
"star" was variously identified as the planet Venus (morning and

evening star), or Polaris marking the axis mundi, or Sirius, or the Stoicism leader of the Pleiades. Styx

Stoicism
Greco- Roman school of philosophy based on worship of Fate, the Goddess whose law ruled the constant combining, dissolving, and re
combining of elements (stoicheia). The infinite variety of her
manipulations of elemental ingredients "gave rise to all perceptible phenomena." 1 According to Stoic doctrine, the karmic law of Nature was beyond
the power of any god to rescind, for the gods themselves were subject to the same law, and in common with other creatures would be
destroyed eventually. Thus Stoicism stood in opposition to the JudeoChristian hypothesis of miracles, by which God broke his own laws from
time to time. Stoics said whatever is, is natural.
The Stoic concept of Fate or Nemesis was like the Tantric
concept of Kali. To know the Goddess was to accept the fact of
death, and to bow before the decrees of Fate as gracefully as possible.
Stoicism appealed to Roman intellectuals such as Seneca and
Lucretius, who despised religious commercialism and hypocrisy. The Stoic sage Persius seems to have been a model for the story of Christ's
encounter with the money-changers in the temple. It was Persius the
Stoic who first demanded, "What is gold doing in a holy place?" 2 Early Christians envied the esthetic elegance of Stoic theology and
tried to assimilate it, but the basic premises of Stoicism and Christian
ity couldn't be reconciled. "The difference between the two
conceptions cannot fail to manifest itself. . . . Stoic ethics are self
sufficing; they proceed from nature, so to speak, and do not rely upon grace; they have no need of a doctrine of Redemption. . . . There is
nothing in common between them and Christianity save the elements it once borrowed from them."*
Nevertheless, Christian admirers of Stoicism strove to assimilate
Stoic principles, such as the brotherhood of man, which Christian
Gospels did not teach. St. Augustine even borrowed the phrase coined
by Marcus Aurelius in his Stoic vision of all races dwelling as kindred
in the "City of Zeus," though Augustine revised the title to "City of God."*

SvjyaiTura Marici-deva or Marishi-ten. "He" was called a protector of the sun, yet
"he" always appeared in the garments of a Chinese woman, indicat
ing an origin both feminine and rooted in lands west of Japan.6
'
Among the ancient Arabs, the sun was a Goddess, Atthar, some
times called Torch of the Gods. 7 The Celts had a Sun Goddess
named Sulis, from sail, meaning both "eye" and "sun." Germans called
her Sunna. Norwegians called her Sol.8 In Scandinavia she was also
known as Glory-of-Elves, the Goddess who would give birth to a
daughter after doomsday, thus producing the new sun of the next
creation.9 The Eddas said: "One beaming daughter the bright Sun
bears before she is swallowed by Fenrir; so shall the maid pace her
mother's way when the gods have gone to their doom." 10
The Sun Goddess Sul, Sol, or Sulis was worshipped in Britain at the famous artificial mountain in the Avebury complex of megalithic monuments, now known as Silbury Hill. Here she gave birth to each
new Aeon from her great belly-tumulus, over 1 30 feet high and more than 500 feet in diameter. "The influence of the British Goddess, Sul,
extended over the greater part of south west England, and her worship appears to have been conducted on the tops of hills, overlook
ing springs. Thus near her springs at Bath we have the isolated hill
called Solsbury, or Sulisbury, probably the seat of her worship." At Bath, Romans identified Sul with Minerva and set up altars to her under the name of Sul Minerva. 11

Svayamara
Bridegroom-choosing ceremony of pre-Vedic queens embodying the
spirit of Sati as the Virgin Kali. She chose Shiva the Condemned One
as her consort, casting over his head a wreath of flowers representing
her yoni enveloping his lingam. In the role of sacred king he would die
in his mating, like a penis, and his bridal wreath became the funeral
wreath laid on his grave. 1 His divine bride followed him into the
underworld and brought him back, as Ishtar followed Tammuz and
Aphrodite followed Adonis. 2
Svayamara meant a love-death (Teutonic Liebestod), a sinister implication for the ones who originally "caught the bride's bouquet." But later patriarchy converted the spirit of Sati into a symbol of the
dutiful wife who followed her deceased husband into the underworld,
whether she wanted to or not. "Sati" was corrupted into the word for
widow-sacrifice, suttee. Up to the 19th century it was customary to burn widows on their husbands' funeral pyres, until the British govern
ment in India finally classified the rite of suttee as "homicide"
though it was never homicide, but only gynocide. 3 Widowers were never slain for the sake of their dead wives.

Sufism
Arabic mystical system preserving within Islam a Tantric form of
Goddess- and woman-worship. Like European bards and minnesingers who copied them, medieval Sufi poets sang of the spiritual significance of love, exemplified in the woman called a Fravashi or "Spirit of
the Way." Sufis claimed the universe was held together by the
feminine forces of motherhood and sexuality. To survive within a
rabidly patriarchal society, however, the Sufis disguised their doc
trines in many allegorical symbols, and established a mystical system in
which nearly every tenet was imparted as a graphic image or metaphorical tale. Sir Richard Burton called Sufism "the Eastern parent
of Freemasonry." See Arabia; Romance; Tantrism.
Sukra
"Seed," son of the planet Venus, with a second birth from the penis of Shiva, who had swallowed him and then endured a pregnancy of 100
years.
1 Like the stories of male birth-giving in Greece and the Middle East, Sukra's myth was intended to establish the notion that men could be "mothers." See Birth-Giving, Male.

Sufism Sun Goddess
Sun Goddess
Though western iconography usually called the sun male and the
moon female, archaic Oriental tradition spoke of a female sun. Japanese
ruling clans traced their descent from a supreme Sun Goddess,
Omikami Amaterasu. 1 In 238 a.d., Japanese tribes were ruled by a
queen named Himiko, Daughter of the Sun. 2 The Hindu Great Mother took the form of the sun as the Goddess
Aditi, mother of the twelve zodiacal Adityas, spirits who would "reveal their light at Doomsday." 3 The Mahanirvanatantra said the sun was the "garment" of the Great Goddess: "The sun, the most
glorious symbol in the physical world, is the mayik vesture of Her who is
'clothed with the sun.' " 4 The same Goddess, identified with Mary,
appeared in the Gospels as the "woman clothed with the sun" (Revela
tion 12:1). Tantric Buddhism recognized a precursor of the Middle-Eastern Mari, or Mary, as the sun. Her monks greeted her at dawn as "the
glorious one, the sun of happiness. ... I salute you, O Goddess Marici!
Bless me, and fulfil my desires. Protect me, O Goddess, from all the
eight fears." 5
When the Japanese revised their mythology to accommodate new
patriarchal ideas, the Goddess Marici was masculinized, and it was forgotten that she was once identical with Omikami Amaterasu. Yet there was a strange ambivalence about the "powerful god" called
Sun Goddess

Swastika
Those who know the swastika only as the Nazi Hakenkreuz (Hook
Cross) may be surprised to learn that it is one of the oldest, most widely
distributed religious symbols in the world. Swastikas appear on Paleo
lithic carvings on mammoth ivory from the Ukraine, dated ca. 10,000
B.C. 1 Swastikas figure on the oldest coinage in India. 2 Persia, Asia
Minor, and Greece represented the rotating axis mundi with the symbol of a swastika. On a Boeotian amphora of the 7th century B.C., the
swastika was presented as a sacred sign of the Goddess Artemis. 3 It also
represented many other deities from Iceland to Japan, Scandinavia to
North Africa. It was much used in Troy and Mycenae before the 1 3 th
century B.C. 4 Sanskrit svastika meant "so be it" or "amen." In Japan, the swas
tika was an ideogram for "infinity" the number 10,000, which was
a synonym for infinity because it was the highest number Japanese sages could visualize. 5
There were two basic types of swastikas: the left-pointing, counter
clockwise, widdershins version called the Moon Swastika, and the
right-pointing, clockwise one called the Sun Swastika. The former was naturally associated with the Left-Hand Path of the Goddess, the latter with the Right-Hand Path of the God. (See Left Hand.) Hindus
said the solar swastika represented the god Ganesha, "Lord of Hosts," and the lunar swastika stood for Kali-Maya, his virgin bride, mother of Buddha.6 As a reincarnation of his divine father, Buddha displayed
the sign of a cross, with a swastika enclosed in the female circle at the
end of each arm.7 Tibetan Buddhists said the right-handed swastika
was the Savior, the left-handed swastika meant witchcraft, or the "magic" of Mother Maya. 8
The feminine moon swastika received the name oisauvastika and
was said to represent the autumnal half of the year, when the sun
m



wanes, while the masculine swastika stood for the vernal season when Swithin, Saint
the sun grows stronger. 9 As the feminine sauvastika suggested the sun
god declining toward his death and resurrection at the winter solstice, it mm^^mtm^^^^mm
sometimes signified rebirth. In Japan, the reborn Amida, "Buddha of Immeasurable Light,"
wore a left-handed swastika carved on his breast. 10 A similar lefthanded swastika was the sign of Thor's hammer on Scandinavian coins. 11 Thor was one of the gods supposed to have come from ancient Troy; and Trojan images of the Great Goddess showed a
swastika within a female triangle on her belly, indicating the hidden
god prior to his next rebirth. 12
Early Christians adopted the swastika to represent Christ, calling it a crux dissimulata or disguised cross. It was also called crux gammata,
gammadion, or gamma cross, because it showed the Greek letter
gamma four times repeated. To Saxons it was fylfot, translated either
"four-foot," referring to the four heavenly pillars at the corners of the
earth, or "fill-foot," referring to the Christian habit of filling in the foot of a church window with swastikas. 13 In old Danish churches, the
swastika was the usual ornamentation for the baptismal font. 14 It was
also much used in medieval heraldry, as "cross potent rebated," croix
gammee, or croix cramponnee. Still, knights who wore the swastika on their shields couldn't be sure whether it stood for the cross of Christ
or the cross of Thor, the latter being revered in swastika form all over
Germanic areas, including the Scandinavian settlements in Lincolnshire
and Yorkshire. 15
In the 1930s, the Nazi party adopted the swastika because of an
impression that it was a "pure Aryan" sign. A variant of the swastika
long represented German Vehmic Courts (from Vehme, "punishment") which began in the Middle Ages as civil tribunals for
persecuting heretics, and became connected with the Inquisition. Their activities were kept secret. In Napoleon's time, the Vehmic Courts
were still operating as underground organizations devoted to summary justice, like the Black Hand in Sicily. 16 From the Vehmgericht arose specifically anti-Semitic secret societies of Austria and Germany in the
early 1900s the forerunners of Nazism.

Swithin, Saint
Originally S. Wothin, or Holy Wotan, "Swithin" was the god of West Saxon kings of Winchester, "Place of the Winds," from Latin venta, winds. The calendar symbol of St. Swithin was the Cross of Wotan representing the four winds. 1 Since Wotan was a Saxon version
965



Sword of Jupiter Pluvius, it was claimed that rain on St. Swithin's day meant
Syba rain for the next forty days, and that Swithin's relics were buried outside
___^__^_ Winchester Cathedral where rain could pour from a roof spout onto
his grave.
Swithin was adopted as a Christian saint about a century after his
alleged lifetime, which was assigned to the 9th century. 2 His claim to sainthood was that he was supposed to have established tithes in England, having talked the Saxon king Ethelwold into turning over

Sword
Herodotus said the Scythian war god was represented by an ancient iron sword (phallus) fixed in a pyramid of brushwood (female symbol), made fertile with the blood of human sacrifices. 1 Eight centuries
later, the Alani and Quadi in the same region worshipped a father-god as a naked sword fixed in the ground. Ammianus said the warriors
worshipped their own swords as gods. 2
In the north, a primary female symbol was the house (hus, hussy),
which was combined with the sword by marriage. A Norse wedding custom was plunging a sword into the main beam of the house: "a proof
of the virility of the bridegroom and a sign of good luck for the
marriage." 5 Norse myth said the gates of heaven are guarded by a man juggling
seven swords, one for each of the seven (male) spirits of the planetary
spheres. 4 1. Goodrich, 217. 2. Gelling & Davidson, 38. 3. Gelling & Davidson, 150. 4. Keightley,61.

been made up of collections and reorganizations of older myths.

Tammuz
The Christos or sacred king annually sacrificed in the temple at
Jerusalem, attended by women who dedicated him to their Goddess
Ishtar-Mari, Queen of Heaven, his mother and bride (Ezekiel 8:14). He was a Hebrew version of Dionysus Liber, or Adonis, whom the
970



Romans called the chief god of the Jews. l Tacitus however thought Tammuz
the Jews had given up worshipping Liber, for he "established a festive
and cheerful worship, while the Jewish religion is tasteless and ^^^^^^^^^^^
mean." 2 A month of the Jewish calendar is still named after Tammuz, who was revered all the way up to the 10th century. 5 Tammuz was imported from Babylon by the Jews, but he was even older than Babylon. He began as the Sumerian savior-god
Dumuzi, or Damu, "only-begotten Son," or "Son of the Blood." He fertilized the earth with his blood at the time of his death, and was
called Healer, Savior, Heavenly Shepherd. He tended the flocks of stars, which were considered souls of the dead in heaven. Each year on the
Day of Atonement he was sacrificed in the form of a lamb, son of the
Holy Ewe; but his animal incarnation was understood to be a
substitute for an earlier human sacrifice. A lament for the dead god
asked rhetorically:
Why have they slain him, him ofthe plains? The Shepherd, the Man of Wisdom, the Man ofSorrow why have they slain? The Lady ofthe Vine languishes, the lambs and the calves languish. The Lord, the Shepherd of the fold lives no more, the spouse ofthe Queen of Heaven lives no more. *
On the occasion of the god's death, temple women raised ritual
"howls" or "ululations," which the Babylonians called alalu, and the Greeks called houloi. This was the sound mentioned by Ezekiel: in
the Jerusalem temple, women "wailed" for Tammuz. A typical "wail" is mentioned in Sumerian scriptures:
For him who has been taken away there is wailing; ah me, my child has
been taken away, my Damu that has been taken away, my Christ that has been taken away, from the sacred cedar where the Mother bore him.
The wailing is for the plants, they grow not; for the houses and for the
Hocks, they produce not; for the perishing wedded couples, for perishing children, the people ofSumer, they produce not. The wailing is for the great river, it brings the Hood no more. The wailing is for the fish ponds; the fish spawn not. The wailing is for the forests; the tamarisks grow
not. The wailing is for the store-house; the honey and wine are not
produced. y
Some liturgies addressed Dumuzi-Tammuz as Usir or Usirsir, variations of the name Osiris, who was also the Good Shepherd and the
keeper of the "flocks" of the dead.6 Though Tammuz occupied the
central position in the sacred drama at Jerusalem, the New Testament transformed him into a mere apostle of the new dying god, under the Greek form of his name, Thomas.
A thousand years later, however, Syrian farmers still considered the
sacrifice of Ta-uz, the grain god, essential to the welfare of the crops.
He was cruelly treated: slain by the reaper's sickle, his bones ground in a
mill, his flesh scattered on the earth, his death bewailed by the women.7

Like all earlier "saviors," Tammuz eventually was diabolized in Christian tradition. During the Middle Ages he was listed as one of
hell's leading devils. Weyer's treatise on demonology made Tammuz
hell's ambassador to Spain, probably because he was still worshipped
by Saracenic sects in Spain. 8 1 Graves W.G. 368. 2. Tacitus, 660. 3. Frazer, G.B., 393. 4. Briffault 3,91-95.

SignofTanit
Tanit
Carthaginian name of the Phoenician Great Goddess, Astarte the
biblical Ashtoreth or Asherah. Her temple in Carthage was called the Shrine of the Heavenly Virgin. Greek and Roman writers called it a
temple of the moon. 1 Another of her titles was Astroarche, Queen of the Stars. Her
priestesses were famous astrologers, whose prophecies were circulated throughout the Roman empire and even rivaled the
pronouncements of the Cumaean sybils. 2
Though Romans destroyed Carthage in the Punic Wars, Roman
legend traced the very origin of Rome to the Carthaginian mothercity, as shown by the story of Aeneas, who came directly across the Mediterranean from there, to found Rome. 3 The primitive Roman queen Tanaquil, who conferred sovereignty on the "fatherless" Latin kings, the Tarquins, was none other than the Libyan Goddess Tanit. She was also known as Libera, Goddess of Libya, whose festival the
Liberalia was celebrated each year in Rome during the Ides of
March.4 An alternative name for the festival was Bacchanalia, dramatiz
ing the love-death and resurrection of Bacchus Liber, or Dionysus, or
Consus, which were various names for the same fertility god. 5
The distinctive symbol of Tanit was a pyramidal shape, like a
woman in a very full skirt, topped by a disc-shaped full-moon head, with upraised arms in the manner of the Egyptian ka. 6 Similar symbols
represented such goddesses as Aphrodite, Athene, Venus, and Juno.

Tannhauser
"Dweller in the House of Tann," the hero who lived in the
Goddess's magic mountain, the Venusberg. Tann, Dann, Danu, Diana, Tannetis, or Dennitsa were variations of the same Goddess (Venus) whom Tannhauser adored in the shape of her mortal priestess, Queen Sybil. The legend of Tannhauser displayed considerable
hostility to the authority of the pope, and presented the cult of the Goddess as an alternative to Christianity. See Sybil.

Tantrism Tantrism
The system of yoni-worship, or female-centered sex-worship, alleged
ly founded thousands of years ago in India by women of a secret sect hhuhmhihi called Vratyas, forerunners of the devadasis or sacred harlots. 1 The
religion was associated with later written scriptures known as Tantras, therefore it was called Tantrism. The primary object of its adoration
was the lingam-yoni, sign of male and female principles in conjunction
(the god Shiva and the goddess Shakti-Kali). Tantrism is still widely
practiced in India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Tibet. 2 The basic principle of Tantrism was that women possess more spiritual energy than men, and a man could achieve realization of the divinity only through sexual and emotional union with a woman. A
fundamental rite was controlled sexual intercourse, maithuna, Latin
coitus reservatus: sex without male orgasm. The theory was that a man
must store up his vital fluids rather than expending them in ejacula
tion. Through Tantric training, he learned to absorb through his penis
the fluid engendered by his partner's orgasm and to prolong sexual intercourse for many hours. In this way he could become like Shiva, the
God in perpetual union with his Goddess. Theoretically, the vital
fluids thus conserved would be stored in a man's spinal column, mount
through the chakras up to his head, and there flower forth with the
inspiration of divine wisdom. The Tantras explain this and other
practices based on worship of the Goddess, together with the philosophy underlying the rites.
The most sacred mantra (holy phrase) expressing Tantric worship
was Om manipadme hum, the Jewel (penis) in the Lotus (vulva). The symbolic lingam-yoni often took the form of an altar, shaped like a penis in a vulva. 3 Remnants of Tantric practice inspired the medieval
European belief that "witches" worshipped at an altar represented by a female body.
Tantric Buddhism consisted of an uneasy marriage between an
originally ascetic Buddhist cult with ancient sexual disciplines. Like its Christian offshoot five centuries later, Buddhism was founded on
opposition to the female principle and the belief that men must avoid
women, in order to conserve their souls' vitality by retaining their semen
and concentrating on the Self. Buddhist monks claimed their prophet
ordered them to quell all sexual desire, and never to see or speak to women.4
Like early Christianity, however, Buddhism soon spread out
along a continuum of sects ranging from the austere, puritanical Jains to exuberantly erotic Tantric Buddhists with principles like "Buddha
hood resides in the vulva." 5 All over Indian temples, Buddhist saints
appeared with their voluptuous Shaktis in the divine embrace called
Yab-Yum (Father-Mother), representing everlasting orgasmic bliss the real cause of the beatific smiles on the faces of the bodhisattvas.
Erotic forms of Tantric Buddhism penetrated all Asia, though
patriarchal sects later suppressed them and denied their historical
973



Tantrism existence. Tantric Buddhism flourished in China under the Six Dynasties, T'ang, and Mongol Yuan, until Confucian patriarchs succeeded
in eliminating it. Japanese Shingon is an attenuated remnant. Tantrism
is no longer mentioned in China or Japan; its art was destroyed;
authorities pretend it was never there at all.6 The same denial appeared in areas dominated by Islam where Sufi
mystics had perpetuated a form of Tantrism. They emphasized the
discipline oifana, "rapture," attainable only with a pir (Peri), a fairy
mistress, also known as Fravashi, "Spirit of the Way." 7 Through her, a man might achieve "the larger full surrender" said to pass beyond God to realization of the ultimate Void that swallowed even the
gods. 8 Early Gnostic Christians sometimes called their religion synesaktism, the Way of Shakti, another name for Tantrism.9 These
Christians were influenced by Oriental Tantrism as well as by some of
its western forms, philosophies of Goddess-worship filtered through
Pythagorean and Neoplatonic mystics. Plotinus equated the mind's progress toward the Ineffable with "the sight of a beautiful lady."
Ascent of the mind toward realization of divinity was divided into six
steps, beginning with perception of woman's beauty, culminating in contemplation of Universal Beauty. 10 Christians like the Ophites and Montanists apparently practiced sexual adoration of the feminine life force under the name of Sophia,
the female Holy Spirit, a feminine soul or Shakti of God. Their rite of
"spiritual marriage" was misunderstood by the orthodox, who later called it a Test of Faith. Certain male and female saints, they said, had
proved their chastity by lying together naked without copulation. Possibly it was not sexual intercourse perse that such "saints" had
avoided, but only male orgasm. Like Tantric yogis, Gnostic saints
sometimes thought themselves "perfected" by coitus reservatus, so they could indulge in nakedness and promiscuity without being sinful. 11
These sects were destroyed by the end of the 5 th century a.d. and no more was heard of the famous Test of Faith. 12 Orthodox fathers
of the church ruled that sexual intercourse should have no purpose
other than to beget offspring, and sexual pleasure should be altogether denied to women. 13
While Tantric Christians were condemned as heretics, Islamic
leaders were attacking Sufi cults of love. 14 Sufi mysticism survived
underground, in the hands of troubadours who called themselves
Lovers and adored the female principle as the world-sustaining
power. Sufi yoni-worship influenced European troubadours, who founded cults of Courtly Love in the centuries following the cru
sades. The church called them devil-worshippers because they
"sinfully" loved women instead of God, and women were equated with the devil by the theological opinion of the time. 15 See Romance.
Heroes of the Courtly Love movement apparently practiced Tantric maithuna under the name of drudaria, a kind of love
974



associated with male self-denial, yet not at all chaste. On the contrary, its Tao poetry was highly erotic. 16 Bardic romance sometimes showed dis
tinct connections with eastern Tantrism, as when Peredur's mystic ^^^^^^^^^^^
lady-love revealed that she came from India, or when Tristan told his
lady-love Iseult that his name was the syllabically-reversed Tantris. 17
Though never officially recognized, Tantric sex has been practiced throughout history in western nations, either in accordance with a
secret teaching, or as an independent discovery. Medieval Goddessworshippers vilified as "witches" apparently knew of it, and may have
used it as a birth-control technique. It was claimed that no woman was
ever made pregnant at the witches' Sabbath. 18 In 1848, maithuna was again publicized by the founder of the Oneida Creek Community, John Humphrey Noyes, who rediscovered it while trying to protect his wife from "the horrors and the fear of
involuntary propagation" after she had four disastrous pregnancies. 19 Noyes called his discovery "male continence," or karezza, and trained members of his community in the technique. Then they engaged in what Noyes called "complex marriage" with various partners, without unwanted pregnancies. 20 Several occult societies of the 19th and
20th centuries made use of Tantric coitus reservatus for various reasons,
but it was seldom admitted to the "normal" sexual repertoire of the
western male.

Tao
"The Way," Chinese version of Tantrism. Men were taught to
reserve their vital forces, which could be dangerously depleted by
ejaculation, and to let their weaker Yang nature absorb the powerful
Yin force engendered by a woman's orgasm. Men were advised to keep
this "key" secret from women, for if women learned to suppress their
own orgasms while bringing men to ecstasy, they would greatly surpass
men in wisdom and spiritual energy. Their already superior Yin magic would remain in their bodies, while the man's lesser Yang magic would be added to it. 1 Lao-Tse said: "How unfathomable is Tao like unto the empti
ness of a vessel, yet, as it were, the honored Ancestor of us all. Using
it we find it inexhaustible, deep and unfathomable. Now pure and still is
the Way! I do not know who generated it. It may appear to have
preceded God." 2

Tara Tara
Tarot Indo-European name of the primal Goddess Earth, known from
mm^^^m^ India to Ireland; cognate with Latin Terra Mater, Hebrew Terah,
Gaulish Taranis, Etruscan Turan. 1 An extremely ancient festival held annually at Athens was named after her, Taramata (Mother Tara),
nicknamed "the Rioting" because of its wild orgiastic customs.2 The sacred grove of Tara in Ireland was the Goddess's genital
shrine, enclosing the God in the form of a stone pillar, Fal (phallus).
This pillar represented his generative power, like the obelisk in Egypt,
and was specifically called "the stone penis." 3 The God's name was
Taran in Wales, or Torann in Ireland, meaning "thunder." Like Jupiter Pluvius, he fertilized Mother Tara with rain. 4 The traditional words
of a fanfare, Taran-Tara, originally came from a magic "cry" expressing the union of the two deities.
Tantric Buddhists in Tibet still pray to Mother Tara like this:
Hail! O verdant Tara! The Savior ofall beings! Descend, we pray Thee,
from Thy heavenly mansion, at Potala, together with all Thy retinue of gods, titans, and deliverers! We humbly prostrate ourselves at Thy lotus
feet! Deliver us from all distress! O holy Mother! We hail Thee! O revered and sublime Tara! Who are adored by all the kings and princes of
the ten directions and ofthe present, past and future. !
In India, Tara is called "the most revered" of the old pre-Vedic
Goddesses, just as in all lands populated by Aryan peoples, Mother Earth was the first, oldest, and greatest of deities. 6

Tarot
The modern pack of playing cards evolved from the Tarot pack by the subtraction of 25 cards. In addition to the now-standard 52 four
suits from ace to king Tarot packs had a fifth suit, the Major Arcana
(Great Secrets), a trump suit consisting of 22 picture cards. Only one of these trump cards now remains in the deck, the Joker, Jester, or Fool. Present card decks are only remnants of what medieval cards used to
be that is, the Tarot.
Four court cards also disappeared from the suits: the four knights.
Therefore, modern cards have only three court cards per suit: king,
queen, and jack. Disappearance of the knights led some scholars to think Tarot cards might have been invented by the Knights Templar, who were declared heretics, disgraced, and exterminated in the 14th
century. Though Templars may have learned from the Saracens to use cards, they didn't invent them. 1 Unbound "books" of picture cards
were long used in the east to teach mystical doctrines to people who couldn't read. 2
Italian author Covelluzo wrote: "In the year 1379 the game of
976



cards was brought to Viterbo from the country of the Saracens, where it is called naib." In that year, Saracen mercenaries served in the
armies of rival popes Urban VI and Clement VII; but Saracenic
Arabs had occupied Spain, southern France, Sicily, and Italy since the early 8th century. The Arabs dominated Spain until the 1 5 th centu
ry. Their word naib became Spanish naipes, "playing cards." 3
Gypsies migrating from their ancient home in Hindustan also
brought cards into Europe. Tarot cards have been called "the
compendium of gypsy philosophy and religion."4 The world's oldest gambling game, Faro, came from gypsies who were supposed to be "Egyptians," and whose "game of kings" was naturally named Pharaoh (Faro) because, it was said, their cards had pharaohs painted on them. 5 Spanish gypsies introduced Spain's national card game, ombre
(Spanish hombre), "the game of man," which was as much a system of mystical divination as a game. Ombre was "a modification of the
earlier game of primero ... of all modern games that which most
resembles the ancient tarot. "6
The mysterious disappearance of the trump suit and the knights was connected with more or less consistent hostility of Christian
authorities toward the cards. In 1370, a monk named John of Brefeld
said in the symbolism of the cards "the state of the world as it is now
is most excellently described and figured." But this turned out to be a
heretical opinion. Other churchmen claimed the Cathari used cards
to teach their Gnostic faith. In 1 378, the cards were banned in
Regensburg, Germany. In 1381, they were condemned in Marseilles. In 1397, they were forbidden in Paris. In 1423, St. Bernardino
of Siena said the cards were invented by the devil. In 1441, importa
tion of cards was prohibited in Venice. In 1450, a Franciscan friar
denounced cards in northern Italy. John Northbrooke later wrote:
"The play at Cards is an invention of the Devil, which he found out
that he might the easier bring in Idolatry amongst men." Scottish
clergymen called cards "the Devil's books." Churchmen were especial
ly enraged by the Major Arcana or trump suit. These 22 little
pictures were called "the rungs of a ladder leading to the depths of
hell." 7 Cards were described as the devil's breviary, "in which various
figures are painted, just as they are ih the breviaries of Christ, which figures show forth the mysteries of evil." 8
One may well wonder, what were these mysteries? What "idols"
did the idolatry of cards show forth? What doctrines were taught by
the "devil's breviary"?
The Tarot has been linked with several non-Christian mystical
systems: the Cabala, Hermetic magic, classical paganism, witchcraft.
Dr. Gerard Encausse wrote, "The game of cards called the Tarot,
which the Gypsies possess, is the Bible of Bibles. It is the book of
Thoth Hermes Trismegistus, the book of Adam, the book of the
primitive Revelation of ancient civilizations." 9 A more recent student
of the cards says, "The Tarot speaks in the language of symbols, the
Tarot
Dr. Gerard Encausse French

Tarot language of the unconscious, and when approached in the right
manner it may open doors into the hidden reaches of the soul." 10
._ In the east, whence cards originally came, there was an ancient
tradition of religious insights taught through dramatic presentation or through pictures. Eastern mystics believe in the existence of a secret
international symbol-code known only to initiates, whereby the true
meanings of religious mysteries are revealed. Similarly it was thought the hieroglyphs of Egypt and central America began as a secret
symbol-code. Pythagorean and Orphic initiates used such code systems
in antiquity. European mystery plays, too, conveyed Gnostic or nonChristian ideas in symbols and tableaux of very ancient origin, under the noses of churchmen who would have suppressed them if they had
understood their meaning. 11 The Tarot strongly resembles an Oriental symbol-code when
observed in relation to doctrines prevailing in the east at the time of
its European debut. Pictures of the Major Arcana can be linked with
pageants of the mystery plays, Gnostic teachings, and Orphic icons. Here was the real reason for opposition to the trump suit opposition so
bitter that in the end all trumps were excised except the Fool, a
"know-nothing." Because of the church's hostility, today's card players have no trump suit, and are obliged to name one of the other suits
"trumps" when necessary. Images of the Tarot suggest female-centered, cyclic doctrines of reincarnation such as the old religions taught. The cards probably
were the original "elf-books," allegedly given by the fairies to people they loved, which enabled them to foretell the future. 12 Cards were
associated with witches. In German towns where witch persecutions fell
heaviest, painters of the forbidden cards were women. 13 Moakley has
pointed out that "preachers have never liked playing cards, and it can be
said that the story the cards tell is very much opposed to the basic
tenets of Christianity." H To understand the story, one must study the cards' format. The
four suits of the Minor Arcana or Lesser Secrets are clearly related to
Oriental images of the elements. The first suit was Cups, Chalices, or
Grails; it later became the suit of hearts. The second was Wands,
Rods, Batons, or Scepters now converted into clubs, though the club
is not a club but a trefoil. The third suit was usually called Pentacles,
also rendered Coins, Disks, Denari, or Pomegranates, which became diamonds. Finally there was the suit of Swords, modern spades, derived from Spanish espada, sword.
As cup, scepter, ring, and sword, these emblems were displayed by the four-armed androgynous deity Ardhanarisvara Kali and Shiva merged. 15 Other gods, such as the monkey god Hanuman, held the same symbols. 16 The female earth principle Brawani also carried the elements as lily, flame, cross, and sword. 17 Like her the Greek Goddess
Nemesis or Fate displayed the same symbols as a cup, apple wand, wheel, and sword. 18
978



These Tarot suit symbols stood for paired male-and-female ele- Tarot
merits: female water with male fire, female earth with male air. These
in turn were linked with the four stages of life established by Tantric ^^^^^^^^^^^
philosophers: Sambhoga, Nirmana, Artha, and Moksha. 19 These four
life-stages had the following "elemental" meanings. 1 . Sambhoga, the Life of Enjoyment, was related to the feminine
Water element and its symbol the cup, grail, or heart. It referred to
the period of youth under the tutelage of the Mother, when pleasures of
the senses figure most prominently in the life experience, while the
cup of life fills up with feelings, consciousness, awareness of others. The
Tarot suit of Cups therefore was traditionally applied to the subject of
love, family relationships, marriages, children, emotion: matters of the heart, or "hearts."
2. Nirmana, the Process of Building, was related to the masculine
Fire element and its symbol the phallic wand, scepter, rod, or club. It
meant young adulthood, the period of assertion of power, a peak of
energy. The wand or dorje represented the phallic lightning streaking toward the waters. Tarot readers therefore applied the suit of Wands to
matters of status, power, business, and commerce. The straight Wand became a trefoil through an alchemical trans
formation. The trefoil was an alchemical symbol for wood, sometimes called Wood of the Tree of Life. 20 The Chinese considered wood a
fifth element, placed between earth, which gave birth to it, and fire, which consumed it. 21 The Wand of the Tarot associated with fire would
have meant a wooden torch, therefore the symbol of wood changed it
into a modern "club."
3. Artha, "Earth," stood for Wealth or Possessions: the period of Symbol of Wood
middle age when the fruits of labor accumulate, and grown children also are "wealth." The feminine Earth element was associated with
riches in all Indo-European traditions, and so the Goddess's pentacle became a diamond, the Far-Eastern earth-symbol whose very name meant "Goddess of the World." The oldest form of money was a
female-genital cowrie shell, and coins used to be manufactured in the Mother Goddess's temple at Rome. 22 It was not illogical then that the
Tarot suit of Pentacles was related to money matters and property.
Sometimes they were Pomegranates, another female symbol. 23
4. Moksha, "Liberation," or the Art of Dying, was linked with the masculine Air element that meant the soul released from the body,
into the keeping of the Lord of Death, or Kali the Destroyer, represented by the sword. Eastern philosophers viewed old age, the fourth
life-stage, as an opportune time to learn to approach death without fear.
However, the Tarot suit of Swords was linked with fear-inspiring
events: calamities, difficulties, threats, various kinds of doom. Even in
ordinary playing cards, the suit of spades, the Swords' descendant, was reckoned a suit of evil omen.
The underlying theory of cartomancy was that shuffling the cards was like mixing the elements in the larger world. Fate would guide
979



T*ot the diviner to make combinations which, properly interpreted, would apply to past or future events that the mingling of elements brought ^^^^^^^^^^ about. Suit colors still show the blood-red of life for the "female"
elements, the black of death for the "male" elements, according to very ancient Oriental ideas of the active energy of the Lady of Life as
opposed to the passivity of the Lord of Death. It is perhaps oddly significant that the oversized ace of modern cards is the ace of spades,
symbolically the sword of Father Heaven, which fortune-tellers called
the card of death.
When churchmen failed to eradicate playing cards, there were
several attempts to adapt the cards to Christian orthodoxy. Major Arcana pictures were described as various episodes in Christ's Passion as
if they represented Stations of the Cross. 24 Another system tried to
relate the four suits to the four Grail Hallows, listed in the 12th century
as (1) the chalice of the Last Supper; (2) the wooden lance St.
Longinus used to pierce Jesus's side; (3) the round paten or platter from
which Jesus's disciples ate the paschal lamb, and (4) King David's "Sword of the Spirit." These Grail Hallows were themselves un
christian, having been lifted from the Four Treasures of pagan
Ireland, magical emblems of the Tuatha De Danann. These were: (1)
the Cauldron of Regeneration; (2) the Spear of Lug; (3) the Stone of Fal, or Stone of Sovereignty, which like the Scots' Stone of Scone
would cry out in recognition of a true king; and (4) the Sword of Nuada. 25 Typical lingam-yoni combination of the last two formed the famous "Sword in the Stone" that figured in myths of Arthur,
Perceval, and Galahad.
A
1 5th-century game called Triumphs associated the four suits
with qualities resembling the Tantric definitions of the four elemental
life-stages: (1) Pleasures, (2) Virtues, (3) Riches, and (4) Virginities. 26 These are easily identified with the male-female elements. "Virtues"
came from virtu, "manliness, uprightness" in the dual sense of erect
ness. "Virginities" referred to the ascetic life recommended for the elder sage in eastern lands. But the game itself was named after the
Major Arcana the "trump" suit that clergymen called heretical.
The word "trump" came from trionfiov "triumph," the old Latin
word for a religious procession, in which the very sequence, costumes, and masks of the marchers stood for doctrinal teachings the
initiates could understand. Images of the deities, sacred masks borne
by temple dancers, charioteers, priests, and priestesses displayed the exuviae, "attributes," of divinities. The leader of the procession was
the triumphator, a magistrate in charge of Rome's sacred games. At the end of the drama or the parade, celebrants raised the cry of Triumpe,
announcing the immanence of divine spirit in the things and persons
shown. 27 Trump, then, originally meant "that which is divine," and
like everything divine it was credited with power of divination.
According to ancient ideas of the divine order, deities revealed themselves within a calculated framework of time. An initiate into
980



any of the pagan Mysteries would meet them one at a time, learning Tarot new thoughts from each. A time-frame appeared in the Tarot as well
as the matter-frame of the elements. This had to do with its numbering. ^^^^^^^^^^^
The number of Minor Arcana cards is 56, a number with pro
found meanings in Oriental philosophy. When Buddha was born, he took his first 56 steps in each of the four cardinal directions, 7 forward
and 7 back each way, signifying the 14 waxing and 14 waning days of the moon and the lunar weeks, like the 14 steps on the heavenly ladder
of Osiris. 28
The same number of posts or stones representing "steps in time"
circled old temples of astronomical calculation, like Stonehenge. There were 56 years in a sacred Great Year when lunar and solar cycles
coincided. 29 The number of the Tarot's Sun card is 19, the number
of the Moon card 18: and the ancient Great Year consisted of two 19
year periods combined with an 18-year period, a total of 56 years to bring the sun and moon together. The total number of cards in a Tarot
pack, 78, was the sum of all the numbers of the signs of the zodiac
added together: 1 +24-3+4+5 + 6 + 7 + 8+9+ 10+11 + 12.
Among the many derivations offered for the mysterious word
Tarot was the famous palindrome ROTA TARO ORAT (TORA) ATOR: the Wheel of the Taro speaks of (the Law of) Hathor. 30
However, the Oriental background of card-divination and the 2 1
numbered cards of the Major Arcana suggest an older connection with the Goddess Tara, the Aryan Great Mother as "Earth," whose name gave rise to Latin Terra Mater and Celtic Tara.
From ancient times, this Goddess was assigned 2 1 forms. Magic
diagrams, or painted dice-boards for divining the cause of illness, prophesying, and so on, are still known as "the 21 Taras." If the 21
numbered cards of the Major Arcana can be related to such boards,
the Minor Arcana certainly echo the similar boards of 56 squares used
"for determining the successive regions and grades of one's future
rebirths." 31 In the Far East, games like cards and dice were used to
teach esoteric doctrines. Tantric Buddhists still enjoy the Game of
Rebirth played with dice and a colorful board; it is both a pastime and a
teaching aid for spiritual doctrines. 32
As in China, cards were created from the possible throws of rods in
the I Ching, so divination by dice obviously influenced the format of the Tarot. The two Tarot numbers 56 and 21 are dice numbers 21 the number of possible throws by a set of two dice and 56 the number
of possible throws by a set of three dice. Together they add up to 77
seven-times-eleven, the ultimate number of dice games. The Tarot pack has one more card, making 78, but this card has no numerical
value. It is the Fool, whose number is zero. In many Tarot layouts he stands apart, as an observer or querent. 33
The form and meaning of Hindu temples also had some influence
on the Tarot. Images showing various manifestations or avatars of the
deities were placed in rows along corridors leading to the central Holy of
981



Taiot Holies. Devout pilgrims passed through this "instructive picture gallery" saying prayers at each station. 34 Pictures of the deities and thei
^^^^^^^^^^ attributes used to be painted on cards, like a miniature picture gallery,
for private meditation. Such a pasteboard pageant revealed sacred
mysteries to those who knew its symbolism. In this circumstance one
might find the real reason why Christians objected to the Major Arcana not because the cards were frivolous, but because their
underlying meanings were all too serious.
The most significant arrangement in Oriental sacred graphics was the triangle, sign of the Goddess, known as the Kali Yantra or
Primordial Image. 35 A female triangle with a central dot or bindu,
"spark of life," stood for the Goddess's genital power bringing life into being. The 21 numbered Tarot trumps seemed designed to form
this yantra, 7 cards to each side of the triangle, with the unnumbered
Fool in the center standing for the bindu.
The three sides of the triangle traditionally represented the Triple
Goddess as Three Fates, ruling past, present, and future; the three trimesters of intrauterine existence; and the three larger trimesters of
extrauterine life: from birth to coming-of-age at 21; from 21 to
middle age at 42; and from 42 to the "grand climacteric" at 63. The
same three stages of man's life were depicted in such classical images
as the Riddle of the Sphinx.
The biblical God promised his followers a lifetime of threescore
and ten years, offering seven years more than older deities who
guaranteed only the mystically trinitarian number of threescore and three (63). The pagan lifespan was remembered in medieval times, when the age of 63 was known as the grand climacteric and was thougl
to carry a threat of death. 36 It is still believed that 21 is the pinnacle of
first maturity, because the pagan system of age-counting became incorporated in common law.
Each trimester spanned 21 years, the first exclusive multiple of th( sacred numbers 3 and 7. Therefore the past, present, and future could be envisioned in the Major Arcana arranged in one of the
Goddess's essential sigils. This triangular format was often used by the gypsies, who understood that "triangle" meant "female" and that
the Goddess was the trinitarian ruler of Fate. 37
The last trump is called the World, also known as the Bride, the
Shekjna, the Universe, Mother Nature, Sophia, or the Major Fortune. 38 This card always showed a naked woman dancing within a flower wreath, flanked by emblems of the four seasons. This was the
final revelation of the Tarot system: the Goddess without her veils, the
Shakti bringing joy to the moment of death. According to the
doctrine of karma, "She it is who is ever desired, won, and lost again." 3
In the cyclic or continuous layouts favored by gypsy cartomancers, the realization of the World led "naturally on to the next card, the Fool
symbol of the newly born child commencing its life's journey. And so
982



the Ring of Return revolves once more." 40 In other words, the religion Tarot
of the Tarot was a cyclic religion of reincarnation, not a linear religion of heaven-or-hell choices. ^^^^^^^^^^^^
A popular method of laying out the cards signified two Rings of return, the joined circles of the Right-Hand Path (clockwise) and the Left-Hand Path (counterclockwise), traditional symbols of male and female powers combined in a horizontal figure eight, the Vedic sign of Infinity. This was inherited by the Arabs along with the other
"Arabic" numerals (actually of Indian origin), and is still the sign of
infinity in modern mathematics. The Major Arcana strongly suggest
ed this figure-eight layout by their own traditional designs. The lemniscate infinity-sign appeared as a wide-brimmed hat or
halo over the head of the Magician, a male figure beginning the first
decade of trumps at the #1 position. The same sign appeared again as the same wide-brimmed hat or halo over the head of the Goddess of
Strength, a female figure beginning the second decade of trumps at the #11 position. The male and female figures hinted that the first circle
often cards was to rotate clockwise, along the "solar" path; the second
circle often cards was to rotate counterclockwise, along the "lunar"
path.
The figure-eight represented union of the sexes not only in the Orient, but also in the ancient Celtic marriage rite preserved by the
Scottish custom of handfasting. Bride and groom joined their right
"male" hands, then their left "female" hands also, forming the
double-sexed Infinity sign to signify the blending of their two natures.
This custom is still followed in India, where the symbolism of the Right-Hand Path and Left-Hand Path was never lost. 41
Besides the Magician and the Goddess of Strength, another card
presented the Infinity sign: the deuce of Pentacles, showing two discs
embraced by two endlessly circling serpents, or a comparable lemniscate design. The importance of this card was revealed by special decora
tions; it usually bore the maker's trademark, as the ace of spades does
today. Clearly, the figure-eight layout was urged. But then, what did it show?
The first circle stood for the realm of consciousness, matter, the
world of affairs: solar, outward-turning all the cards faced out. The
second circle stood for the unconscious or the spirit lunar, inward,
feminine, the realm of mysteries and "true meanings." The center crossing superimposed the two "mandala" cards, the Wheel of Fortune
and the World (or Major Fortune). In such an arrangement, each card in the solar sphere matched a card in the lunar sphere, their two
numbers always totaling 20, a sacred number in the eastern decimal
system. 42 Each pair of matched cards revealed a secret identity or
meaning. The Magician, or Hermes (#1) corresponded in the spiritual realm to the masculine power of the Sun (#19). The Papess (#2)
983



Ta|ot was revealed as a personification of the Moon (#18). The Empress
(#3) was the same as the Naked Goddess pouring forth her blessings on land and sea, on the card of the Star (# 1 7) i.e., Astarte or Ishtar.
^
^^m The Emperor (#4) stood for the Holy Roman Empire, which would
soon suffer a downfall, according to the heretical prediction; and the
downfall of the Empire was shown on the corresponding card, #16, the Tower, or the House of God, blasted by the lightning of Lucifer the
Light-bringer. Two figures toppling from the crown of the lightningstruck Tower could well have been Emperor and Pope. As for the Pope himself, shown on card #5, in the spiritual realm of the Tarot he was
revealed as the Devil (#15), taking the same pose on both cards with
two worshippers at his feet. 43 Tarot cards were not the only manifestations of these subversive
symbols. The same pictures mysteriously appeared in many places, including even churches. Rheims Cathedral still has a carved stone
panel showing the lightning-struck Tower with the two male figures falling from its blasted crown. 44 An engraved Horoscope wheel manu
factured at Niirnberg in 1515 placed seven of the Major Arcana
pictures in various zodiacal positions.45 The figures of the World, the Wheel of Fortune, Justice, the Fool, and Death the skeletal Grim
Reaper with his scythe were common illustrations of the medieval
Zeitgeist; but no one knows whether they were copied from the
Tarot, or the card pictures were copied from them. Just before the card of Death came the card perhaps most
characteristic of the Tarot alone: the Hanged Man, who "cannot be
found in any orthodox Christian symbology, and is one of the clearest
indications that the Tarot trumps were designed to illustrate some
non-Christian system of belief." 46 The Hanged Man hung on a door
shaped gallows such as Norse pagans called the Wooden Horse, or the Horse of Odin.47 Even though the figure of Death immediately
followed him, it was only a symbolic death. He hung, not by the
neck, but by one foot: a custom known as "baffling," inflicted on
debtors and traitors in Germany, Italy, and Scotland.48 Baffling was a
formal humiliation, like a sojourn in the stocks, or like the mockery of
sacred-king-victims (such as Jesus). Mystical initiations imitated such procedures, so the novice "should empty himself completely, should be
stripped of all his faculties, renouncing all his own predilections, his own thoughts, his own will in a word, his whole self." 49 The Hanged Man's number, 12, recalled the famous Twelfth Rune sacred to Odin the Hanged God, the rune by which hanged victims could be
made to speak, and reveal the mysteries of the death-world. 50
The mystic revelation following the Hanged Man's encounter
with Death was the female figure of Temperance, copied from magic texts that showed the Goddess Isis with one foot on land, the other in
water, revealing her dominion over both elements. 51 This Temper
ance angel poured water from one jar into another, recalling the
984



symbolic merging of Isis and Osiris in the Amulet of the Two Jars, an Tartarus
ancient Egyptian charm of eternal life. 52 Similarly in India, the revelation of divine love was a merging of God and Goddess "like the ^^^^^^^^^^^^
pouring of water into water." 53 One of the incarnations of the God
himself was a water jar, just as Babylonian, Egyptian, and Cabirian
savior-deities were symbolized by water jars in their holy processions, as was Jesus also, according to Luke 22:10. In the Far East, the vessel of water was regarded as the residence of the deity. 54 Moreover, this same
Water-Jar-Savior appeared in Hindu playing cards at the head of the suit of Jars, which corresponded to the Tarot suit of Cups. 55
Thus the European Tarot seemed to show a man symbolically dying, and meeting a manifestation of the Goddess as a result. This
meeting or merging, "like the pouring of water into water," prefigured the final meeting with the cosmic Mother upon actual death the
Last Trump just as a man's sexual union with his earthly Shakti
prefigured his union with the ultimate Shakti of the spirit realm, Kali
herself. Small wonder then that patriarchal Christians regarded the
Tarot as a Bible of heresy comprehensible to the illiterate, at a time when even literate laymen were officially forbidden to read their own
Bible. 56 The Oriental origin of its heretical Tantric/Gnostic imagery
is suggested by the Slavic word for a "reader" of the cards: Vedavica,
literally a Vedic seer. 57 Small wonder that some of the bishops and
cardinals tried to collect packs of cards and burn them, as was done in
Niimberg in 1452. 58 Cards became harmless to the church only after
their religious symbols were removed and their meanings forgotten, so they were mere "games" ludicrous, in the new interpretation of the
old pagan ludiox "sacred games." To Hebrew patriarchs also, naipes,
"cards," became naibi, "sorcery." 59

Tartarus
Greek name of the underworld, related to tartaruga, "tortoise," because archaic Hindu tradition claimed the earth was supported by
Vishnu in the form of a tortoise. The tortoise was a totem of the
985



Taueret Underground God, sometimes incarnate in Pan or Hermes who invent
Tetresias ed the tortoise-shell lyre to create universal harmony. 1 In alchemy,
^^^^^^^^^^_ the Underground God became spiritus tartari, spirit of Tartarus, a
description of tartaric acid, or simply tartar.
1. Jung & Kerenyi, 78.
Taueret
"The Great," Hathor as the Goddess of childbirth and nursing; as Mother of the Nile, she sometimes wore a hippopotamus head. At other times she wore the lion head of destruction. Her images were
associated with the hieroglyphic sign sa, meaning the uterine blood of the Goddess which could bestow eternal life. 1 See Menstrual Blood.
].Larousse, 38-39.
Tefnut
Primitive Egyptian death-goddess living at the bottom of the underworld; a shadow twin of the Goddess Nut who lived at the summit of
the sky. A group of nether gods with slaughtering-blocks hacked the dead to pieces and fed Tefnut with their blood a mythic memory of
Neolithic sacrifices. 1
Tefnut was identified with Hathor-the-Sphinx and with the Greeks' Artemis. 2 Some said she was a savage Goddess from the
Nubian desert; she was always reddened with the blood of the men she devoured. 3 She resembled the blood-red Kalika who devoured all that
she brought forth (see Kali Ma). Tefnut's consort was Shu, "Giver of Winds," a god of dryness as
opposed to her wetness. 4 He was "dry, parched, withered, empty."
He was a phallus called Prop of Heaven, but a spent phallus entering the Goddess's "deep" which served as "a hiding-place for his body."
He could give souls of air to the dead, like Yahweh in Ezekiel's valley of bones; in fact some Jews said Yahweh and Shu were the same. 5

Teiresias
Double-sexed seer of Thebes. The Goddess miraculously made him
a woman, and he lived as a temple harlot for seven years, acquiring great powers of insight and divination. His myth may date back to the transvestism or ritual castration required of men who entered the
Goddess's priesthood. Hermes also became a god of magic insight by
turning himself into the pseudo-female Hermaphroditus and presiding
986



over the temple of his consort Aphrodite, wearing female robes and Tell, William
artificial breasts. 1 Teraphim
Teiresias had a Hindu counterpart, Trisiras, god of magic, whose ^^^^^^^^^^^m
powers were based on his ability to change from male to female at
will. 2
Teiresias's "daughter" was Mante, whose name means Seeress,
and was really a title of the Theban priestesses before men managed
to take over their functions.
1. Graves, CM. 1, 73. 2. O'Flaherty, 70.
Tell, William
Archer-wizard of Altdorf, the best known of the whole cycle of
legendary heroes. A cruel overlord ordered Tell to shoot an apple from
his son's head with an arrow to prove his skill. Tell performed the feat
successfully, holding a second arrow which he said would have slain the
oppressor, had the junior Tell been injured. The same tale was told earlier of the Rhineland archer-wizard
named Puncker (Marksman), ordered by Prince Eberhard Longbeard to shoot a penny off his son's head. Puncker too held a second
arrow, saying if he failed the test, the second arrow would have
penetrated Longbeard's heart. 1 In the 12th century, Saxo Grammaticus told the same story about Toki, a Danish archer-wizard forced by King Harald Bluetooth to
shoot an apple from his son's head. The same incident occurred in the
mythical history of Egil, brother of Velundr, in the Saga of Thidrick.
Another Norse hero, Eindridi, was obliged to shoot a writing-tablet off his son's head. Another, Hemingr, had to throw a spear at a hazel nut
on the head of his brother Bjorn. The Faroe Island archer-wizard was
Geyti, whom King Harald commanded to shoot a hazel nut from his
brother's head.
All the stories may have come from an ancient Persian poem, the
Mantic Uttair, or Language of Birds, by Farad-Uddin Attar. One of
its most widely repeated stories told of a king who shot an apple from the head of a beloved page boy. 2

Teraphim
Old Testament household fetishes, said by Hosea to be essential to
worship (Hosea 3:4). A Hebrew commentator said the teraphim were ancestral ghosts, in the form of mummified oracular heads. 1 Their name means "children of Terah." The Bible says Terah "begat"
Abraham; but the word translated "begat" often meant "gave birth
to," and many of the so-called patriarchs in the Pentateuch are feminine
987



Terra Rrma names. If Abraham was the same as Ab-Brahm or Father Brahma, his
Tetragrammaton parent would have been the Goddess Tara, a universal name of Mother
^
m Earth.
The Jews' teraphim were similar to the Romans' lares or manes,
also ancestral spirits residing in relics. Like the worshippers of teraphim, African natives still believe a dead ancestor's spirit can inhabit
an effigy especially if the effigy contains physiological relics like
bones, teeth, hair, etc. and by consulting such an idol one can communicate directly with the ancestor. 2 There were many Middle-Eastern peoples whose habit it was to
preserve skulls of the dead for later necromantic consultation, espe
cially the skulls of sacred kings. Their place of sacrifice called Golgotha,
alleged scene of Jesus's crucifixion, meant "the place of skulls."

Terra Firma
Title of Mother Earth, taken from the Homeric phrase "Great
Mother, Firmly Founded, Oldest of Divinities." To the Greeks she was
Gaea the Deep-Breasted One, who ruled Mount Olympus before the coming of the Hellenic gods. See Tara.
Tetragrammaton
Literally, "four-letter word," the secret name of God in Hebrew letters yod-he-vau-he (YHWH); often confused with God's introduc
tion of himself to Moses, "I Am That I Am" (Exodus 3:14). This introduction was borrowed from the god Ab-braham or Father Brahma,
who introduced himself in Sanskrit Tat Sat "I Am That that Is." '
The root of YHWH is the radical HWH, he-vau-he, which meant
"being" or "life" or "woman" interchangeable concepts in the ancient Middle East. 2 The same letters in Latin are E-V-E: Eve. 3 Thus
the so-called inner meaning of the Tetragrammaton was really Eve, Mother of All Living, the real creator of the world and mother of Adam,
according to Gnostic scriptures. 4 The Tetragrammaton had two versions. The lesser-known one
was EHYH, a feminine principle derived from Hayya (another of Eve's names), designating the Goddess in her special connection with women in childbed. On Samaritan phylacteries the masculine and
feminine versions of the Tetragrammaton were intertwined. 5
Medieval writers who didn't know the meaning of Tetragrammaton often took it for the name of a powerful demon, and invoked it in
magic charms. A 17th-century writer declared that "the mighty Tetra
grammaton" was a devil who protected witches.6 Other authorities



said Tetragrammaton was one of the more powerful secret names of Teutatis
God, used to control demons when they were invoked. (See Name.) Thais, Saint
Jewish mystics used the Tetragrammaton extensively in the lore of ^^^^^^^^^^^^
the Cabala. YHWH was called the Divided Name, "considered to contain all the Forces of Nature." Since the holy name could be divided
into that of Mother Eve (HWH), and that of the "I" or jod for
Jehovah, it suggested the cabalistic doctrine of God's loss of his Shekina,
the Great Mother, whose return the mystics believed essential to the
achievement of peace in the universe.
Sometimes the Tetragrammaton was called Sem ha-mephoras, or Schemahamphorasch, probably the origin of the word "semaphore" in the sense of a word-sign like the Hindu samjna? Rabbinic tradition
said the Sem ha-mephoras either was inscribed on a holy phallic stone
buried in the Great Gate of Mother Earth, or else was the stone itself,
also called Eben stijjah, the Stygian Stone, or Stone of the Deeps. It was connected with the sexual myth of the descent of Father Heaven's
phallus into the yoni of the virgin Mother Earth, to "unlock her
fountains," that is, to stimulate the Nether Upsurge of world-sustaining blood. Sexual organs of God and Goddess lay at the center of the
holy of Holies. "David is supposed to have found at the digging of the
foundation of the temple, the Eben stijjah, Stone of the Deeps, that unlocked the fountain of the great deep, and on which the Sem ha
mephoras, the outspoken name of God, was inscribed." 8

Teutatis
Germanic version of the priapic Hermes, worshipped as a giant phallus at Eresburg, the Mount of Mother Earth (Hera). Teutatis was
also called a Lord of Death, and a father of "Teutons." '

Thais, Saint
The famous harlot Thais, mistress of Alexander the Great, was
transferred to the 4th century a.d. in her Christianized legend, which
ignored chronology so Thais could repent her gaudy life and be
converted to Christianity by one of the Coptic cenobites, usually St. Anthony. To fulfill what seemed to be one of the ascetics' favorite
fantasies, Thais at the height of her beauty and fame was said to have renounced her sins, mortified her flesh, burned her fine clothes and
ornaments, given away all her wealth to the church, and walled herself
up in a desert cell to live in the midst of her own filth. 1 The only trou
ble with the hagiographer's tale was that, at the time it was supposed to

have happened, Thais had already been dead for more than 600
years. l.Aftwatcr, 320.
Thalassa
The Goddess at Rhodes and Miletus, mother of the Telchines
("enchanters"). As patroness of sex and marriage, she was an archaic
form of Aphrodite Marina. She was invoked at Roman weddings by
the cry Talassio, the meaning of which had been forgotten, but everyone knew "it was the correct thing to shout at weddings." '
1. Rose, 192.
Thecla, Saint
"Famous One," a title of Ephesian Diana, whose shrine in Seleucia
was a popular pilgrimage center in pagan times, and remained so even after the Goddess was Christianized as a saint, up to the 1 7th century
A.D. 1 Early churchmen didn't like St. Thecla or her shrine. In the 4th
century it was attended by a group called Apotactics, under a female
"deacon," subsequently declared heretical. 2 Some Christians asserted
that St. Thecla was Diana's priestess. 3 Others, like Tertullian, knew she was nothing but an epithet of the Great Goddess. Tertullian denied
the legend connecting Thecla with St. Paul, calling it a lie invented
by a misguided church elder "for love of St. Paul" a curious explana
tion, hinting that Paul might have been honored by the connection. 4
l.Attwater,321. 2. Boulding, 370. 3. Brewster, 423. 4. Reinach, 255.
Aphrodite, Cybele, Anat-Athene, and many other Goddesses occupied aniconic stones, called baitulos in
Greece, baetyl in Syria, beth-ei or "house of deity" in Palestine. 2
Themis
Pre-Hellenic Creatress, cognate with Chaldean Thamte, "Sea," or with Tiamat. Her Virgin aspect was Artemis (Ar-Themis); her name was numerically equivalent to that of the moon. 1 Her children were
Themistes, "oracles." She founded the oracle of Delphi ("Womb"), long before it was taken over by Apollo. Black Sea Amazons worshipped Themis in the form of a black
stone on their sacred island of Themiscyra, "Divine Themis." The
Roman Forum had an ancient black stone, the Lapis Niger, engraved with the Goddess's sacred law. 3 In faraway Iceland the same Goddess
was adored in the form of a stone called Spamathr, "Mother of
Prophecy," or Armathr, "Mother of Prosperity." 4 To the Egyptians, Themis was "Temu," spirit of the fertile Abyss that gave birth to all things in the beginning.
990



Classic myth made Themis the spirit of the post-diluvian creation. After the Flood receded, Themis taught the survivors Deucalion and
Pyrrha how to repopulate the earth by magic. They were to fling "the
bones of their mother" behind them as they walked. On resolving the riddle, they understood that Themis meant stones, the bones of their
Mother Earth. 5 By the grace of the Goddess, new human beings rose
up from these stones.

Theology
Theology
Literally, "God-knowledge," the paradoxical pretense of knowing what theologians themselves call unknowable. The weakness of theol
ogy as a "science" is its lack of objective proof for any of its claims.
Vetter points out that any theologian in the modern age is likely to be
confused and worried: "He is trying to reconcile science with faith
and dogma, and they are simply not to be reconciled." 1
Since Galileo's time, Christian theology has been concerned not
with justifying God's ways to man but with justifying God's ways to
science. This is usually done by reasoning backward from religion's
given conclusions to theoretical causes. In 1952, Pope Pius XII
demonstrated this in an astonishing series of non sequiturs to force
"science" to prove the existence of God:
What significance, then, has modern science for the proofofthe existence
ofGod, which depends on the fact that the cosmos is susceptible of change? . . . From the fact that there is change we may conclude that
there is an Absolute Being whose nature is unchangeable. . . . [Science] has, with the concreteness that belongs to physical proof, confirmed the
principle ofcontingency and the conclusion based on it that . . . the cosmos came into being by the hand ofthe Creator. 2
Only theology could make such a long, loose-jointed leap from the fact that there is change to a "conclusion" that something un
changeable must exist. Needless to say, science has not confirmed
any such thing as the theological principle of contingency with any
"physical proof"; theologians simply don't understand what physical proof consists of.
Theological problems are not solved by physical evidence but by adjustment of verbal definitions. The usual method is debate. Medi
eval Schoolmen earnestly debated such questions as how many angels could dance on the head of a pin, or whether the earth hung from heaven by a golden chain or an iron one. "Evidence" was taken from
analogy. For instance, Peter Lombard's rules on incest said it was all
right to marry outside the sixth degree of consanguinity because there were six ages of the world. In 1215 the fourth Lateran Council
Peter Lombard Ecclesiastical teacher of
the 1 2th century, bishop of Paris, author
of many sermons, commentaries on scrip
ture, and theological treatises known as the Books ofSentences.
991



Theology declared it was even all right to marry outside the fourth degree of
consanguinity, because there were four humors in the body and four
^^^^^^^^^^ elements in the universe. 3
Most of the time, theology and science have been implacable
enemies. 1 The aggression has been on the side of theology, not
science; the latter simply pursues facts, the former attacks facts because
they threaten orthodox fantasies.
The priesthoods of whatever stripe can never live down, nor make amends
for, their disgraceful role in retarding the development ofmodern science during the past millenium in Christendom. But what is even worse, they seem to have learned nothing from that defeat and are now closing ranks, better to fight the same sort ofa battle in the area of the
social sciences and ethics. . . . [S]upernaturalism is, in its social func
tions and consequences, a dangerous opiate. And, what is perhaps even
worse, it discourages objective attempts at intelligent social trial-anderror, planning, and even research, and undermines man s faith in his own
resources. . . .
The methods and principles ofthe theologians are still the same; they have merely abandoned certain fields as no longer profitable for exploitation and have concentrated their efforts in the psychological and sociological, derived out ofa distant past. Their sole claim to validity today derives from the extent oftheir social acceptability, not from any
empirical validation. To preserve that social acceptability organized religion bends its every effort to keep "controversial" topics out ofpublic educational institutions and to provide as much parochial education as
possible for as many ofthe "faithful" as possible. s
To provide the kind of education defined as Christian, it has
been necessary for theologians to lie, and then to find words that call
their lies morally right. Such semantic wriggling is shown by a book
for Catholic laymen by Edwin F. Healy, S.J., published in I960 under
the rather astonishing title of Mora] Guidance.
At times one is obliged in conscience to veil the truth, for there are secrets to be guarded and detractions to be avoided. Sometimes silence will not
suffice to maintain the secret which one is trying to guard. In fact, it may
happen that silence would betray the secret. Hence there must be some
licit means ofconcealing the truth when necessary. This licit means is the
broad mental reservation. . . . One way ofputting the question is to ask
ifa false statement is always a lie. Some theologians answer in the
negative. . . . Sometimes it is necessary to make a false statement in order to protect secret knowledge. Silence or the use ofmental reservation
is not sufficient; the only way to protect the secret is to make a statement contrary to what you know to be true. 6
In direct ideological descent from Eusebius who extolled "holy lying"
for the church's sake, Healy makes "licit" every form of falsehood.
Churchmen themselves seldom believed the lies they told, or al
lowed, as shown by the 19th-century clergymen's aphorism: "He may hold anything who holds his tongue." 7 The theologian Beausobre wrote:
992



Churchmen not only do not say what they think, but they do say the Theotokos
direct contrary of what they think. Philosophers in their cabinets; out of them they are content with fables, though they well know they are fables. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Nay, more: they deliver honest men to the executioner, for having
uttered what they themselves know to be true. How many atheists and
pagans have burned holy men under the pretext ofheresy? Every day do hypocrites consecrate, and make people adore the host, though as well convinced as I am, that it is nothing but a bit ofbread. 8
Perhaps the most dangerous truth, about which theologians always lied, was the one advanced by the Arab philosopher Averroes:
that all religions are of equal validity or nonvalidity, because all are
merely human productions.9 Judeo-Christian tradition could not bear
this idea, for it taught that not only were its scriptures directly dictated
by God but its religion was the only "right" one even though shaped and supported by false statements.
How could the modern church acknowledge, Guignebert asks, "that religion lives its whole life in the consciousness of men and that
human consciousness has changed since the thirteenth century?"
Orthodoxy must believe itself immutable, but it is always embarrassed
by the records of its mistakes. Renan says, "There is one thing that a
theologian can never be, and that is a historian. History is necessarily disinterested. . . . The theologian has one interest, his dogma. If this dogma be trimmed down as much as ever it can be, then it is still for the
critical mind an unbearable load. The orthodox theologian may be
compared to a bird in a cage; all real movement is forbidden to it." 10
The conclusion that theology once found unthinkable is becoming
more and more thinkable. "What gods are there, what gods have
there ever been, that were not from man's imagination?
"
' ' To insist on
deities in the real world, the theologian must resort to intellectual
dishonesty. "One should claim as knowledge only what he really knows, and admit that he does not know what he doesn't know. The
characteristic Western ardor for answering the unanswerable would be
more uplifting if it did not entail claims of certitude." n Morton
Smith points out that "When a theologian talks of a 'higher truth,' he is usually trying to conceal a lower falsehood." 1B

Thesmophoria Thesmophoria Thomas Rhymer Women's festival of Demeter Thesmophoros, "Demeter-Who-Es
bh^hh^ tablished-the-Customs." Women mixed the seed corn with their
menstrual blood to give it life; sacrificed pigs; and carried in proces
sion seed vessels, serpents, and cakes formed like female genitals. 1 On the third day, sacrificed victims came forth from the earth-womb in
the Kalligeneia, "Fair Birth." 2 Victims were identified with the savior
Dionysus, a Holy Child laid in a manger, later to die and give his
blood as sacred wine for the worshippers to drink, thus assuring their
immortality. 1. Spretnak, 269. 2. Encyc. Brit, "Thesmophoria."
Thomas Rhymer
Thomas Learmont, also known as Thomas of Erceldoune, a 14th
century Scottish poet-seer. Erceldoune (now Earlston) was "Ercel's Down," seat of the Saxon Goddess Ercel, or Ursel, or Horsel, the
"Fairy Queen" who loved Thomas and taught him secrets of magic. Thomas was accosted on Huntlie Bank by the incumbent Queen of
Elphame, an earthly incarnation of the Goddess, who taught him the secrets of the witch cult and re-baptized him as True Thomas when
he had renounced Christianity. 1
According to "The Ballad of Thomas Rhymer," the Fairy Queen showed Thomas three roads: one leading to heaven, a second to hell,
and a third to "fair Elf-land," that is, a Way that was neither Christian
nor anti-Christian. Along the third road he came to the River of
Blood, comparable to the Greeks' birth-river Styx, or the river of
giantesses' menstrual blood, crossed by the god Thor on his way to
the land of elder deities. Here Thomas entered a very mysterious place:
"For forty days and forty nights / He wade thro' red blude to the knee, / And he saw neither sun nor moon, / But heard the roaring of the
sea." 2
The legend suggests a Tantric sort of enlightenment, brought about by communion with female life-essence. The Fairy Queen
stated that she had "claret wine" in her lap and invited Thomas to lay
his head there. The original meaning of "claret" was perception, or
enlightenment. In common English usage, claret was also a synonym for blood. In Celtic myth, the Fairy Queen offered "red mead"
which was also herself, Mab (Mead). 5 The Norse version of Thomas
was Sir Bosmer, who swam the "eddying flood" to the Elf-Queen as she stood on the far bank, saying, "Welcome, Sir Bosmer! Come home to me, I've brewed the mead and the wine for thee." 4 Such tales tend
to confirm clergymen's insistence that menstrual blood was the communion wine of witches. After Thomas's journey to the secret paradise, where he remained
seven years recalling the seven windings of the Styx he became a
994



great wizard, poet, and prophet, ranked with such sages of the old faith as Merlin and Tristan. 5

Thomas, Saint Thor
Thomas, Saint
Hellenized name of the god Tammuz, traditional Dying Savior of
the Jerusalem cult (Ezekiel 8:14), whose rites were supplanted by those of Jesus. Tammuz then became Doubting Thomas, challenging Jesus's claim to authentic apotheosis and resurrection in the flesh. He
refused to believe in his rival's return from death until he had probed his wounds. Then, Thomas-Tammuz announced his acceptance of
Jesus as "my Lord and my God" (John 20:28) or so the Gospel would have it.
The story of Doubting Thomas appears only in the so-called
Gnostic Gospel of John, written more than 1 50 years after Jesus's
purported lifetime. 1 Its purpose was to press Christian claims to superi
ority over the old deities.
Thomas the doubter-turned-convert was also Thomas the twin:
Christian legends admitted that Jesus and Thomas-Tammuz had the
same face and were really the same god. According to some sources, the
rival's name was Judas Thomas, or Judas the Tammuz, whose face
was the same as Jesus's face. 2 Judas and Jesus seem to have been
traditional names taken by victims in whom the god Tammuz was
incarnate.
During the 4th century, a shrine at Edessa was taken over by
followers of the new Tammuz now called St. Thomas, Apostle to
India and the usual phony relics were installed. 3

Thor
Scandinavian thunder-and-lightning god, corresponding to the Slavs' Pyerun and the Latin Jove which is why Rome's diesjovis, Jove's Day, became Thursday (Thor's Day). Thor had at least six major sanctuaries in England; Thurstable in Essex was originally "Thor's
Pillar." Thor's cult persisted up to the 1 1th century when a Christian chronicler said Thor or his priest was "a wicked man of Kent"
acting as the king's counselor. Saxons converted to Christianity were
obliged to renounce "Thunaer, Woden and Saxnot, and all those
demons who are their companions." x
Yet Thor continued to be worshipped in the north. His sanctuary
at Maerin in Trondheim was still active in the 1 1th century. 2 Eligius,
bishop of Noyons, scolded Christians for observing Thursday as the holy day of Thor in the 7th century; yet even 500 years later, Thor's

hammers were still revered in temples as sacred relics and sources of
thunder. In Prussia up to the 16th century, Jupiter-Thor was worshipped by the people in "sacred woods in which they made sacrifices
and sacred springs which Christians were not allowed to approach." 3 Thor apparently descended from the Middle-Eastern thunder-bull
who was also Jupiter. Plutarch said the Phoenician thunder god was Thur, the bull. 4 The Germanic Thor "bellowed like a bull" as he swung his hammer. 5 Like other forms of the bull god, he was married
to the Earth Goddess as Thrud, "Power" or "Strength." 6 Though late myths sometimes called Thrud his "daughter," Thor's home in
Asgard belonged to her. It was called Thrudvangar, "Thrud's Field." 7

Thoth
Egyptian god of magic words and writing, which he acquired from his consort Seshat, or Maat. He was identified with the Greek Hermes. His
holy city was known as Hermopolis, "City of Hermes." Priests of
Hermopolis pretended that Thoth had created the world, either by
hatching the World Egg (which he encircled in the form of the
Gnostic Serpent), or by speaking the words of creation, after the manner of the biblical God. (See Logos; Ur-Text.) The Book of
Thoth was a famous legendary work supposed to reveal the secrets of
manipulating matter by verbal charms.
Like Hermes and other manifestations of the Wise Serpent, Thoth
owed his powers to his former close association with the Great
Mother. He was lunar in nature, rather than solar. When he ascended
to heaven, he became the guardian of the Moon gates. 1

Thugs
The curious ritual-murder cult of Thuggee flourished in central India
for some three centuries, until the advent of railroads decreased foot
travel in the 1800s so that the depredations of Thuggee "highway
men" declined.
Thugs were fanatical worshippers of the Goddess Kali, having
developed the idea that killing men in her name would win them a
privileged reincarnation. They preyed on her enemies, the Brahmans.
Women had nothing to fear from the Thugs; their victims were only
men. 1
Thuggee legend said Kali once tried to destroy all the "demons of blood and seed" (men) created by male gods. But each time she
beheaded one, another man sprang up from every drop of spilled blood, probably a remnant of the belief that spilled blood in the Goddess's
996



sanctuary brought forth increased fertility. At last Kali wiped the sweat from her arms with a handkerchief, gave the handkerchief to her
faithful followers, and told them to make it into cords to strangle the "demons" without bloodshed.
Male human sacrifices were still offered to Kali up to the 16th
century a.d., and occasionally even later, decapitation being the method of choice. A boy was beheaded at Kali's altar in Tanjore every
Friday at sunset. 2 A king of Cooch Behar offered a hundred and fifty
men to Kali at Danteshvari in the 1 500s, and a king of Bastar sacrificed
twenty-five men at the same shrine in 1830. Human sacrifice was
prohibited and replaced by animal sacrifice in 1835. Like medieval Arabian Assassins, the Thugs maintained that the rites of their Goddess should continue, and the Brahmans were
heretics who deserved extermination. The Mahabharata presents Kali as
a spirit of Brahmanicide, "with teeth projecting terribly, of an aspect
furiously contorted, tawny and black, with disheveled hair, appalling eyes, and a garland of skulls around her neck, bathed in blood, clad in
rags and the bark of trees." 3 This probably represented a primitive idol of the Death-goddess whose devotees believed she must be bathed in
blood to remain fertile and satisfied.

Thumb
Thyrsus
Thumb
Hindus said the soul, "of the size of a thumb, the innermost Self,
dwells forever in the heart of all beings." According to the Katha
Upanishad, "That being, of the size of a thumb, dwells deep within
the heart. He is the lord of time, past and future." The belief was literal.
The sages actually thought a thumb-sized manikin danced inside the
heart, stamping out the heartbeat, just as Dancing Shiva stamped out the rhythm of the universe as he perpetually danced within the
cosmic body of his consort. The crudity of the original belief now has to
be glossed over by modern commentators, who don't want their
ancient traditions to seem absurd. So the pious scholar writes, "The
sages ascribe a definite, minute size to the Self in order to assist the
disciple in meditation." !
Still, the thumb-sized soul passed into European folklore and
emerged as Hop-O'-My-Thumb and the fairy Thumbelina, both of whom probably began as disembodied souls in search of new bodies.

thought, dealing with
the philosophy known as Vedanta. The Katha Upanishad discusses
transmigration of souls, the nature of eternal life, the doctrine of maya, and an account of a visit to Yama, Lord of the Dead.
Thyrsus
Rod and staff of Dionysus, a wand or scepter tipped with a pine cone, representing the god's power to fertilize. The thyrsus was borne by the
997



Tiamat god himself, by his satyrs, his Maenads, his sileni, and other partici
pants in his sacred orgia. Sometimes the thyrsus was displayed in
conjunction with a wine cup, forming a male-and-female combina
tion like that of the royal scepter and orb. 1
1. Lamusse, 153.
Tiamat
Sumero-Babylonian "Goddess Mother" (Dia Mater), from whose
formless body the universe was born at creation; personification of The Deep, or Tohu Bohu. Babylonians later claimed their municipal god Marduk, Tiamat's son, divided her into heavens above and earth below,
as did Marduk's imitator, the biblical God. But the original division was made by the Mother herself, as in the ancient Pelasgian myth of her
Aegean counterpart, Eurynome. 1
In derivative Hebrew myths, Tiamat became Tehom, The Deep;
and this is how she appears in the Bible (Genesis 1:2). Patriarchal
writers forgot that "The Deep" was a personified womb, a MiddleEastern version of Kali whose being before creation was "formless."
Most creation myths incorporated the idea of formlessness, in the
darkness before the birth that brought "light" and the splitting of the Mother's body, so she became both heaven and earth. The Bible's
account is based on the same archetype. In Egypt, Tiamat was Temu or Te-Mut, oldest of deities, mother of the archaic Ennead of four dual female elements: Water, Dark
ness, Night, and Eternity. 2 She was also Nun, Naunet, or Ma-Nu, the great fish who gave birth to the universe and the gods. In repeated
cycles of becoming, she periodically swallowed up both gods and universes and gave them rebirth like Kali. 5
Tiamat's firstborn child seems to have been a duplicate of herself, Mummu, translated either "churning" or "mother." The combina
tion recalled the ancient notion that solid earth was made from
"churning" the primordial fluid, like making butter from milk. 4 Some
myths gave Tiamat a male consort, Apsu, similar to Jupiter Pluvius: a Father Heaven whose job it was to fertilize the Mother's abyss with
seminal rain. But he was not her superior, not even her equal. Even in
the chaotic conditions before creation, Tiamat was the true source of
life. Her consort was subordinate, not even very necessary. 5 Various
myths said Tiamat alone produced the fluid of creation, which was
not semen but her menstrual blood, flowing continuously for three years
and three months.6 Its great reservoir was the Red Sea comparable
to Kali's "ocean of blood" the eastern shore of which is still called
Tihamat by the Arabs.
Babylonians said their god Marduk divided his mother Tiamat into
two parts, upper waters and lower waters. Likewise, the Jewish God
998



"divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters Tiamat which were above the firmament" (Genesis 1:7). The Jewish God also divided the Red Sea, which was likened to Tiamat herself. ^^^^^^^^^^^
The idea of dividing waters was not original with the Jews.
Goddesses did it before gods. The Hindu Goddess Bindumati, "Mother of Life," divided the waters of the Ganges. 7 The Goddess Isis
divided the waters of the river Phaedrus, to cross dry-shod. 8 Even an insignificant Egyptian wizard named Zazamonkh divided the waters of
a lake to retrieve a courtesan's lost pendant.9 Yahweh's miracle on
behalf of the Israelites was fairly common in contemporary lore.
By dividing Tiamat, Marduk established the Diameter (horizon), which was the Greek version of Tiamat's name, meaning Goddess
Mother. We still say a diameter divides a whole circle. Though Marduk
was supposed to have slain his mother, the Ocean of Blood, he still maintained the menstrual calendar in Babylon, celebrating sabbaths and
months of the year according to the moon's phases. 10 Modern scholars tend to ignore Tiamat's maternal Creatress
nature, describing her as nothing more than a "dragon of chaos" slain by Marduk. It is seldom emphasized that this was a myth of matricide, or that the Goddess was the one who created the world. Some traditions indicate that Marduk's murder of his mother may have been
motivated by jealously, like Cain's murder of Abel. Mother Tiamat had overlooked Marduk and chosen another of her sons, Kingu, to be
her consort and the king of the universe.
[She] exalted among the gods, her sons, that she had borne, Kingu, and
made him greatest among them all . . . placed him on a throne, saying, "By my charm and incantation I have raised thee to power among the
gods. The dominion over all the gods I intrusted to thee. Lofty thou
shalt be, thou my chosen spouse; great be thy name in all the world. " She
then gave him the Tablets ofDestiny, and laid them on his breast. "
Jealous Marduk not only killed Tiamat; he also deposed, castrat
ed, and killed Kingu, and made the first man on earth out of Kingu's blood which tends to show that Kingu was once the name of the
sacrificed god-king, whose blood had the "feminine" power to make
life. 12 Kingu was identified with the moon. Chaldeans called him Sin,
the Moon-god of Mount Sinai. Apparently he still had the tablets of the
Law given him by Tiamat (as Mother Rhea gave sacred tablets of the Law to Minos on Mt. Dicte), for the Old Testament claims he passed them on to Moses.
In southern Arabia, the Goddess was assimilated to Ishtar. The
eyes of her idol Tehama were said to flow with tears each year as she bewailed the death of Tammuz. 13

Tingeltangel Tingeltangel
TWteut,i Sexual orgy connected with worship of the Great Mother in medi
^^^^^^i eval Germany. The same word was known to Scottish witches in the
17th century, according to a Forfar witch's confession that at the
sabbat a "merry" song was sung at a nocturnal churchyard meeting. The song was called "Tinkletum Tankletum," close enough to the German term to show correspondence between them. The Scottish rites seem to have been fairly innocent. Scottish witches only drank some beer and danced, and "the devil kissed every one of the women." '
As a result of such confessions, four women were hanged.

Titania
Ovid's name for Diana, inherited by the medieval Fairy Queen, as
shown in Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream. 1 The original Titania was the Great Goddess who ruled the pantheon of Aegean
"Titans" or Elder Gods, later overthrown by patriarchal Olympians under Father Zeus. The name of the Titans meant "rulers," for they
once ruled the Aegean world. Titania, their queen, was otherwise
known as Themis, Gaea, or Mother Rhea, assimilated as the mother
of the conquering Zeus.

Tiw
Saxon god identified with Mars; the god of Tuesday (Tiw's Day), called Mars's Day in Rome, modern French mardi. Tiw was an archaic
Aryan sky god descended, like Zeus Pater, from Sanskrit Dyauspitar, as suggested by his other names: Tiuz in northern Germany, Ziu in the south, Tyr in Scandinavia. He was also called Things, because he was
invoked at the Germanic Thing or Ding, an assembly for lawmaking. A 3rd-century inscription in Britain called him Mars Thincsus. The
German word for Tuesday, Dienstag, evolved from "Thing-day." '

Tlalteutli
Aztec Goddess of creation. At the beginning of time, the universe
was made of her body. The gods discovered that she wouldn't bring forth new fruit for food, nor any new life, unless she was fed human hearts and drenched with human blood, like some of the manifestations of Kali. 1 Hence the Aztecs' sanguinary sacrifices.

Tlazolteotl Tlazolteotl
Aztec Goddess resembling the medieval Hecate as Queen of Witch- Tohu Bohu
es. Her symbol was a broomstick; she was also associated with the moon, ^bbhih
the snake, and the screech owl. Her sabbats were held at crossroads.
Her sacred women were Ciuateteo, "right honorable mothers," or
Ciuapipiltin, "princesses." Sahagun said they were the ghosts of women who died in childbirth. "They were supposed to wander
through the air, descending when they wished to earth. . . . They haunted cross-roads to practice their maleficent deeds, and they had
temples built at these places where bread offerings were made to
them, also the thunder stones which fall from the sky." ' In other words,
in Mexico as in Europe, the missionary clergy were at pains to diabolize the Mother-deities.

Toga
Garment of clan-ruling matronae in pre-patriarchal Rome. Men
adopted the toga as they gained political power, until in classical times
the only women still wearing it were promiscuous priestesses of the Goddess. Thus it became a custom to distinguish a prostitute by the
name of "toga-wearer." '
1. Rose, 191.
Tohu Bohu
Hebrew "primal chaos," elemental formlessness between the destruc
tion of one universe and the creation of the next. The idea came from a
general Asiatic belief in cyclic recurrences brought about by the
Goddess (Kali), herself the cauldron or sea of "infinite formlessness,"
holding all potential forms in a plastic state of flux. 1 She was the
Abyss or the Deep before creation, according to the Bible (Genesis 1:2). Chaldean sources of the Bible myth said the brooding creative
spirit that brought order out of chaos was the Goddess; but patriarchal writers transformed her into the "Spirit of God." 2 Tohu bohu was her
semi-fluid substance, menstrual blood in the process of clotting into
solidity; the sea, but also a sea of blood. Orphics called it "Chaos eternal,
immense, uncreated, from which all is born; neither darkness nor
light, nor damp nor dry, nor hot nor cold, but all things mingled, eternally one and limitless." 3 Some scholars have identified tohu with
the Primordial Sea, the Goddess Tiamat (Hebrew Tehomet), and bohu
with the male earth god Behemoth, making "a sexual creation." 4

Tongue Tongue
Latin lingus, "tongue," was derived from Sanskrit Hngam, "phallus."
^^^mb^^^h Showing the tongue between the lips was once a sacred gesture
representing the lingam-yoni; to this day the folds of the vulva are
properly called kbiae, "lips." (See Vagina Dentata.)
At the moment of her mating with Shiva, Kali Ma usually showed a protruding tongue in token of the sexual sacrament. 1 The classic
Medusa head signifying "female wisdom" also had a protruding tongue, a reference to ancient sexual mysteries celebrated in her honor. 2
Medieval Christians understood very well that the protruding
tongue was a sexual symbol. Their pictures of lusty devils showed
long phallic tongues, and sticking out the tongue "at" someone became their favorite gesture of insult, equivalent to "fuck you." In the east, where sexuality was not associated with shame or dishonor, sticking out
the tongue is still considered a polite greeting. Italians used to heighten the mouth's resemblance to a vulva by
drawing down one corner of it with the thumb. 3 Biting the thumb, a
supreme insult in Italy, cast a curse of castration.
Archaic sacred kings, who had to kill their "fathers" or predeces
sors to win the queen, often castrated the defeated rival to deprive his
ghost of virtu (man-magic) which might give him enough power to return for revenge. This Oedipal attack was often mythologized as
the slaying of a dragon, symbol of "father," or "phallus bigger than mine." The dragon-slayer's reward was the woman (mother). Drag
on-slaying heroes cut off the dragon's tongue, representing amputation of the penis. Tristan cut off the tongue of his slain dragon, to establish
his right to demand the hand of Iseult. 4
In medieval cathedrals, "an extraordinary number of grotesque
heads are depicted with protruding tongues," and this was distinctly related to exposure of sexual organs. "The exposure of the genitalia was widely believed to thwart and keep at bay pursuing evil forces." 5 All
over the Gothic cathedral, numerous creatures with their tongues
sticking out showed once again that the cathedral was dedicated to a
pantheon of both Christian and pagan deities. People wanted their
"creatures from the grotto" ox grotesques to inhabit the same
churches that were built over the sites of the old grottoes. By Renais
sance times, the old deities with their obscenely protruding tongues were declared devils, so it became conventional to show devils making
this gesture.6 The story of Pinocchio's nose, which grew every time he told a lie,
may have originated in Oriental beliefs concerning the tongue. Buddhists said a liar's tongue would grow to great length in hell. 7 The Buddhists called "liars" most of the old non-Buddhist deities who
stuck out their tongues in token of the sexual sacrament.

Tophet Tophet
Alternate name for hell, from the Jewish shrine of Tophet in the
valley of Hinnom, outside Jerusalem, where Solomon made fire- ^^m^^^mm^^^m
sacrifices to the Tyrian god Heracles-Melkart, or Molech (1 Kings
11:17). The previous source was probably the Egyptian Tephet, "Hidden abode," a part of the underworld. 1
At the Tophet altar, victims "passed through the fire to eternal
life," meaning they were burned to death and rose again as gods. For
a while, Molech was identified with Yahweh, which is why the sons of Aaron were consumed on the altar by "fire from the Lord" (Leviti
cus 10:2). Norse heroes also passed through "magic fire" to reach the
paradise of the Valkyries. Jewish surrogate-kings were still burned for the Lord in Hilkiah's reign (2 Kings 23: 10). 2
Levite priests eventually distinguished Yahweh from Molech and forbade the latter's worship (Leviticus 18:21); but the cult of Hera
cles-Melkart still flourished in St. Paul's time in Paul's own home town
of Tarsus. 3 Because victims burned in this "Tophet" were deified as
holy martyrs, Paul thought there was a special magic in giving one's body to be burned (1 Corinthians 1 3:3).

Torture
During the Middle Ages, torture became the common accompaniment to legal cases involving matters of faith. Pagan common-law
traditions opposed the use of torture, and regarded an accused person
as innocent until proven guilty by the prosecution. 1 Christian crusaders
and inquisitors reversed this trend. (See Inquisition.) The Inquisition's use of torture removed all possibility of proof of innocence. Gibbon said, "No power under heaven could save the prisoner; he
was doomed." Weyer, an eyewitness, wrote that the inquisitors' victims
were "slaughtered with the most refined tortures that tyrants could
invent, beyond human endurance. And this cruelty is continued until
the most innocent are forced to confess themselves guilty." 2
Surviving records, though scanty, paint a hideous picture of the Inquisition's activities, which were sometimes disbelieved even by
icontemporaries because they were unimaginable. A woman arrested at Eichstatt in 1637 "laughed heartily" on the first day of her trial at the
idea that she might have trafficked with the devil. She said she would
rather die than accuse herself of such doings; she had lived a
jblameless life with her husband and eight children for more than 20
years. Three weeks later, she died under the torture, confessing that
he was in love with the devil, that she killed one of her children at his
bidding, and that at least 45 of her neighbors were fellow-Satanists. 3
Not even the most saintly had a chance against the inquisitors'
hngines. A 16th-century abbess of the convent of Santa Isabela at
1003



Torture Cordova, Magdalena de la Cruz, was a woman of "an extraordinary
reputation for sanctity." Nevertheless she was accused and arrested,
and soon confessed to practicing witchcraft with the help of two familia
demons, Balbar and Pithon. 4
The inquisitors' rule was to keep on torturing until the victim named many "accomplices," who were then arrested and tortured
until more names were given, and so on until whole districts were foun
to be "infected" with heresy. One woman told her confessor: "I never dreamed that by means of the torture a person could be brought
to the point of telling such lies as I have told. I am not a witch, and I
have never seen the devil, and still I had to plead guilty myself and denounce others." One minister urged a condemned witch to re
nounce her accusations of innocent people, but she answered, "Father,
look at my legs! They are like fire ready to burn up so excruciat
ing is the pain. I could not stand to have so much as a fly touch them, t<
say nothing of submitting again to the torture. I would a hundred
times rather die than endure such frightful agony again. I cannot
describe to any human being how terrific the pain actually is." 5 Such
torture was "extensively, viciously, and persistently used and could break all but the most heroic spirits." 6
Weyer served as a physician in witch prisons and spoke from first
hand knowledge of women driven half mad "by frequent torture . . .
kept in prolonged squalor and darkness of their dungeons . . . and constantly dragged out to undergo atrocious torment until they would
gladly exchange at any moment this most bitter existence for death, are
willing to confess whatever crimes are suggested to them rather than
be thrust back into their hideous dungeon amid ever recurring torture.'
Friedrich von Spee, a Jesuit confessor who also worked in the prisons,
wrote: "All recantation is vain. If she does not confess, the torture is
repeated twice, thrice, four times. In 'exceptional' crimes, the
torture is not limited in duration, severity, or frequency. . . . She can
never clear herself. The investigating body would feel disgraced if it
acquitted a woman; once arrested and in chains, she has to be guilty, by fair means or foul." 7
This might be contrasted with the old law of the Ripuarian Franks
that any man who killed a woman for any reason whatever must pay a
fine so heavy that it obligated his descendants for three generations. 8
Motherhood was a distinct liability for those who fell into inquisi
tors' hands. Bodin recommended that children, if "craftily handled," could be depended on to inform against their mothers. Children were
also highly susceptible to torture; so a rule was made that children could be tortured at once, without any waiting period. Elicited by
torture or by craft, the testimony of "infants" meaning children
under 10 was acceptable to the Inquisition and could convict their
mothers of witchcraft, even though such testimony was not accepted in other kinds of trials.9
Rules for the persecution of witches allowed no revocation of
1004



confessions after torture. Those who tried to retract their confessions Torture
were taken back to the torture chamber and tortured again; once to purge themselves of the retraction, and once again to elicit a "true" ^^^^^^^^^^^m
confession. Any display of fear was proof of guilt. So was denunciation
by another tortured victim. In 1 597 a 69-year-old woman named
Clara Geissler manage to resist the thumbscrew, but confessed every
thing she had been asked after racking and crushing of her feet.
When those she named had been arrested and similarly tortured, Clara
was returned to the torture chamber to confirm their confessions. She
was tortured with "the utmost severity," and died. The record stated
that the devil had wrung her neck. 10
In some cases of retracted confessions, the court automatically
assumed that the confession was true, and the retraction a perjury.
The victim was then declared a relapsed impenitent, and handed over to
the stake. 11
Inquisitors were instructed by their handbooks to give false prom
ises of mercy for the sake of compliance and confession. 12 There was
no need to keep any promises to an accused witch. If a victim confessed
everything, abjured her heresy, and threw herself on the court's
mercy, her sentence was carried out anyway, on two counts: (1) for the
"temporal injuries" she had caused, and (2) for the worthlessness of her confession which was made "from fear of death" rather than from
true repentance. 15 The same "worthless" confession, though, was a legal basis for execution.
Denial of guilt was useless, even if it could be maintained against
tortures. Le Sieur Bouvet declared that "denial of guilt by a prisoner
was an especially good reason why torture should be continued."
Limborch's History ofthe Inquisition said it was a simple matter to
extort confession by torture from "such as are most innocent." Accord
ing to Cornelius Loos, "Wretched creatures are compelled by the
severity of the torture to confess things they have never done, and so by
cruel butchery innocent lives are taken and by a new alchemy gold and silver coined from human blood." Von Spee wrote, "The most robust who have thus suffered have affirmed to me that no crime can
be imagined which they would not at once confess, if it would bring
ever so little relief, and they would welcome ten deaths to escape a
repetition." H Records of the Spanish Inquisition at Toledo show that some
victims were prevented from confessing until the lust of their tormen
tors had been gratified. Their torture went on for days or weeks beyond
the point where they had wholly broken down, and pleaded to be told what to say, so they could say it. 15 Such evidence shows that the
Inquisition really was a system of formalized sadism. The fact that the
vast majority of its victims were women points to crypto-sexual motiva
tions engendered by repression on a massive scale. Pope Alexander III said in an encyclical letter that confessions
should not be forced by torture. His successors took it upon themselves
1005



Torture to explain that what Alexander really meant was that torture must not
be used against clergymen by lay persons; but it could be used by the
^^^^^ clergy against laymen. When Innocent IV adopted torture for eccle
^
siastical trials, he said it should "stop short of loss of life or limb," but thi:
was a mere formality, since limbs were broken or crushed routinely in
the torture chamber. When a victim died under torture, inquisitors were authorized by Pope Urban IV to absolve each other from guilt, to be
innocent in the sight of God. 16 Many semantic devices were used to convey an official impression that the inquisitors were not monsters of cruelty. Records often said confessions were given freely, sine tortura et extra locum torturae "without torture and even out of sight of the instruments of torture."
This meant that after the victims were tortured, they were carried into
another room and given the choice of confessing "freely" or being taken back to the torture chamber. 17 When victims managed to kill themselves in prison, or died of thei
injuries, they were said to have been slain by the devil. One victim who succeeded in cutting his own throat was described by Friar Guazzc
as "tempted by a demon," which carried away his soul, "for so did
Divine Justice dispose." 18 Few victims were allowed an opportunity to
kill themselves, for they were closely chained at night; but they could easily be devoured by the rats and other prison-infesting vermin attract
ed by the smell of blood and suppurating wounds. 19
Most victims pleaded for death sooner or later, but pious ones were further tormented by visions of the hellfire that awaited them,
dying with lies on their lips. A housewife named Rebecca Lemp ser
letters from prison to her husband and six children, showing radical
alterations in her attitude before and after torture. At first she was
confident: "My dearly beloved Husband, be not troubled. Were I to be
charged by thousands of accusations, I am innocent, else may all the demons in hell come and tear me to pieces. Were they to pulverize me, cut me in a thousand pieces, I could not confess anything. Therefore do not be alarmed; before my conscience and before my soul I am
innocent. Will I be tortured? I don't believe it, since I am not guilty
of anything." After she had been tortured five times, and had confessed every
enormity her tormentors suggested to her, Rebecca wrote again to her husband: "O thou, the chosen of my heart, must I be parted from
thee, though entirely innocent? If so, may God be followed through
out eternity by my reproaches. They force one and make one confess; they have so tortured me. . . . Husband, send me something that I
may die, or I must expire under the torture. . . . Send me something,
else may I peril even my soul." 20
Another letter smuggled out of the Bamberg prison in 1628 was
written by a man of means, Burgomaster Johannes Junius, whose
property was taken by the inquisitors:
Many hundred thousand good-nights, dearly beloved daughter Veronica.
1006



Innocent have I come into prison, innocent have I been tortured, Torture innocent must I die. For whoever comes into the witch prison must become a witch or be tortured until he invents something out ofhis ^^^^^^^^^^^^m
head and God pity him bethinks him ofsomething. I will tell you how it has gone with me. . . . The executioner put the thumb screws on me, both hands bound together, so that the blood ran out at the nails and everywhere, so that for four weeks I could not use my hands, as you can see from the writing .... Thereafter they first stripped me, bound my hands behind me, and drew me up in the torture. Then I thought heaven and earth were at an end; eight times did they draw me up and let
me fall again, so that I suffered terrible agony. The executioner said, "Sir, I beg you, for God's sake confess something, whether it be true or
not. Invent something, for you cannot endure the torture which you
will be put to, and even ifyou bear it all, yet you will not escape. "... Now, dear child, here you have all my confession, for which I must die.
And they are sheer lies and made-up things, so help me God. For all this I was forced to say through fear of the torture which was threatened beyond what I had already endured. For they never leave off with the torture till one confesses something; be he never so good, he must be a
witch. Nobody escapes. . . . Dear child, keep this letter secret so that
people do not find it, else I shall be tortured most piteously and the jailers will be beheaded. So strictly is it forbidden. . . . I have taken several days to write this; my hands are both lame. lam in a sad plight. Good
night, for your father Johannes Junius will never see you more. . . . Dear
child, six have confessed against me at once . . . all false, through
compulsion, as they told me, and begged my forgiveness in God's name before they were executed. 2'
Torture was euphemistically called "the Question." Making a show of mercy, handbooks of the Inquisition recommended that the
accused be questioned at first "lightly, without shedding of blood." 22
Sometimes this elicited full confessions. A witch in the diocese of
Constance confessed to having raised a hailstorm by pouring water
into a small hole in the ground after she "had at first been exposed to
the very gentlest questions, being suspended hardly clear of the ground by her thumbs." 25
Other methods, not quite so gentle, included the rack, thumb
screw, bootscrew, whips, branding irons, pincers for twisting off gobbets of flesh, ropes to wind the extremities until blood spurted from
under the nails. A favorite of the judges was the hoist or strappado, a
pulley to haul the victim into the air by her arms bound behind her
back, jerking her up and down until the shoulders were dislocated.
The water torture was also common. This consisted of forcing gallons of
water into the belly through a funnel put down the throat, sometimes
also forcing down and pulling up long strips of linen along with the water, or paddling the distended belly with sticks. Feet or hands
might be basted with boiling fat and roasted over a brazier. 24 Most of the
instruments were inscribed with the pious motto: Soli Deo Gloria,
Glory be only to God. 25 Dr. Johann Meyfarth witnessed hundreds of witch trials in the
1007



Torture 1 7th century and wrote that he would have given a thousand thalers
to be able to forget what he had seen: "feet wrenched off legs, and eyes ^^^^^^^^^ torn from their sockets, and the prisoner burned with brimstone and
^
^^^m basted with oil. He had seen torturers apply flaming balls of brimstone to
the genitals of a woman while she was hanging in strappado. He had watched them revel in horror until their victims confessed or died
(strangled by the Devil, the judges explained)." 26 Execution was still another torture, sometimes miserably protracted, as in Spain where half-burned heretics were snatched from the flames, still alive, and allowed to suffer for hours before being returned to the fire. At the "Witches' Tower" in Hesse, victims were hung 1 5
feet above ground in niches, and slowly baked to death over a low fire. Numerous burned bones and skulls were found buried at the base of
the tower. 27 Oddly enough, the tower later became the property of the
novelist Sacher-Masoch, who gave his name to the perversion known as masochism. 28
A significant detail, speaking psychologically, was that inquisitors seemed very anxious to make women cry. It was their rule that a
witch was proved guilty if she didn't shed tears during torture. The
judge adjured her to weep, "by the loving tears shed by Christ on the
cross." If she did weep, though, she went to the stake anyway, for it
proved the devil had given her the gift of tears to mislead the
judges. 29 If she didn't weep, she was convicted of "taciturnity," a crime
punishable by burning. In England, the punishment for taciturnity was peine fort et dure pressing to death. 30
England didn't import the engines of torture used on the conti
nent, but Scotland did. English witch-finders used informal or
bloodless tortures like starvation, "swimming the witch," or "walking the witch" (preventing her from sleeping until a confession was
made). 31 Various binding tortures were used. An accused witch might
be stripped and bound cross-legged on a table, sometimes with ropes around the neck attached to the four corners of the room, and left in
that position until she confessed. Sometimes, accused witches were so
tightly manacled in jail while awaiting trial, that they came to the courtroom with limbs rotted by gangrene. Many died of "gaol fever"
(typhus) before they could be tried at all.
Swimming the witch was a relic of the ordeal by water. With
thumbs bound to the opposite big toes, the victim was lowered into a
stream or pond by men holding ropes, one on each bank. If the body
floated, witchcraft was proved, on the theory that water rejected a
witch. If the body sank, the accused was innocent, although frequently dead of drowning. The decision was largely dependent on the men who held the ropes.
Peasant mobs often invented their own tortures for suspected
witches. At Catton in Suffolk in 1603, a mob of men tossed an 80
year-old woman up in the air, punched her, flashed gunpowder in her face, and "having prepared a stool in the which they had stuck
1008



daggers and knives with sharp points upwards, they often times struck Torture
her down upon the same stool whereby she was sore pricked and
grievously hurt." 32 ^^^^^im
"Pricking" was the favorite technique of witch-finders who
claimed to locate the giveaway witch mark or "devil's mark" on a
witch's body by sticking a three-inch awl into her flesh. The devil's mark
was supposed to be a numb spot, so the pricking would produce no pain. Most witch-finders used a trick instrument with a retractable blade,
like a stage dagger, to find the "painless" spot. 33 Scottish prickers formed a regular guild. Among the more famous of them were John
Bain, John Balfour, John Kincaid the "common pricker," and Matthew Hopkins, who pricked hundreds of old women in the country of Suffolk, and soon announced that the entire area was infested with
witches. 34
The search for the mark was not necessarily definitive, if it failed.
When the Bavarian witch-finder Jorg Abriel couldn't find the mark
on a woman, he simply said she looked like a witch to him, and went on
to torture her into admitting it. 35
Grim Calvinist Scotland instituted tortures as nasty as the conti
nental ones, though the persecution was less, because the church made no profit from it. Perhaps the most famous Scottish witch trial was
conducted in the presence of King James VI (James 1 of England), who was convinced the witches had caused a storm at sea that nearly
wrecked his ship, and badly frightened him. The record said they had
done it by throwing a dead cat into the sea. They also set sail on the sea
in a sieve. 36
The alleged ringleader of the "coven" was Dr. John Fian, a
schoolmaster, who displayed exemplary courage in the face of multiple tortures, but his courage did him no good. "His nails upon all his
fingers were riven and pulled off with an instrument called in Scottish
a turkas, which in England we call a pair of pincers, and under every nail there was thrust in two needles." He was subjected to "thrawing"
(binding the head tightly with a rope), tongue-pricking, and three sessions in the boots. He "did abide so many blows in them, that his
legs were crushed and beaten together as small as might be, and the
bones and flesh so bruised, that the blood and marrow spouted forth
in great abundance, whereby they were made unserviceable for ever." 37
He was carried to the stake on a cart. 38
The memory of this martyr to superstition was sullied by a rather bawdy tale that arose after his death. Dr. Fian was said to have
craved the love of a village maiden, and bribed her brother to obtain
three of her pubic hairs for a love charm. The boy was caught by his
mother, who substituted three hairs from a cow's udder. Dr. Fian
accepted these and made his love charm, after which he was pursued
through the village by a roaring, lovesick cow. 39 Through its history, western civilization has been disgraced by
spectacles of formalized infliction of pain upon the helpless. Such
1009



Torture spectacles are even artificially contrived in modern "entertainment,"
such as films. G. B. Shaw remarked, "A public flogging will always ____^^_^_ draw a crowd; and there will be in that crowd plenty of manifestations of
a horrible passional ecstasy in the spectacle of laceration and suffering."'40 Sometimes it was so blatant as to embarrass even participants.
When Protestants abolished the bloody sport of bear-baiting in England, they gave as their reason not that it was cruel to bears and
dogs, but that it afforded too much pleasure to the spectators. 41 Animals and women were perennial victims, even equated with one another by churchmen who claimed both were devoid of souls.
Among the most savagely tormented were women suspected of enjoy
ing their sexuality witches, whores, adulteresses. The latter received
public floggings in colonial America: "Public whippings yielded a vicarious sexual experience a mixture of sadism and mass voyeur
ism cloaked in righteous disapproval. . . . They gathered on such occasions to watch as a woman convicted of uncontrolled desire
bared her back down to the waist and was whipped by a man with a kind of erotic violence later made notorious by the Comte de Sade." 42
Western civilization came to choose pain over pleasure: to think
pain-giving permissible, fit for public display, even pious, whereas pleasure-giving of the physical sort was suspect, hidden, "evil." The two
types of behavior seem to be inversely related. If a society suppresses one, the other will flourish. Studies with laboratory animals show that
individuals conditioned to be highly aggressive have below-normal
sex drive and display little interest in copulation. It has also been
observed among human beings that angry, hostile individuals have
little sexual appetite. 43
Sexually repressed individuals abounded in western society, especially in the church, which spawned the Inquisition. There were also less extreme manifestations of the evil. Doctors lauded the salutary
effects of pain. Paullini's Flagellum Salutis ( 1 698) recommended severe beatings for "quick and easy cures" of such disorders as melan
cholia, paralysis, toothache, sleepwalking, deafness, and nymphomania. Professor Cullen at Edinburgh taught that "stripes and blows about the body" help cure maniacs. John Battie, another expert
on the care of the insane, wrote: "Body pain may be excited to purpose
and without the least danger. Beating is often serviceable." 44
Among the most curious manifestations of western man's pain
obsession was its projection upon women as the givers of pain, almost
as if man collectively sought punishment for his historical offenses
against females. Flagellation was remarkably popular among Victorian "puritans." Publisher George Cannon called flagellation "a letch which has existed from time immemorial, and is so extensively
indulged in London at this day that no less than twenty splendid
establishments are supported entirely by its practice." 45 One writer said, "Lovers of the birch ... are almost as common as the lovers of Venus." 46

But it was Venus who wielded the birch: usually a mother image, Torture
stepmother, aunt, governess, housekeeper, or a large, imposing sort of courtesan. Swinburne said, "One of the great charms of birching lies ^^^^^^^^^^^
in the sentiment that the floggee is the powerless victim of the furious
rage of a beautiful woman." St. George H. Stock wrote: "When an
elegant high bred woman wields the birch with dignity of mein and
grace of attitude, then both the practice and suffering becomes a real
pleasure." Dugdale published a pornographic book entitled Betsy Thoughtless, "a most spicey [sic] and piquant Narrative of a Young Girl obliged to excoriate her sweetheart's bum before he could ravish her
Maidenhead." 47 A typical passage of Victorian "spice" ran:
Martinet meanwhile had taken offher loose morning wrapper, and armed herself with a rod, formed, not ofcanes and cuttings like the rest, but of stout birch stems with innumerable branches, like a tree in miniature.
With this weapon in her hand, how terrible she appeared! Juno deprived ofthe apple might have looked like her. Her splendid neck and arms were bare, her cheeks flamed, her huge breasts were heaving.
Speech was too weak, the graces ofbirching were ignored, nothing short ofsavage beating would satisfy her present need of vengeance. *8
Was this a vision of woman wronged or Goddess ignored
through centuries of oppression, surfacing in pornography which by
its very simplicity may give expression to genuinely archetypal imagery? These books were written by men, not women. They presented
fantasies that men wanted to see in the mind's eye. In one porno
graphic work, a young man was beaten for insulting his mother, by an older woman presented as a "nurse" ordinarily, a nurturer or
caretaker. Her bizarre speech ran: "The young gentleman thought, I dare swear, there was no one could break him of those crimes, but I'll
whip this bold backside of his till I strip every bit of skin off it, or I'll work
an amendment in him." The youth pleaded, "Try me this once, my dearest mistress! Oh gracious! Try me! Oh, I'm killed! let me down! let
me down! nurse! nurse! nurse!" She answered, "You may roar, and
cry, and kick, and plunge, and implore, my pretty gentleman, but all will not do; I'll whip you till the blood runs to your heels! You shall feel
the tuition of this excellent rod!" 49
William Gladstone, four times prime minister of England, regular
ly indulged in flagellation and patronized brothels for the purpose, as was discovered when his diaries were published in 1975. 50 Of course,
English public-school customs of hazing and caning created many unfortunates whose sexual drives were warped into a confusion between
pleasure and pain; the poet Swinburne presents a well-known exam
ple. But a tradition even older had predisposed all Christendom to this kind of confusion. The sense of sin and guilt attached to all forms of
sexuality; the ubiquitous image of a tortured Christ revered for his
suffering (inflicted on him by Father); the generally accepted theory that children must be trained to "fear God" through painful punish
ments many such things together established a culture of cruelty,
1011



Transubstantiation where men often judged their own success in life by their level of ability to make others suffer. This was the real meaning of power.
_^^^^^^^^^_ Psychologically, men who obviously enjoyed torturing women anc
children revealed their own incapacity to inspire love. Sadists find
sadistic behavior satisfying because it can elicit strong emotional responses from people who would otherwise pay no attention to them.
A sadist doesn't know how to be lovable. This feeling of powerlessness
can be transformed into a feeling of power if he can torture. He can
even achieve something like a sense of bravery or daring, despite the fact that the victim has no opportunity to retaliate. To subject others
to any violent physical attack is to defy their rage. When such rage is
made completely helpless to express itself, as in the case of a prisoner, the victim becomes an object of total control which is precisely what
men yearned to make of women ever since patriarchal thought introduced the possibility.
Sadism has been called the religion of psychical cripples. 51 It was also a religion of sexual cripples. Unable to reconcile their concept of
sin with the tenderness and affection that good sexual relatedness
requires, Christians turned to perverted obsessions with pain and
punishment. Western historians were fond of describing the barbarian
cruelties of the ancient pagan world, as contrasted with a "Christian"
morality of kindness. However, it might appear that of the two approaches to morality, paganism was the kinder one on the whole. At
least its cruelty was never so mercilessly efficient as that of western
civilization, extending from the Inquisition to the wars and concentration camps of the 20th century.

Transubstantiation
Catholics claim by the doctrine of transubstantiation that the bread
and wine of the Eucharist is entirely transformed into Jesus's flesh and
blood, a doctrine as old as primitive cannibalistic blood-sacrifices
when the "symbol" was real because the dying god was in fact eaten.
The Satapatha Brahmana says the first sacrifice most acceptable to the gods was a man; then a horse was substituted, then a bull, ram, or
goat, and at last "it was found that the gods were most pleased" with
offerings of grain. 1
1012



Mystery cults of the early Christian era sacrificed and ate their gods Transubstantiation
in the form of bread and wine, whether the "savior" was Osiris,
Mithra, Attis, Dionysus, or Orpheus. Rationalists like Cicero objected to ^^^^^^^^^^
the practice: "When we call the corn Ceres and the wine Bacchus we
use a common figure of speech; but do you imagine that any one is so insane as to believe that the thing he feeds upon is a god?" Yet the
vulgar did indeed believe it, transforming the ancient omophagia into grain-flesh and wine-blood of the god who might carry them into heaven when he became a part of them. Jesus repeated the same claim as all other savior gods: "Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my
blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day." 2
The theory behind transubstantiation was the most primitive kind
of magic, "the echo of some prehistoric cannibalistic religion. . . . The flesh and blood consumed becomes an innate part of the diner.
Thus, if a man feeds on a stag, some measure of the animal's
swiftness becomes a part of his own skill; if he drinks the blood of a
warrior, he acquires the warrior's power and strength." 3 If he eats a
god, he becomes godlike. Literal belief in the conversion of bread and wine into Jesus's flesh
and blood was essential to the idea of salvation, which Christianity
shared with the pagan Mysteries. Doubt on this point was not tolerated.
St. Gregory the Great told of a woman who dared laugh at the
Eucharist, explaining to Gregory, "I laughed because you called this morsel of bread, which I kneaded with my own hands, the 'Body of
Christ.'" Gregory then prayed, and caused the host lying on the altar to
be changed into "a piece of flesh in the form of a finger." This convinced the woman, who then ate the bread she had just seen turned
into a finger, and came back to the faith. 4
Even today, those who tried to reinterpret the Eucharist as a purely symbolic act have been rebuked ex cathedra by the pope. The 1965
encyclical Mysterium Fidei once again insisted on "the marvelous
change of the whole of the bread's substance into Christ's body and
the whole of the wine's substance into his blood." Having never
wavered on this point, churchmen were curiously inconsistent, to say the least, in condemning converted Mexican Indians for secretly con
tinuing their "great heresy and abominable sin," which consisted of
making "dough images of their god which were distributed and eaten." 5
Transubstantiation was one of the primary doctrinal causes of the
Protestant Reformation. John Huss and his colleague Jerome of
Prague went to the stake for denying it, but their martyrdom set off the war between the papacy and the Bohemian heretics, which ended with the church's loss of all Bohemia and the foundation of the
independent Moravian church. 6 Protestants eventually developed contempt for Catholic "God-eaters." Heath's 1610 Epigrammes called
them worse than cannibals, who committed only the lesser sin of
eating man's flesh. 7 Both factions, perhaps dimly recalling pagan versions of transubstantiation, viewed witches as cannibals. "Where the
1013



Transvestism basic internal social divisions are between the generations or sexes, women and children are often cast as witches and cannibals by the
^^^^^^^^^^^ dominant males." 8
There was much satisfaction in pagan communion feasts where
the god was incarnate in an edible animal and distributed even to the poor, who seldom enjoyed any meat of their own. But the church came
to regard this kind of feast as too expensive. "The point that really merits attention is that the nutritive value of the communion feast is
virtually zero, whether there is transubstantiation or not. . . . What
the end of animal sacrifice really signified was the end of ecclesiastical
redistributive feasting." 9

Transvestism
When men began to seek a share of religious and magical knowledge,
formerly the property of women, their original objective was to make themselves resemble women so the spirits would find them acceptable. A common method was to put on women's clothes. Transvestism is found in a majority of ancient priesthoods. Tacitus
said the priests of Germanic tribes were muliebri ornatu, men dressed
up as women. 1 Norse priests of sunrise and sunset rituals in honor of the
Haddingjar (Heavenly Twins) were men whose office demanded that they wear the dress and hair styles of women. 2 Even Thor, the thunder
god, received his magic hammer and was filled with power only after
he put on the garments of the Goddess Freya and pretended to be a
bride. 5
At the ancient Argive "Feast of Wantonness" (Hubristika) men
became women by wearing women's dresses and veils, temporarily
assuming feminine powers in violation of a specific taboo. 4 Cretan
priests of Leukippe, the White-Mare-Mother, always wore female dress. So did priests of Heracles, ostensibly in memory of their god's service (in female dress) to the Lydian Goddess Omphale, personification of the omphalos} The Jewish philosopher Moses Maimonides said men in his day put on women's clothing to invoke the aid of the Goddess Venus.6
Roman priests of the Magna Mater dressed as women, and
transvestism figured prominently in Roman rites of the Lupercalia and the Ides of January. The custom was still prevalent in the time of St.
Augustine, who inveighed against men who clothed themselves in women's garments at the feast of Janus. He said such men could not
attain salvation, even if they were otherwise good Christians. Before
his conversion to Christianity, St. Jerome even participated in ritual transvestism, though his biographers tried to pretend that he had worn women's clothes by mistake. 7
1014



Despite Augustine and other church fathers, ritual transvestism Transvestism
continued. Men dressed in women's clothes at religious festivals at Amasea in the 5 th century, and again or still at the Kalends of ^^^^^^^^i
January in the 10th century. Balsamon said in the 12th century even
the clergy participated in pagan rites in the nave of the church, wearing masks and female dress. 8 Gregory of Tours, bishop of Auvergne in Merovingian times, was forced to give up his church to a crowd of
"demons," their leader dressed as a woman and seated on the
episcopal throne.9 The inquisitor Jean Bodin asserted that male and
female witches actually changed their sex by changing clothes with
one another. 10
Men's transvestism was rooted in the ancient desire to imitate
female magic. In the Celebes, religious rituals remained in the hands
of women, assisted by an order of priests who wore female dress and
were called tjalabai, "imitation women." The same word was applied
in Arabia to the robe that men copied from women, djallaba. n Among the northern Batak the shaman is always a woman, and the office is
hereditary in the female line, because there was no transvestism. 12 In
Borneo, magicians are required to wear female clothing. Siberian shamans often wore women's clothes. Considered greatest were those shamans who could "change their sex" and become female, taking husbands and living as homosexual wives. 13 Similarly, American Indians viewed the homosexual or berdache as a gifted medicine man. He claimed to receive an order from the
Moon-goddess in a dream, to the effect that he must turn female and become one of her own. He was accepted by the tribe as the woman he wanted to be, was allowed to wear women's clothes, joined the
women's craft guilds and dance societies. Eliade says, "Ritual and
symbolic transformation into a woman is probably explained by an
ideology derived from the archaic matriarchy." H
An observer in Maiaya said it was "more than likely that manang
ism (shamanism) was originally a profession of women, and that men were gradually admitted to it, at first only by becoming as much like women as possible." 15 The manang or shaman put on female
clothing after initiation, and remained a transvestite for life. A Dyak
manang still wears women's dress and follows women's occupations.
"This transvestism, with all the changes that it involved, is accepted after a supernatural command has been thrice received in dreams: to refuse would be to seek death. This combination of elements shows
clear traces of a feminine magic and a matriarchal mythology, which must formerly have dominated the shamanism of the Sea Dyak; almost all the spirits are invoked by the manang under the name of Ini
('Great Mother')." 16 The Krishna cult as currently practiced in India still demands ritual
transvestism for men who adore the feminine principle by identifying themselves with Krishna's Gopis. They wear the clothes and ornaments of women and even observe a "menstrual period" of a few days'

Irish god of the trefoil (shamrock), known as Triple Bearer of the
Triple Key, the same as Shiva the "trident-bearer," referring to a triple
phallus designed to fertilize the Triple Goddess. The shamrock-god was assimilated to St. Patrick, another bearer of the trefoil, whose name
meant "father" like that of any tribal begetter. Old legends said the
Irish god's trefoil produced apple, nut, and oak trees, as well as the five mystic trees representing the five senses. 1 See Shamrock; Trident.

"Three Ways," a Roman title of Hecate as Goddess of three-way
crossroads, where her three-faced images received offerings of cake, fruit, or money. She also ruled springs and fountains. Money is still
offered to the Roman fountain that bears her name, Trevi.
The modern meaning of "trivia" may be related to early attempts
to belittle the cult of the Goddess and render unimportant the old
custom of offering gifts to her image for protection on journeys.
Triangle
Tantric tradition said the triangle was the Primordial Image, or the
female Triangle of Life. 1 It was known as the Kali Yantra, representing
Kali as Cunti, or else as the Yoni Yantra, or sign of the vulva. 2 In
Egypt the triangle was a hieroglyphic sign for "woman," and it carried the same meaning among the gypsies, who brought it from their original home in Hindustan. 3 In the Greek sacred alphabet, the delta or triangle stood for the Holy Door, vulva of the All-Mother Demeter
("Mother Delta").
Most ancient symbol systems recognized the triangle as a sign of the Goddess's Virgin-Mother-Crone trinity and at the same time as
her genital "holy place," source of all life. The triangle represented the Virgin Moon Goddess called Men-Nefer, archaic deity of the first
Mother-city of Memphis. 4 The triangle itself was worshipped in much the same way that modern Christians worship the cross. Concerning
this, Oriental sages said: "The object of the worship of the Yantra is to
1016



attain unity with the Mother of the Universe in Her forms as Mind,
Life, and Matter . . . preparatory to Yoga union with Her as She is in herself as Pure Consciousness." 5 The triangle was everywhere connected with the female trinity, and a frequent component of monograms of Goddesses. To the Gnostics, the triangle signified "creative intellect." 6

Trident
Triduana, Saint
Trident
Symbol of the triple phallus displayed by any god whose function it was to mate with the Triple Goddess; a masculine counterpart of the
triangle. In India, the "trident-bearer" was Shiva, bridegroom of threefold Kali. 1 In the west, the trident passed to such underground or
abyssal gods as Hades, Pluto, Neptune, and Poseidon, and after them to the Christian devil, their composite descendant.
Celtic myth retained the original phallic significance of the Triple Key to the Holy Door. Like Shiva, the primitive Irish shamrock-god Trefuilngid Tre-Eochair was a "bearer of the triple key." Symbol of
his Door was the trefoil that the Arabs called shamrakh and the
Hindus worshipped as an emblem of Kali thousands of years before the
first Aryans came to Ireland. 2 The Irish god was quaintly assimilated
to Christianity by a Middle Irish text claiming that he appeared to Fintan, king of Tara, on the day of Christ's death, bearing a sacred branch with three fruits, and stone tablets of Celtic property law. 5
Because the trident was generally recognized as a phallus in pagan tradition, Renaissance "devils" were often pictured with three
pronged or forked penises. A devil "cum membro bifurcate" was
mentioned in 1 520, and a number of inquisitorial judges said witches
copulated with devils whose phalli had two or more points. 4

Trinity
Like three-headed
Kali in India, Egypt's primal mother Mut had three heads and three names. An archaic name for Egypt, Khem, with a feminine ending formed the word for "three" Khemt*
Trinity
From the earliest ages, the concept of the Great Goddess was a trinity
and the model for all subsequent trinities, female, male, or mixed.
Anatolian villages in the 7th millenium b.c. worshipped a Goddess in
three aspects as a young woman, a birth-giving matron, and an old woman. 1 This typical Virgin-Mother-Crone combination was Parvati-Durga-Uma (Kali) in India, Ana-Babd-Macha (the Morrigan) in Ireland, or in Greece Hebe-Hera-Hecate, the three Moerae, the three Gorgons, the three Graeae, the three Horae, etc. Among the
Vikings, the threefold Goddess appeared as the Norns; among the
Romans, as the Fates or Fortunae; among the druids, as Diana Triformis. The Triple Goddess had more than three: she had
hundreds of forms. Pre-Roman Latium worshipped her as the Capitoline Triad under
the collective name of Uni, "The One," a cognate olyoni. Her three personae were Juventas the Virgin, Juno the Mother, and Menarva or Minerva the wise Crone. Under the empire, Juventas was ousted to make room for a masculine member of the trinity, Jupiter. 2 Some
modern scholars refer to the two-female, one-male Capitoline Triad
of the later period as "three gods" as if they might describe a group of two women and one man as "three men." 3 Cumont says, "Oriental theologians developed the idea that the world forms a trinity; it is three in one and one in three." 5 The
masculine scholar substitutes the neuter "world" for "Goddess," though
they were in a sense synonymous. It was she who established the
trinitarian form of Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer. Even though Brahmans evolved a male trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva to
play these parts, Tantric scriptures insisted that the Triple Goddess had
created these three gods in the first place.6
The three aspects of the Goddess were personified on earth by
three kinds of priestesses: Yogini, Matri, Dakini nubile virgins, mothers, and elder women. These were sometimes called "deities of
nature." Manifestations of the Triple Goddess were known as The Three Most Precious Ones. 7 Negritos of the Malay Peninsula remembered the Goddess as Kari, a virgin who conceived the first man and woman by eating her own
lotus; yet she was also a trinity called the "three grandmothers under the
earth." 8
Even in pre-Columbian Mexico the Virgin Goddess who gave birth to the Savior Quetzalcoatl was a trinity, one of "three divine
sisters." Like the Semitic Mary, she was a birth-giver, mother, and
death-bringer all at once, for she was also known as the Precious
Stone of Sacrifice, apparently represented by the altar on which her savior-son's blood was poured out.9
Mother of the Greek gods was a trinity composed of Virgin Hebe, Mother Hera, and Crone Hecate; at Stymphalus she was wor
shipped as Child, Bride, and Widow. 10 Each of her personae could be a
1018



trinity again, so she could be the Muses or the Ninefold Goddess. Trinity Hecate was called Triformis and shown with three faces, each a lunar
phase. 11 Among the Irish she was the Triple Morrigan, or Morgan, ^^^^^^^^^^^
sometimes multiplied into "nine sisters" who kept the Cauldron of
Regeneration and ruled the western isle of the dead. 12
The Goddess Triformis ruled heaven as Virgin, earth as Mother,
and the underworld as Crone, or Hel, or Queen of the Shades. This was remembered even in Chaucer's time, for his Palamon invoked her
"Three Forms," Luna in heaven, Diana on earth, Proserpine in hell. 13 The old name of Sicily, Trinacria, invoked her as a "center of the
earth" with three realms.
Bardic romances abounded in manifestations of the Triple God
dess. Wayland the Smith married her, after she first appeared to him
as three magic doves. 14 King Arthur went to Avalon with her. The triadic Guinevere was another version of her. Sir Marhaus (Mars)
encountered her as the Three Damosels at their magic fountain: the
eldest "threescore winters of age, wearing a garland of gold; the
second thirty winters of age, wearing a circlet of gold; the youngest fifteen winters of age, wearing a wreath of flowers." 15 Fifteen was the
number of the pagan Virgin Kore, the pentacle in the apple. Mythic virgin mothers, like that of Zoroaster, typically gave birth at the age of 1 5. Double that was the Mother's age, double again the age of the Crone.
The Middle East had many trinities, most originally female. As time went on, one or two members of the triad turned male. The
usual pattern was Father-Mother-Son, the Son figure envisioned as a Savior. 16
The notion of a trinity appeared during the 14th century B.C. among the Hatti and Mitanni. In the 5th century B.C., a popular
Babylonian trinity was composed of Shamash, Sin, and Ishtar Sun, Moon, and Star. In Greece this was repeated as Helios the sun, Selene the moon, and Aphrodite the star. A Father-Mother-Son trinity
was worshipped at Costopitum as Jupiter Dolichenus, Celestial Brigantia, and Sal us. 17
Gnostic versions of the trinity followed the Father-Mother-Son
patterns of the contemporary east, with the Holy Ghost recognized as a female Sophia, the Dove, worshipped as the Great Goddess in Constantinople, and viewed by most Gnostics as the Shakti of God. The Christian God was originally modeled on Far-Eastern heaven
fathers, such as Brahma and Dyaus Pitar, all of whom needed their
female sources of "Power," or else they could not act. 18 Therefore, a
female member of the triad was essential even to God. Among
Arabian Christians there was apparently a holy trinity of God, Mary,
and Jesus, worshipped as an interchangeable replacement for the Egyptian trinity of Osiris, Isis, and Horus. 19 During the Christian era, all-male trinities became popular among
Germanic tribes. Woden, Thor, and Saxnot were worshipped together
1019



Triptotemus by Saxons of the 8th and 9th centuries. Norsemen called them Odin,
Tristan Tyr, and Frey. According to a certain fragmentary myth, the Triple ^^^^^^^^^^ Goddess seems to have been burned as a witch. She had to be burned
to ashes three times. Afterward, youth, beauty, and love in the person of Freya departed from Asgard; and there was war in heaven. 20
Like many other remnants of paganism, the female trinity is still
associated with marriage. Breton wedding ceremonies celebrated the
three phases of the bride's life, impersonating her first by a little girl,
then by the mistress of a house, then by an old grandmother. 21 Modern weddings still retain the flower girl and the matron of honor,
but significantly the Crone figure has vanished. August Comte nearly revived the female trinity in his vision of
woman as mediator between man and the guiding moral spirit.
Mother, wife, and daughter were to represent man's unity with past, present, and future; also with what Comte called the three altruistic
instincts: veneration, attachment, benevolence. 22 In plainer words, these were what women want from men: respect, love, kindness.

"Three Plowings," name or title of the young god with whom Demeter lay three times in the plowed fields of Crete, before he was
slain. He mated three times with the Triple Goddess (naturally) to
fertilize each of her; he was not Pluto, the god of the trident, able to do
it all at once. Triptolemus's other names were Iasius or Iasion,
cognates of Jesus and Jason. 1

Tristan
Cult hero of the courtly-love movement; a wizard, poet, dragonslayer, lover, and perhaps also a Tantric adept. When he met his Shakti in the form of Iseult, he reversed the syllables of his name and introduced himself as Tantris, which may have been a secret bardic pun
or "recognition sign." ' Though Iseult was the wife of King Mark of Cornwall, the poets called King Mark a "felon" for trying to prevent her from choosing her own lover. As a faithful votary of the Goddess of
Love, Tristan was said to have been reincarnated in another of her
votaries, Thomas Rhymer.

Tritone Tritone
Athenians claimed their Goddess Athene was born from Zeus's head,

was not recognized." Her Libyan mother was Tritone, the Third
Queen, and her birthplace was Lake Tritonis, "the Three Queens." . Herodotus said Athene's dress and the attributes of her cult were borrowed from those of Libyan women. 1 See Athene; Neith.

Trolls
Earth-demons, called Trulli in Burton's Anatomy ofMelancholy} The word "trull," a loose woman, grew from the same root; thus the
Troll was probably at first one of the pagan Hags or earth-priestesses. Norse folklore said trolls commonly sat under bridges, waiting to
seize and eat those who crossed the bridge without making them an
offering. Association with bridges suggests the Valkyries who guarded Bifrdst, the Bridge of Heaven; they too were "trulls" or "trolls." The
Angels of Death were said to congregate at a divine Sabbat called the
trolla-thing. 1

"People of the Goddess Dana," early matriarchal settlers of Ireland,
later called fairies who dwelt in their barrow-graves and sacred mounds.

Tuteta Tutela
Twins "Goddess of the City," title of any divine Mother who took a
^^^^m^mmm particular town under her protection. Her emblem was the mural
crown, signifying that everything within the city walls was held in her
thought. Medieval kings copied the crown.
Tutunus
Phallic god of Roman weddings; another name for Priapus. Brides deflowered themselves on the erect penis of the god's statue, in order that the god, not a man, should "open the matrix" as the biblical
phrase goes, and the firstborn child could be considered God-begotten. 1 Any woman thus deflowered was described as a Virgin Bride of God.
The god himself was a Christos, "anointed," because his phallus was
anointed with chrism or holy oil. The custom was still common in the
4th century a.d. See Firstborn.
1. Simons, p. 77.
Twins
Dylan and Lieu, twin powers of darkness and light, were born simultaneously from the womb of Arianrhod, Celtic Goddess of the star-wheel. 1
Castor and Pollux, twin gods of the morning and evening star,
were born simultaneously from the womb of Leda, or Latona, primal mother of the World Egg in Greek myth. 2
Shaher and Shalem, twin gods of the morning and evening star in
Canaan, were born simultaneously from the womb of Helel, the Pit, a dark yonic aspect of the Goddess Asherah, she who swallowed the
Father-god El. 3 Ahura Mazda and Ahriman, God and the devil, were twins born
simultaneously from the womb of Zurvan, the primal two-faced androgynous being who personified Infinite Time to the Persians. The event is shown on a famous silver plaque from Luristan, dated in the
8th century b.c.4
American Indians said the White Manitu or Lord of Life and the Black Manitu or Lord of Death were twins, born simultaneously from the womb of the Moon-goddess, called The Old Woman Who Never Dies, the real ruler of all gods and men. 5
Gnostics said the sun god Sol, Helios, or Apollo had a dark twin,
known as Sol Niger (Black Sun), king of the nether world. The Chaldeans called him Aciel.6 The light god was transformed into the
dark god when he entered into conjunction with their common mother, the Moon.
Throughout all mythologies the same pair can be found: twins of
1022



light and darkness, born from the Great Mother. Every dualistic Tyche
religion-such as Zoroastrianism-opposing a principle of evil to a princi- Typhon pie of good had to begin with the two principles personified as offspring ^^^^^^^^^^^^
of the primordial womb. Hence the medieval heretics' claim that God
and the devil were twin brothers; for if there were no dark twin, then
God had to be made responsible for evil. See Devil.

Tyche
Greek "Fortune," also called Dike or Moera; the Goddess of Destiny
either for the universe, or for the individual soul. 1 Tyche Basileos was
the title of the "female soul" or Fortune-goddess of a king. No ruler
had any power to act unless the Goddess Tyche looked upon him with favor. See Fortune.

Typhon
Greek name of the Egyptian ass god Set, whose breath was the hot
wind supposed to bring pestilence (typhus). The name was pan-Asiatic: t'aifung in China, tufan in Arabia, "typhoon" in southeastern Asia. This god of winds was probably based on the Vedic ass god Ravana. In
all the ancient world, a hot desert wind that brought pestilence was called the Breath of the Ass. See Ass.

Mary is the West's most famous virgin, but unmarried maidens ap
peared throughout ancient and medieval
history and mythology. This carved and
painted wood panel, "Christ in the Virgin's Womb," is German, ca. 1400.
The Roman venus is best known as a love goddess, but she was
much more, including goddess of birth and death. This early 19th
century school-girl painting is called "Venus Drawn by Doves," but the artist and title are actually unknown.
The Saxon goddess Ursel, the She-Bear, was
eventually transmogrified into SAINT URSULA by the Christian fathers. She was so smart,
pretty, and pure that to marry her, Prince
Conon of England met her every whim: 1 1 ,000 virgin handmaidens, a three-year pilgrimage to holy shrines, and Conon's own conversion in the bargain. Conon and the 11,000 were dis
patched by the Huns, and since Ursula refused
to marry their leader, he shot her with three arrows. Benozzo Gozzoli; painting on wood; Florence, 1 5th century.



Uchati Uchati
UKte "Weepers," title of sacred harlots of Ishtar, whose duty it was to make
m^mi^m^m formal lamentations for the dead. 1 They also wailed for the dead savior
Tammuz in the temple of Jerusalem, where Ishtar was worshipped as Mari, Queen of Heaven (Ezekiel 8:14). Their title was related to
Egyptian Utchatti or Udjatti, Divine Eyes, sacred to the Goddess
Maat as the All-Seeing Eye, whose hieroglyphic eye emblem later became associated with the cult of Horus. 2

Uma
Kali's Destroyer or Crone aspect, also known as Prisni, mother of the dark season and of the "demon" Maruts and Rudras. In the Skanda
Purana, Uma appeared as a demoness with a vagina dentata: "hard
teeth like thunderbolts with sharp tips inside the vagina." l Sometimes
Uma was called Daughter of the Mountains, or Daughter of Heaven that is, of Himalaya, which meant both mountain and heaven. As
the wife of Shiva, Uma was a patroness of yogic asceticism. In most of her forms she was recognizable as Mother Death.
l.O'Flaherty.257.
Umbra
"Shade," the shadow-soul that Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, Semites, and other ancient peoples believed in. After death, the umbra went to
the Land of Shades, to live a dark, bloodless pseudo-life. See Shadow.
Ummati
Title of Assyrian priestesses, meaning "mothers of creation," for
umm was the Semitic version of the Om or Creative Word attributed tc
Kali in India. To be admitted to the Holy of Holies, a woman had to
have borne children to prove she had the spirit of fertility and the "wisdom of motherhood."
Uncle
Before recognition of physical fatherhood, and even for a long time after it, most people viewed a mother's brother as a child's nearest male relative, because he was united with the mother and the mother's
mother by the all-important matrilineal blood bond. Hawaiians still use
1026



the same word for "father" and "uncle" because formerly they made Uni
no distinction between them. 1 Unicorn
Tacitus said Germanic barbarians regarded the relationship be- ^^^^^^^^^^^^
tween sister's sons and maternal uncles as "more sacred and binding"
than the relationship between sons and fathers. 2 The same was true of
the Celts. Early Christian missionaries in Ireland had to call Christ
"our sister's son," because that was the only masculine relationship held
sacred by the people. J
Malory said the whole purpose of introducing Christianity into Britain was to establish laws of patrilineal succession and the authority
of father. Among the pagans, fathers and sons cared nothing for one
another. 4 Only nephews and maternal uncles had a true blood bond.
More recently among the Semang, enlightened sages and prophets were known as nephews of God, not sons of God. 5
Fathers were of no significance in family relationships among the matrilineal clans of early Latium. Inheriting this tradition, even
patriarchal Romans distinguished between a father's brother, patruus, and a mother's brother, avunculus derived from avus, "ancestor."
The patruus was unimportant and usually ignored.6 The avunculus was the true uncle, as shown by the very word "uncle" which descended from his title, and "avuncular" which implies a benevolent interest.
Europe still retains a linguistic memory of the dual-uncle system. A father's brother is just an uncle; but a mother's brother is called "own
uncle."
Systems of uncle relationships were always older than those of
paternity, having descended from the matriarchal period when fatherhood was not understood. See Motherhood.

Uili var. Unial
Etruscan name for the Great Mother's holy trinity, a "three-in-one"
Goddess who gave birth to the uni-verse. She was represented by the
sign of female genitals; Uni was a cognate of "yoni." In Rome, the three were worshipped as the early Capitoline Triad of Virgin-Mother
Crone (Juventas, Juno, Minerva); but in Imperial times the virgin Goddess was removed to make room for Jupiter. 1 The name of Uni evolved into Iune, or Juno.
1. Hays, 181.
Unicorn
Classic symbol of the phallic horse deity, or sacred king incarnate in a
horned horse. According to medieval legend, the unicorn could be
captured only by a virgin girl, because his irresistible desire was to lay
1027



Urania
Uraceus
his "horn" in a maiden's lap. While thus engaged, he was incapable of
resisting capture. (However, no unicorns were ever captured.) The unicorn was a secret phallic consort of the virgin Mary, shown inside her "enclosed garden" of virginity, in many examples of
Christian mystical art. At times he was identified with the Savior. A
medieval hymn called Christ "the wild wild unicorn whom the
Virgin caught and tamed." ' A source of the unicorn myth may have been the Babylonian
dragon-beast made up of a horselike body with lion's forelegs, scales,
a snakelike neck and a flat horned head with a single spike growing from the center of the nose. 2 One theory proposes that the unicorn was
originally the bull of spring, rearing up and struggling with the lion of summer. Babylonian art showed both animals in profile, so the bull appeared to have only one horn. The British coat of arms still has "the
lion and the unicorn" contending in just such a manner. 3
Explorers thought they found the legendary unicorn in the African rhinoceros. Because of the unicorn's phallic significance, powdered
rhinoceros horn became a highly popular "remedy" for impotence, and is so used even today. 4

Uraeus
Egyptian serpent symbol, a hieroglyphic sign for "Goddess," suggest
ing that in pre-dynastic times it was thought all serpents were female
and divine. The serpent-mother was one of Egypt's oldest divinities,
and her uraeus-snake idol signified healing. Moses copied this Egyptian magic with his "brazen serpent" (Numbers 21:9). Egyptian rulers wore the uraeus-snake in the form of a rearing cobra on the forehead,
representing the "third eye" of mystical insight. Despite patriarchal opposition to the symbol of the she-serpent Uraeus, among later Gnostic Christians her name became one of the "secret names of
God." See Serpent.
Urania
"Celestial One," title of Aphrodite as Queen of Heaven. Her former
consort Uranus was transformed into her castrated "father" in classical
myth; Uranus's patricidal son threw his severed genitals into the sea,
and the sea-womb brought forth Aphrodite. Actually, Celestial Aphrodite and the sea-womb were one and the same: manifestations of the
Triple Goddess. The castrated dying god was her ubiquitous son-lover
who died, fertilized her by his death, and begot himself again. Uranus was a western form of Varuna, a deity of indeterminate sex, sometimes a male-turned-female like Hermes or Teiresias. To
1028



the Persians he was varan, a spirit of sexual intercourse like the Hindu Urd Kama. His name came from vr, to envelop a female function and Urine
he performed female-imitative miracles, such as turning water into ^^^^^^^^^^^^
blood, giving birth to the sun, and measuring the earth. 1 From the Asian precedents it may be assumed that Urania and Uranus were the
same primal androgyne as Jana-Janus, Diana-Dianus, etc.
1. Campbell, Or.M, 177.
Urd var. Urth
One of the Norse names of Mother Earth, in addition to Urtha,
Erda, Eartha, Wyrd, Wurd, Word, Weird, etc. Urd was usually called the divine fount of wisdom tended by the three Norns (Fates) under
the root of the World Tree; it was also the name of the oldest Norn, an
Earth Goddess who knew everything, past, present, and future. The
gods couldn't render judgment unless they gathered at the fount of Urd,
because they were helpless without the wisdom imparted by the
Urdarbrunnr, "Stream of Urd," which gave life and mind. Old mythologies held that the fount of wisdom was female, and without it
neither men nor gods could know anything. 1 Another name for the fountain was Mimir, which means "Mother," although the same name was given later to Odin's maternal uncle, who brought him back
to life with fluid from the Mother-spring and taught him the wisdom
of the runes.
1 . Branston, 76.
Urim and Thummim
Divinatory knucklebones or "dice" used by Jewish priests, probably copied from the oracular knucklebones said to have been invented by
Hermes. Kings of Israel governed their acts by the prophecies of the
Urim and Thummim (1 Samuel 28:6). Levitical law directed that these
articles be carried in the high priest's "breastplate of judgment" whenever he entered the tabernacle, so the mana of the holy place
would enter into them and yield correct prophecies (Exodus 28:30).
line
rom Uranus, "Father Heaven," whose magical urine, semen, or ilood came down as rain to fertilize Mother Earth. Primitive myths
resent all three fluids as the fertilizing principle. Zeus came down as
'golden rain" of urine to fertilize Danae, the Earth, whose priestesses
le Danaids performed rain charms by carrying water in a sieve.
ccording to Aristophanes, rain was caused by Zeus urinating through a
1029



Ursu|^ Sjint sieve. Aristotle mentioned the general belief that "Zeus does not rain
in order to make the crops grow, but from necessity," suggesting that
^^ Zeus rained for the same reason men urinated because he had to. 1
^" The Danaids founded the Eleusinian rite of Thesmophoria, when the severed genitals of the sacred king were offered to the Goddess, just as the severed genitals of Uranus were given to the sea-womb. The
real genitals of a real victim were eventually replaced by symbolic
substitutes: serpents and phallus-shaped loaves of bread. But the meaning was the same a summoning of the god's urine, semen, or
blood. 2
Aeschylus said of the Danaids' performance: "Rain falling from the bridegroom sky makes pregnant the Earth. Then brings she forth for mortals pasture of flocks and corn, Demeter's gift, and the fruitful
ness of trees is brought to completion by the dew of their marriage." As the Goddess was both Earth and Sea, the rain-urine-seed-blood, etc.,
fell on both. The priestesses looked up to the sky and cried, "Rain! "
Then they looked down to the earth and cried, "Conceive! " ?
Rain-making was a chief function of Heavenly Fathers every
where. Rome's begetting god was Jupiter Pluvius, Jupiter-Who-Makes-Rain, another version of Zeus, who was in turn a
replacement for Uranus. Even after the essential fluid was definitely
identified as semen, the other fluids were not forgotten. Urine remained
a popular rain charm. Shamans in Siberia used to bring rain by
"making water" on the naked body of a woman who represented the earth. 4 In Iraq, when rain was wanted, a female dummy called the
Bride of God was placed in a field, in the hope that God would "make water" on her. 5

Ursula, Saint
Christianized form of the Saxon Goddess Ursel, or Horsel, the
"Ercel" of Thomas Rhymer's Erceldoune, and the Venus of the
Horselberg-Venusberg. Ursel means "She-Bear," the title of Artemis Calliste, the same as the Helvetian Goddess Artio, in the guise of Ursa
Major, the Great Bear (Big Dipper), whose constellation circles the
pole star without disappearing into the sea. The ancients said Artemis
the She-Bear ruled all the stars until Zeus usurped her place. 1
The mythical St. Ursula was accompanied by eleven thousand
virgins, a common pagan image of the Moon-goddess accompanied by her children, the stars. One of the Goddess's foremost shrines was Cologne, where "Ursel" was converted into a Christian heroine to
account for the reverence paid to her by the local people.
The tale on which Ursula's canonization was based was first
invented about the 9th century a.d.; then, "During the 12th century
1030



this pious romance was preposterously elaborated through the mistakes Ursula, Saint
of imaginative visionaries; a public burial-ground uncovered at Co
logne was taken to be the grave of the martyrs, false relics came into ^^^^^^^^^mK^
circulation and forged epitaphs of non-existent persons were
produced." 2 The churchmen claimed that St. Ursula was a Breton princess
betrothed to Conon, prince of England, in the 5th century a.d. Prior to her marriage, she took her eleven thousand virgins on a pilgrimage.
While passing through Cologne, they were attacked and slaughtered by the Huns, at the instigation of two Roman generals who feared the
Christian ladies' exemplary piety would convert all the northern
barbarians to Christ. 3
This fable was intended to Christianize the lunar bear-goddess
worshipped at Cologne, the same who was Artio, the Helvetian "Mother of Animals," with another cult center at Berne ("She-Bear"),
where her portrait still appears on the Bernese coat of arms. 4 Ursel and Artio were alternate names of the triple Artemis who took the
"bear-king" Arthur to paradise. The Greeks said Artemis Calliste, "Fairest One," was associated with both the moon and the constellation
of the Great Bear. In Britain, Ursa Major was often called "Mistress
Ursula," at first a title ofthe Goddess, later transferred to the saint. 5
Artemis the She-Bear was so widely recognized as the Mother
of Animals that the island once sacred to her, Callista, is still called
Thera, "She-Beast." 6 Arcadians traced their descent from her son
Areas, the Little Bear (Ursa Minor), a bear-god like the Celtic Arthur.
Hellenic mythographers pretended that Arcas's mother was a mere
nymph, Calliste, who was punished for losing her virginity by receiving the form of a bear, along with her child; but Artemis took pity on them and placed them in the stars as Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. This
version ofthe myth was invented "to account for the traditional connection between Artemis and the Great Bear." 7 The Christian
version was invented for different reasons, but with the same ultimate
aim: to mortalize the Goddess.
Some memory of Ursula the Moon-goddess seems to haunt the foundation ofthe Ursuline order of nuns, by St. Angela Merici in
1506. Catholic authorities now claim the Ursulines were the oldest
order of teaching nuns. But most convents were centers of learning for women until the church forbade women's education in the 1 3th
century. 8 The Ursulines were perhaps the only order of teaching nuns who remained obedient to the papacy, and so were permitted to continue.
Yet the Ursulines began under a cloud of suspicion. Angela Merici
was a native of Brescia, which Pope Calixtus III described as a hotbed
of witches.9 Angela's first group of sisters numbered exactly 28, the lunar number. They made their first devotion in a church dedicated
to another mythical saint who was only another transformation ofthe
Goddess, St. Afra or Aphra (Aphrodite). 10 Angela was not allowed to
1031



U^jert establish her holy society of teachers until forty years had passed since
her original vision, which she received not in a church but in an open
^^ field under the moon. She and her women had no religious habit, no
vows, no communal life. They went to their pupils' homes to teach,
like itinerant governesses. The church was not interested in Angela until she underwent
"popular" canonization in her home territory. Two centuries later,
the church decided to take advantage of the popularity of her cult by declaring her Blessed. Finally in 1807 she was canonized by Pope Pius VII. 11 But she is still almost as vague and dim as the Ursuline lunar
She-Bear that the people of Brescia once worshipped. A 20thcentury Catholic scholar mentioned her with one of those curious slips
of the pen so common among patriarchal writers; he said the
Ursuline order was founded by "Bishop Angela of Brescia." n

Ur-Text
Greatest legendary treasure of medieval Hermetic magic, after the
Elixir of Life and the Philosopher's Stone. The Ur-text was supposed to
be a magical grammar of the primordial tongue, whose words God pronounced at creation in order to bring forth the things themselves;
that is, the words could create, just by being spoken. The idea was based on eastern notions of the creative power of Sanskrit, the Mother
language. 1 Another development of the idea was the Neoplatonic Logos or "Seminal Word," which was adopted as a Christian dogma.
(See Logos.) Presumably the Ur-text emanated from Abraham's "Ur of the
Chaldees," famous as the home of magic and astrology. The medieval theory was that all words and names exerted some influence over
their objects, hence the efficacy of both magic spells and liturgies. But
in all known languages, the power of the word was slightly displaced from the true essence of the thing, as the calendar was slightly
displaced from the sidereal year. In the Ur-text, words were precisely aligned with essences or "souls," so the words could control things
and events absolutely. The implications were the same as in the Hindu idea of the "holy
language" of Sanskrit. Knowledge of the Ur-text would give a man absolute power over the universe; whatever he said would come true at once.
Many magicians identified the Ur-text with the equally wonderful
Book ofThoth, named after the Egyptian god of magic and men
tioned in very old Egyptian folk tales as a written version of Thoth's
technique for creating by the power of the Word. One story claimed
1032



the book was found by a sage named Satni-Khamois in a Memphite Ur-Text tomb. It contained only two formulae but they were great hekau
(words of power) : ^^^^^^^^^^^
The two formulae that are written there, ifthou recitest the first ofthem, thou shalt charm the heaven, the earth, the world ofthe night, the mountains, the waters; thou shalt understand what all the birds ofheaven
and the reptiles say, as many as there are. Thou shalt behold the fish, for a divine power will bring them to the surface ofthe water. If thou
readest the second formula, even when thou art in the tomb, thou shalt resume the form thou hadst on earth; thou shalt also behold the sun rising
in the heavens, and his cycle ofgods, also the moon in the form that she has when she appears. 2
The first beneficiaries of this wondrous magic became immortal,
not by reading the book but by eating the papyrus it was written on although the book continued to exist, hidden in underwater vessels
guarded by the Great Serpent. 5 Eating instead of reading a piece of magical literature was a common Oriental method of absorbing the
virtue of magic words even when one is unable to read. In Tibet,
Madagascar, China, and Japan it was customary to cure diseases by writing the curative charm on paper and eating the paper, or its ashes.4 Tartar lamas wrote the names of medicines on paper and made the
patient swallow the prescription; for they believed "To swallow the
name of a remedy, or the remedy itself . . . comes to precisely the
same thing." 5 The same notion was often found in the west. The modern
pharmacist's Rx began as a curative symbol of Saturn, written on paper and eaten by the patient.6 A common medieval prescription for toothache was a paper bearing the magic words by which Jesus removed a worm from St. Peter's tooth. 7 The Venerable Bede declared
that scrapings from the pages of "books that were brought out of
Ireland," when drunk in water, instantly cured snakebite. 8
With so many different kinds of credulity in regard to the written
words especially among the majority to whom all writing was a
mysterious, unknown magic it is hardly surprising that belief in the Book of Books, the Ur-text, survived. Some of the beliefs concerning
the Ur-text became attached to the Latin Bible, which the medieval
church would not allow to be translated into any other language,
even though the readings from the pulpit were quite incomprehensible to most congregations. The theory was that Latin was the language of St. Peter's Roman see, and God intended the Bible to be written in that
language and no other; for the magic efficacy of the words lay in their sound, which would be lost if they were rendered in another tongue.
Thus, out of superstitious belief in the power of the Word, the church kept the "dead" language of Latin alive within its own in-group
for over 1 500 years.

Vagina Dentata
"Toothed vagina," the classic symbol of men's fear of sex, expressing
the unconscious belief that a woman may eat or castrate her partner
during intercourse. Freud said, "Probably no male human being is
spared the terrifying shock of threatened castration at the sight of the
female genitals." l But he had the reason wrong. The real reason for
this "terrifying shock" is mouth-symbolism, now recognized universally in myth and fantasy: "It is well known in psychiatry that both males
and females fantasize as a mouth the female's entranceway to the
vagina." 2 The more patriarchal the society, the more fear seems to be
aroused by the fantasy. Men of Malekula, having overthrown their matriarchate, were haunted by a yonic spirit called "that which draws us
to It so that It may devour us." 3 The Yanomamo said one of the first beings on earth was a woman whose vagina became a toothed mouth
and bit off her consort's penis. Chinese patriarchs said women's
genitals were not only gateways to immortality but also "executioners of
men." 4 Moslem aphorisms said: "Three things are insatiable: the
1034



desert, the grave, and a woman's vulva." 5 Polynesians said the savior- Vagina Dentata
god Maui tried to find eternal life by crawling into the mouth (or
vagina) of his mother Hina, in effect trying to return to the womb of the ^^^^^^^^^^^^
Creatress; but she bit him in two and killed him.6
Stories of the devouring Mother are ubiquitous in myths, representing the death-fear which the male psyche often transformed into
a sex-fear. Ancient writings describe the male sexuarfunction not as
"taking" or "possessing" the female, but rather "being taken," or "putting forth." 7 Ejaculation was viewed as a loss of a man's vital force, which was "eaten" by a woman. The Greek sema or "semen" meant both "seed" and "food." Sexual "consummation" was the same as
"consuming" (the male). Many savages still have the same imagery. The Yanomamo word for pregnant also means satiated or full-fed; and
"to eat" is the same as "to copulate." 8
Distinction between mouths and female genitals was blurred by
the Greek idea of the lamiae lustful she-demons, born of the Libyan snake-goddess Lamia. Their name meant either "lecherous
vaginas" or "gluttonous gullets." 9 Lamia was a Greek name for the divine female serpent called Kundalini in India, Uraeus or Per-Uatchet
in Egypt, and Lamashtu in Babylon. Her Babylonian consort was
Pazuzu, he of the serpent penis. Lamia's legend, with its notion that
males are born to be eaten, led to Pliny's report on the sexual life of
snakes that was widely believed throughout Europe even up to the 20th
century: a male snake fertilizes the female snake by putting his head
into her mouth and allowing himself to be eaten. 10
Sioux Indians told a tale similar to that of the Lamia. A beautiful
seductive woman accepted the love of a young warrior and united
with him inside a cloud. When the cloud lifted, the woman stood alone.
The man was a heap of bones being gnawed by snakes at her feet. 11
Mouth and vulva were equated in many Egyptian myths. Ma-Nu,
the western gate whereby the sun god daily re-entered his Mother, was sometimes a "cleft" (yoni), and sometimes a "mouth." 12 Priestesses
of Bast, representing the Goddess, drew up their skirts to display their
genitals during religious processions. 13 To the Greeks, such a display was frightening. Bellerophon fled in terror from Lycian women advancing on him with genitals exposed, and even the sea god Poseidon
retreated, for fear they might swallow him. 14
According to Philostratus, magical women "by arousing sexual lesire seek to devour whom they wish." 15 To the patriarchal Persians
ind Moslems this seemed a distinct possibility. Viewing women's
nouths as either obscene, dangerous, or overly seductive, they nsisted on veiling them. Yet men's mouths, which look no different,
vere not viewed as threatening. "Mouth" comes from the same root as "mother" Anglo-Saxon
nuth, also related to the Egyptian Goddess Mut. Vulvas have labiae,
lips," and many men have believed that behind the lips lie teeth.
Christian authorities of the Middle Ages taught that certain witches,
1035



Vagina Dentata with the help of the moon and magic spells, could grow fangs in their
vaginas. They likened women's genitals to the "yawning" mouth of
__ hell, though this was hardly original; the underworld gate had always been the yoni of Mother Hel. It had always "yawned" from Middle
English yonen, another derivative of "yoni." A German vulgarity meaning "cunt," Fotze, in parts of Bavaria meant simply "mouth." 16 To Christian ascetics, Hell-mouth and the vagina drew upon the same ancient symbolism. Both were equated with the womb-symbol of the whale that swallowed Jonah; according to this "prophecy" the Hell-mouth swallowed Christ (as Hina swallowed her son Maui) and
kept him for three days. Visionary trips to hell often read like "a
description of the experience of being born, but in reverse, as if the child was being drawn into the womb and destroyed there, instead of being formed and given life." St. Teresa of Avila said her vision of a
visit to hell was "an oppression, a suffocation, and an affliction so
agonizing, and accompanied by such a hopeless and distressing misery that no words I could find would adequately describe it. To say
that it was as if my soul were being continuously torn from my body
is as nothing." 17 The archetypal image of "devouring" female genitals seems undeniably alive even in the modern world. "Males in our culture are so
afraid of direct contact with female genitalia, and are even afraid of
referring to these genitalia themselves; they largely displace their
feelings to the accessory sex organs the hips, legs, breasts, buttocks, et
cetera and they give these accessory organs an exaggerated interest
and desirability." 18 Even here, the male scholar inexplicably "displaces' the words sex organ onto structures that have nothing to do with
sexual functioning.
Looking into, touching, entering the female orifice seems fraught with hidden fears, signified by the confusion of sex with death in
overwhelming numbers of male minds and myths. Psychiatrists say sex is perceived by the male unconscious as dying: "Every orgasm is a little death: the death of 'the little man,' the penis." 19 Here indeed is the
root of ascetic religions that equated the denial of death with denial of
sex.
Moslems attributed all kinds of dread powers to a vulva. It could
"bite off" a man's eye-beam, resulting in blindness for any man who
looked into its cavity. A sultan of Damascus was said to have lost his
sight in his manner. Christian legend claimed he went to Sardinia to
be cured of his blindness by a miraculous idol of the virgin Mary who,
being eternally virgin, had her door-mouth permanently closed by a
veil-hymen. 20 Apparently Freud was wrong in assuming that men's fear of female genitals was based on the idea that the female had been
castrated. The fear was much less empathetic, and more personal: a fear
of being devoured, of experiencing the birth trauma in reverse. A Catholic scholar's curious description of the Hell-mouth as a womb
1036



inadvertently reveals this idea: "When we think of man entering hell Vajra
we think of him as establishing contact with the most intrinsic, unified, Valentine, Saint ultimate and deepest level of the reality of the world." 21 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Vajra
Sanskrit "jewel," "phallus," or "lightning" images of the Jewel in the Lotus, male spirit enclosed in the female, graphically represented by the lingam-yoni. Vajrasana meant the "diamond seat" of the Tantric
yogi, a mystic state of psychosexual union with the Goddess. As a
diamond shape was an archaic symbol of the clitoris, it may be that
the vajra was recognized as an enlarged male version of the same thing. See Lotus.
Va-Kul
Zyrian "Mother of Waters," worshipped throughout the Middle Ages as a powerful Goddess whose displeasure could cause catastrophes. 1 See Water.

Valentine, Saint
The original Valentine's Day in the ides of February was Rome's
Lupercalia, a festival of sexual license. Young men chose partners for
erotic games by drawing "billets" small papers with women's names on them. Christians denounced these prototypical valentines as "heathens' lewd customs." l Churchmen tried to substitute saints'
names and short sermons on the billets, but people soon reverted to the
old love-notes. 2 February was sacred to Juno Februata, Goddess of
the "fever" (febris) of love. The church replaced her with a mythical
martyr, St. Valentine, who was endowed with several contradictory biographies. One of them made him a handsome Roman youth, executed at the very moment when his sweetheart received his billet
of love. 3
St. Valentine became a patron of lovers perforce, because the
festival remained dedicated to lovers despite all official efforts to
change it. Even in its Christianized form, the Valentinian festival
involved secret sex worship, called "a rite of spiritual marriage with
1037



VaMtyries angels in a nuptial chamber." 4 Ordinary human beings engaged before
witnesses in an act of sexual intercourse described as the marriage of Sophia and the Redeemer. A spoken formula said, in part, "Let the see<
of light descend into thy bridal chamber, receive the bridegroom . . . open thine arms to embrace him. Behold, grace has descended upon
thee." 5 During the Middle Ages, St. Valentine was much invoked in love
charms and potions, since he was a sketchily Christianized version of
such love-gods as Eros, Cupid, Kama, Priapus, or Pan.

Valkyries
Norse death angels who hovered over battlefields and took the souls
of brave warriors to Odin's heaven, Valhalla according to the classic
picture. Previously, the Valkyries seem to have been Amazonian priestesses who ruled the gates of death, and in the most primitive times even cannibalized the dead to give them rebirth.
Valkyries were northern counterparts of the funerary vulturepriestesses of Egypt, often decking themselves in feathers. Like
angelic Hindu apsaras, they wore swan feathers; or, in funerary aspect, they appeared as carrion crows (ravens). Dead warriors were known
in skaldic verse as hrafengrennir, "raven-feeders," and the blood of slain
men was called "the raven's drink." l In Old Saxon the Valkyries
were walcyries or waelceasig, "corpse-eaters," defined as "man-eating women" during the 1 1th century a.d. 2 Valkyries in their black raven-feathers were called Kraken, or
"crows." In the Middle East also, ravens were spirits of the lunar
sphere of death and rebirth, symbolically preserved in Mithraic religion as the Raven who led the initiate into the first stage of mystical
hierarchy, the sphere of the Moon. 3 Similar connotations were still
attached to ravens in 1613 a.d., when Perkins's Witchcraft said if a
raven stands on a high place (lunar sphere), "and looks a particular way and cries," death can be expected to come from that direction. 4
Swans, ravens, crows, or hawks represented Valkyries in old ballads, such as "The Maiden Transformed into a Bird," who was
fond of eating her true-love's flesh. This was beneficial to him, for after
sacrificing his flesh to her, he attained a state of paradise in her arms. 5
Eliade says, "The Valkyries are psychopomps and sometimes play the role of the 'celestial wives' or 'spirit wives' of the Siberian shamans. .
. . [T]his later complex extends beyond the sphere of shamanism and has elements both of the mythology of Woman and the mythology of Death." 6
The Valkyries were also totemized as mare-women, like the ancient horse-masked priestesses of Demeter. In Sweden, a mare
woman was a volva, meaning Goddess, priestess, or a witch who could
1038



turn into a mare and carry a man away to death. A cognate was vala, Vampire
a holy woman, with Slavic and central Asian counterparts in the Vilas,
Wilas, or Wilis, possibly derived from vilasa, the heavenly bliss ^m
dispensed by Hindu nymphs of paradise in the service of the Goddess. 7 Such spirits were sometimes called Samovila or Samodiva: "deathgoddess." 8 Some claimed that death in the arms of a Vila was a blissful
passage into a fairy paradise. Others said it was cruel torment.9
Naturally, this was a mythic expression of various ways of dying. See Vila. The Grimnismal lists 13 Valkyries, the number of a witches' coven; other sources said there were only nine, the number of the
Muses. From the 10th to the 14th centuries, Valkyries and witches were considered identical; both were also mystic swan-maidens and
fairies. 10 Earthly priestesses who played the Valkyrie role in pagan funerals were described by churchmen as either Vilas or witches. 11
Valhalla or Valholl was the death-realm of Hel, the Great Vala.
Though it was taken over by new gods led by Father Odin, its archaic feminine name remained. Later myths made it a paradise reserved
solely for warriors and war-kings, members of the military caste who shared the opinions of Japanese samurai and Moslem "soldiers of
Allah," that heavenly bliss belonged only to those who died fighting
bravely. Radbod, king of the Frisians, refused to abandon this faith when a
Christian missionary informed him that Valhalla was the same as the
Christians' hell. Where were his own ancestors, Radbod wanted to
know, if there was no Valhalla? He was told they were burning in hell
because they were heathens. "Dastardly priest!" Radbod cried. "How
dare you say my ancestors have gone to hell? I would rather yes, by
their god, the great Woden, I swear I would ten thousand times rather
join those heroes in their hell, than be with you in your heaven of
priests!" 12

Vampire
The primal notion that all life depends on the magic of menstrual blood or "the blood of Moon," as some primitives say evolved a
corresponding notion that the dead crave blood in order to make
themselves live again. 1 Greeks believed the shades of the dead could be
recalled from the underworld by offerings of blood, which they
greatly desired; therefore blood was the essential ingredient of necromancy. Homer's Odysseus consulted the dead with a necromantic
ceremony: "I took the sheep and cut their throats over the trench, and the dark blood flowed forth, and lo, the spirits of the dead that be departed gathered them from out of Erebus." 2
1039



Vampire
The Greek word for a vampire was sarcomenos, "flesh made by the moon."' The word "vampire" was Slavic, possibly traceable to central Asia, thence to India. The Siamese still call a lunar sabbath day vam
pra. As in early Greece, there were two vampra sabbaths in each lunar month, at the new moon and
full moon, with lesser sabbaths on the quarters to make four
seven-day weeks.'1
Ever since Homer's time, western nations had the fixed idea that
blood could recall the dead to life, at least temporarily. Regular supplies of blood would impart a kind of life to the "un-dead," that is,
vampires. They were called forth by the moon, their original Mother,
who also called forth the blood that made the living. Since the moon
was the original home of the dead and the source of rebirth, it was
closely associated with vampires. Breton churchmen, still not altogether
certain of the physiology of conception in the Middle Ages, claimed that a woman who exposed her naked body to moonlight would conceive and bear a vampire child. 5 Yet common folk continued to express in their customs the older belief that the souls of all children
waited in the moon to be reborn. Scottish girls refused to be married
at any time except during the full moon, for fear they otherwise might
not have children. New brides in the Orkneys went to a circle of
megalithic stones locally called the Temple of the Moon to pray for
babies. 6 The idea that the moon provided vital force for both the living and
the dead persisted through the centuries, and reappeared as emphati
cally as ever in popular vampire literature only a hundred years ago. Boucicault's The Vampire instructed his servants to carry his body to a high mountain where it could be touched by the first rays of the rising
moon. When this was done, the vampire sprang back to life, saying, "Fountain of my life: once more thy rays restore me. Death! I defy
thee!" 7 An English friar once said, "The moon is the mother of all
humors," and the body's most important life-giving "humor" was blood. 8 Therefore, vampires walked wherever the moon shone and they
might find blood; the church taught this, and no laymen dared to doubt it. Balkan countries had certain wizards who specialized in
bottling vampires, a technique they probably learned from Arabian magicians who put djinn (Latin genii) into bottles or lamps, like the
lamp of Aladdin. When a Bulgarian village panicked over a purported outbreak of vampirism, the specialist was called. He would solemnly
identify the offender's grave, bait his bottle with blood, catch the
restless spirit, cork him up, and burn the bottle.9 The Rev. Montague Summers mentions a sure cure for vampirism, which would have been simple, and eliminated all the dramatic,
time-consuming, ultimately ineffective classical measures such as exor
cisms, crucifixes, garlic, silver bullets, stakes through hearts, and so on. This simple solution was to place a consecrated host in a vampire's grave, which would immobilize him forever. However, Summers
said, this remedy "was not to be essayed, since it savors of rashness and
profanation of God's Body." 10 Summers, an earnest believer, evi
dently thought it was better to let a community be ravaged by marauding vampires than to profane Eucharistic bread. Summers also attacked the rational doubts of Dom Calmet,
who wrestled with the physical improbabilities of vampirism two
1040



centuries earlier, asking questions that no one ever bothered to answer: Vampire
How can a corpse which is covered with four or five feet ofearth, which has no room even to move or to stretch a limb, which is wrapped in mi^mmmmmmimmmmmm linen cerements, enclosed in a coffin of wood, how can it, I say, seek the upper air and return to the world walking upon the earth so as to cause
those extraordinary effects which are attributed to it? And after all that
how can it go back again into the grave, when it will be found fresh,
incorrupt, full ofblood exactly like a living body? Can it be maintained
that these corpses pass through the earth without disturbing it, just as water and the damps which penetrate the soil or which exhale therefrom
without perceptibly dividing or cleaving the ground? It were indeed to be wished that in the histories ofthe Return of Vampires which have been related, a certain amount ofattention had been given to this point, and
that the difficulty had been something elucidated. "
Rev. Summers quickly disposed of Dom Calmet's questions in
the accepted theological manner, not by answering them but by denouncing the asking of them:
These difficulties which Dom Calmet with little perception has raised . . .
are not only superficial but also smack ofheterodoxy. . . . [OJne can hardly brush aside the vast vampire tradition. . . . Can the Devil endow a
body with those qualities ofsubtilty, rarification, increase, and diminishing, so that it may pass through doors and windows? I answer that there is
no doubt the Demon can do this, and to deny the proposition is hardly orthodox. '2
From the church's "vast vampire tradition," Summers concluded: "There can be no doubt that the vampire does act under satanic
influence and by satanic direction." 1? This assertion was made not in
the 12th or 13th century, but in the year 1928.
A thinly disguised reason for the never-failing popularity of vampire stories was, of course, their suggestion of sinful sex. Kissing and biting ran close together in both mental and actual behavior; and the
attack of a male or female vampire on a victim of the opposite sex
surely bore some resemblance to a love-bite. One of the all-time classics
of vampire literature, Prest's Varneythe Vampire, titillated Victorian male readers with scenes more suggestive of rape than of demonology:
That young and beautiful girl exposed to so much terror . . . . Her beautiful rounded limbs quivered with the agony ofher soul. The glassy horrible eyes ofthe figure ran over that angelic form with a hideous
satisfaction horrible profanation. He drags her head to the bed's edge. He forces it back by the long hair still entwined in his grasp. With a plunge
he seizes her neck in his fanglike teeth. M
The church sanctioned vampire superstitions in order to draw
converts through fear, and church rituals officially established the
burning or piercing of suspected vampires in their graves. Even in the
present century this was still done by priests in the Balkans. 15 Jean
Jacques Rousseau showed the evidence for the existence of vampires
1041



Vsrir Varuna
resting on much the same foundations as the evidence for the existence
of God: "If there ever was in the world a warranted and proven
history, it is that of vampires; nothing is lacking, official reports,
testimonials of persons of standing, of surgeons, of clergymen, of judges; the judicial evidence is all-embracing." ,6
The most famous fictional vampire of them all, Count Dracula,
did have a real history. He was a feudal baron of sadistic temperament, Vlad the Impaler, of the Little Dragon clan: that is, Dracule. He
liked to impale his enemies on stakes, while he cut, roasted, and ate
pieces of flesh from their still-living bodies. 17 The fear engendered by this monster was such that his serfs believed he would return to plague them even after his death. Of course no such revenant has ever
reappeared, but the Count's clan nickname, at least, seems truly
immortal.

Vanir
Scandinavian elder deities: peace-loving, matriarchal, agricultural nature spirits led by Mother Earth and by Freya, "the Lady," called Vanadis or Matriarch of the Vanir. The warlike Aesir led by Father
Odin moved into the territory of the Vanir and made war against them, beginning with an act of cruelty: the Aesir seized and tortured their
holy sorceress, Gullveig. 1 In the end the Vanir were conquered, but many generations remained in awe of their miraculous powers. They
were said to have accomplished everything by magic, and invented all the knowledge that the new gods learned. 2
Whether the Vanir were described as elder gods, giants, elves,
matriarchs, or "primal ancestresses," they seem to have represented pre-patriarchal farming cultures who were forced to give way to nomadic Aryan invaders.

Varuna
Son of the Hindu sun-goddess Aditi, Varuna was an archaic god of
Protean forms: lord of the sky, of waters, of law, of winds, of seasons, and of death. He was sometimes female, sometimes an androgyne
representing sexual union. In this guise, he-she probably became the
Persian Varan, a "spirit of concupiscence." Varuna was paired with Mitra, a similar entity, a sister or male twin; from this deity evolved the Persians' wholly masculinized Mithra.

Vas Hermeticum, Vas Spirituale
Alchemical terms for the symbolic Grail, signifying the womb of
matter, a universal vessel of all transformations. The original symbol was
the "Vase" of life and death representing the womb of the Great Goddess Rhea Pandora. Among Christian mystics, Vas Spirituale was a
common title of the virgin Mary.
Vas Hermeticum Venus
Venus
Roman name for the Great Goddess in her sexual aspect, derived
from the eponymous mother of Venetian tribes of the Adriatic, after whom the city of Venice was also named. "Veneration" and "ven
ery" were further derivatives. Venery used to mean hunting; for, like
her eastern counterpart Artemis, Venus was once a Lady of Animals, and her Horned God Adonis, both the hunter and the sacrificial stag became venison, which meant "Venus's son." J
Early Christian fathers denounced the temples "dedicated to the foul devil who goes by the name of Venus a school of wickedness
for all the votaries of unchasteness." 2 What this meant was that they
were schools of instruction in sexual techniques, under the tutelage of
the veneriiox harlot-priestesses. 3 They taught an approach to spiritual grace, called venia, through sexual exercises like those of Tantrism.4
Like Tantric yogis, educated Romans envisioned the moment of
death as a culminating sexual union, a final act of the sacred marriage
promised by the religion of Venus. Ovid, an initiate, said he wished to die while making love: "Let me go in the act of coming to Venus; in
more senses than one let my last dying be done." 5 Centuries later, in
Shakespeare's time, "to die" was still a common metaphor for sexual
orgasm.6 An English treatise on interpretation of dreams said if a sick man dreamed of marrying a lovely maiden, it meant death. 7 When Christians said to die was to be gathered to the bosom of Christ or
Abraham, they unwittingly based the concept on the ancient female one.
Modern interpretations of classical mythology tend to picture
Venus as a sex goddess only. Her birth-giving and death-giving
aspects have been suppressed; but they were equally important in her cult. As Queen of the Shades she was identified with Proserpine, but
went by the name of Libitina. Plutarch said Libitina was only another
name for Venus, "the goddess of generation." 8 During the early Middle Ages, Venus became the ruling Fairy Queen of the magic mountains called Venusbergs. She also became a Christian saint, St. Venerina, who never existed in human form but
only as a cult figure continuing the worship of the Goddess in Calabria.9 In the Balkans she was called St. Venere, and is still invoked
as a patron of marriage by young girls making a wish that they might find good husbands. 10 The magic rhyme addressed to the planet Venus

her sacred city of Venice, on Ascension Day each year, the Duke of
Venice ceremonially married her by throwing a gold wedding ring into the sea. 11 This practice continued through Renaissance times, even when the title of Stella Maris was assimilated to Mary.

Venus Observa
Technical term for the male-superior sexual position, which Adam tried and failed to impose on Lilith, and which the Catholic church
designated the only legal position for marital intercourse, since it afforded the least pleasure to the wife. 1 Patriarchal societies generally
opposed such female-superior sexual positions as those favored by the worshippers of Shiva and Hecate, and by medieval witches who, as the
nursery rhyme says, rode on top of their "cock-horses."
Christian missionaries throughout the world usually insisted that
their native flocks must abandon any sexual variations they might be
accustomed to, and adopt the Venus observa posture exclusively, for anything else was sinful. Thus it came to be known as the "mission
ary position," and native couples often made fun of it in secret.
1. Graves & Patai, 67.
Veronica, Saint
St. Veronica was not a person but only a contraction of two Latin
words, vera iconica, "the true image." In 8th-century Rome, a cloth imprinted with a man's face appeared in St. Peter's basilica and was
advertised as the vera iconica of Christ. The legend invented to accoun
for it was that, as Jesus was carrying his cross, a woman named Veronica wiped the sweat from his face with her veil, which miraculous
ly took the image of the divine face. 1
Such stories were not uncommon in the ancient world. An old Greek tale told of Pandarus the Thessalian, who had "shameful
letters" on his brow until the god Asclepius miraculously removed then
to a scarf that Pandarus bound on his forehead. 2 Another pagan tale
was adapted to the Veronican legends: the king of Edessa sent an artist
to paint Jesus's portrait; but the artist couldn't see Jesus's face because
of its blinding sunlike brightness. So he merely pressed a cloth to the
divine features, and the imprint rendered a perfect portrait. Another impossible story claimed that Veronica's veil cured the emperor Tiberi
1044



us of sickness, so he carried it to Rome on a road entirely spread with silk and installed it in the shrine where it was "found" eight centuries
later. 5
St. Veronica's act of veil-imprinting is still included in the Stations
of the Cross, though some churchmen recommended its elimination
on the ground that the legend's transparent fakery is becoming too well known. 4

Verthandi
Vesica Piscis
Verthandi
Second of the three Norns venerated by Norsemen. Verthandi
signified the present, while her sisters Urth and Skuld stood for the past
and future. 1 As the Weird Sisters, or Mothers of Fate (wyrd), they
corresponded to the Greek Moerae, Latin Fortunae, and other versions of the Triple Goddess. Verthandi also governed motherhood and the
phases of the moon, like Kali the Preserver.
l.Branston,209.
Vesica Piscis
"Vessel of the Fish," a common yonic symbol, the pointed oval, named from the ancients' claim that female genitals smelled like fish.
Mother Kali herself appeared in a Hindu story as "a virgin named
Fishy Smell, whose real name was Truth," like Egypt's Goddess Maat. 1
Egyptians said Abtu, the Abyss, was "a fish who swallowed the penis
of Osiris," but this abyss was also "The Fish of Isis," therefore a sexual
metaphor. Aphrodite's principal rites at Paphos took place under the
sign of Pisces, the Fish. Aphrodite, Isis, Freya, and other forms of the Goddess in sexual aspect appeared veiled in fish nets. 2 See Fish.
The vesica piscis was an unequivocally genital sign of the sheilana-gig figures of old Irish churches. The squatting naked Goddess
displayed her vulva as a vesica, as did the temple-door images of Kali in India. 3 One of the old pagan ideograms of sexual union was adopted
by the church to represent the Feast of St. Nicholas on the runic
calendar: a vesica piscis enveloping a male furka. 4
The pointed-oval fish sign was even used by early Christians to represent the mystery of God's union with his mother-bride which
is why Jesus was called "the little Fish" in the Virgin's fountain. 5
This female enclosure was much used in Christian art, especially
as a superimposition on Mary's belly, with her child within. Sometimes Christ at his ascension was shown rising into a heavenly vesica, as
if returning to the Mother-symbol. The vesica was also shown as a
frame for figures of Jesus, God, and saints. Another name for the same sign was mandorla, "almond," which

Sign of Vesta
Vestal Virgins
Priestesses of Rome's oldest Goddess-matriarch, Vesta, who was the same as the Greeks' Hestia. Descendants of an ancient order of holy women who guarded the public hearth and altar, the Vestals were
entrusted with keeping alight the perpetual fire that was the mystic heart
of the empire. Vestals were vkgines, i.e., women who vowed never to marry because they were brides of the spirit of Rome, in the same sense that
Christian nuns were brides of Christ. Vestals underwent the same
ceremony that was later applied to nuns, to limit their magic female
powers: they had their hair shaved off. 1 In an earlier era, however, they
were not so restricted. Like all other ancient priestesses who ruled by
virtue of magic and motherhood, the Vestals used to be the governing
sisterhood of Latium. Rhea Silvia or "Rhea of the Woodland" was called the First
Vestal; she was actually the Goddess Rhea transplanted to the Latin
colonies. According to Roman legend, she gave birth to Romulus and
Remus, the founders of Rome. Their midwife, Acca Larentia,
another Vestal described as a "courtesan," gave birth to all the ancestral
spirits the Romans called lares. (See Akka.)
The Vestals were never altogether virginal in the physical sense.
Their marriage to the phallic deity of the Palladium was physically consummated in Vesta's temple, under conditions of great secrecy. The
ceremony was performed by a priest called the Pontifex Maximus, "great maker of the pons," which meant a bridge, a path, or a way. The Pontifex Maximus had what Dumezil calls "an obscure, now un
known duty" toward the Vestal Virgins. 2 One might suppose that his
"way" was something like the Way of eastern sex-sacraments; that is, he built the "bridge" between Father Heaven and Mother Earth
(Vesta). The office of Pontifex was adopted by Christians, and became a
"pontiff," synonymous with "pope." The Vestals however were
emphatically not adopted by Christians, although several of the details of their habit and lifestyle passed on to Christian convents. Pagans
revered the Vestals and were horrified by the way they were treated by
Christian regimes in the 4th and 5th centuries. In 382 a.d., the
endowments of all the pagan temples were withdrawn, including that of Vesta's 600-year-old Mother-hearth. "Worst of all in the opinion of
some traditionalists, the fire on Vesta's hearth was to be permitted to go out: the Vestal Virgins were to lose their endowments and immunity
from taxation, and all their privileges were to be taken away. The tiny
1046



order of six Vestals was particularly hated by the Christians. . . . Their Vida

Vida
Norse skald's word for the sacred poetry setting forth religious tales; cognate with the Hindu Vedas. Vida might be traced back to the elder
race of giants called risi, from Sanskrit rishi, an Enlightened One or sage, such as the early collectors of the Vedas were supposed to be. 1

Vidya
"Wisdom," a Tantric term for a woman acting as sexual partner of a
man in the magic circle; another epithet of the enlightenment-bringing Spirit of the Way, or Shakti.
Vikarr
Ancestor of the Vikings; a legendary king of Norway, sacrificially slain by the priests of Odin, enabled to beget tribes by the blood he shed on the maternal earth.
Vila var. Will
Slavic witch-spirit associated with water; cognate of the Scandinavian
Vala or Valkyrie. Russian Vilas were sometimes known as Rusalki,
daughters of Holy Mother Russia (Earth). Like Valkyries, the Vilas of old had charge of the rites of death and the guiding of souls.
Sometimes, especially favored men were invited to join the Vilas
for a while, usually seven years. A man would be invited into a cave or hollow tree, and find himself in fairyland. He was "one who has won
the love of a Vila," and his title was Krstnik, a "Christ," which meant both an Anointed One and an Accursed One. 1 That is, he was the
Slavic version of the Enchanted Hunter (Chasseur Maudit), or
Thomas Rhymer, Tannhauser, etc. In Dalmatia, a man associated with the Vilas was called Macieh,
Messiah." He took the form of a youth in a Phrygian cap, like the
Indo-Iranian sun-hero Mithra. 2 The female spirits he lived with were
also called krstaca, "crossed ones," from krst, a cross cognate with both the Greek Christos and the Saxon "curst." The female spirits were also known as Rogulja, "Horned Ones." 3

Virginal, Ice Queen
Virgin Birth
Vilas or Wilis came to be feared as angry, dangerous "souls of drowned women" who dwelt in water, perhaps because so many "witches" were drowned. Like Sirens, they were supposed to draw into the waters any heedless wayfarer who happened to see them dance by moonlight. They still dance on modern stages in the classical ballet
Giselle; the old fear of them resides in such phrases as "it gives me the willies." A cold shudder was said to be a prophetic touch from a
Wili's deathly hand. However, traces of the priestesses' former benevolence are found in the legend that where they danced on the
nights of the old pagan festivals, there the grass grew thicker and the wheat flourished more abundantly. 4

Virginal the Ice Queen
Medieval European version of the high-mountain Goddess, known in India as Durga the Inaccessible. She lived in the high Himalayas, an<
sometimes came down to form alliances with men; but always she
returned to her lonely glaciers. In European folk tales, Virginal the Ice Queen lived alone in the pure upper snowfields of the mountains,
but once she descended to a valley to become the bride of a minstrel
wizard, Dietrich von Bern. Soon, however, she wearied of the
lowlands and of him, and went back to her inviolable mountaintop,
where "she still rules supreme." '
The Norse version of Durga-Virginal was the death-goddess Skadi, who married the god Njord but grew tired of living with him in the lowlands by the sea, so she returned alone to her mountains. Some say she became the evil Snow Queen who would kidnap children from their homes and take away their souls. Since snow-covered mountains were widely associated with the
milk-giving breasts of Mother Earth, it is possible that Durga the Inaccessible and similar Ice Queens represented the nursing Goddess, in the period when lactating human females, like lactating animal females, were literally inaccessible to the male. Preoccupied with
motherhood, the Goddess became "virgin" again in her refusal to tolerate male attentions. She "withdrew" from her marriage and went away to a place where no man could follow. There was an archetypal element in these stories. As M.-L. von Franz has said, "One may
suddenly find oneself up against something in a woman that is
obstinate, cold, and completely inaccessible." 2

Virgin Birth
"Holy Virgin" was the title of harlot-priestesses of Ishtar, Asherah, or Aphrodite. The title didn't mean physical virginity; it meant simply
1048



"unmarried." The function of such "holy virgins" was to dispense
the Mother's grace through sexual worship; to heal; to prophesy; to perform sacred dances; to wail for the dead; and to become Brides of God. Children born of such temple women were called by the Semites
bathur, by the Greeks parthenioi, "virgin-born." ' According to the Protoevangelium, the Virgin Mary was a kadesha and perhaps married to one of that class of priests known as "fathers of the god." 2 See
Firstborn.
Mary's impregnation was similar to Persephone's. In her Virgin guise, Persephone sat in a holy cave and began to weave the great tapestry of the universe, when Zeus appeared as a phallic serpent, to beget the savior Dionysus on her. 3 Mary sat in the temple and began to spin a blood-red thread, representing Life in the tapestry of fate, when the angel Gabriel "came in unto her" (Luke 1:28), the biblical
phrase for sexual intercourse. Gabriel's name means literally "divine husband." 4
Hebrew Gospels designated Mary by the word almah, mistakenly translated "virgin," but really meaning "young woman." 5 It was derived from Persian Al-Mah, the unmated Moon-goddess. 6 Another
cognate was Latin alma, "living soul of the world," virtually identical to Greek psyche, Sanskrit shakti. The Holy Virgins or temple-harlots were "soul-teachers" or "soul-mothers" the alma mater.
Christian translators insisted on rendering Mary's title as "virgin,"
which saddled their religion with an embarrassing article of faith.
Even today, theologians like Karl Barth declare that "It is essential to the
true Christian faith to accept the doctrine of the virgin birth" thus
drastically reducing the number of people who can be called true Christians. 7
Early Christians demanded a virgin birth for their Savior out of
simple imitativeness. All the other Saviors had one, for they were
born of the Goddess incarnate in a chosen "virgin of the temple,"
whose business it was to bear Saviors. The notion that mortal women
were impregnated by gods or spirits was a matter of everyday acceptance throughout the ancient world. Even the Old Testament says the
archaic "giants" (ancestral heroes) were born of mortal women impregnated by spirits that came from God (Genesis 6:4).
Zoroaster, Sargon, Perseus, Jason, Miletus, Minos, Asclepius, and dozens of others were God-begotten and virgin-born. Even Zeus, the Heavenly Father who begot many other "virgin-born" heroes, was himself called Zeus Mamas, "Virgin-born Zeus." 8 Plutarch noted
among the Egyptians the common belief that the spirit of God was capable of sexual intercourse with mortal women.9 Heracles was born of another almah, the Virgin Alcmene, whose name means Power of the Moon. 10 Her husband also, like the
biblical Joseph, kept away from her bed during her pregnancy. The same tale was told of Plato, whose nephew affirmed that he was

The temple hierodules were called virgines or venerii in Rome, horae in Greece, kadishtu, qadesh, or kadesha in Babylon, Canaan, and Palestine.

Virgin Birth
St. Justin Martyr Christian apologist of
the 2nd century, born of pagan parents and trained in philosophy before his conversion. In addition to his Apologia and
Dinlogus, many anonymous later works were falsely attributed to his pen.
begotten by the god Apollo, his earthly parents having no sexual
relations until after his birth. 11 Christians believed this, and solemnly
attested that Plato was a virgin-born son of the sun god. 12 After Christianity was established as the official religion of the
Roman empire, however, church fathers tried to discredit all other
virgin births by claiming that the devil had devised them, and malicious
ly placed them in a past time, so they would pre-date the real Savior. Justin Martyr wrote, "When I am told that Perseus was born of a virgin I realize that here again is a case in which the serpent and deceiver
has imitated our religion." 1?
Despite the efforts of church fathers, the virgin birth of Jesus was
neither the first nor the last such miracle given credence by Chris
tians. Priapic idols of antiquity, credited with the power to father
children, actually fathered other priapic idols who became saints like
Foutin, Gurtlichon, Gilles, Regnaud, and Guignole; these were credited with the same power of fertilization and were much adored by
women who desired offspring. 14 Women of Tuscany and Portugal
thought they could become pregnant by eating apples specially consecrated by a priest. Spaniards remembered the virgin birth of Mars, and thought any woman could conceive like Mars's mother Juno, by
eating a lily. It was believed that souls could enter a woman's body in
the form of flies, worms, or serpents, to cause impregnation. Cases were solemnly documented, like that of a Scot named Gillie Downak
Chravolick, conceived when his mother raised her skirts on an old
battlefield and received into her "private member" some ashes from the
burned bones of dead warriors. 15 As impregnation by a god used to be
the "acceptable explanation for pregnancy in most pagan countries where the sexual act was part of the fertility rites," so Christians
thought impregnation by spirits was still credible, whether the alleged father was a dead hero, a devil, an incubus, or even in some sects
the Holy Ghost again. 16 Such an untenable belief survived because it was important to
men. The impossible virgin mother was everyman's longed-for resolution of Oedipal conflicts: pure maternity, never distracted from her
devotion by sexual desires. Churchmen unwittingly showed their
anxiety by denying even the evidence of their own Gospels that Jesus
had brothers and sisters. St. Ambrose insisted that Mary never
conceived again, since God couldn't have chosen for his mother-bride "a woman who would defile the heavenly chamber with the seed of a
'17
man.
Theologians in effect severed the two halves of the pagan God
dess, whose realistic femininity combined abundant sexuality and
maternity. One half was labeled harlot and temptress, the other a female ascetic even in motherhood. The Goddess's old title, Sancta Ma
trona Holy Mother was added to the canon of saints as a phony St.
Matrona, whose pseudo-biography made her a "hermitess." 18
1050



The primitive naivete of the virgin-birth concept was dressed in Virgo
pretentious verbiage, purporting to explain it, while actually hiding it Virtue from prying eyes. "A shadow is formed by light falling upon a body. ^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Virgin, as a human being, could not hold the fulness of divinity; but the power of the most High overshadowed her, while the incorpore
al light of the godhead took a human body within her, and so she was
able to bear God." 19
Churchmen often presented the doctrine of the virgin birth as
"ennobling" to women, since they viewed women's natural sexuality as degrading. Seldom were female sexuality and motherhood perceived as component parts of the same whole. Some women were astute
enough to see that the doctrine effectively degraded real womanhood by
exalting a never-attainable ideal. At the end of the 19th century one
woman wrote:
/ think that the doctrine ofthe Virgin birth as something higher, sweeter, nobler than ordinary motherhood, is a slur on all the natural motherhood of the world. . . . Out of this doctrine, and that which is akin to it, have sprung all the monasteries and nuns ofthe world, which have disgraced and distorted and demoralized manhood and womanhood for a
thousand years. I place beside this false, monkish, unnatural claim . . . my mother, who was as holy in her motherhood as was Mary herself. 20

Virgo
Virgil said the constellation Virgo (the Virgin) was Erigone, Goddess of Justice, also known as Astraea or "Starry One." l She identified with
Libera, or Libra, the Lady of the Scales, judge of men and ruler of their fates. Renaissance poets still called her Astraea: "She is that royal
and great goddess by whom cities and empires are preserved in pride; without her no kingdom can long endure. This is she who makes them
all secure." 2

Virtue
Latin virtu was derived from vir, "man," and originally meant
masculinity, impregnating power, semen, or male magic, like Germanic heill. Patriarchal thinkers defined manliness as good and womanliness
as bad, therefore virtu became synonymous with morality or godliness,
along with other synonyms hinting at male sexuality: erectness,
1051



vishnu uprightness, rectitude, upstandingness, etc. As the Old Testament said,
Vitus, Saint "Praise is comely for the upright" (Psalms 33:1).
^^^^^^^^^^ Old phallic connotations of "virtue" may have been hidden in the
"^ Gospels' description of Jesus's miraculous cure of the woman with an
issue of blood. When she touched Jesus, he felt "virtue" go out of him, "and straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up" (Mark
5:29-30). According to ancient systems of sacred kingship, it was
important for the king-victim to give proof of virility, which meant
impregnating a specially chosen priestess, so that the "fountain of her blood" might cease.
Vishnu
Vedic god representing both the sacrificial boar and the phallus. His
name meant "he who embraces, pervades, or penetrates"; he was known as "the expander," and "he who excites men." l His emblem
was a lingam-yoni composed of a male cross with a female circle, called
the sign Kiakra: "When held by Vishnu, it signifies his power to penetrate heaven and earth." 2
Vishnu insisted that his flesh and blood, poured out on the
sacrificial altar, preserved the whole world, creatures and gods alike.
When he transformed himself into the boar, he became the Universal
Savior. For the sake of the world he gave himself up to death, and
was sacrificed by "gods saying Om." ?
The boar's tusk was identified with his phallus, because it was the
tusk that effected Vishnu's mating with the primal Goddess Earth:
"He uprose bearing on his tusk the fair goddess Earth, shedding in all directions the brine of the cosmic sea." 4 Boars' tusks often represent
ed phalli in Oceanic and Far-Eastern cultures.

Vitus, Saint
Imaginary saint dimly associated with Sicily, possibly based on a Latin
word carved on an ancient healing shrine: Vitus ("life"). An emblem of
the Moon-goddess entered into the fabrication of St. Vitus as his
alleged "nurse," Crescentia. Vitus was especially venerated in Westphalia, where bones said to
be his had rested since the 9th century a.d., though his legend
assigned him to the time of Diocletian, six hundred years earlier. The
bones were credited with the ability to cure many diseases, especially chorea, the so-called St. Vitus's Dance. 1

Viviana, Saint Viviana, Saint
Canonized form of the pagan Goddess Viviane, whose name meant Life. It seems to have been nothing more than a word on the Goddess's i
temple on the Esquiline Hill in Rome. Probably an image of the
Goddess, so labeled, was deliberately re-interpreted as the image of a
"virgin martyr." 1 Among early medieval Celtic poets, Viviane was the name of the
Lady of the Lake, who reappeared in Arthurian myths as another form of Nimue, the "Nemesis" of Merlin.
l.Attwater, 338.
Volsi
"Horse's Penis," a title of Odin as the castrated royal horse, whose
amputated member became the ancestor of the Volsungs. Welsh
equivalents were the Waelsings, sons of Waels, who later became "the god Wales." Waels also meant "the Corpse," for the dead god was
always resurrected and became the usual Lord of Death, like Shiva's
corpse-form Shava. See Horse.
Vulcan
Latin lightning- or volcano-god derived from Cretan Velchanos, identical with Hephaestus. Vulcan's forges were said to lie under Mt. Etna or Mt. Vesuvius. See Lightning; Smith. He evolved into the
medieval "Volund the Smith," a divine wizard whom the British called
Wayland.
Vulture
One of the oldest totems of the Great Mother in Egypt was the
vulture, eater of the dead. Vultures who devoured corpses were regard
ed as her angels of death, since they carried the dead piecemeal to
heaven. In Neolithic times it was a common practice to expose dead
bodies to carrion birds, who embodied the Mother's spirit. For this
reason even the Greeks and Romans fostered a belief that all vultures
are female. 1 On the Stele of the Vultures from Catal Huyuk, 7th
millenium B.C., dead bodies are carried off by vultures in a time and
place where only the female principle was worshipped. 2 Ancient Iranians didn't bury their dead, but exposed them to
vultures in open-topped "towers of silence" called dakhmas, many of
which still stand today. Such towers were built when Iranians wor
shipped the Moon-goddess Mah, the Mother, and believed that
1053



Vulture vultures carried the deceased to her heavenly realm. 5 Even after burial was instituted in Persia, a dead body couldn't be interred until it was
^
^^^Im first torn by vultures.*
Egyptians worshipped the vulture-headed Mother as the origin of all things, calling her Mut, Isis, or Nekhbet. 5 In combination with the
serpent goddess Buto (Per-Uatchet), the vulture-mother gave rise to the
Two Mistresses, guardians of royal dynastic clans, and nurses of deceased kings in the after-life. Temples had special chapels for the Two Mistresses: on the east, the serpent Goddess brought the sun to birth; on the west, the vulture Goddess daily ordained his death. 6 Sometimes both Goddesses appeared as vultures on the sacred mount of Sehseh, where the deceased pharaoh became an eternal infant at
their breasts. 7 Egypt's oldest oracle was the shrine of the vulture goddess Nekh
bet at Nekhen (modern Al-Kab), the original "necropolis" or city of the dead. Because it was a birth shrine as well as a death shrine, Greeks
called it Ilithyiaspolis after their own Great Mother of childbirth,
Aphrodite Ilithyia. 8 Romans called it Civitas Lucinae, the city of Juno Lucina, Goddess of childbirth.9
Egypt's symbol for "grandmother" was the vulture goddess bear
ing a flail of authority: a totemic form of the pre-dynastic clan
matriarch. 10 The word "mother" was written in hieroglyphics with the sign of the vulture. 11 Nekhbet the Vulture once ruled all of Upper
Egypt, wearing the white crown in token of sovereignty. As Isis, she appeared in vulture form on mummy-pillows, crowned with a vulture skin and bearing in each claw the ankh or Cross of Life. 12 As a vulture
she devoured her dead consort Osiris, just as Kali devoured her dead
Shiva. 13 Then she reincarnated him in her body, and gave him rebirth
as a new Holy Child, Horus.
Osiris was dismembered, which was the funerary custom of primitive Egypt, dating from a remote time when the dead probably were
eaten, after the manner of primitive Greece's omophagia. Funerary magic lay in the hands of dancing priestesses called muu, "mothers," who may have worn costumes of vulture feathers to represent "eaters"
and, like Isis, reconstitute the dead in their own bodies. The Book of
Ani said the first gate of the uterine underworld was guarded by the
vulture Goddess, whose tearing beak could admit the dead to the
place whence they rose again. 14 The vulture-mother was known also in northern Europe and Asia.
Valkyries were "corpse-eaters" to the Saxons and often took the form
of carrion-eating birds such as crows or ravens. In Siberia, each shaman
had a "Bird-of-Prey Mother" who appeared twice in his life, at his spiritual death-and-rebirth like the Dove-mother appearing at Jesus's
baptismal ceremony and again at his physical death. This spiritmother was a large carrion bird "with an iron beak, hooked claws, and a
long tail." 15
Funerary priestesses came to be called "dirty" in classic myths, as
1054



they appear in the tale of the vulture-feathered Harpies. However, Vulture
the ancient claim that all vultures are female was believed well into the
Christian era. Church fathers cited, in defense of the Virgin Birth, ^^mM
the "fact" that vultures conceived their eggs only because they were
fertilized by spirits of the wind. 16

Walpurga, Saint War
var. Saint Walburga
Walpurga, Saint Christianization of the pagan Goddess of Walpurgisnacht (May
Eve), the orgiastic festival of the springtime sacred marriage. Walpurga was the May Queen whose cult remained so popular in Germany that the church had to adopt her in its usual way, by a spurious
canonization. According to the canonical legend, she was an Englishwoman who became supreme abbess of the double monastery of Heidenheim during the 8th century; but there were no contemporary records of the time when this "abbess" was supposed to have lived and
reigned. 1 In the 8th century, however, double monasteries largely perpetuat
ed the pagan traditions of the "colleges" of priests and priestesses
living together under a female ruler, and apparently carrying on the
ancient sex rites under a thin veil of Christian-pagan syncretism. 2
(See Convent.) The name of Walpurga's monastery means literally "home of heathens." The medieval church produced and sold vast quantities of an allegedly miraculous Oil of St. Walpurga, which exuded so it was claimed from the holy rock under which the saint's bones lay, and
which was highly recommended for the purpose of healing many
kinds of diseases. 3
The saint's day was transferred from May Eve to February,
possibly in an attempt to discourage the Walpurgisnacht revels; but "witches" celebrated the original date of the marriage-festival anyway, in honor of Walpurga. Therefore the church had to claim that May
Eve commemorated the transfer of St. Walpurga's relics to Eichstatt so
the processions and dances and songs would seem to be associated
with the progress of a revered reliquary. 4 May Eve, however, remained
a prime festival of witches throughout all Europe.

War
A primary patriarchal contribution to culture, almost entirely absent from the matriarchal societies of the Neolithic and early Bronze Ages. 1
Even when Goddess-worship was beginning to give way to cults of aggressive gods, for a long time the appearance of the Goddess imposed peace on all hostile groups. Among Germanic tribes in Europe, Tacitus said, whenever the Goddess moved in her chariot at certain
seasons to certain sacred places, the people "do not go to battle or
wear arms; every weapon is under lock; peace and quiet are known and welcomed." 2 In later centuries, one of the reasons for the devaluation
of women in feudal Europe was that the feudal system was based on
war, in which women played no part except as victims. 3 Patriarchal gods tended to be warlike from their inception
1058



including, or even particularly, the Judeo-Christian God. Stanton observed that the Old Testament's account of God's nature, purpose,
and activities on behalf of his Chosen People boils down to "a long
painful record of war, corruption, rapine, and lust. Why Christians who wished to convert the heathen to our religion should send them these
books, passes all understanding." 4
But Christianity was never a pacifist religion. The church placed warfare in its armory of persecution as soon as its political power made this possible. Pope Innocent I (d. 417) proclaimed that God gave the church the right to kill, and permitted papal armies to employ the sword "for the punishment of the guilty," which meant massacre of the
nonorthodox. 5 The warfare of Christian sect against Christian sect
was unremitting, so that pagan observers said Christians behaved toward
each other with the ferocity of wild beasts. 6 These trends continued
throughout the Christian era, under the headings of holy wars, crusades, conquests, and conversions by the sword. All-male Christianity was
disseminated by violence. 7
Meanwhile, with the decline of their religious power and the
obliteration of their Goddess, women helplessly disapproved, as many do today. An American black woman recently said:
/ don 't think a few should control everything. I don 't think it's right that women lay down and bear sons and then you have a few rich people
that tell your sons they have to go and die for their country. They're not
dying for their country. They're dying for the few to stay on top. I don 't think that's necessary. I'm just tired ofthis type of thing. I just think we
ought to be just human. s
In contrast to these sentiments, there was a more masculine
opinion published in Marinetti's "manifesto of futurism" in the follow
ing terms: "we want to extol the love of danger. . . . There is no
beauty apart from conflict. There are no masterpieces without aggression. . . . We want to extol war the world's only hygiene
militarism, patriotism, the anarchist's destructive gesture, the glorious,
death-giving ideas and contempt for women!" 9 Some women accepted the contempt and tamely submitted to the
God and the man who extolled war, even giving up their children without protest, like housewife Jesusita Novarro:
I pray a lot. I pray to God to give me strength. IfHe should take a child
away from me, to have the strength to accept it. It's His kid. He just borrowed him to me. . . .
These kids don 't ask to be born these kids are gonna grow up and
give their lives one day. . . . There will always be war. Why? I really don 't know. Nobody has ever told me. . . . I wish I knew. I guess the big shots decided the war. ,0
More articulate women have spoken out against the "big shots"
who seem to leave the life-affirming interests of women out of their
plans for the future, calling their power-mania gynocidal and therefore

War genocidal.
11 It is often implied that only women can take on the
responsibility of defying the war machines, to save their children; but
again women are placed in a no-win situation when they have no
power to enforce their defiance.
With the advance of technological civilization, as everyone knows, wars have become deadlier than ever, as if the mind of man
becomes less "civilized" as his tools become more so. Some have
doubted that man is capable of constructing a stable, peaceful world. Becker remarked, "It seems that the experiment of man may well
prove to be an evolutionary dead end, an impossible animal." n Jules
Henry said:
Is there nothing in life in an achieving culture but constant war war
against the outside as the fullest expression of the drive, and war on the
inside to contain and transform it? The grisly history ofachieving cultures does not permit anything but the affirmation: No, there is nothing more. Though the inner and the outer war continue, the outer has so far been most successful, and the history ofthe achievement drive shows that Homo sapiens has been dying ofsuccess and will probably fail as a
species because ofit. n
Teilhard de Chardin wondered whether some historical error
might have brought man to a wrong turning in the path of progress, so that violence of the modern world betrays "a certain excess, inexplicable to our reason, as if to the normal effect of evolution is added the
extraordinary effect of some catastrophe or primordial deviation." H It is not difficult to find such a deviation in the contrast between "matrist"
and "patrist" societies, especially in their respective valuations of elemental caring behavior.
The fundamental problem ofmankind is to develop a culture where the needs ofthe individual are always complementary to those around him; a culture in which a child is not slapped for crying; a culture in which
sorrow always is met by the complementary need to be compassionate; where fear is always met by the complementary need in others to give reassurance; where the need to be loved is met by a need to give love in the way it is wanted, at the time it is wanted and as much as it is wanted. This is not an American view, for the American makes conflict into a god; and although sociology swells its chest with a thousand "conflict theories, "it has none on compassion. . . . Life without conflict seems
stale to the American elites; and compassion, which is a low-paid motiva
tion, has been relegated to the fringes ofthe low-paid segments ofthe culture, and has never been a subject for research. ,s
The highest-paid pursuits of the modern age tend to exploit violence either directly or in symbol, as Arthur Miller observed:
There is violence because we have daily honored violence. Any halfeducated man in a good suit can make his fortune by concocting a
television show whose brutality is photographed in sufficiently monstrous detail. Who produces these shows, who pays to sponsor, who is honored for acting in them? Are these people delinquent psychopaths
1060



slinking along tenement streets? No, they are the pillars ofsociety, our War honored men, our exemplars ofsuccess and social attainment. We must begin to feel the shame and contrition we have earned before we can ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
begin to sensibly construct a peaceful society, let alone a peaceful world. A country where people cannot walk safely in their own streets has not
earned the right to tell any other people how to govern itself, let alone to bomb and burn that people. 16
Some observers of the modern scene fear that the symbolism of
violence, so prevalent in what passes for "entertainment" in our
aggressive society, will actually create its social counterpart because of man's propensity to model his behavior on symbolic forms. Mumford
says:
Power and order, pushed to their final limit, lead to their self-destructive
inversion: disorganization, violence, mental aberration, subjective chaos. This tendency is already expressed in America through the motion picture, the television screen, and children 's comic books. These forms ofamusement are all increasingly committed to enactments ofcold
blooded brutality and physical violence: pedagogical preparations for the practical use ofhomicide and genocide. . . . Was it not in the country
most disciplined by militarism, absolutism, and physical science that systematic torture in the form of "scientific experiments" was undertaken? Did not Germany produce the nauseating horrors ofthe extermination camps? In the combination ofcold scientific rationalism with criminal
irrationalism the fatal poison produced its equally fatal antidote. ' 7
The rise of Hitler's Germany provides an interesting case in point, showing a nation swept by militaristic sentiment coupled with a
sense of divine mission. The churches accepted Hitler's warmonger
ing with religious joy. In April 1937, a Christian organization in the Rhineland passed a resolution that Hitler's word was the law of God
and possessed "divine authority." Reichsminister for Church Affairs Hans Kerrl announced: "There has arisen a new authority as to what
Christ and Christianity really are that is Adolf Hitler. Adolf Hitler
is the true Holy Ghost." 18 And so the pious gave him their blessing, and
the churches gave him God's. "Organized religion has always managed to provide prayers and thanks for victories in bloody wars. ... In
more recent history, is there any evidence that organized religion
anywhere did anything but bless the battlers on both sides?" 19
In fact, Nazism was not the creation of Hitler alone, nor even of
Germany alone. The Nazi myth of "pure Aryanism" began not with a German but with a Frenchman, Comte de Gobineau, who claimed in 1853 that the divinely chosen Master Race, of Teutonic stock, had
been defiled by admixtures of inferior, swarthy peoples: Latins, Negroes, Semites. Teutons would "naturally" rule the world once these
inferior strains were purged from their Aryan bloodlines. Germans founded Gobineau societies all over their country, and
developed a new nationalistic pride out of the myth of the Teutonic
Ubermensch. The myth was further elaborated by an Englishman,
1061



War H. S. Chamberlain, who wrote The Foundation ofthe Nineteenth
Century in 1899, giving a "scientific" rationale for the awful conse
quences of racial mixture, especially the contamination of "exalted
Aryans" by Semitic blood. Chamberlain married Wagner's daughter
Eva, and became a German citizen. Kaiser Wilhelm praised him, and
called Chamberlain's book his favorite reading. Clearly, it was also a
favorite of Hitler's. The Gobineau-Chamberlain-Hitler theory of the Ubermensch shows one of the most common underlying causes of war: man's
propensity to view himself and his own group as superior to others, who therefore deserve destruction because they are substandard. Once the
propaganda machine begins to work, there is no limit to the depravity it can impute to the enemy not wholly without reason, for war
corrupts everyone including one's own troops, though this fact is invariably overlooked. War is an outstanding example of the WeThey syndrome: the Saved versus the Damned, the Chosen People
versus the heathen, God's champions against the forces of evil (even
when God is on both sides). Hitler succeeded brilliantly in convincing his followers that his political enemies were subhumans (Untermens
chen), therefore it was only reasonable to exterminate them. 20
In a sense this indoctrination can extend even to the enemy's
homeland, which can be seen as a non-country whereas according
to the patriotic ideal one's own country is the most superior spot on
Mother Earth's body, the essential cunnus as primitives believed, a
paradise on earth. Such maternal symbolism has even been used to good
effect in developing desirable sentiments of aggression in wartime, as
shown by the writing of a California superintendent of schools:
The good citizen stands in relation to his country as the good son to his mother.
He obeys her because she is his elder, because she conjoins within herselfthe vision ofmany, and because he owes to her his begetting
and his nurturing. He honors her above all others, placing her in a special niche within his secret heart, in front of which the candles ofrespect and admiration
are forever kept alight. He defends her against all enemies, and counts his life well lost in her behalf 21
Such utilization of the powerful Mother-symbol on behalf of
militarism tends to conceal the real aggressors from their real victims. As
women seem to know almost instinctively, the former are the "big
shots" mature men in positions of power. The latter are the younger, handsomer, more virile rivals the sons who can be made obedient
soldiers and sent off to be destroyed, which may defuse the Oedipal
jealousy. In effect, war is a gentlemen's agreement between the
authority figures on both sides that they will kill off each other's youths,
and even win social approval or adulation for doing so. 22

Patriarchal males have always shown hostility to the young, who War
divert the attention of females, either as mates or mothers. In the
west, male aggression against the young is sometimes projected onto ^^^mm^^ma^^m
women: for example, accusing women of murder in the case of abortion, or of crime in the case of birth control. Both these measures
tended to diminish the patriarchs' supply of cannon fodder. Margaret
Sanger thought women could end war by "cutting off the surplus people. Of course military states always clamor for more children,
first to defend the Fatherland, and when the population soars, to conquer more territory for the added millions." 23 But the goals of a
militaristic state would not be served by women who deliberately denied
it the necessary population base; the state wanted quantity, not
quality.
Religion of the patriarchal sort was, and is, always on the side of the patriarchs. Vetter says, "There is little to choose between the
head-hunting which keeps down the number of people to be supported by the game produced in a given area, and the periodic wholesale slaughter engaged in by 'civilized' peoples in their battles for the control
of equally vital economic resources, and for which slaughters the
blessings of our religions have never failed to be forthcoming." 24 Wars are begun by elite males and carried out by those of lower
status, while priesthoods bless the effort. "It is a fair estimate that 100
million people have been killed by war since 1900. Responsibility for
this mass slaughter rests directly upon the male members of the
species." 25 Yet war is never reasonable, as males imagine their actions to be. "Destruction of the world by a small group of white men in order
to achieve more wealth than they can ever possibly use does not make
sense. We are talking here about a drive for power, a need for domination that must be examined. ... In squelching female energy,
patriarchy creates a culture that is destructive and death-oriented." 26
Today "we see the threat of nuclear annihilation more serious than ever
after two decades of disarmament efforts. We realize that science and
technology cannot save us, at least not as currently administered by
men. The design for disaster we currently face was not planned by women." 27
In the Tantric morality which probably was planned by women, at
least in part, war is entirely unacceptable. The adept may not participate in fighting or in the manufacture of weapons; he must not
glorify soldiers' bravery, nor praise killing in a hunt or a battle. These "constitute a worse form of murder since they incite others to do it, thus
harming their spiritual growth." 28 With modern films and television
still trying to glorify violence, it seems the Tantric sages had already achieved a deeper understanding of human nature than those of our
"enlightened" modern world.

Waste Land
The recurrent threatening theme of medieval romances was the
Waste Land motif, especially in the Holy Grail cycle. Like the Grail legends themselves," the Waste Land motif probably came from the Middle East, where European travelers and crusaders had seen a true
Waste Land: the great desert which eastern mystics attributed to
Islam's renunciation of the fertile Great Mother. Western pagans also
maintained that if the Mother should be offended or neglected, she
might curse the land with the same desperate barrenness that could be
seen in Arabia Deserta and north Africa. (See Grail, Holy.)
One of the Grail stories said a king of England (Logres) once
committed a mortal sin by raping one of the Goddess's priestesses
and stealing her golden cup, symbol of her love, which must not be
stolen but only given. Afterward, priestesses of the sacred springs no longer welcomed wayfarers with food and drink. 1 The Peace of the
Goddess was destroyed, for the women no longer trusted men. "The
land went to waste. The trees lost their leaves, grass and flowers
withered, and the water receded more and more. ... [A] wrong
against a feminine being and a plundering of nature were perpetrated. . . . [T]he origin of the trouble was looked upon as an offense committed
against the fairy world, i.e., actually against nature. . . . The growth of masculine consciousness and of the patriarchal logos principle of the Christian outlook are concerned in no small measure with this
development." 2 The Goddess appeared in several myths of the Grail cycle as a
great lady disinherited, or a queen robbed of her possessions and reduced to penury, like La Reine de la Terre Gaste (Queen of the
Waste Land) in the Cistercian romance of the Queste del Saint Graal}
Many tales speak of groups of women deprived of their former property rights and gathered together in "castles of damsels," under three rulers
personifying the Goddess: a queen, her daughter, and her granddaughter. Hoping to keep their enemies at bay by magic spells, the woman waited for a champion to defend their cause, as the Grail knights were
supposed to do. The queen employed a certain learned astronomer
whose wizardry kept away from the castle any knight likely to fail through cowardice, envy, greed, or any other weakness of character. The ladies waited for the coming of their savior, the Desired Knight,
perfect in his honesty and bravery: one who could destroy all their enemies and restore their lands and possessions, which had been taken
from them by various robber barons. "Orphaned maidens," deprived of
1064



their inheritance by new patrilineal laws, also took refuge in such castles Waste Land
of women; so did older widows who were no longer permitted to inherit
property as under the former laws of mother-right.4 m^^^mt^m^^^mm
Legends of the coming of the Desired Knight may have been
promulgated by women, or by bards seeking to please women with a favorite theme. But there was more than this to the image of the Waste
Land. It haunted a society in which, "Under the autocratic regime of
persecuting Christianity during the Middle Ages of Europe, Christian dogma was indeed accepted nominally by great intellects, but it was accepted under duress and with a reservation. . . . The men of highest
intellect were compelled to express the faith that was in them in the
most guarded language." 5 Often, the language was symbolism the most guarded of all, since its true meaning could always be denied. The
symbolic Waste Land was "a landscape of spiritual death," where
religious concepts were dissociated from the feelings and life experiences of ordinary people, and imposed upon a confused, reluctant public only by authoritarian indoctrination.6
This could well describe Europe in the 1 2th century, when the
coming of the Desired Knight was vaguely identified with the second
coming of Christ or Merlin, Arthur, Frederick, etc. Many oppressed
people despairingly yearned for a powerful hero to defy the oppressors on their behalf. The Waste Land theme invoked the collective fear of
every agricultural society since the Stone Age: the fear that Mother
Earth's cyclic miracle of food production might fail. But it meant more
than that. It also stood for collective devitalization and depression in a
society perceived by its members as lacking spiritual roots. A famous modern application of the Waste Land theme is, of
course, T.S. Eliot's poem, based not only on western applications of
Grail symbolism but also on the Hindu tale of the hopeless quest for the
true Word of Power, as recounted in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. The Hindu version ran like this:
Gods, men, and demons went to Shiva-Prajapati in the guise of Lord of Thunder, to find out from him the ultimate word that is, the
word signifying the goal and end of all things, as Om signified their beginning. But the Thunder, being thunder, was not able to say any word except one: Da.
Men, hearing this word, thought it meant datta, meaning "give" or
"fertilize," because begetting was the only divine thing they could do, and charitable giving was the only way they knew to seek blessedness.
Demons, hearing this word, thought it meant dayadhvam, meaning "sympathize" or "be compassionate"; in the Oriental context demons were not evil spirits but deities of the old matriarchal religion, who
preached karuna, mother-love. Gods, hearing this word, thought it
meant damyata, meaning "control," the secret of their success; by self
control they became divine, and by divinity they achieved power to control all the others.
But the Lord of Thunder couldn't distinguish one word from
1065



Water another. He only repeated mindlessly the only word he knew: "Da! Da!
Weird Sisters Da!" 7 1 Spence 138. 2. Jung & von Franz, 202, 204. 3. Campbell, CM., 543.

Water
First of the elements, according to the philosophers of ancient
Miletus; the Arche, mother of all things.
1 Water gave birth to "spirit,"
supposedly a male principle; hence the idea of baptismal rebirth that
Christians copied from the pagans involved both water (feminine) and spirit (masculine). The baptismal font was described as a "womb," specifically the womb of Mary, whose name was that of all the ancient
Sea-goddesses. 2 Most myths placed the primary impulse of creation in a watery womb of chaos or "formlessness" representing the Great
Mother (Tiamat, Kali, Ma-Nu, Themis, etc.), an image really drawn from the lack of differentiation between self and other or self and
mother experienced by the infant in the womb and subconsciously remembered throughout life as an archetypal image. The Mother-letter
M (Ma) was an ideogram for waves of water.
"Students of mythology find that when the feminine principle is
subjected to sustained attack, as it was from the medieval Christian
authorities, it often quietly submerges. Under the water (where organic life began) it swims through the subconscious of the dominant male
society, occasionally bobbing to the surface to offer a glimpse of the
rejected harmony." 3 Correspondence between "water" and "mother" was so universal
even in the Middle Ages, when the maternal principle was theoreti
cally squelched, that the Hermetic magicians and other "philosophers" claimed souls were created not by God, but by the maternal earth and
maternal waters.4 Goddess-shrines were nearly always associated with
wells, springs, lakes, or seas. 5 The Lady of the Lake was identical with
Minne/Aphrodite, the Minnesingers' Goddess of Love, who appeared as a mermaid and was assumed to have a "nature of water." Often,
water was a metaphor for love itself. Like water, love stayed with the
man who held it loosely, as in an open, cupped hand; but the man
who tried to grip it hard, in his fist, found that it flowed away and left
him gripping nothing. And water, like love, was essential to the lifeforces of fertility and creativity, without which the psychic world as well as the material world would become an arid desert, the Waste Land.

Weird Sisters
The three witches in Shakespeare's Macbeth were called Weird
Sisters after the three Fates, or Norns, corresponding to the Greek
1066



Moerae and the Celtic Morrigan; that is, the Triple Goddess of past, Wells
present, and future. Weird was a Saxon name of the death-goddess or Crone, who often stood for the whole trinity. Her name was variously ^^^^^^^^^^^^
given as Wyrd, or Wurd, or Urd, meaning both "Earth" and the Word
of Fate's immutable law. 1 As Beowulf said, "Every man in this life will go lay him down on the bed where Wyrd has decided to nail him." 2 This passage from an early Saxon romance might throw light on
the eastern yogi's celebrated bed of nails, symbol of his submission to
the Goddess. Devotion to the Fates and their decrees often brought
forth a "passionate surrender" in both eastern and western mystics:
"This eagerness to submit to divine Fate inspired certain souls in days of
old with feelings so fervent as to recall the rapture of Christian
devotion, which burns to subject itself to the will of God." 3 Fate was
karma, a concept virtually identical with that of Weird.
Beowulf was written in a pagan era, but it received later Christian
additions. For instance, Beowulf said once that the Goddess Wyrd would determine the outcome of his battle; then he said that God would. The Triple Goddess was much opposed by churchmen of the
time. A 12th-century Bishop of Exeter scolded his people for inviting the Three Sisters into the house after a birth, to cast a good destiny
for the newborn, and making offerings to them on a table prepared "with three knives for the service of the fairies." 4
Nevertheless, the Fairy Godmothers or Weird Sisters continued to
be invited. Four centuries later in Tudor England, they were still
prayed to appear at the cradle of a newborn infant, "for to set to the babe what shall befall to him." 5

Wells
Springs, fountains, ponds, wells were always female symbols in
archaic religions, often considered water-passages to the underground womb, in northern Europe associated with Mother Hel, whose name
also gave rise to "holy" and "healing." Many pagan sacred springs throughout England received the name of Helen's Well during Christian times, and churchmen claimed all these wells were named
after Empress Helena, Constantine's sainted mother. But the real "Helen" was Hel, or Dame Holle, whose water-womb was called the source of all the children on earth. 1
There were also many wells named after the Goddesses Morgan
and Brigit. Coventina, "Mother of the Covens," was associated with
healing wells. Margaret, a traditional witch name, also designated wells
and springs. Lancashire legend speaks of a statue called Peg o' the
Well beside a formerly holy spring in Ribblesdale, said to claim a human sacrifice every seven years. 2 Ecclesiastical canons of the 10th century
1067



Werewolf expressly forbade "well-worshippings," but they continued
nonetheless. 5 The Danish poem Water ofLife drew on the pagan tradition of
resurrection through the Mother-symbol of a sacred well called Hileva (Hel-Eve). With this magic water, a divine queen put her
dismembered lover back together and made him live again, as Isis did for Osiris.4 The grotto and fountain of Lourdes once had a similar
pagan tradition, now revamped to the service of the church. In 1770 a curate of Brpmlield forbade pagan ceremonies, wakes,
and fairs at a spring calle<rHellywell (Hel's Well), to which site the ceremonies had been moved after they were evicted from the church
yard at a still earlier date. 5 The ceremonies had been going on for a
very long time. A medieval Life ofSt. Columba mentioned them in
connection with a fountain-shrine "famous among this heathen
people, which foolish men, blinded by the devil, worshipped as a
divinity."6 1. Rank, 73. 2. Phillips, 1 12, 160. 3. M. Harrison, 143. 4. Steenstrup, 186. 5. Hazlitt, 78. 6. Joyce 1 , 366.
Pausanias Creek traveler and geographer of the 2nd century a.d. Living in a time of
declining culture, he was inspired by a desire to describe the ancient sacred sites for
posterity.
Werewolf
Belief in the werewolf, or "spirit-wolf," probably began with earlymedieval wolf clans who worshipped their totemic gods in wolf form, as did some people of the Greco-Roman world centuries earlier. Zeus
Lycaeus, or Lycaeon, was a Pelasgian wolf-king who reigned in a nineyear cycle as spouse of the Ninefold Goddess, Nonacris. 1 Virgil said
the first werewolf was Moeris, spouse of the trinitarian Fate-goddess
(Moera), from whom he learned secrets of magic, including the necromantic knack of calling up the dead from their tombs. 2
Lycanthropy (werewolfism) was named for Apollo Lycaeus, "Wolfish Apollo," who used to be worshipped in the famous Ly
ceum or "Wolf-temple" where Socrates taught. 3 Apollo was mated to Artemis as a divine Wolf Bitch at Troezen, where she purified
Orestes with the blood of nine sacrificial victims. 4 Pausanias said Apollo
was originally an Egyptian deity, deriving his name from Up-Uat (Ap-ol), a very ancient name of Anubis. 5 (See Dog.) Another Roman version of the wolf god was Dis Pater, Soranus, or
Feronius, consort of the Sabine underground Goddess Feronia, "Mother of Wolves." A certain Roman family claimed descent from
her Sabine priestesses, and annually demonstrated her power by walking barefoot over glowing coals during the festival of the Feronia. 6
She was also identified with Lupa the She-Wolf, whose spirit purified
Palatine towns through the agency of young men in wolfskins, consecrated by participating in the Lupercalia or Festival of the SheWolf. 7
The She-Wolf was another aspect of the Triple Goddess, as
1068



shown by her triadic motherhood. She gave three souls to her son, Werewolf
the legendary King Erulus or Herulus, so that when he was overthrown
by Evander, he had to be killed three times. 8 The Amazons, who ^^^^^^^^^^^
worshipped the Triple Goddess, incorporated a tribe called the Neuri, who "turned themselves into wolves" for a few days each year during
their main religious festival, presumably by wearing wolf skins and masks. 9 The same story was told of a certain Irish tribe in Ossory,
who became wolf-people when attending their Yuletide feast, devouring the flesh of cattle as wolves, and afterward regaining their human
shape. "Giraldus Cambrensis relates this great wonder in detail, as in
operation in his own time, and believed every word of it." 10 The heathens' devotion to ancestral wolf gods in Teutonic Europe
is evinced by the popularity of such names as Wolf, Wulf, Wolfram, Wolfburg, Aethelwulf, Wolfstein, etc. "Beowulf son of Beowulf," hero of the Anglo-Saxon epic, was called Scyld by the Danes, who said he came from the waters in a basket like Romulus and Remus, foster-sons of the She-Wolf. 11
Irish tribes said their spiritual fathers were wolves, and for that
reason they wore wolf skins and used wolves' teeth for healing
amulets. Celtic folksongs tell of children or wives transformed into
wolves. One whole tribe was said to assume wolf shape very seventh
year. 12 As Germanic "berserkers" could become bears by donning
bearskins, so it was thought people could become wolves by donning
wolf pelts. 1? In Mercia during the 10th century a.d. there was a revival of
pagan learning under two druidic priests, one of whom was named Werwulf. 14 This name of "spirit-wolf
" seems to have been applied to
opponents of Christianity in general. About 1000 a.d., the word "werewolf" was taken to mean an outlaw. 15
South Slavs used to pass a newborn child through a wolfskin, saying it was thus born of the She-Wolf. After their conversion to
Christianity, the people claimed this ceremony would protect the child from witches. But its real purpose, obviously, was to assimilate the
child to the wolf totem via a second birth from the wolf. 16
Livonians said witches routinely transformed themselves into
wolves by passing through a certain magic pool, another instance of
baptismal rebirth in animal form. 17 Polish legend said a witch could
transform a bride and groom into wolves by laying a girdle of human
skin across the threshold at their wedding feast. Later they would
receive dresses of fur and would regain their human shape at will. 18
Against such totemic ceremonies the 7th-century Council of Toledo issued severe denunciations of people who put on the heads of beasts, or "make themselves into wild animals." 19
Italian peasants still say a man who sleeps outdoors on Friday under a full moon will be attacked by a werewolf, or will become one
himself. Friday was the night of the Goddess, and the warning against her lunar influence probably dated back to the myth of Endymion
1069



Werewolf
The werewolf was known to every Indo
European language: Danish var-ulf, Gothic
vaira-ulf, Old Norman wargus, Servian wlkoslak, Slovakian vlkodhk, Russian waw
kalak, Greek
vrykolaki, Romanian varcolaci, French loup-garou, Italian lupo manaro, German Wahr-Wdlffe." Shvk terms descended
from volkhvi, a title of
the shamans who
held important positions in tribal life before
Christianity. Cognates are German Volk, "people," and Russian
vrach, "physician"
indicating that werewolves were people: totemic healers in wolf masks. 24 Similar "medicine men" are still found among all
primitives.
("Seduced Moon-Man"), who fell asleep on her holy moon-mountain and became her enchanted bridegroom, never to wake up again, so the Goddess could shower her kisses on him each night. 20 Another story traceable to wolf-clan traditions was "Little Red
Riding Hood." The giveaway details are the red garment, the
offering of food to a "grandmother" in the deep woods a grandmother who wore a wolfskin and the cannibalistic motif of devouring and
resurrection. In Britain, "a red woven hood" was the distinguishing
mark of a prophetess or priestess. 21 The story's original victim would have been not the red-clad Virgin but the hunter, as Lord of the Hunt.
Like Snow White, Little Red Riding Hood was part of a VirginMother-Crone trinity, wearing the same red garment that Virgin Kali
wore; as the red moon of a lunar eclipse she prophesied catastrophe and inspired much fear. Romanian churchmen declared that the eclipsed moon was reddened by her own blood, shed when her wolves attacked her, to "make men repent and turn from evil." 22 The Gaulish Diana had numerous wolf-cultists among her votaries, in both ancient and medieval times. Under her totemic name of
Lupa she was a Mother of wild animals, and certain women seem to have impersonated her in southern France. A Provencal troubadour named Pierre Vidal wrote a love poem to a lady of Carcassonne, whose name was Loba, "She-Wolf":
When loup-garou the rabble call me,
When vagrant shepherds hoot, Pursue, and buffet me to boot, It doth not for a moment gall me,
I seek not palaces nor halls, Or refuge when the winter falls;
Exposed to winds and frosts at night,
My soul is ravaged with delight.
Me claims my she-wolfso divine;
And justly she that claim prefers,
For, by my troth, my life is hers More than another's, more than mine. 25
Lovers of the She-Wolf sometimes found her on a holy moun
tain, which the gypsies called Monte Lupo, Wolf-Mountain. Young
men could learn the secrets of magic by celebrating the sacred
marriage: masturbating over the Goddess's statue and ejecting semen on
it. She would guide and protect them, provided they never again set foot in a Christian church. 26 Her votaries' shape-shifting followed the
phases of the moon, which was another form of the Goddess herself.
In the 12th century, Gervais of Tilbury noted: "In England we often
see men changed into wolves at the changes of the moon." 27 Sacharow quoted an old Russian charm, to be spoken by one who wished to invoke the Moon-goddess and become a werewolf:
On the sea, on the ocean, on the island, on Bujan, on the empty pasture gleams the moon, on an ashstock lying in a green wood, in a gloomy
1070



vale. Toward the stock wandereth a shaggy wolf, horned cattle seeking for Werewolf his sharp white fangs; but the wolfenters not the forest, but the wolf
dives not into the shadowy vale. Moon, moon, gold-horned moon, check ^^_^^^_^^^^^
the flight ofbullets, blunt the hunters' knives, break the shepherds' cudgels, cast wild fear upon all cattle, on men, on all creeping things, that they may not catch the gray wolf, that they may not rend his warm
skin! My word is binding, more binding than sleep, more binding than the promise ofa hero. 28
This charm has a ring of peasant magic, suggesting a hungry poacher hoping to steal some fresh meat from the baron's herds, under
the protection of a wolfskin. Poaching the overlord's cattle or game
was punishable by death, which may account for the cruelty meted out to those accused of lycanthropy. One captured "werewolf" in France was so mauled that, a witness said, "he bore hardly any resemblance to a man, and struck with horror those who looked at him." The inquisi
tor, Pierre Boguet, explained that terrible injuries were common among werewolves, due to the many lacerations they suffered while running
through bramble bushes. 29
Another werewolf captured by the Inquisition in 1 598 was "pos
sessed by a demon" while in prison, which gave him such a thirst that
he drank a large tubful of water, so his belly was "distended and hard."
He refused to eat or drink any more, and soon died. 30 Translating this
official report into its probable reality, one would assume the unlucky
werewolf was subjected to the water torture and died of a ruptured stomach. Another unfortunate werewolf was Peter Stubb of Cologne, tor
tured until he confessed having transformed himself into a wolf by a
magic girdle given him by the devil. The judges couldn't find the girdle
where Stubb said he hid it, but they explained this by saying it had "gone to the Devil whence it came, so that it was not to be found."
Though his case was unproved, Stubb was nastily executed for the
crime of lycanthropy: he was sentenced to have the flesh pulled off his
bones in ten places with red-hot pincers, then to have his legs and arms broken with a wooden axe; finally to be beheaded and burned. 31 Yet another werewolf in 1 541 never even lasted long enough to go
to prison. His captors hacked off his arms and legs, claiming to be
searching for the wolf-hair that he wore on the inside of his skin. The
hair was not found, so the victim was declared innocent of lycan
thropy which did him little good, as he was already dead. 32
An often-repeated story concerned a lone man attacked at night by
a lone wolf, which he wounded, usually by cutting off a forepaw. Next day a woman would be found with her hand missing, which identified her as the werewolf. Such an incident was reported as fact
by Jean de Nynauld in 161 5; the woman in the case was burned alive. 33
The story probably recommended itself to some men as a perfect way
to dispose of a woman they had mistreated, such as a rape victim. On December 14, 1 598, a tailor of Chalons was sentenced to
1071



Wheel death for lycanthropy, having confessed to luring children into his
shop, murdering and eating them. Methods by which these confessions
were extracted from the man can only be guessed, because the judges ordered the court records burned. In 1 521 at Poligny, three men were induced by torture to say they had made themselves wolves with a
magic salve given them by the devil, and in wolf shape they had eaten
several children, and enjoyed sexual relations with wild she-wolves. 34
Gilles Gamier was a famous "lycanthrope" caught by the Inquisition, tortured and executed for having devoured children. The charge was not murder or cannibalism, but lycanthropy. 35 Whatever was left of the pagan wolf cults, it seems the Christian church molded the material
into the enduring legend of the werewolf.

Wheel
A primary Oriental symbol of the Goddess as ruler of Fate was the
karmic wheel, often identified with the wheel of the galaxy, the Milky
Way, or zodiac, circling the outer reaches of the universe around the
Goddess's yoni or omphalos (navel), her earth-centered hub. Tantric
tradition showed the wheel as a mandala centering on the three
totems of the Triple Goddess, the dove (Virgin-Creatress), serpent
(Mother-Preserver), and sow (Crone-Destroyer). 1 This mandala established "the six realms of the round of being," the sacred Hexagram.
Celts worshipped the karmic star-wheel as the emblem of Mother
Arianrhod, ancestress of "Aryans." Some said it was a great silver
wheel that dipped into the sea, on which heroes rode to Emania, the
Moon's land of death. 2
In Ethiopia the Goddess's image was placed in the center of a
wheel of flames, like Indian images of Kali. Christian myths depict
the early missionaries' destruction of her idol, which was called an old
woman with the power of the evil eye and with feet "like unto a wheel of fire." Jesus commanded: "Take this woman of the evil eye, and make up a fire, and carry her thereto, and throw her into it and
burn her." 3 Her ashes were to be scattered to the wind, for people
believed she might be resurrected from them, like the Phoenix, if
they remained in one place.
Destruction of the Wheel-goddess's image was the probable basis for the legend of St. Catherine, supposedly martyred on a wheel of fire, the famous "Catherine Wheel." There was no real St. Catherine,
1072



but there was a Goddess as Dancer of the Fiery Wheel, performing Wheel Kathakali Kali's "dance of time" at the hub of the universe. The
Kalacakra Tantra (Wheel of Time), which presents this image, is still ^^^^^^^^
the most revered text in India and Tibet, "coming at the head of the tannic section of the sacred canon." 4 See Catherine. Catherine was not the only medieval manifestation of the Goddess of the Wheel of Time, which was also the Wheel of Fortune
manipulated by the trinitarian Mother of Fate, Fortuna. In ancient Rome she was one of the emanations of Juno Februata, whose
festival was Christianized as St. Valentine's Day. Its symbol was a wheel
of six spokes formed of yonic mandorlas, in the Asiatic manner. 5 The
six spokes remained a sign of Juno well into the Christian era.6
In the 1 2th century, the Goddess and her wheel appeared in the Hortus deliciarum (Garden of Delights). Wheel windows of cathe
drals were connected with her, some showing human figures rising on one side of the wheel and falling on the other, like the Rota Fortuna
at the center of the Tarot's Major Trumps. "In these cathedral churches
and royal abbeys is Dame Fortune who turns topsy-turvy faster than a
windmill." Honorius of Autun said, "Philosophers tell us of a woman Wheel of Fortune
fastened to a wheel which turns perpetually, so that they say she is sometimes rising and sometimes falling with its movement. . . . The
woman fastened to the wheel is Fortune, whose head alternately rises
and falls." Here was the real St. Catherine: the Fate-goddess, wor
shipped by builders who incorporated their own secret symbols into the churches they built. Hugo pointed out that "Sometimes a porch, a
facade, or a whole church presents a symbolic meaning entirely foreign to worship, even inimical to the Church." 7
Boethius, a Gnostic philosopher whose writings were too popular to be ignored, was claimed as a Christian theologian; but his major work made no mention of Christ. He found his Consolation of
Philosophy in the visitation of his guardian Goddesses, Philosophia and Fortuna. The latter taught him her doctrine of the karmic wheel: "I
cause a rapid wheel to turn; I love to raise the fallen and abase the
proud. Mount, then, if thou wilt, but on condition that thou dost not wax indignant when the law that presides at my Games demands that thou shalt descend." 8
Fortuna, Goddess of the Wheel, may have been derived from a
pre-Roman Vortumna, "She Who Turns the Year." 9 Fate and Time were always linked in the thought of the ancients. Later Roman writers tried to masculinize this Goddess as a seasonal god, Vertum
nus; but they gave away "his" original character by saying he appeared in the guise of an old woman. The Goddess was worshipped in both beneficent and maleficent aspects as Bona Fortuna or Mala Fortuna,
represented in her temple on the Esquiline as an All-Seeing Eye in the form of a wheel. 10
As Fortuna Primigeneia, the Goddess of the Wheel was called the firstborn of the primal Mother Juno, and revered as the Virgin "who
1073



Wheel bestows on her worshippers every grace of body and every beauty of
soul." n She was identified with the Mazdean "Glory." From her, as
the Fortuna Augusti, Caesars drew their divine right to rule.
Her fiery wheel was associated with kingship in a more primitive,
direct way during the early Bronze Age, when sacred kings died within the wheel of rebirth, as shown by the legend of Ixion, a ruler of the Thessalian Lapiths. 12 Ixion was killed at the end of his term of
office, when he was rolled downhill, fastened inside a fiery wheel that
signified the sun. This sacred-king figure might be compared with the Norse deity Kris Kringle, a "Christ of the Wheel," personifying the dying and reborn sun of the winter solstice hence his later connec
tion with Christmas, even identification with Santa Claus. 13
Northern Europeans believed the mystic wheels of existence
stopped turning at the crucial transition from one year to the next,
during the darkest days of winter, when the sun came to its nadir. At this
time, during the season of Yule, all rotating motions were taboo. Cart wheels were not allowed to roll; butter could not be churned. 14 Yet at
the winter solstice and its corresponding point at the other side of the
rolling year, Midsummer Eve, fiery fate-wheels were set rolling from
British hilltops as late as the 19th century. "The Pagan rites of this
festival at the summer solstice, may be considered as a counterpart of
those used at the winter solstice at Yule-tide. . . . [T]he people imag
ine that all their ill-luck rolls away from them together with this
wheel." 15
Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, a 6th-century Christian mystic who pretended to be a lst-century bishop of Athens and was believed authentic for many centuries, declared that the class of angels called
Thrones were really Wheels, having the name of Gel, "which in the
Hebrew tongue signifies revolutions and revelations." 16 This image was
Oriental, drawn from the vision of eastern temples as gigantic world
chariots, complete with wheels, in which the god was enthroned. In his
chariot the god participated in the Carnival of Existence, carrying the
world along with all its teeming life forms: animals, plants, mountains, rivers. Upon identification with the god, the sages said, "He who has
seen his true self looks down upon transmigrating existence as upon a
rolling chariot-wheel." 17 Medieval processions sometimes took a circular form and went
round and round a public square or courtyard, this exhibition being
known as a carrousel, "a wheel of chariots." 18 The inclusion of its
model in the proceedings of carnivals and fairs bears out the probabil
ity of its pagan origin, for most of the traditional trappings of fairs were left over from the Old Religion, including the wheel of Fortune.
The very name of the Carnival came from old festivals of the
Goddess Carna, mother of "re-in-Carnations," the same cycles controlled by Kali's wheel of karma. The roulette or "little wheel"
evolved from the eastern prayer wheel. Its spirit was not only Dame
Fortune, but also Lady Luck, from Sanskrit Loka, a Divine Midwife
1074



guarding one of the planetary spheres or "ascending light planes of Whisper
experience." 19 Whistling Another carnival manifestation of the wheel was the Ferris Wheel, ^^^^^^^^^^^
a form of the Fairies' Wheel, descended from the Celtic Wheel of
Arianrhod. Riders of the Wheel represented pre-Christian "fairy folk" whose souls were involved in karmic cycles. The Dream ofKing
Arthur describes a Fairies' Wheel closely resembling the modern Ferris Wheel. 20

Whisper
The ancients believed that ghosts and spirits would speak in whispers.
Having been deprived of flesh, the dead spoke without laryngeal sound.
Nearly all supernatural beings were supposed to be identifiable by their whisper-voices, even God, according to 1 Kings 19:12 the "still small voice" of God speaking to Elijah was a mistranslation of a phase
meaning literally "a thin whisper." l Other biblical parallels are Job 4:16, the same word "whisper"
translated as a still voice; and Isaiah 29:4: "Thy voice shall be as one
that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall
whisper out of the dust." These passages indicate the practice of
ancient "spirit mediums" when purporting to be in communication
with the dead. Impersonating the spirit, they whispered, so the voice couldn't be identified.
In a medieval German legend, the Triple Goddess presided over a
land of the dead called Wisperthal (Valley of Whispers) centering on an enchanted Hall of Mirrors perhaps related to the fairy-tale Crystal Mountain. Three innocent youths once trespassed in the valley, met
various aspects of the Goddess as three beautiful maidens, three terrible
hags, and three black death-ravens. They barely escaped with their
lives from the eerie place and vowed never to return. 2

Whistling
An old rhyme says "Whistling girls and crowing hens never come to any good ends." It was true; women who whistled were suspected of
witchcraft. Whistling was a piece of sympathetic magic used to raise a wind. Becalmed sailors were allowed to "whistle for the wind," but
whistling women were believed to cause destructive storms. 1 There
fore it became "unladylike" for girls to whistle.

Widdershins
Counterclockwise, the direction of the moon, or "left-hand path" of
pagan dances (still prevalent in folk tradition). To open the door of a fairy hill, one must walk around it three times widdershins, as Childe
Rowland did, calling, "Open door!" The same Open Sesame appears in other ballads: "Thrice went fair Agnes the mountain round, and entered the cave beneath the ground." l As sacred caves once served as pagan temples, the medieval church forbade their use and claimed
that walking or turning one's self widdershins was an indicium of
witchcraft. 2 See Left Hand.

Willow
Water and willows represented the Goddess Helice, "Willow," virgin form of Hecate with her willow-withe grain-basket. 1 Willow wands invoked the Muses, whose mountain was encircled by the Helicon,
"Willow-stream." The Dionysian thyrsus, like the later witch's wand,
was willow. As Dionysus was once a major god of Jerusalem, the willow figured prominently in municipal ceremonies there. A "Great Day" of the Feast of Tabernacles was known as the Day of Willows,
with rites honoring fire and water. 2 Willow wands gave protection in the
underworld, where Orpheus carried one to show the way. 3 Willow
wands were sacred to the Moon-goddess as late as the 1 7th century a.d.,
when an English herbal said the moon owns the willow. Witches used willow bark to treat rheumatism and fevers; it was
the source of salicylic acid (aspirin), one of Hecate's cures. Some said
wicca or "witchcraft" evolved from a word meaning willow, cognate
with "wicker" (willow-withe weaving). Magic cats were supposed to grow from pussy-willows or "catkins," to become witches' malkins
(familiars): hence the saying that all cats were gray in the beginning.
The catkins were harbingers of spring, appearing on the willow as
graymalkins. (See Cat.)

Witch
There were many other words for witches, such as Incantatrix,
Lamia, Saga, Maga, Malefica, Sortilega, Strix, Venefica. 3 In Italy a
witch was a Strega or Janara, an old title of a priestess of Jana (Juno). 4 English writers called witches both "hags" and "fairies," words which
were once synonymous. 5 Witches had metaphoric titles: bacularia, "stick-rider"; fascinatrix, "one with the evil eye"; herberia, "one who
gathers herbs"; strix, "screech-owl"; pixidria, "keeper of an ointment
1076



box"; femina saga, "wise-woman"; lamia, "night-monster"; incantator, "worker of charms"; magus, "wise-man"; sortiariae mulier, "seeress"; veneficia, "poisoner"; maliarda, "evil-doer." Latin treatises called witch
es anispex, auguris, divinator, januatica, ligator, mascara, phitonissa,
stregula. 6 Dalmatian witches were krstaca, "crossed ones," a derivative of the
Greek Christos. 1 In Holland a witch was wijsseggher, "wise-sayer," from which came the English "wiseacre." 8 The biblical passage that
supported centuries of persecution, "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to
live" (Exodus 22:18), used the Hebrew word kasaph, translated "witch"
although it means a seer or diviner.9
Early medieval England had female clan-leaders who exercised
matriarchal rights in lawgiving and law enforcement; the Magna Carta of Chester called them iudices de wich judges who were
witches. 10 Female elders once had political power among the clans,
but patriarchal religion and law gradually took it away from them and called them witches in order to dispose of them. In 1711 Addison
observed that "When an old woman begins to doat and grow chargeable
to a Parish, she is generally turned into a witch." u
Scot remarked that the fate of a witch might be directly proportion
al to her fortune. The pope made saints out of rich witches, but poor
witches were burned. 12 Among many examples tending to support this opinion was the famous French Chambre Ardente affair, which
involved many members of the aristocracy and the upper-class clergy in a witch cult. Numerous male and female servants were tortured and
burned for assisting their masters in working witchcraft; but in all the
four years the affair dragged on, no noble person was tortured or
executed. 13
Illogically enough, the authorities persecuted poor, outcast folk as witches, yet professed to believe witches could provide themselves
with all the wealth anyone could want. Reginald Scot, a disbeliever, scornfully observed that witches were said to "transfer their neigh
bors' corn into their own ground, and yet are perpetual beggars, and
cannot enrich themselves, either with money or otherwise: who is so
foolish as to remain longer in doubt of their supernatural powers?
"H
Witchcraft brought so little profit to Helen Jenkenson of Northants, hanged in 1612 for bewitching a child, that the record of her execution
said: "Thus ended this woman her miserable life, after she had lived
many years poor, wretched, scorned and forsaken of the world." 15
The nursery-rhyme stereotype of the witch owed much to Scot's
description:
Women which be commonly old, lame, blear-eyed, pale, foul, and full of
wrinkles; poor, sullen, superstitious, and papists; or such as know no religion; in whose drowsy minds the devil hath gotten a fine seat; so as,
what mischief, mischance, calamity, or slaughter is brought to pass, they are easily persuaded the same is done by themselves. . . . They are

Skeat's Etymological Dictionary derived "witch" from medi
eval English wicche, formerly Anglo-Saxon wicca, masculine, or wicce, feminine: a
corruption of witga, short form of witega, a seer or diviner; from
Anglo-Saxon witan, to see, to know. Similarly, Icelandic vitki, a
witch, came from vita, to know; or vizkr, clever or knowing one. Wizard came from Norman French wischard, Old French
guiscart, sagacious one. 1 The surname Whittaker came from
Witakarlege, a wizard or a witch. 2 The words "wit" and "wisdom" came from the same roots.

Persecutors said it was heretical to consider witches harmless.
Even in England, where witches were not burned but hanged, some
authorities fearfully cited the "received opinion" that a witch's body should be burned to ashes to prevent ill effects arising from her blood. 1
'
Churchmen assured the arresting officers that a witch's power was
lost the instant she was touched by an employee of the Inquisition; but the employees themselves were not so sure. 18
Numerous stories depict the persecutors' fear of their victims. It
was said in the Black Forest that a witch blew in her executioner's
face, promising him his reward; the next day he was afflicted with a fate
leprosy. Inquisitors' handbooks directed them to wear at all times a
bag of salt consecrated on Palm Sunday; to avoid looking in a witch's
eyes; and to cross themselves constantly in the witches' prison. Peter
of Berne forgot this precaution, and a captive witch by enchantment
made him fall down a flight of stairs which he proved later by
torturing her until she confirmed it. 19
Any unusual ability in a woman instantly raised a charge of witchcraft. The so-called Witch of Newbury was murdered by a
group of soldiers because she knew how to go "surfing" on the river.
Soldiers of the Earl of Essex saw her doing it, and were "as much
astonished as they could be," seeing that "to and fro she fleeted on the
board standing firm bolt upright . . . turning and winding it which
way she pleased, making it pastime to her, as little thinking who
perceived her tricks, or that she did imagine that they were the last she ever should show." Most of the soldiers were afraid to touch her,
but a few brave souls ambushed the board-rider as she came to shore,
slashed her head, beat her, and shot her, leaving her "detested carcass fo the worms." 20
From ruthlessly organized persecutions on the continent, witchhunts in England became largely cases of village feuds and petty
spite. If crops failed, horses ran away, cattle sickened, wagons broke, women miscarried, or butter wouldn't come in the churn, a witch was always found to blame. Marion Cumlaquoy of Orkney was burned in 1643 for turning herself three times widdershins, to make her
neighbor's barley crop rot. A tailor's wife was executed for quarrelling with her neighbor, who afterward saw a snake on his property, and his children fell sick. One witch was condemned for arguing with a
drunkard in an alehouse. After drinking himself into paroxysms of
vomiting, he accused her of bewitching him, and he was believed. 21
A woman was convicted of witchcraft for having caused a neigh
bor's lameness by pulling off her stockings. Another was executed for having admired a neighbor's baby, which afterward fell out of its cradle and died. Two Glasgow witches were hanged for treating a sick child, even though the treatment succeeded and the child was
1078



cured. Joan Cason of Kent went to the gallows in 1 586 for having dry
thatch on her roof. Her neighbor, whose child was sick, was told by an
unidentified traveler that the child was bewitched, and it could be
proved by stealing a bit of thatch from the witch's roof and throwing it
on the fire. If it crackled and sparked, witchcraft was assured. The test
came out positive, and the court was satisfied enough to convict poor
Joan. 22 Witches were convenient scapegoats for doctors who failed to cure
their patients, for it was the "received" belief that witch-caused
illnesses were incurable. Weyer said, "Ignorant and clumsy physicians blame all sicknesses which they are unable to cure or which they have
treated wrongly, on witchery." There were also priests and monks who "claim to understand the healing art and they lie to those who seek
help that their sicknesses are derived from witchery." 23 Most real witch
persecutions reflect "no erotic orgies, no Sabbats or elaborate rituals;
merely the hatreds and spites of narrow peasant life assisted by vicious
laws." 24
Witches provided a focus for sexist hatred in male-dominated
society, as Stanton pointed out:
The spirit ofthe Church in its contempt for women, as shown in the
Scriptures, in Paul's epistles and the Pentateuch, the hatred ofthe fathers, manifested in their ecclesiastical canons, and in the doctrines of
asceticism, celibacy, and witchcraft, destroyed man 's respect for woman
and legalized the burning, drowning, and torturing of women. . . . Women and their duties became objects ofhatred to the Christian
missionaries and ofalternate scorn and fear to pious ascetics and
monks. The priestess mother became something impure, associated with
the devil, and her lore an infernal incantation, her very cooking a brewing ofpoison, nay, her very existence a source ofsin to man. Thus woman, as mother and priestess, became woman as witch. . . . Here is the reason why in all the Biblical researches and higher criticism, the scholars never touch the position of women. 25
Men displayed a lively interest in the physical appearance of witches, seeking to know how to recognize them as men also craved
rules for recognizing other types of women from their physical
appearance. It was generally agreed that any woman with dissimilar eyes was a witch. Where most people had dark eyes and swarthy complex
ions, as in Spain and Italy, pale blue eyes were associated with
witchcraft. Many claimed any woman with red hair was a witch. 26
This may have been because red-haired people are usually freck
led, and freckles were often identified as "witch marks," as were
moles, warts, birthmarks, pimples, pockmarks, cysts, liver spots, wens, or any other blemish. Some witch-finders said the mark could resemble
an insect bite or an ulcer. 27
No one ever explained how the witch mark differed from an
ordinary blemish. Since few bodies were unblemished, the search for
the mark seldom failed. Thomas Ady recognized this, and wrote: "Very

Anselm (1870).
few people in the world are without privy marks upon their bodies, as
moles or stains, even such as witchmongers call the devil's privy marks." 28 But no one paid attention to this. Trials were conducted with as much injustice as possible. In 1629
Isobel Young was accused of crippling by magic a man who had quarrelled with her, and causing a water mill to break down. She protested that the man was lame before their quarrel, and water mills
can break down through neglect. The prosecutor, Sir Thomas Hope, threw out her defense on the ground that it was "contrary to the
libel," that is, it contradicted the charge. 29 When a witch is on trial, Scot said, any "equivocal or doubtful answer is taken for a confession." 30
On the other hand, no answer at all was a confession too.
Witches who refused to speak were condemned: "Witchcraft proved by
silence of the accused." 31 Sometimes mere playfulness "proved" witchcraft, as in the case of Mary Spencer, accused in 1634 because she
merrily set her bucket rolling downhill and ran before it, calling it to follow her. 32 Sometimes women were stigmatized as witches when they
were in fact victims of unfair laws, such as the law that accepted any man's word in court ahead of any number of women's. A butcher in
Germany stole some silver vessels from women, then had them
prosecuted for witchcraft by claiming that he found the vessels in the
woods where the women were attending a witches' sabbat. 33
Sometimes the accusation of witchcraft was a form of punishment
for women who were too vocal about their disillusionment with men
and their preference for living alone. Historical literature has many
references to "the joy with which women after widowhood set up
their own households, and to the vigor with which they resisted being
courted by amorous widowers." 34 The solitary life, however, left a woman even more vulnerable to accusations of witchcraft, since men
usually thought she must be somehow controlled. Those who tortured the unfortunate defendant into admitting
witchcraft used a euphemistic language that showed the victim was condemned a priori. One Anne Marie de Georgel denied making a
devil's pact, until by torture she was "justly forced to give an account
of herself," the record said. Catherine Delort was "forced to confess by
the means we have power to use to make people speak the truth," and she was "convicted of all the crimes we suspected her of commit
ting, although she protested her innocence for a long time." The
inquisitor Nicholas Remy professed a pious astonishment at the great number of witches who expressed a "positive desire for death,"
pretending not to notice that they had been brought to this desire by innumerable savage tortures. 35 See Torture.
The extent to which pagan religion, as such, actually survived among the witches of the 16th and 17th centuries has been much discussed but never decided. Dean Church said, "Society was a long
time unlearning heathenism; it has not done so yet; but it had hardly
begun, at any rate it was only just beginning, to imagine the possibility
1080



of such a thing in the eleventh century." In 1 5th-century Bohemia it Witchcraft was still common practice at Christmas and other holidays to make
offerings to "the gods," rather than to God. 35 European villages still ^^^^^^^^^^
had many "wise-women" who acted as priestesses officially or unofficially. Since church fathers declared Christian priestesses
unthinkable, all functions of the priestess were associated with pagan
ism. 37 Bishops described pagan gatherings in their dioceses, attended by "devils ... in the form of men and women." 38 Pagan ceremonies
were allowed to survive in weddings, folk festivals, seasonal rites, feasts of the dead, and so on. 39 But when women or Goddesses played
the leading role in such ceremonies, there was more determined
suppression. John of Salisbury wrote that it was the devil, "with God's
permission," who sent people to gatherings in honor of the Queen of the Night, a priestess impersonating the Moon-goddess under the name of Noctiluca or Herodiade. 40 The Catholic church applied the word "witch" to any woman who
criticized church policies. Women allied with the 14th-century
Reforming Franciscans, some of whom were burned for heresy, were
described as witches, daughters of Judas, and instigated of the Devil.41 Writers of the Talmud similarly tended to view nearly all women as
witches. They said things like, "Women are naturally inclined to witchcraft," and "The more women there are, the more witchcraft
there will be." 42
Probably there were few sincere practitioners, compared with the multitudes who were railroaded into the ecclesiastical courts and
legally murdered despite their innocence. Yet it was obvious to even the
moderately intelligent that Christian society deliberately humiliated and discriminated against women. Some may have been resentful enough to become defiant. "Women have had no voice in the canon
law, the catechisms, the church creeds and discipline, and why should
they obey the behests of a strictly masculine religion, that places the
sex at a disadvantage in all life's emergencies?" 43 Possibilities for
expressing their frustration and defiance were severely limited; but
voluntary adoption of the witch's reputation and behavior was surely
among such possibilities.

Witchcraft
irly in the Middle Ages, almost anything women did could be
described as witchcraft because their daily lives invoked the Goddess
1081



Witchcraft with a thousand small ceremonies as well as the larger ones connect
ed with major holidays. Martin of Braga said women must be
^^^^^^^^^ condemned for "decorating tables, wearing laurels, taking omens
^^^^^^^"" from footsteps, putting fruit and wine on the log in the hearth, and
bread in the well, what are these but worship of the devil? For women to call upon Minerva when they spin, and to observe the day of
Venus at weddings and to call upon her whenever they go out upon the public highway, what is that but worship of the devil?" l
Outside the official religion, where they were kept, women passed
down their private family recipes and charms, curses and blessings,
telling traditional tales of the past and foretelling the future from omens
and "signs." The Dominican Johann Herolt declared: "Most women belie their catholic faith with charms and spells, after the fashion of Eve
their first mother, who believed the devil speaking through the serpent rather than God himself. . . . [A]ny woman by herself knows more of such superstitions and charms than a hundred men." 2
Up to the 1 5th century, women's "charms and spells" were
virtually the only repository of practical medicine. Churchmen avoided doctoring, on the ground that all sickness came from demonic
possession, and the only permissible cure was exorcism. 3 Europe's traditional witch doctors were women: clan mothers,
priestesses of healing shrines, midwives, nurses, vilas. In pre-Christian Gaul and Scandinavia, medicine was entirely in the hands of women.4
Even in the Christian era, the village wise-woman was still every
peasant's family doctor. Paracelsus said witches taught him everything he knew about healing. 5 Dr. Lambe, the Duke of Buckingham's famous "devil," was said to have learned secrets of medicine by
consorting with witches.6
In 1 570 the gaoler of Canterbury Castle released a condemned
witch, citing the popular opinion that she did more good for the sick with her homely remedies than all the priests' prayers and exorcisms. 7
Agrippa von Nettesheim thought witches superior to male practitio
ners: "Are not philosophers, mathematicians, and astrologers often inferior to country women in their divinations and predictions, and
does not the old nurse very often beat the doctor?" 8 The men who
learned doctoring from witches were allowed to practice, but their
female teachers were persecuted. Scot observed that a male "conjurer"
was permitted to cure disease by magic arts, whereas a woman was condemned to death for doing so.9
Ordinary folk had no doctors. Physicians were available chiefly to
the rich. The poor took their troubles to the local witch. Irish farmers
still say a "fairy doctor" is needed for charms against the evil eye. In
Greece, "both priests and witches are available for emergencies
created by the evil eye. The priest burns incense and recites appropriate
prayers. The witch also burns incense as she recites appropriate incantations." 10
It wasn't unusual for the witches' healing charms to be preferred
1082



to those of the church, or for the two to be regarded as identical in Witchcraft
essence. Ramesey wrote that the witches' cures were indistinguish
able from the "magical and juggling cures" professed by the clergy, ^^^^^^^^^^^
including "saints, images, relics, holy-waters, shrines, avemarys, cru
cifixes, benedictions, charms, characters, sigils of the planets, and of the signs ... all such cures are rather to be ascribed to the forces of the
imagination, than any virtue in them." n
Officially, women were often forbidden to do any kind of healing.
In 1322 a woman named Jacoba Felicie was arrested and prosecuted
by the medical faculty of the University of Paris for practicing medicine, although, the record said, "she was wiser in the art of surgery and
medicine than the greatest master or doctor in Paris." 12
Scot said witchmongers gave the witches as much power as Christ, and even more, when they claimed witches could raise the dead, as
Christ raised Lazarus; they could turn water into other fluids, like wine
or milk; they could control the weather, the crops, animals, men; they could see into the past and future. Reading of witches' trials, he said,
"you shall see such impossibilities confessed, as none, having his right
wits, will believe." n Loher also declared that the "sins" for which
witches were brought to the stake were such "that they could not possibly commit." 14
Churchmen, however, viewed the impossibility of witches' miracles as perfectly good ground for believing them, "because the performance of the impossible proved that demons were at work." 15 It was never explained how the performance of a miracle demonstrated
the intervention of a saint in one case and of a demon in another. For
example, Marie Bucaille was burned as a witch, though her "mir
acles" were saintlike: she healed the sick, saw holy visions, displayed
stigmata, and performed many of the acts that led to canonization in other cases. 16
The same acts were differently interpreted by churchmen in different times. Witchcraft was allowed through the first half of the
Christian era. It was not called a "heresy" until the 14th century. In 500
a.d. the Franks' Salic Law recognized witches' right to practice. In
643, an edict declared it illegal to burn witches. 17 In 785, the Synod of Paderborn said anyone who burned a witch must be sentenced to
death. 18 France's first trial to declare witchcraft a crime took place in 1390. 19
Up to a surprisingly late date, nobility and clergy alike employed the services of witches. In 1382 the Count of Kyburg hired a witch to stand on the battlements of his castle and raise a thunderstorm to
disperse an army of enemies. 20 This practice was soundly based on
theological opinion that witches could raise storms at will, "either upon sea or land." 21 Churchmen said witches controlled the weather "with
God's permission," and they didn't begin to punish what God permitted until the beginning of the Renaissance. 22
Witches were summoned to court by Louis d'Orleans to cure his
1083



Witchcraft brother's madness, after priestly exorcisms had failed. (The witches
also failed.) Guichard, Bishop of Troyes, used the classic pierced-puppet
kind of witchcraft to kill his enemy, Queen Blanche of Navarre. 23 English law was fairly tolerant of witchcraft until the reign of
James I. As late as 1371 a male witch was arrested in Southwark for
possessing magical articles: a skull, a grimoire, and a corpse's head for
divination. He was released after he had promised not to do it again. 24
In 1 560, a lenient period, eight men confessed to conjuration and
sorcery, and were released with a reprimand. Only three years later the
same acts were made punishable by imprisonment or a death penalty. 25 The Council of Treves in 1 3 10 outlawed conjurations, divina
tions, and love potions. 26 Further prohibitions seemed to be aimed at supporting husbands who wished to cast off their wives. Stringent laws
threatened a witch to whom an abandoned wife might apply, for revenge through malefica, since she had no recourse under law. 27
The church distinguished between sorcery, which was generally acceptable, and witchcraft, which was heresy. Von Nettesheim's books of sorcery were published under church auspices, accompanied by a statement of ecclesiastical approval; indeed, his instructor in magic had been John Trithemius, an abbot. What the distinction between sorcery
and witchcraft boiled down to was that men could practice magic,
women could not. 28 When the church discovered that common folk couldn't under
stand the doctrinal subtleties of heresy and didn't care about theological arguments, persecution was extended into areas that were accessible to the public mind, so the church could maintain its control of that mind.
For example, in the region of Bonn a late spring frost of 1610 ruined
crops and was officially described as an act of God. Twenty years later, after the witch judges came to the area, the same kind of natural
disasters were blamed exclusively on witches. 29 Churchmen fostered the public delusion that witches were en
gaged in a vast secret plot, under the devil's guidance, to overthrow the
kingdom of God on earth. They created and embellished the concept of
the black mass, and made laymen believe it frequently occurred,
whereas it was largely a fraud supported only by spurious "evidence" from the torture chamber. The Inquisition needed this public delusion, because the work it was created for was finished when the Albigensian,
Waldensian, and other heretic groups of the south of France had been
finally crushed. In order to continue its profitable existence, the Inquisition needed new victims. The witchcraft mania was the solution to its
problem. 50 Whatever secular crimes the witches were supposed to have
committed, the one crime that was decisive in sending all of them to the
stake was the one crime of which all of them were completely innocent,
because it was impossible: the crime of collaborating with a real devil.
As for secret continuation of a pre-Christian religion: that was more
often done by the church itself, in the guise of saint-worship, festivals,
healing shrines, etc.
1084



Scholars aren't sure how much pagan religion survived in the form
of actual group worship, at the beginning of the era of persecution. Pico della Mirandola's La Strega (The Witch) described a cult in northern
Italy where a pagan Goddess presided over sexual orgies; she was said to bear a close resemblance to the Mother of God. 31 Another group at
Arras was said to have centered on "a prostitute" called Demiselle, or The Maiden. Her consort was the Abbot of Little Sense, otherwise
known as the Prince of Fools, a composer and singer of popular songs in other words, it was a cult of minstrelsy. 52 (See Romance.) There is a vast body of "information" about what went on at the
witches' Sabbat all of it worthless, because its source was the torture
chamber. The late Renaissance saw a frivolous interest in "black
masses" among the wealthy, who tried to model a new cult group on
what they had read of earlier trials. In 1610, Pierre de l'Ancre wrote of
"great Lords and Ladies and other rich and powerful ones who handle
the great matters of the Sabbath, where they appear cloaked, and the women with masks, that they may keep themselves always hidden and unknown." 33 In the reign of Louis XIV, half the Parisian clergy and
most of the court, including Madame de Montespan, were involved with a society witch called La Voisin, who staged black masses for
them. 34 But their rituals were based on ecclesiastical literature, not on a
true folk tradition.
It has been claimed that witchcraft constituted a coherent under
ground organization from the beginning, with well-defined chains of command and communication. "Witch books" purporting to come
from the ancient tradition speak of a Brotherhood (not Sisterhood): "If
you are condemned, fear not, the Brotherhood is powerful, they will help you to escape if you stand steadfast. ... Be sure, if steadfast you go
to the pyre, drugs will reach you, you will feel naught. You but go to death and what lies beyond, the Ecstasy of the Goddess." 35 But during
the real persecutions, few witches seemed indifferent to their sufferings,
and virtually none escaped. Monstrelet described a typical early example of persecution in 1459.
In this year, in the town ofArras and county ofArtois, arose, through a terrible and melancholy chance, an opinion called, I know not why, the
Religion of Vaudoisie. This sect consisted, it is said, ofcertain persons, both men and women, who, under cloud ofnight, by the power of the
devil, repaired to some solitary spot, amid woods and deserts, where the devil appeared before them in a human form save that his visage is
never perfectly visible to them read to the assembly a book ofhis
ordinances, informing them how he could be obeyed; distributed a very little money and a plentiful meal, which was concluded by a scene of
general profligacy; after which each one of the party was conveyed home to her or his own habitation.
On accusations ofaccess to such acts ofmadness, several creditable persons of the town ofArras were seized and imprisoned along with some
foolish women and persons oflittle consequence. These were so horribly

Witchcraft tortured that some ofthem admitted the truth ofthe whole accusations,
and said, besides, that they had seen and recognized in their nocturnal
assembly many persons ofrank, prelates, seigneurs, and governors of
bailliages and cities, being such names as the examiners had suggested to
the persons examined, while they constrained them by torture to impeach
the persons to whom they belonged. Several of those who had been thus
informed against were arrested, thrown into prison, and tortured for so long a time that they also were obliged to confess what was charged
against them. After this those ofmean condition were executed and
inhumanly burnt, while the richer and more powerful of the accused ransomed themselves by sums ofmoney, to avoid the punishment and the shame attending it. Many even of those also confessed being persuaded to take that course by the interrogators, who promised them indemnity for life and fortune. Some there were, ofa truth, who suffered with marvellous patience and constancy the torments inflicted on them, and would
confess nothing imputed to their charge; but they, too, had to give large sums to the judges, who exacted that such ofthem as, notwithstanding their mishandling, were still able to move, should banish themselves from
that part of the country. . . . fl]t ought not to be concealed that the whole accusation was a strategem of wicked men for their own covetous
purposes, and in order, by these false accusations and forced confessions,
to destroy the life, fame, and fortune of wealthy persons. *6
Those prisoners who found themselves condemned to death
immediately shrieked aloud that they had been tricked; they were
promised a light sentence, such as a pilgrimage, if they confessed as the inquisitors wanted. 57
Witchcraft persecutions picked up momentum when inquisitors
were seeking new victims to keep their organization going. In 1375 a French inquisitor lamented that all the rich heretics had been extermi
nated; there were none left whose wealth could support the
Inquisition, and "it is a pity that so salutary an institution as ours should
be so uncertain of its future." Then Pope John XXII empowered the
Inquisition to prosecute anyone who worked magic, and "the Inquisi
tion slowly and unevenly developed its concept of witchcraft." w Soon the church was making sweeping claims, such as the claim that the entire population of Navarre consisted of witches. 59
Witch hunting sustained itself because it became a major industry,
supporting the income of many. Local nobles, bishops, kings, judges,
courts, townships, magistrates, and other functionaries high and low all received a share of the loot collected by inquisitors from their victims'
assets. Victims were charged for the very ropes that bound them and the
wood that burned them. Each procedure of torture carried its fee.
After the execution of a wealthy witch, officials usually treated them
selves to a banquet at the expense of the victim's estate. 40
Inquisitors were no less zealous in wringing the last penny out of
their poorer victims than in helping themselves to the estates of the
rich. In 1256, a woman named Raymonde Barbaira died before her
sentence could be carried out, leaving to her heirs a chest of linens,
1086



her clothes, several cows, and four sous in cash. The inquisitor demand- Witchcraft
ed from the heirs forty sous for all the property. "Such petty and
vulgar details," Lea said, "give us a clearer insight into the spirit and ^^^mmmmmm
working of the Inquisition, and of the grinding oppression which it
exercised on the subject populations." 41 A history of the Inquisition written by a Catholic in 1909 had to
admit that it "invented the crime of witchcraft and . . . relied on torture
as the means of proving it." At first the Inquisition encountered
skepticism everywhere. Even theologians shocked the inquisitors by attributing natural disasters to chance, or God, rather than to witch
craft. The public disbelieved witches' confessions, saying they were
extracted only by torture. Peasants in some subalpine valleys broke
into open rebellion against the judges' wholesale burnings. It took
decades of ceaseless propagandizing, and ruthless measures to stop
the mouths of critics, before the persecution could be said to have won
public support.42 Severe persecution dated from the bull of Pope Innocent VIII,
Summis desiderantes, wherein God's vicar "infallibly" declared that
witches could blast crops and domestic animals, cause disease, prevent
husbands and wives from copulating, and in general "outrage the
Divine Majesty and are a cause of scandal and danger to very many." 43
The Divine Majesty being apparently unable to look after its own interests without human help, the churchmen took it upon themselves
to carry out God's vengeance, which developed into a "hideous nightmare" as the church's mailed fist stretched over the western world
for five centuries.44
The earlier Canon Episcopi ruled that witchcraft was nothing but
a delusion, and it was heresy to believe in it. But that was before the
church discovered how to profit from the witchcraft belief. After Pope
Innocent's reign, it was heresy not to believe in witchcraft. According
to Martin Del Rio, S.J., anyone who thought witchcraft was only a deception must be suspected of being a witch. No one was allowed to
speak against the extermination of witches. Inquisitor Heinrich von Schultheis said, "He who opposes the extermination of the witches
with one single word can not expect to remain unscathed." 45
Superstitious belief in the "evil" of witchcraft persisted to a very
late date. The last English witch trial took place in 1712. The last
official witch burning in Scotland was in 1727, with unofficial incidents
even later. Only a century ago, an elderly woman in the Russian village of Wratschewe was locked in her cottage and set afire for
bewitching cattle. Her murderers were tried, and sentenced only to a
light ecclesiastical penance.46 In January, 1928, a family of Hungarian
peasants beat an old woman to death, claiming she was a witch. A
court acquitted them, on the ground that they acted out of "irresistible
compulsion." 47 The real reason for persistence of the witchcraft idea was that
Christian authorities couldn't let it die, without admitting that God's
1087



Witchcraft word was wrong, and God's servants had committed millions of legal
murders and tortured millions of helpless people without cause. Dr.
Blackstone, England's ultimate authority on jurisprudence, wrote: "To
deny the possibility, nay, actual existence of Witchcraft and Sorcery,
is at once flatly to contradict the revealed Word of God in various
passages both of the Old and New Testament; and the thing itself is a truth to which every Nation in the World hath in its turn borne
testimony." When skepticism about witchcraft seemed to be on the
rise, John Wesley cried bitterly, "The giving up of witchcraft is in effect
the giving up of the Bible." 48 Calvin and Knox also protested that
denial of witchcraft meant denial of the Bible's authority.49 Joseph Glanvill, chaplain to Charles II, said all who disbelieved in witchcraft
were atheists. 50
Despite such protests, skepticism grew with the slow advance of the Age of Enlightenment. In 1736, Scottish laws against the "crime" of witchcraft were formally repealed. Yet the church refused to
keep pace with the law. Forty years later, ministers of the Associated
Presbytery passed a resolution declaring their unabated belief in witch
craft. 51 As late as the 1920s a rector of four parishes in Norfolk could
still write: "If I were to take a census of opinion in all four villages I am
certain that I should find a majority of people seriously professing belief in witchcraft, the policy of the 'evil eye,' and the efficacy of both
good and evil spells." 52 The churches wouldn't let these beliefs die.
Christianity, then, has been chiefly responsible for the survival and growth of witchcraft as an article of faith. It seems so still. In the
1940s, Seabrook estimated that "half the literate white population in the
world today believe in witchcraft"; and the nonliterate nonwhite
population attains a much higher proportion. 53 A Gallup poll taken in 1978 showed that ten percent of all Americans believe in witches. 54
But what is meant by "believe in"? It could mean a belief that
there are people who call themselves witches; this is self-evident
enough. It could mean a belief that such people erroneously think they
have supernatural powers. It could mean a belief that such people
really do have supernatural powers. It could mean a belief that, as the
church has always maintained, witches are agents of the devil, seeking to destroy the world out of sheer perversity. Or, it could mean a belief
that witches preserved an older and better religion based on worship of Nature and the female principle. Those who now call themselves witches usually uphold some
version of the latter belief. A modern witch, Leo Louis Martello,
says:
We worship and identify with the Horned God, Lord ofthe Hunt and the
Underworld, and the Mother Goddess, especially the latter (Mother Earth, Mother Nature). Without the female principle (women) man wouldn 't be here. . . . Witchcraft is a pre-Christian faith. . . . It tends to be matriarchal whereas both Christianity and Satanism are patriarchal and
urn



male chauvinist. The latter two are merely opposite sides of the same Witchcraft
coin. Witchcraft, as the Old Religion, is a coin ofa different vintage,
predating both. 55 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Asked how he feels about belonging to a heavily matriarchal tradition, one male witch answered: "I'd rather be first mate on a ship
that is solid than captain on a ship that has a rotten hull, a ship that is
sinking. Patriarchy is such a ship." Witches have defined patriarchy as "manipulative and domineering." The matriarchal world view, on the other hand, values "feelings of connectedness and intuition . . .
nonauthoritarian and nondestructive power relationships." It is claimed that witchcraft tends to correct what W. Holman Keith called
the fundamental religious error of our time: "to substitute force as the
divine and ruling principle in place of beauty and love, to make
destruction, in which the prowess of the male excels, more important in life than the creativity of the female." 56
Certainly the history of witchcraft shows men persecuting women
in order to maintain a male monopoly of profitable enterprises, such as medicine and magic. Women of outstanding reputation in any field were at risk, since almost any woman's accomplishment could be defined as witchcraft. When the church declared war on female healers,
healing became a crime punishable by death if it was practiced by a woman. Women were forbidden to study medicine, and "if a woman dare to cure without having studied, she is a witch and must die." 57
Doctors eagerly participated in witch hunts, to eliminate their competition. It was all done very deliberately. "Given the number of instances in which the church combined with various economic groups
from doctors to lawyers to merchant guilds, not only to make
pronouncements about the incapacities of women, but often to accom
plish the physical liquidation of women through witchcraft and heresy trials, one can hardly say that it all happened without anyone intending
it." 58
Churchmen who availed themselves of witches' services some
times persecuted even those who helped them, in remarkable
examples of ingratitude. Alison Peirsoun of Byrehill was so famous as a
healing witch that the archbishop of St. Andrews sent for her when he was sick, and she cured him. Later he not only refused to pay her fee,
but had her arrested, charged with witchcraft and burned. 59
The muddy illogic of persecutors' sexist thinking is nowhere better illustrated than in the notion of the witch's "poppet," or wax doll,
which could be mistreated by piercing or melting in order to make a
human victim suffer corresponding stabbing pains, fevers, and other troubles. When the witch destroyed the doll altogether, the victim
would die. Yet oddly enough, when male authorities discovered the
doll and destroyed it, the victim would not die but would recover. A
similar sexist attitude was apparent in the whole idea of traffic
between human beings and demons. Burton's Criminal Trials of
1089



Witchcraft Scotland stated that a male sorcerer is the master of demons, but a
female witch is the slave of demons. 60 Yet her offense was usually
^^^^^^^^i^^ considered more punishable than his.
Modern witches, male and female, seem inclined to restore the
sexual balance of old romances, where men's magical skills were acquired under feminine instruction.61 The witches appear to be recon
structing an old religion in a new format, gradually working out a theology that owes more to ancient Indo-European models than to the "reverse Christianity" associated with the idea of Satanism. Important
points upon which this theology differs from Christianity are the
following: (1) The female principle is deified, equal to or greater than the male. (2) Body and soul are seen as one and the same; one cannot ex
ist without the other. (3) Nature is sacred, not to be abused or
"conquered." (4) The individual will has intrinsic value and is not to
be subordinated to the "revealed" will of a deity. (5) Time is circular
and repetitive; existence is cyclic; the figures of the Triple Goddess
symbolize constant repetitions of growth and decay. (6) There is no original sin, and no hard-and-fast separation of "good" and "evil" (for example, a feast of fresh beef is good for the feasters but evil for the
once-living main dish). (7) Sexuality, spontaneity, humor, and play activities may be incorporated into ritual, where the experience of
pleasure is regarded as a positive force in life, rather than a temptation or a sin. 62 The Goddess speaks to modern witches in somewhat the same
vein as the speeches drawn from her ancient scriptures:
Mine is the secret that opens upon the door ofyouth and mine is the Cup ofthe Wine ofLife and the Cauldron ofCerridwen, which is the Holy Grail ofImmortality. lam the Gracious Goddess who gives the gift ofjoy
unto the heart ofman upon earth. I give the knowledge of the Spirit Eternal, and beyond death I give peace and freedom and reunion with those that have gone before. . . . I who am the beauty ofthe Green Earth, and the White Moon amongst the stars and the mystery ofthe Waters, and the desire ofthe heart ofman, I call unto thy soul to arise and come unto me. For lam the Soul ofNature whogiveth life to the
universe; from me all things proceed and unto me all things must return. . . . I have been with thee from the beginning, and lam that whici is attained at the end ofdesire. 6i

Woden Womb
Woden
Saxon and Frankish names of Odin, whom the Goths called Godan (God), or Father Goth. The day sacred to him was Wednesday Woden's Day. German churchmen eventually changed the name of
the day to Mittwoch, "mid-week," to prevent speaking of the heathen
deity's name. Wednesday is Mercury's Day in Latin-based languages (Italian mercoledi, French mercredi, Spanish miercoles), because WodenOdin was identified with the Roman Mercury (Hermes). As a Conductor of Souls, Woden was associated with the cult of the dead,
who were formerly called "elves" in Scandinavia; therefore he evolved
into the Elven-king, Erl King, and leader of the Wild Hunt, when
ghosts rode through the sky at Halloween. As Hod, the slayer of the
year-god Balder, he appeared in his death mask and hood as a
malicious deity, Old Carl Hood, father of the greenwood-hero Robin. 1
Christians readily identified him with the devil because he was
already a fearful deity of death very like the Hindu Yama.

Wolf
Sacred totem of many European clans during the Middle Ages, as shown by the frequency of the name Wolf or Wulf in place names and family surnames. The old Saxon year began with Wolf-monath
(Wolf Month). Wolf mothers or wolf nurses figured prominently in the biographies of pagan heroes. An early version of Siegfried was nursed by a divine she-wolf and was named Wolfdietrich. 1
Worship of the wolf among heathen clans led to innumerable superstitions about wolf-demons and werewolves. Wolves were asso
ciated with death and reincarnation, since they were carrion eaters,
formerly believed to carry the dead in their own bodies to the pagan heavens and hells. See Dog; Werewolf.

Womb
The Sanskrit word for any temple or sanctuary was garbha-grha, "womb." '
The great annual festival of Aphrodite in Argos was called Hystei,"Womb." 2
1091



Worid ^ The oldest oracle in Greece, sacred to the Great Mother of earth,
Wormwood sea, and sky, was named Delphi, from delphos, "womb."
Megalithic tombs and barrow-mounds were designed as "wombs"
" "^^^^^^" to give rebirth to the dead. Their vaginal entrance passages show that Neolithic folk went to considerable trouble to devise imitations of
female anatomy in earth and stone. Tomb and womb were even
related linguistically. Greek tumbos, Latin tumulus were cognates of
tumere, to swell, to be pregnant. The word "tummy" is thought to have come from the same root. 3 Womb-temples and womb-tombs point backward to the matriar
chal age, when only feminine life-magic was thought efficacious.
Rebirth from the womb-tomb was the meaning of the domed funerary stupa of the Far East, where the remains of the sainted dead lay
within a structure called garbha, the "womb." 4 The parallel with barro
graves, Mycenaean tholos tombs, cave temples, and other such structures is now well known. Even a Christian cathedral centered on
the space called nave, originally meaning "belly." Caves and burial chambers were said to be sunk in the "bowels" of the earth that is, of
Mother Earth. The biblical term for "birth" is "separation from the
bowels."
Archetypal womb-symbolism is as common today as it ever was, though not always recognized as such. Paul Klee said, "Which artist would not wish to dwell at the central organ of all motion . . . from
which all functions derive their life? In the womb of nature, in the
primal ground of creation, where the secret key to all things lies hidden?" 5

World Egg
See Egg; see also Dioscuri; Goose; Swan.
Worm
"The Worm" or "The Worm That Never Dies" sometimes designated the Earth Goddess in her corpse-eating aspect. Her spirit was
thought to inhabit grave-worms (maggots), for which the Old Norse word was mathkr, Old English matha both related to "mother." The modern word descended from a Middle English derivative, mawke}
Linguistically related to these "worms" were the Goddess's familiars oi mawkins. See Cat.
1. Potter & Sargent, 238.
Wormwood
Artemisia absinthium, wormwood, was sacred to the Great Mother. Trevisa wrote in 1398: "Artemisia is called mother of herbs, and was
1092



sometime hallowed to the goddess that hight [is named] Artemis." ' Wudu-Maer In Russia, wormwood or absinth was called an "accursed herb" because Xipe Totec
it was sacred to the pagan nymphs (Vilas); but it had also protective ^^^^^^^^^^^
magic. 2 Wormwood was a corruption of Old English wermod, "spiritmother," which became German Wermut, French vermouth. Absinthe was first prepared by French witches from artemisia, and
became a commercial product in the 1 8th century, though it proved
very dangerous. Wormwood is a habit-forming drug that can destroy brain cells and cause delirium; furthermore, commercial absinthe was
68% alcohol by volume. 3 During the 19th century, the French govern
ment outlawed its production. 4

Wudu-Maer
"Forest-mother," literally "Wood-Mary"; Old Saxon for a nymph or
fairy of the sacred grove, a priestess of the Oak-goddess, or a female druid. In Bavaria, the wudu-maerwere presented with offerings of
foodstuffs to court their goodwill; they were known as Little Wood
Women. 1 A similar concept of a forest priestess survived in English legends of Maid Marian. See Robin.
l.Fra/.er,F.O.T.,312.
Xikum
Babylonian Tree of Heaven, emblem of Ishtar, spreading her branches into the celestial and nether worlds, holding the Savior
Tammuz in her midst. 1 Moslems diabolized this Mother-tree and mentioned her in the Koran as Zakkum, the Tree of Hell. 2 See Fig.
1. Harding, 48. 2. Campbell, Oc.M., 430.
Xipe Totec
"Our Lord the Flayed One" in pre-Columbian Mexico, impersonated by a man who was executed on the Hill of the Stars at the end of
each sacred 52-year cycle, at the moment when the Pleiades reached the zenith. He was castrated and flayed, and the priest was clothed in his
bloody skin, signifying the god's rebirth. 1 People carried new fire
from his temple to re-kindle their household fires, believing that his
death staved off the end of the world, at least for one more cycle. 2
Xipe Totec was the son of the Demeter-like Corn-goddess Chico
mecoatl. Like all gods of crops, he suffered in imitation of reaping
and grinding the grain. His flaying may have represented the husking of the corn cobs.
1093



Xochiquetzal Yahweh
The "Flayed One" bore a remarkable resemblance to the archaic
Hindu god Rudra, the Red One, or the Howler, or the Lord Who Is Half Woman. Rudra too was associated mystically with the Pleiades, called the Seven Mothers of the World, or Krittikas ("cutters"),
whose "cutting" function may have been castrating or even flaying
sacrificial gods. 3
1. Neumann, G.M., 192. 2. Tannahill, 82. 3. 0'Flaherty, 298, 346.
Xochiquetzal
Mexican Aphrodite: a many-faceted Love Goddess, Moon-virgin, fairy queen, and Madonna; a patroness of marriage and sacred harlots, dance, songs, spinning, weaving, changes and transformations, magic, and art. Like Syrian Adonis, her son-lover was a young vegetation god. 1 Her worshippers said Xochiquetzal was the mother of all races of
humanity after the primordial flood. Her many children were as dumb as animals until her holy spirit in the form of a dove descended oi them from the Tree of Heaven and gave them speech. In this way all
the world's languages were created. 2
In addition to the dove, another symbol Xochiquetzal shared with
the ancient Indo-European Goddesses was her sacred flower, the
marigold perhaps a New World version of the golden Thousand
Petaled Lotus representing the Great Mother in India. Xochiquetzal's paradise was located "above the nine heavens in a
very pleasant and delectable place, accompanied and guarded by many people and waited on by other women of the rank of goddesses,
where are many delights of fountains, brooks, flower-gardens." 3 This fairyland was available after death to those who faithfully served the
Goddess and lived according to her laws.
1. Neumann, G.M., 196-97. 2. Frazer, F.O.T., 107. 3. Summers, V, 260.
Yab-Yum
"Father-Mother," the Tantric coital posture in which gods mated with the Goddess and men with their Shaktis, especially at the moment
of death when the Eternal Shakti brought everlasting bliss. 1 Unlike
western patriarchs, Oriental mystics said the most favorable position for
copulation was not Venus observa (male-superior), but Yab-Yum, with both partners upright, face to face, and free to move.
l.Rawson.E.A., 170; pi. 103.
Yahweh
Hebrew name of God, a vocalization of the Tetragrammaton. It
was also rendered Yah, Yahu, Jahveh, Jahi, or Jehovah, and has been
1094



related to the name of the Canaanite moon deity Yareah, possibly a Yama female or androgynous form. A male Yahweh was married to the Yang and Yin Canaanite mother goddess Anat at Elephantine. 1 ^^^^^^^^^^^
The name of God pronounced Jaho, Iao, or Ieuw was applied to Zeus-Sabazius as the nocturnal sun: a Lord of Death under the earth,
like Saturn. Jews called him Sabbaoth, "Lord of Hosts.". His Latin name
came from the same roots: Iu-piter, "Father leu," that is, Jupiter or
Jove. 2 Jahi was also a very ancient Goddess, appearing in Persian scriptures as the maker and seducer of the first man. Like many other
Creatresses, she mated with the primal serpent; she also gave the menstrual "blood of life" to Eve.
1. Hays, 85, 89. 2. Knight, D.W.P., 113.
Yama
Hindu Lord of Death, male counterpart of the Lady of Life, whose
name was his own in reversal: Ma-Ya. In classic Hindu myth, however,
Yama's consort was his twin sister Yami, a feminine form of himself. The Fates ordained that he should mate with her, in the manner of the
Primal Androgyne (see Androgyne). But Yama refused, saying he intended to keep himself pure. Because he detached himself from his
feminine half and renounced the life-supporting power of the female, he became the first man to die. 1 He went into the underworld and
became its king.
This myth presents an interesting reversal of the Judeo-Christian notion that the sin of woman and sex brought death into the world. Here death came about through the sin of male asceticism; Yama
"died" because he refused to be a sexual being. His followers revered
him as a psychopomp, like Hermes after his detachment from Aphrodite: "Yama chose death, and he found out the path for many, and he
gives the souls of the dead a resting place." 2 As Lord of Death he took the title Samana, "the Leveller," and at
times he wore the fearsome aspect of a blue-skinned, bull-headed
demon, the same as Sammael, the Angel of Death in the Book of Enoch. 3 Persians worshipped him as Yima the Splendid, the Good
Shepherd who gave men immortality.4 In the ancient land of Canaan, he became Yamm, Lord of the Abyss, annually cast down by Baal in
their eternal contest for the favors of Astarte.

Yang and Yin
Chinese mandala of light and dark, male and female, summer and
'inter, death and life, etc.: an S-curve dividing black and white halves of Yang and Yin
1095



Yantra the circle, each half containing a spot of the opposite color. Though Yggdrasil now regarded as a bisexual emblem, the Yang and Yin symbol was onc<
wholly feminine. During the Sung period it referred to the cyclic phases of the moon. 1 Yin, the female power in the mandala, was a
cognate of "yoni."
1. Campbell, Or.M., 24.
Yantra
Tantric "meditation sign," the graphic or symbolic equivalent of a mantra. Most important was the Sri Yantra or Great Yantra, a design of
two interlocking triangles representing time cycles and the union of Goddess and God (see Hexagram). 1 Worship of the yantra was meant to attain "unity with the Mother of the Universe." 2
1. Rawson, AT., 82. 2. Avalon, 428.
Yard
From Scandinavian gard or garth, "world," the earth. 1 The church
yard descended from the old pagan tradition that a temple and its
environs constituted a model of the universe, and those buried in the
yard corresponding to the Greek koimeteria, "cemetery" automati
cally entered paradise because they were already in its vicinity (i.e., close to the temple). This was the pagan belief underlying the Christian
habit of burying the pious in "consecrated ground" adjacent to the
church. Refusal of such burial to criminals, witches, and other outcasts
was tantamount to sending them to hell, for it was believed that
anyone buried in unhallowed ground was automatically damned.
l.Lethaby.62.
Yggdrasil
"Terrible Horse," or "The Horse of Ygg [the Ogre]"; Norse name of
the World Ash Tree that became Odin's gallows tree a gallows being poetically likened to a horse (drasil) on which men rode to Death.
Like Christ's cross, Yggdrasil was depicted as the axis mundi. Its roots
supported the earth, its trunk passed through the world's hub, its branches stretched over heaven and were hung with the stars. Under its
roots by the Fount of Wisdom lived the three Fate-goddesses or
Norns. A mighty serpent constantly gnawed at the tree and at doomsday would succeed in toppling the entire structure. All the worlds it
upheld Earth, heaven, Midgard, Asgard were destined to tumble down and fall apart. See Doomsday; Odin.
1096



Yin Yin
Feminine life force, a Chinese cognate of "yoni "; usually represented om
as a fluid emanating from a female "Grotto of the White Tiger" ^^^^mmmm^mm^
(genitals).
1 According to the doctrines of Tao, the power of yin was
stronger than any male power; therefore men had to learn to take
feminine fluids into themselves, to gain wisdom and health.
1. Rawson, E.A., 253.
Ymir
Teutonic giant who died to give life to the universe. His flesh became
the soil; his blood became rivers and seas; his skull was the dome of the
sky. The first couple of male-and-female beings emerged from the
sweat of his left armpit. The race of dwarves evolved from maggots that
bred in Ymir's rotting corpse. This pantheistic creation myth was
designed to give primordial significance to a sacrificial god; but Ymir was not really the first of all creatures. He was brought to life and nourished by the Cow-mother Audumla, "Creator of Earth."
Ymir's name has been related to the Sanskrit Yama, the oldest
underworld god in hermaphroditic guise as a producer of living things. 2 As Odin was another form of Indra, so Ymir was the Yama
remembered by Aryan tribes in their westward migrations.
l.Urousse, 248. 2. H.R.E. Davidson, G.M.V.A., 151, 199.
Yoga
Sanskrit yoga meant to link, join, or unite, like the English derivative "yoke." It was the term for sexual union between the Tantric sadhu and
his yogini, or Shakti, in imitation of the union between Kali and
Shiva. As Kali's consort, Shiva bore the title of "Lord of Yoga." l
The practice of yoga was supposed to develop magic powers collectively called siddhi in northern Europe, sidh or seidr, "mag
ic." The fully developed sage could walk on water, change base metals to gold, understand all languages, heal diseases, cast out demons, and so on. 2 The Moors called such a person a sidi, "hero." In the myth
cycles of Moorish Spain, the title itself became a name of the greatest known hero, El Cid. ?

Yoni
"Vulva," the primary Tantric object of worship, symbolized variously
by a triangle, fish, double-pointed oval, horseshoe, egg, fruits, etc.
1097



Yonijas Yule
Personifying the yoni, the Goddess Kali bore the title of Cunti or
Kunda, root of the ubiquitous Indo-European word "cunt" and all its
relatives: cunnus, cunte, cunning, cunctipotent, ken, kin, country. The Yoni Yantra or triangle was known as the Primordial Image, representing the Great Mother as source of all life. 1 As the genital
focus of her divine energy, the Yantra was adored as a geometrical symbol, as the cross was adored by Christians.
The ceremony of baptismal rebirth often involved being drawn bodily through a giant yoni. Those who underwent this ceremony were styled "twice-born." 2
1. Silberer, 170. 2. Frazer, G.B., 229.
Yonijas A Hindu myth of the battle of the sexes told of a quarrel between the
Goddess Parvati (Kali) and the God Mahadeva (Shiva) over their rival
claims to the true parenthood of human beings. To decide the question, each proposed to create a race of people without the aid of the
other. The God, spirit of the lingam or phallus, created the Lingajas, who were weak and stupid, "dull of intellect, their bodies feeble, their
limbs distorted."
However, the Goddess created the Yonijas, spirits of the yoni or
vulva, who turned out to be excellent specimens: "well-shaped, with sweet aspects and fine complexions." 1 The two races fought a war, and
the Yonijas won. This may have been one of the earliest myths of conflict between
male and female divinities over the matter of who did the creating. It
was still a matriarchal age, as shown by the way the Mother made more
viable people than the Father could make.
1. Simons, 57.
var. Yul Yule
Norse solstitial festival, the season of the sun's rebirth, assimilated to
Christmas in the Middle Ages, along with its pagan trappings: holly, ivy,
pine boughs, lighted trees, wassail bowls, suckling pigs, Yule logs,
carols, gifts, and feasting. Some said the god of Yule was Kris Kringle, i.e., a Christ of the Orb, a new solar king. But most northern folk remembered the
reborn god as Frey. They said, "Yule is celebrated in honor of Frey." '
In France it was celebrated in honor of another phallic god, like
Cernunnos, whose phallus was identified with the festive log, called
the Noel Log. Provencal folk songs mention the fertility magic of the
1098



Noel Log, the ashes of which were traditionally mixed with cows' Yu-Ti
fodder to help them calve. 2 Zalmoxis
1. Oxenstierna, 216. 2. Briffault 3, 101-2. ^^^^___^^__
Yu-Ti
Chinese Heavenly Father, consort of Mother Earth (Wang-Mu). He
was known as the August Personage of Jade, or August Supreme Emperor of Jade. He lived in heaven in a palace exactly like the
earthly emperor's palace. He was said to have made the first human
beings out of clay, like other archaic gods whose "creating" took
place before the concept of begetting was understood. 1
\.Larousse, 381-82.
Zabat
Berber name for sacred dances performed in groups of thirteen, in connection with the magic ceremony called "an occasion of power";
possible origin of the so-called witches' "sabbat." '
1. Shah, 210; Ravensdale & Morgan, 1 53.
Zagreus
Cretan bull-god and savior identified with both Dionysus the Son,
and Zeus the Father. Zagreus was slain by the Titans (pre-Hellenic
gods) as a sacrifice, then assimilated to his heavenly father and
resurrected as a new copy of himself, by rebirth through the Mother
(Rhea).
Zakar
Hebrew "male," from several ancient words for "penis." Zakar or
Zaqar was a phallic deity like Hermes in Babylon, where he was called a
messenger from the moon. Zekker, the Arabic word for "penis,"
came from a similar Egyptian root: Seker, the Lord of Death, i.e., Osiris as the dead god (or phallus) hidden within the Mother's womb. See Seker.
Zalmoxis
Savior of Thrace, worshipped by the Getae and identified with
Orpheus. Zalmoxis promised eternal life to guests at his sacramental
1099



Zar Last Supper. Then he went into the underworld, and rose again on
Zephyr the third day or, by some accounts, in the third year. He established
sacred Mysteries to teach the secrets of the after-life. Human sacri
fices to him were impaled, like victims impersonating Tmolus in Lydia
(see Heracles). 1 Martyrdom as the spirit of Zalmoxis apparently was coveted. If the victim survived after being hurled onto the points of spears, he was rebuked and designated a "bad man"; and another was
chosen to die in his place. 2
1. Herodotus, 241-42. 2. Guthrie, 175.
Zar
Ethiopian demon, still worshipped by women as the spirit of their voodoo-like cult of possession, to which they have recourse when
oppressed by their patriarchal society. The name Zar may be related to an ancient name of Osiris, worshipped during the first dynasty at Abydos as the god-king Zer, who became Lord of the Underworld.
Zen
Japanese system of controlled meditation, to master various skills,
especially the martial arts. Zen was a mispronunciation of Chinese
ch 'an, which was in turn a mispronunciation of Sanskrit dhyana,
"contemplation." ' Medieval knights of romance, who worshipped Diana and followed a similar martial-arts cult, may have drawn their
tradition from the same Oriental source.
1. Campbell, M.T.L.B., 127; Or.M., 440.
Zenobia
Dynastic name of matriarchal queens of Palmyra. In their native
Aramaic, the name was Bath-Zabbai, or Bath-Sheba, meaning "Daughter of the Goddess." See Solomon and Sheba. The famous queen Zenobia Septimia was the "seventh Bath-Sheba." x She had no official
consort. She named her son Wahab-Allath, "Gift of the Goddess
Allath." Allath was the same Semitic Moon-mother whom Islam later masculinized as Allah. 2
1. Encyc. Brit., "Zenobia." 2. de Riencourt, 75.
Zephyr
Greek wind-spirit, capable of impregnating women or female animals, as Boreas the North Wind was thought to impregnate mares.
Greek phallic gods often appeared in carvings and amulets as "snake
1100



tailed winds." The idea that fatherhood resulted from sending air, Zeus
breath, or wind into a womb was not only a Greek idea. It was Ziusudra common to early patriarchal religions, which taught the male Oversoul ^^^^^^^^^^
was nothing but air. See Soul.
Zeus
Greek form of Sanskrit Dyauspitar, "Father Heaven," probably linked with Babylonian myths of Zu the Storm-Bird, a thrower of thunderbolts. The Romans called him Jupiter, or Jove; the Jews
called him Jehovah.
Unlike the Judeo-Christian God who assumed his attributes, Zeus was not a creator of humanity, nor even a giver of laws. The real
Creator-lawgiver was the Goddess called either his mother or his wife:
Rhea, Hera, Gaea; in all her forms a "Virgin Mother of God." Zeus
was entitled Mamas, "Virgin-born Zeus." ' He was also identified with a
number of dying gods, such as Zeus-Sabazius, Zeus-Zagreus, ZeusSabaoth. Like Lucifer, he "came down" as rain or lightning to fertilize
his Mother, the earth. As a god of the fructifying bolt, he was known
as Zeus Kataibates, "Zeus Who Descends." 2 He took over Mount
Olympus, former shrine of Gaea Olympia.
Zeus eventually became the Olympic-Platonic patriarch, even claiming to give birth to Athene the ancient Libyan Goddess of female wisdom from his own head. "With the spread of Platonic
philosophy the hitherto intellectually dominant Greek woman degenerated into an unpaid worker and breeder of children wherever Zeus
and Apollo were the ruling gods." 3
1. Graves, W.G., 320. 2. Guthrie, 38. 3. Graves, G.M. 1,117.
Ziggurat
Babylonian "Mountain of Heaven," the pyramid that served as
temple and palace in Mesopotamian towns. At its summit, the king consummated his sacred marriage with the Goddess, this being the point of contact between heaven and earth. Nebuchadnezzar's ziggurat
was built in seven stages, representing the seven planetary spheres. Beneath, seven nether pits represented the descent into the corresponding seven spheres of the underworld. Such pits were used for death-and-rebirth ceremonies of priestly initiations. See Mountain.
Ziusudra
Sumerian prototype of Noah, the flood hero, carrying the seeds of a new universe through watery Chaos between destruction of one world and the birth of the next. Sometimes spelled Xisuthros. See Flood.
1101



Zoe Zoe
Zurvan "Life," a Gnostic name of Eve, comparable to the Teutonic All
^^Ma^MBHHMB Mother Lif. ' Zoe was a daughter or emanation of the Gnostic Goddess, Sophia, who gave Adam his soul. She also threw down to the Abyss the unjust Creator, who had dared to curse her, and elevated the Lord
of Hosts to the seventh heaven, where she undertook to instruct him
about the eighth, the Great Mother's dwelling place. Gnostic Gospels said Zoe's power alone animated the first clay man, after various gods had tried to do it and failed. Therefore the man called her Mother of All
Living. 2 The canonical Bible kept her title, but eliminated her giving
of life to Adam.
1. Pagels, 30. 2. Robinson, 159, 166-69, 172-76.
var. Zarathustra Zoroaster
Patriarchal Persian prophet whose name was affixed to many anti
female doctrines, such as the rule that no women could enter heaven
except those "submissive to control, who had considered their hus
bands lords." ' Most women, of course, were destined to go to hell.
Along with much else, these sentiments were adopted from Zoroas
trian teaching by the Jews and applied to the laws of Yahweh.
1. Campbell, Oc.M., 196, 199.
Zorya
The "Three Fates" in Slavic myth. "Three little sisters, three little
Zorya: she of the Evening, she of Midnight, and she of Morning" i.e., of the old lunar calendars that figured the day from noon to noon.
Like the Norns, the Zorya kept the doomsday-wolf fettered to the pole star: "Their duty is to guard a dog which is tied by an iron chain to the constellation of the Little Bear. When the chain breaks it will be the
end of the world." l An Egyptian prototype of the triple Zorya was the Goddess Reret, who kept the powers of destruction fettered by a chain. 2
1. Lamusse, 285. 2. Budge, G.E. 2, 249.
Zurvan
Archaic Persian deity of Infinite Time, two-faced or two-sexed in
Zoroastrian symbolism. Zurvan must have been originally a manifesta
tion of the Two Ladies of life and death, like Kali who united Virgin and Crone aspects of female divinity. From the womb of Zurvan were born the twins Ahura Mazda (God) and Ahriman (Satan). The former twin became king of heaven because he made the right sacri
1102



fices. Ahriman's sacrifices were unacceptable, so he was banished to the underworld and became the Great Serpent. 1
Zurvan Akarana was worshipped as the First Cause, or principle of
creation, linked with Time, Destiny, and Fate: three common characterizations of the Goddess. 2 An ancient scripture said her divinity
could not even be addressed; it was "so incomprehensible to man that we can but honor it in awed silence." ? Thus Zurvan was similar to the
Gnostic Goddess Sige, origin of all things in Silence. Ahura could have been one of her early names. In Egypt, Ahura was feminine.4 The Zoroastrian pantheon assigned Zurvan to the dark side of
divinity as a demon of decrepitude, very like the Crone Kali who
represented moribund old age. 5 Patriarchal thinkers characteristically
emphasized the negative aspects of the destroying-and-creating Goddess, even when the primal character of the Mother of good, evil, time, fate, and the universe was clearly discernible under the veneer of later
myth. 1. Lawusse, 323. 2. Cumont, A.R.G.R., 61. 3. Seligmann, 14. 4. Budge, E.M., 144. 5. Seligmann, 14.

WOMEN'S STUDIES/REFERENCE
THE WOMAN'S
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MYTI
AND SECRETS
"A tremendously interesting compendium. . . .
indispensable on my bookshelf beside Robert Graves.
Russell Hoban, author of Riddley Walker
Where the legend of a cat's nine lives comes from?
Why "mama" is a word understood in nearly all languages?
How the custom of kissing began?
Whether there really was a female pope?
Why Cinderella's glass slipper was so important to the Prince?
The answers to these and countless other intriguing questions are given in this
compulsively readable, feminist encyclopedia. Twenty-five years in preparation, this unique, comprehensive sourcebook focuses on mythology, anthropology,
religion, and sexuality to uncover precisely what other encyclopedias leave
out or misrepresent. The Woman's Encyclopedia presents the fascinating stories
behind word origins, legends, superstitions, and customs. A browser's delight
and an indispensable resource, it offers 1350 entries on magic, witchcraft, fairies, elves, giants, goddesses, gods, and psychological anomalies such as
demonic possession; the mystical meanings of sun, moon, earth, sea, time and space; ideas of the soul, reincarnation, creation and doomsday; ancient and
modern attitudes toward sex, prostitution, romance, rape, warfare, death and
sin, and much, much more. Tracing these concepts to their prepatriarchal origins, Barbara C. Walker explores a "thousand hidden pockets of history and custom in addition to the valuable material recovered by archaeologists, orientalists, and other scholars." Not only a compendium of fascinating lore and scholarship, The Woman's
Encyclopedia is a revolutionary book that offers a rare opportunity for both
women and men to see our cultural heritage in a fresh light, and draw upon the
past for a more humane future.
A professional researcher and writer, Barbara G. Walker lives near Morristown,
New Jersey.
