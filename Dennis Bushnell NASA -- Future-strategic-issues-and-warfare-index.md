Fundamental Problem With Future U.S. Power Projection
• “EAN” can have “country sized magazines” filled with hordes of inexpensive Precision strike “Munitions” - Area Denial
• U.S. Forces run out of “bullets” and die
[Beam weapons not panacea, inexpensive workarounds available]
• Deep Water Subs with large loadout/“swimin” weaponry only survivable “Close-in” platform

The Revolutionary Size/Capability/Cost Warfighting Spiral
1 Commercial electronics/GNC/Comms/Sensors (Much smaller/cheaper/better - Allows:
2 IO and “Precision” - Reduces Reqd. munition size and Numbers much-Leads to:
3 Small/Light/Deadly/Inexpensive Munitions
4 Which Reduces requisite Platform size/cost
5 Which is reduced still further by (also enabled) “Automatics/Robotics” - Uninhabited
6 Combined with Much lighter/cheaper Revol. Materials/Fabrication for structure and energetics (propul./warhead) - Yields “Cheap Warfare”

Fundamental Military Issues/Metrics
• Affordability [“Warfare on the Cheap”]
• Survivability [“Can see everything, Anything you can see you can kill”]
• Effectiveness [Lethality of Precision and Volumetric weaponry]
I.E. Simultaneous ongoing Revolutions in all three of the major Warfare Metrics



Future Strategic Issues, 7/01
Given the Superb/Ubiquitous World Wide Sensor Suites and Precision Strike Capabilities “Then Year” the Following WILL NOT BE SURVIVABLE
• APODS/SPODS
• Runways
• Surface Ships
• Manned (logistic/combat) Aircraft
• Manned (logistic/combat) Ground Vehicles
Due to their size & (multi-physics) signatures



Future Strategic Issues, 7/01
CONCERNING (CURRENT) FARTHER TERM (U.S.) DEFENSE “STRATEGIC STUDIES”
• Almost wholly dedicated to/concentrated on offensive operations (DOO?)
– Across the board (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, OSD)
• (Apparent) wholly inadequate consideration of defense
– Defense of Conus, especially from short time of flight inshore undersea attack
– Defense of the offensive forces [especially in terms of the “enemy after next” capabilities definitization and response(s) thereto]
– Defense of the logistics assets, especially “out of theater”



Future Strategic Issues, 7/01
Typical Scenario - “Takedown” of U.S. by 10 People and <$10M
• Binary Bio [via (imported Vitamins/Clothing, etc., food supply(s)]
• Terror Bio (e.g. Aflatoxin)
• IW (“usual” plus physical against key nodes such as Railroads - take down the economy)
• Selective anti-personnel RF/MW (Towers)
• Water Supply Contamination via Intercontinental UAV’s
Accompanied by SERIOUS “PSYWAR”



Future Strategic Issues, 7/01
Trends Summary
• Tele-everything
• U.S. just “one of the crowd” economically
• “Warfare on the cheap,” many potential “peers”
• Warfare Increasingly Robotic
• Survivable/Affordable power projection via deep water subs and Blast Wave Accelerators
• CONUS and Logistics Defense increasingly worrisome



Future Strategic Issues, 7/01
FROM U.S. COMMISSION ON NATIONAL SECURITY/21ST CENTURY
• It will soon be possible to connect human brain cells to silicon chips
• Due to IT technology we will witness the “death of distance”
• More than 2/3rds of the satellites are foreign owned
• Large scale missile attacks will be able to overwhelm defensive systems
• Development of genetically engineered pathogens that will thwart our bio detection/defense measures/cycles



Future Strategic Issues, 7/01
“Circa 2025”
• Machines as creative/“smart” as humans “Robotics” the “norm”
• Zeroth order “warstopper” - Binary bio into nation’s agric./food distrib. system (every home/fox hole)
• Next level of concern: Ubiquitous/Cheap micro-to-nano EVERYTHING (sensors, munitions, weapons swarms/hordes)
• Battlefield attrition/CNN syndrome forces U.S. Army to look/act like SOCOM



Future Strategic Issues, 7/01
(Suggested) Major U.S. Future (2025) Warfare Issues
• CONUS Defense (Requirement(s) for, potential approaches)
• Logistics Defense/Protection (in/out of theater)
• Survivability/Effectiveness of U.S. Forces on/near the “Killing Ground” in an era of affordable ubiquitous multiphysics hyperspectral sensors, precision strike, volumetric weaponry, “swarms” and hardened munitions



Future Strategic Issues, 7/01
• “Non-explosive Warfare” (psywar, biowar IT/net war, “anti-operability war,” Beam weaponry including RF, Spoofing/Cammo
• Robotic Warfare “in the large”/better than human AI/“Cyber life”
• Alternative Power Projection Approaches (e.g. Deep Water depth/death sphere, blast wave accelerator, etc.)



Future Strategic Issues, 7/01
Future “Power Projection”?
• Humans “hold” instead of “take” ground (go in after “Sanitization”)
• Sanitization via:
– IW/Psywar
– Global Reach “Guns” (BWA/Slingatron)
– Deep water/large loadout Subs w/“swimins”
– “Robotic Everything” w/Volumetric weaponry, non-explosive warfare



Future Strategic Issues, 7/01
Future(s) of SOF
• Becomes THE (only survivable) HUMAN Strike Force (Army/Marines forced to become “SOF-Like”)
• Increasingly The “Overseas FBI” to counter the increasingly capable (IO/Bio WMD) & horrific destructive power of INDIVIDUALS and Groups
• Ops involve increasingly difficult-to-deal-with omnipresent/omni-physics sensor/ID suites, Few-to-No exploitable Interstices for Covert/Clandestine “work” - THE Challenge



Future Strategic Issues, 7/01
Future “Warfare”
• “Defense” against the “then year” multitudinous conventional and unconventional delivery methods for volumetric and precision munitions is essentially neither doable nor affordable.
• Suggested National Defense Approaches:
– Work Technology, Intel, Diplomacy, SOCOM for detection/interdiction/deflection of the “pre-delivery” phases (causes of war, motivational and decision processes, design and construction, test)
– Work and ADVERTISE a REALLY EFFECTIVE RETRIBUTION to deter delivery (ala MAD)

RMA Planning “Shortfalls” (NPS)
• “Indications of the innovative paths adversaries might take or how they might adapt technologies from the civilian world” (Being worked in the “Technical War Games”)
• “The path from todays systems and capabilities to those hypothesized for the future (2020+)”



Future Strategic Issues, 7/01
What is needed is a “Then Year” (~2030) Serious/Holistic Vision of Warfare Changes Resulting from the On-going IT/Bio/Nano/Virtual Technological Revolutions
• Such does not exist, “bumper sticker” attempts extant.
• All are agreed, warfare will become increasingly robotic and probably more affordable, swarms of sensors/shooters are a given.
• A longer term “Vision” of these changes would enable “mapping” from the present, NOT AT ALL CLEAR HOW TO “Get There From Here” as do not know where “there” is!



Future Strategic Issues, 7/01
“War between mass armies weighed down with baroque equipment has become a third world sport. The advanced world, too vulnerable to survive a war of attrition or mass destruction, must learn to conduct its affairs by the Rapier--by the threat or use of small specialized forces exploiting high tempo and strategic surprise”
R. E. Simpkin, “Race to the Swift: 1985



Future Strategic Issues, 7/01
In the second half of the 1900’s Nuclear/Bio Warfare was “Unthinkable” In the first half of the 2000’s “conventional” warfare may become so deadly/effective as to become “Unthinkable” (“Killer Aps” available to mitigate the “Causes of War”)

(Usual) Reactions to this Presentation
• Is in the “Too Hard Box”
• Not being done yet by anyone, therefore, will not be done
• They would not do that
• We have to Hope they would not do that
• Why go there, cannot defend against it
• Some Disbelief, but agreement there is too much there to disregard
