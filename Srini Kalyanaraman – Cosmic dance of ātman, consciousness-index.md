[quote]Biological barriers are protecting the brain. a Blood–brain barrier; b blood
CSF barrier; c the arachnoid barrier. A highly controlled microenvironment is required
to promote the normal functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). The existence
of a biological barrier at the blood to brain interface effectively separating the brain
from the rest of the body was established after the finding of Paul Ehrlich when he
noticed that a peripherally infused dye did not stain the brain tissue. His finding was
further supported by later observation from his associate Goldmann as he applied the
same dye to the cerebrospinal fluid. It did stain only the brain tissue without
extravasating in the periphery [1]. These biological barriers are established by
different cells at three key interfaces: the blood–brain barrier (BBB), blood–CSF
barrier (BCB), and the arachnoid barrier [2][unquote]

Abstract: Summary
[quote]Endogenous circadian rhythms are thought to modulate responses to external
factors, but mechanisms that confer time-of-day differences in organismal responses to
environmental insults/therapeutic treatments are poorly understood. Using a xenobiotic,
we find that permeability of the Drosophila “blood”-brain barrier (BBB) is higher at
night. The permeability rhythm is driven by circadian regulation of efflux and depends
on a molecular clock in the perineurial glia of the BBB, although efflux transporters are
restricted to subperineurial glia (SPG). We show that transmission of circadian signals
across the layers requires cyclically expressed gap junctions. Specifically, during
nighttime, gap junctions reduce intracellular magnesium ([Mg2+]i), a positive regulator
of efflux, in SPG. Consistent with lower nighttime efflux, nighttime administration of
the anti-epileptic phenytoin is more effective at treating a Drosophila seizure model.
These findings identify a novel mechanism of circadian regulation and have therapeutic
implications for drugs targeted to the central nervous system.[unquote]

[quote]Figure 1. A circadian clock in the Drosophila BBB regulates RHB permeability of the brain (a–b) Rhythm of permeability into the Drosophila brain: Flies were injected with RHB under CO2 anesthesia at different time points and the levels of RHB in individual fly brains and bodies were measured after 1 hr using a fluorescence reader at Ex540/Em595. The level of RHB fluorescence in the brain was normalized to the amount of RHB in the body to control for injection consistency. Shown are the brain:body ratios of RHB in a) iso31 n=14–21 per time point, pooled from 3+ experiments and b) per01 flies. n=8–21, pooled from 2 experiments. Means ± SEM are shown. c) Expression of the PER clock protein in the BBB. PGGAL4>UAS-nGFP Drosophila were entrained to a 12:12 LD cycle for 3 days. The brain was analyzed for nGFP and PER expression at ZT2, ZT8, ZT14, and ZT20 with a confocal microscope. Representative images of the surface of the brain are shown. Each panel represents an area 100×120μm. (d–e) The PG clock is required for the permeability rhythm. UAS-dncyc (control) and d) PG-GAL4>UAS-dncyc (experimental) or e) UASdncyc (control) and SPG-GAL4> UAS-dncyc (experimental) were injected with RHB under CO2 anesthesia and assessed by Ex540/Em595 fluorescence after 60 mins. Means ± SEM of the ratio of brain:body fluorescence are depicted. n=12–22, pooled from 4 experiments. pCycle indicates a presence of rhythm using JTK cycle analysis. See also Figure S1.[unquote]

diurnal differences in efflux of RHB a) Efflux from the Drosophila brain.
Live brains from wild type or mdr65mut flies at ZT4-8 or ZT12-16 were
dissected in HL3.1 media and incubated with RHB for 2 mins. Dye was
washed off and brains were immediately imaged with a confocal microscope.
Representative images are shown (top panel). Adjusted change in fluorescence
of live brains over time was quantified for brains assayed at ZT4-8 and at
ZT12-16 (bottom left panel); the two samples are compared at 8–9 min time
point (bottom right panel). n=9–12 brains, pooled from 4 independent
experiments. b) Expression of p-glycoprotein in the BBB. Brains from PG
GAL4>UAS-mCD8GFP (top panels) or SPG-GAL4>UAS-mCD8GFP (bottom
panels) were dissected and incubated with c219 anti-pgp antibody and imaged
with a confocal microscope. Pgp expression co-localized with the SPG, but
not the PG. Representative images of GFP expression (left), pgp fluorescence
(center), and overlay (right) are shown. [unquote]

[quote]Figure 6. Model of Circadian Regulation of BBB Efflux
During the day, circadian clock regulation in the PG lowers levels of gap
junctions, reducing connectivity with the SPG. The level of [Mg2+]i is
high in the SPG, which promotes activity of the efflux transporters,
reducing permeability of xenobiotics. During the night, the PG clock
increases gap junctions, thereby increasing connectivity with the SPG.
The Mg2+ ions diffuse from SPG into the PG, lowering the [Mg2+]i in the
SPG. The efflux transporters reduce activity due to the decline in
[Mg2+]i, and xenobiotics are retained in the brain. [unquote]

[quote]The reward pathways (olfactory and gustatory circuits) of the honey bee brain and
fruit fly brain. Schematic frontal views of a cross-section of the central honey bee (A) and
fruit fly (B) brain (head capsule and eyes removed). The olfactory (CS) pathway is
depicted in light blue (light grey in the print version). Olfactory neurons send information
to the brain via the antennal nerve. These neurons form synapses within the glomeruli of
the antennal lobes (ALs) onto local interneurons (not shown) and projection neurons
conveying olfactory information to the lateral horn (LH) and the mushroom bodies (MBs).
In the honey bee brain (A), the gustatory (US) pathway involves the VUMmx1 neuron
(brown, light grey in the print version), which projects from the gna- thal ganglion to the
LH, AL and MB. VUMmx1 is bilaterally symmetrical, but in this figure only the right side
is shown. Abbreviations: CS, conditioned stimulus; US, unconditioned stimulus;
VUMmx1, ventral unpaired medial neuron 1 of the maxillary neuromere. Figure adapted
