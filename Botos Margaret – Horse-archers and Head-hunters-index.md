ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I wish to thank Miklós Patrubány, President of the World Federation of Hungarians, for his
suggestion that I edit a book about the Celtic-Hungarian connection. This book would
never have been written without his encouragement and that of my husband, László.
Thanks are due to all the authors, who contributed their articles to this undertaking, for
allowing me to donate all proceeds to the IX Hungarian Congress to take place in August,
2016. I also appreciate the help of my friend, Mary Roberts, for her corrections and
suggestions.

Introduction
The word “historian” cannot be applied exclusively to those with a Doctorate in History
from a given university. There are many people who have spent a lifetime reading, who are described as self-educated, and who deserve the title historian. However, if they draw
conclusions from the many books they have read during their life and decide to write a
book, they are not usually accepted by Academia and are regarded as amateurs. Yet their
observations may become a very valuable contribution to research and might encourage
others to continue to research avenues hitherto ignored. History is not an exact science like
mathematics. For the most part it records events as they happened in the past, but also
proposes theories which the writer must try to prove, although he expects to be challenged.
One such theory or hypothesis is the Finno-Ugric theory, which states that the Hungarians
are descended from primitive tribes in Siberia. We are planning to disprove this theory by
proving that the ancestors of the Hungarians (Magyars) were the original inhabitants of the
Carpathian Basin and that they were related to the Scythians and the Celts.
I have included in this book some articles by amateurs such as László Botos, Susan
Tomory, Sándor Timaru-Kast, Klara Friedrich, István Vallus and myself. Dr. Atilla
Grandpierre has a doctorate in physics and astronomy, not history, yet he has completed
extensive research into the Scythians. Dr. László Marácz, a linguist, and Dr. Kornél Bakay,
an archaeologist, refute the Finno-Ugric theory. I humbly ask the reader to keep an open
mind and consider some alternative approaches to the history of Western and Central
Europe.

The Sky is Falling!
The Celts are recorded as being fearless warriors but there was one thing that they were
afraid of. Their envoys reported to Emperor Alexander the Great that they were terrified
that the sky would fall on their heads.3 There is an English children’s tale that expresses
the same sentiment, about Henny Penny who was walking in the forest when an acorn fell
on her head, and she wanted to run to the King to tell him that the sky was falling. (In the
American version she is called Chicken Little). This could have been inherited from the
Celts, who inhabited the British Isles from approximately 900 BC. Interestingly enough,
the Hungarians have this same story in their folk-tales.4 So if the British inherited it from
the Celts, is it possible that the Hungarians might also have some relationship with the
Celts?
When I speak to people in Hungary and they ask about my origins, I tell them that
I was born in Wales, but I am not Welsh. My mother was Irish and my father English.
Hungarians often tell me that I am related to them because they believe themselves to be
related to the Celts. My knowledge of the Celts used to be very scant. Like most people I
associated them with the Irish, Welsh and Scots. We are familiar today with Celtic music
by listening to groups like Celtic Woman and River-Dance, and here, in the United States,
there are Celtic festivals celebrated every summer and of course huge parades on Saint
Patrick’s Day. The renowned archaeologist Barry Cunliffe calls the renewed interest in the
Celts “Celtomania”. It began in the 18th century and has continued to the present time.
Several institutions were founded to study the Celtic heritage in Wales, Scotland and
Ireland: The Society of Cymmrodorion in 1751, the Cambrian Archaeological Association
in 1848, the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in 1780, and the Royal Irish Academy in
1785.5 The first chair of Celtic Studies was founded at Oxford in 1877.6
Because I have Irish ancestry, I know I am related to the Celts. But to the
Hungarians? My interest was aroused, and I read a book by Sándor Timaru-Kast entitled, Kelta-magyarok – Magyar-kelták (Celtic-Magyars – Magyar Celts). It convinced me that
there is indeed a relationship between the Hungarians and the Celts. I will include parts of
it in this book, translated into English.
Of course, you would say that this relationship is not possible because history
teaches us that the Hungarians, i.e. the Magyars, entered the Carpathian Basin in AD. 896
and conquered the Slavs who were living there at that time and that the Kingdom of
Hungary was established by King (Saint) István (Stephen) in AD 1000. Before launching
into an examination of the “impossible” relationship between the Magyars and the Celts,
we need to learn a little more about the Magyars, who are even today portrayed as
barbarians and pagans.

What most people do not know is that the Magyars were related to the Scythians,
Huns and Avars and were the autochthonous population of the Carpathian Basin.
According to geological findings, the ancient people worked the land 35,000 years ago, as
can be seen in the Pallag territory in Transylvania.7 8,000 years ago, the ancient people
knew how to write in a runic script carved on wood or bone. Klara Friedrich, an expert in
runic scripts, has written an eye-opening article which proves that the ancestors of the
Magyars lived in the Carpathian Basin many thousands of years ago. Her study will be
included later. She writes:
The fact that the signs on the Tatárlaka disk are 1,000-1,500 years older than
similar Mesopotamian hieroglyphic signs reinforces the hypothesis that the cradle of
writing was the Carpathian Basin. The Hungarian people, whose ancestors created
these letters, still live there.
Perhaps due to overpopulation or climatic conditions, groups of the ancient people
of the Carpathian Basin left their homeland and returned from time to time as Huns, Avars
and Magyars. The arrival of the Magyars of Árpád in the ninth century was the last of several waves of migration. As the ancient chronicle, the Tarih-i-Üngürüsz8, written in the
16th century, relates, the Magyars found a people (Üngürüsz) in the Carpathian Basin,
speaking their own language and they established the Hungarian State in this territory that
they had reclaimed, giving their name to the language that was spoken here: Magyar. This
state existed as the Kingdom of Hungary for more than a thousand years until it was carved
up after World War I, at the Treaty of Trianon in 1920, into a size that is a third of historical
Hungary. Parts of Hungary were given by the Treaty to the neighboring states of Romania
and Austria, and parts were given to new states that were created – Czechoslovakia and
Yugoslavia. The Carpathian Basin is geographically ideal for settlement. It is a large plain
surrounded by mountains and well-watered by mountain streams and rivers. It is a territory
with natural defenses, accessed through only a few mountain passes. László Botos published his book The Homeland Reclaimed, in 1995, in which he proposed the above
mentioned theory of migration out of the Carpathian Basin and the return of the populace
in several waves.

Grover S. Krantz, the late Professor of Anthropology at the University of
Washington, who established the pattern of the spread of language groups, identified
twelve language branches from which he originates all the known European languages. He
places the birth of languages to a pre-Mesolithic time with the Carpathian Basin as its
epicenter.9
In the Geographical Development of European Languages, Professor Krantz
recognizes the Magyar language as the base of European culture. According to his theory,
the Indo-European languages developed very late in time in Europe, and for this reason,
30% of these languages indicate another, non-European origin. For example, he shows that
on the early maps of Europe there are no Indo-European river names. We are interested in
his following statements:
“The unexpected conclusions here are mainly in the area of increased
antiquity ascribed to the original Indo-European dispersion itself, and in the longer
residence indicated for some of its subdivisions in their present locations. This would include, for example, developing Greek in its present area since 6500 BC.,
and Celtic in Ireland since 3500 BC. The antiquity of Magyar in Hungary may be
equally surprising: I find it to be a Mesolithic speech that predates the Neolithic
entry.”
And a little later:
“In at least one major instance the commonly assumed direction of
migration of population is reversed here. It is usually stated, that the Uralic Magyars
moved into Hungary from an eastern source in the 9th century A.D. I find instead

that all the other Uralic speakers expanded out of Hungary in the opposite direction,
and at a much earlier date.” [Emphasis by editor]
Grover Kranz was not alone in his estimation of the antiquity of the Magyar
language. Sir John Bowring (1792-1872), an English philologist, who spoke many
languages, one of them Hungarian, translated many Hungarian poems into English and published his collection in: “The Poetry of the Magyars” in 1830. In his preface, he stated:
“...Its construction and composition may be safely referred to an epoch when most of the
living tongues of Europe either had no existence, or no influence on the Hungarian
region.” He wrote that the Hungarian language originated “in an age too remote to be
defined or even discovered.”10
R. Nisbet Bain, a linguist from the British Museum, noted that the Hungarian language is "a miracle of word formation." Ebersberg, an Austrian linguist, says that the
Hungarian language is so perfect that it is as if it were created by a congress of linguists to
serve conciseness, smoothness, harmony and clarity of expression. Cardinal Giuseppe
Mezzofanti, an Italian writer and linguist, (1774-1849), who spoke fifty-eight languages fluently and was familiar with one hundred, stated: "After Latin and Greek, Hungarian is
the most musical language and the language most suited to poetry." Jakob L. K. Grimm, a
German linguist, (1785-1863), recommended that Hungarian be adopted as an international
language.11
If they have such ancient origins then, why are the Magyars portrayed as barbarians
and pagans even today? After Hungary became a kingdom, in AD 1000, she became a
strong state in the center of Europe. The Germans constantly attempted to overcome
Hungary, starting with Otto the Great and continuing throughout the centuries with the
Hapsburgs who ruled Hungary from the 16th century on. The Hungarians waged several
freedom fights against the Austrians, the strongest being the 1848-1849 War of
Independence, which was successful until the Austrian Emperor, who was also King of
Hungary, enlisted the aid of the Czar of Russia to finally subdue them. The Hungarians had
always been proud of their past, declaring that they were descended from the Huns, Avars
and Magyars. The Hapsburgs realized that they could not subdue this proud nation by
military means, so they determined to conquer their spirit and erase their past. They used
the Hungarian Academy of Sciences to promote a false theory of the origin of the
Hungarians, called the Finno-Ugric theory. Linguists who promote the Finno-Ugric theory
of the origin of the Magyars state that the Magyars were so primitive that they had no words
to express even the simplest elements, and they picked up their vocabulary from the peoples
they met on their travels throughout Europe. Hungarian students are taught that their
ancestors were primitive tribes related to the Voguls and Ostyaks and that they originated
in the snowy wind-swept steppes of Siberia. In The Homeland Reclaimed, László Botos writes:
Karin Mark, an Estonian anthropologist, has stated that the Magyar origins
cannot be found among the Voguls and Ostyaks because there are unbridgeable
differences between them and the Magyars. The most famous Finno-Ugric linguist
who has been called "the apostle of Finno-Ugric linguistics", Björn Collinder,

writes: "The Finno-Ugric phonetic system lacks the Magyar phonemes - á, é, cs,
gy, í, ly, ny, ó, ö, sz, ty, ú, ü, zs, - fourteen phonemes, and the Finno-Ugric languages
also lack the verbal prefix.”12 Miklós Gábori writes that, at the time of the
Sumerians, the territory of the Urals and Siberia was unpopulated. According to
the Finno-Ugric hypothesis, the ancestors of the Hungarians lived on these
aforementioned territories with their relatives, the Voguls and Ostyaks in 6000 B.C.
Gyula László states that the territory which the linguistic science declares to be the
"Ural-Finno-Ugric territory" never existed.13 He also mentions that there is no
Finno-Ugric archaeology, folk art, or anthropology which prove connections with
the Magyars.14 Ferenc Badiny Jós asks on what the Finno-Ugric relationship is
based, if the Finno-Ugric languages lack fourteen Magyar phonemes and there is
no Finno-Ugric archaeology, anthropology and folk-art to prove a relationship
with the Magyars.15
The Finno-Ugric theory has been taught in schools and universities ever since and
is still supported by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. In the 1890’s Gábor Bálint (1844
1913) from Szentkatolna, who spoke more than 12 languages, opposed the Finno-Ugric
theory and stated that the Magyar language was related to the Hun and Scythian languages.
Even before that, in the 17th and 18th centuries, there were two linguists who researched the
antiquity of the Hungarian language: Fóris Ferenc Otrokocsi (1648-1718) and Mátyás Bél
(1684-1749).16 Fortunately, today there are many researchers, studying the language and
origin of the Magyars, like Grover S. Krantz, who write that the Magyars are autochthonous
to the Carpathian Basin, and their language is the oldest language in Europe. This means
that it was the language of the indigenous population of the Carpathian Basin. It is generally
believed that the name “Magyar” was given to the language and the people at the time of
the Árpád ingress in AD. 896.
Lajos Marjalaki Kiss stated in 1928:
"I have a strong belief that the Árpád Conquest brought a political change, and
formed a new state in this land, but the populace in this territory remained 90% the
same as it was before the invasions of the Huns, Avars, Bulgars, Slavs and
Germans. The majority of the people did not come into the Carpathian Basin with
Árpád. They lived there before the Huns and the Avars and spoke a Magyar
language. It is my conclusion that these were the descendants of a Magyar-speaking
peasantry who were the Scythian, later called Sarmatian people from the millennia
before Christ."17
In his book: “Anonymus és a magyarság eredete” (Anonymus and the origin of the
Hungarians) Marjalaki Kiss Lajos quotes a list of Magyar geographical names including

lakes and rivers, which he attributes to the 12th century historian “Anonymus”, writing in the Gesta Hungarorum.18
Historians in the first millennium AD called the people of the Carpathian Basin
Scythians, Huns, Avars, Parthians and Magyars, interchangeably. That was not disputed
until 1849, when the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, under Austrian pressure, declared
the Magyars to be a Finno-Ugric people and denied their relationship to the Huns, based on the work of János Sajnovics: Demonstratio. Idioma Ungarorum et Lapponum idem esse
published in 1770. Modern historians treat these peoples as completely separate entities
and do not recognize the fact that they were related.
If we accept that a Magyar-speaking people inhabited the Carpathian Basin in
ancient times, then it is obvious that the Celts encountered them during their migrations to
the West.
Kevin Duffy, writing about the Celts, stated,
“Numerous countries, all the way across Europe from Hungary to Germany,
Switzerland, France, Britain and Ireland, could legitimately claim the ancient continental
Celts as ancestors.” 19 In the case of Hungary and the Magyars, it is the reverse. They
can claim the Celts not as their ancestors but as their descendants!
Who were the Celts?
Gerhard Herm calls them, “The people who came from the darkness”.20 Other writers
simply say that the Celts “appeared” in the Hallstatt region of Austria from 500 BC onwards. Peter Berresford Ellis says that they “suddenly erupted in all directions through
Europe.”21 John Davies writes, “The Hallstatt culture evolved from that of the Urnfield
People” between 1500 BC and 1000 BC.22 If they evolved as he says, then they must have
evolved from the indigenous people of the Carpathian Basin, i.e. the Magyar-speaking
people, and their language therefore should show some relationship to the Magyar
language. In fact, Sándor Timaru-Kast has examined the linguistic similarities between the
Celtic (Irish) language and the Magyar language, listing many cognates and similar
grammatical structures. If they inhabited the Carpathian Basin, there should be
archaeological evidence of the Celtic presence there. Having read many books by Western
authors specializing in Celtic studies, I have found references to Celtic finds in Slovakia,
Yugoslavia and Romania, [all part of the Carpathian Basin and part of Hungary prior to
1920] but very few references to Celtic finds in truncated Hungary except for John Davies, who writes, “So rich is Hungary in Celtic gold objects that an entire room of the National
Museum at Budapest is devoted to them.”23
However, since 1987, a series of seven volumes has been published by the
Hungarian Academy of Sciences, in English, written by Magdolna Hellebrandt and edited by Tibor Kovács, Éva F. Petres and Miklós Szabó, entitled, “Corpus of Celtic Finds in

Hungary”. It is obvious that there was a large population of Celts in the Carpathian Basin.
Some of the graves contained inhumations and some cremations. In the Preface of Volume
III, we read that the majority of Early Iron Age and Celtic cemeteries of Hungary have not been excavated. “Systematic excavation in the future will undoubtedly contribute to a
better knowledge of to what extent individual artefact types and customs are rooted in
earlier ages, in the Scythian or pre-Scythian period.”
The Irish Book of Invasions (in Irish, Lebor Gabála Érenn = The Book of the
Taking of Ireland), describes five invasions of Ireland. The first four are based on myths,
and the peoples who invaded Ireland are pictured as gods. The fifth is the invasion of the
Milesians, led by Miled. Thomas Rolleston tells us,
Miled, whose name occurs as a god in a Celtic inscription from Hungary,
is represented as a son of Bilé. Bilé, like Balor, is one of the names of the god of
Death, i.e., of the Underworld. They came from ‘Spain’- the usual term employed
by the later rationalising historians for the Land of the Dead.24
“Bál” or “Bél” was a Sumerian sun-god, and the name occurs frequently in Hungary
as a male name, Béla, or as part of geographical names such as Lake Balaton. It can also
be found in Wales, in Lake Bala. This name originated from the Palóc people of Hungary,
where it is still a frequent name, originally the name of the Sun. It is worth noting that in
Celtic traditions, on May 1, the holiday of Beltane (Irish: Bealtaine) commemorates the
Celtic god of fire. The May tree is the symbol of the holiday of Beltane and of the god
Bel.25 The Hungarians still celebrate May Day. It is a very ancient tradition. Thomas Rolleston links the Milesians with the Celts, “With the Milesians we begin to come into
something resembling history - they represent, in Irish legend, the Celtic race; and from
them the ruling families of Ireland are supposed to be descended.”26 He says that later Irish
accounts, trying to reconcile the myths with Christianity, relate that their place of origin is
in Spain or Scythia. In fact, in the Declaration of Arbroath, 1320, the Scots declare that
they came from Scythia.
There were, of course, many Celtic settlements in Spain, where the Celts and
Iberians intermingled and became known as Celt-Iberians in the 5th and 4th centuries BC.
Peter Berresford Ellis mentions the “invasions” of Ireland and talks of Mile Easpain
(Soldier of Spain) or Milesius (Miled), who was identified as an Iberian Celt who traveled
the world, selling his military services. He married the daughter of the Pharaoh of Egypt,
whose name was Scota and who eventually gave her name to Scotland.27
Tamara Talbot-Rice sees an overlap between the Celts in the West and the Scythians in the East. “This shows that the western Scyths and eastern Celts were in some
sort of touch with one another.”28 She also writes, “The Scythians vanished from the pages
of history as abruptly as they had entered;”29 Perhaps they were no longer called Scythians,
but Celts. She writes that an archaeologist named Párducz, excavating graves in Hungary,
found that Celtic and Scythian remains were intermixed. He found the same thing in
24 Rolleston, Thomas: Myths and Legends of the Celtic Race, 1911, p. 130.

Transylvania.30 Tadeusz Sulimirski supports this view, stating that the Celts advanced as
far east as the Lower Volga. Articles of jewelry, brooches of various types made sometimes of silver “including the tendrilled type ‘with the foot turned over’ deriving from those
introduced by the Celts (the Bastarnae),” were found in graves on the Lower Volga.31 He
tells us that the Bastarnae were a Celtic people, called Galatians by ancient writers. Around
280 BC, they crossed the Carpathians and settled along the Dnyester and the Pruth Rivers, “mingling with the indigenous Getae, the Scythians and the Sarmatians”.32 Sulimirski
states that they appear to have penetrated farther eastward because numerous La Tène finds
have been excavated in the graves west of the River Dnieper.
Several writers mention the Cimmerians. Gerhard Herm says that the Scythians,
pressing toward the West between 800 and 700 BC, drove the Cimmerians into Asia
Minor.33 Barry Cunliffe says that they were pushed into the Carpathian Basin followed by
the Scythians.34
To talk of these incomings as Cimmerian or Scythian is to oversimplify. For this
reason, Hungarian archaeologists prefer to call the early phase the Mezőcsát
culture and the later phase the Szentes-Vekerzug culture, after two of the most
representative Hungarian cemetery sites.
Gerhard Herm mentions that there was a tribe called the Cimbri, who, along with
the Teutons, invaded central Europe from a northerly direction. He says that the intruders
must have belonged to the same Cimbri who had lived on the Black and Azov Seas, who
were driven out by the Scythians and moved to Asia Minor. A small group of them went
north, settled on Chersoneus Cimbrica, modern Jutland, and then marched south again.35
Nora Chadwick supports this theory, and states that the Cimbri spoke a Celtic language.36 She includes the Teutones among the Celts. “Moreover, (Teutones) is itself cognate with a
Celtic common noun tuath (cf. Welsh tud ‘people’)” Thus, says Herm, the Cimbri and the
Teutones were “the most Celtic of the Celts.” When the Celts were pushed farther toward
the West and settled in Wales, the Cimbri became known as Cymru.
What did the Celts call themselves? Barry Cunliffe37 says that they called
themselves Celtae/Keltoi, which is why the Roman and Greek historians used these names. Some Roman historians called them Galli or Galatae. Caesar called them Celtae or Galli.
Returning to Gerhard Herm’s statement that the Celts “came from the darkness”, we might
assume that they came from the East. Professor Tibor Baráth, in his book The Early
Hungarians, says that Henri Hubert, the most eminent French specialist of the Celts, states
that their name contains the root-word Kel “implying the idea to rise”.38 He goes on to
state that in Hungarian, the word Kel means “to rise”, and the word Kelet means East,
where the sun rises, thus concluding that the Kelti or Celts came from the East. He does

not believe that they were Indo-European. All other western writers state that the Celtic
homeland was in Central Europe and that the Celts were Indo-Europeans. John Davies writes, “Proto-Celtic could have crystallized out of Indo-European in situ.”39 In other
words, Proto-Celtic could have evolved from the language of the ancient people who
inhabited the Carpathian Basin, whether they were Indo-European or not.
Professor Davies continues, “Yet, if there is a majority scholarly view at all at
present, it is that Celtic evolved between 1500 and 1000 BC, probably in the region
between the Danube and the Rhine.”40 Barry Cunliffe writes about a “central Celtic
linguistic zone” comprising Gaul, the British Isles, Ireland, Iberia and the Lepontic area.
He says that if we accept that a Celt was one who spoke Celtic, “it enables the uncoupling
of ‘Celt’ from the archaeologically defined La Tène culture, by demonstrating that the
Celtic language was spoken considerably earlier than the development of La Tène culture
and over a more extensive area.”41
He also states, “How far back in time a distinctive Celtic language could be
discerned is a matter of pure guesswork and will ever remain so, but some observers are
content to see its origins in the Neolithic period in the fifth millennium BC.”42 If that is so,
then the Magyar language, which Grover Krantz believes was spoken in the Mesolithic era,
predates the Celtic language, which means that the Magyar-speaking populace of the
Carpathian Basin were ancestors of the Celts.
Tibor Baráth tells us that Camille Julien (from Paris) estimates that a hundred
million Europeans spoke the Kelti language in the second half of the first millennium BC.
He says that the Celtic language can be deciphered by using Hungarian, and he comes to the conclusion, “The name Kelti or Keleti was the general term designating all the
Hungarian speaking ethnic groups” in central and western Europe.43
John King, in Kingdoms of the Celts, lists Herodotus, Aristotle, Sotion,
Poseidonius, Julius Caesar, Cicero, Polybius, Diodorus of Sicily (Diodorus Siculus) and
Timageneus, and, in the Christian era, Strabo, Pomponius Mela, Lucian, Pliny, Tacitus,
Suetonius, Dion Chrysostom and Clement of Alexandria as writers who described the Celts as “peoples whom they were, in varying degree, keen to characterize as barbaric, alien,
uncivilized or threatening. All their accounts, therefore, are unreliable to some extent.”44
Most of the classical authors write their descriptions of the Celts by quoting earlier
writers, but some of them were more directly acquainted with the Celts, such as Julius Caesar and Tacitus, and they can be counted as more reliable sources. “We are forced to
rely on the accounts of classical authors, who had great difficulty distinguishing between
Celts, Germans and Scythians.”45 Here again is mention of the Scythians.
Just as Hungarian history has been written by the enemies of Hungary, so too was the history of the Celts. Peter Berresford Ellis writes, “In AD 54 the Roman emperor
Claudius officially prohibited the Druids by law. It was an obvious move for Rome to make:
in order to conquer any people and absorb them, you first have to get rid of their

intellectuals and destroy their cultural knowledge.”46 He says that the conquerors rewrote
the history books (just as the Hapsburgs did to the Hungarians). “As is always the way of
conquerors, the people they seek to conquer are denigrated and painted in the worst
possible light.”47
Peter Berresford Ellis tells us that archaeology has disproved the picture of the Celts
as hordes of nomadic warriors, attacking and looting. They were actually farmers who grew
crops like wheat, barley, rye and oats, hemp and flax. They also grew beans, peas and
lentils and raised animals: sheep, cattle and pigs.48 The Roman historians portray them as
“head-hunters” because they cut off the heads of defeated warriors and displayed them in their houses. Berresford Ellis says that they did not go out looking for heads. “Decapitation
only took place after the victims were slain in battle or died, and then only if they were
deemed worthy of respect.” He also tells us that the Celts believed that the soul resided in
the head, and, quoting Strabo, that they believed that the soul was indestructible. By
keeping the head of an enemy, they may have thought that the spirit was also controlled.49
The Celts were also masters of invention. They built the roads in Europe that later
became known as Roman roads.50 Kevin Duffy tells us that they invented chain armor,
horse-shoes, the first mechanical harvester, the iron ploughshare and the first rotary flour mill. Most surprisingly, “The Greeks credit the Celts with having invented soap.”51
John Davies reports that the Celts invented trousers.52 Yet the Scythians are credited
with inventing that article of clothing. Discussing the costume of the Celts, Tamara TalbotRice relates, “Their profusely trimmed trousers were very like those worn by the Scyths on
the Chertomlyk vessel.”53 Renate Rolle also mentions trousers in her description of the
national costume of the Scythians, “The long braided tunics are of embroidered, fur
trimmed leather. Trousers, embroidered lengthways and soft ankle length boots complete
their outfit.”54 She also gives an amusing description of how the Greeks were instructed to
mount their horses since they did not wear trousers like the Scythians.55
Tibor Baráth writes that the history books mention that around 300 BC the name Scythian abruptly vanished and the Kelti name made its appearance. “It follows that the
‘Celts’ must have been an amalgam of the previous non-Indo-European inhabitants of
Europe.”56 He calls them the first Europeans.
Furthermore, he lists the similarities of the most striking characteristics of the
Scythians and the Celts: a fortified place protected by embankments, ditches and hedges,
the animal images in their art, their love of horses, and sun worship. We might add their
practice of collecting the heads of their enemies, their love of gold and jewelry, their
costume (trousers and tunics), their use of mirrors, their love of wine and feasting, their

love of music and dance, their horse-burials and kurgans or tumulus graves containing
wagons. They liked to play board games; the Celts played a game similar to chess and the
Scythians an unknown board game found on a carpet in a Pazyryk grave. Of course both
peoples practiced agriculture and used hemp for their medicine men (druids, magi) to
induce trances. Pliny wrote that the Celts called their magi druids. Atilla Grandpierre has written
extensively about the magi of the Scythians and the Magyars in his article The Ancient
People of the Royal Magi.57 The druids of the Celts were very skilled in medicine, even
surgery. Peter Berresford Ellis writes,
“We know that surgical medicine was advanced in the Celtic world... We know
from the skulls of several skeletons that the Celts often did neurosurgery and were
adept at the trephining operation, making circular cuts into the skull in order to
relieve pressure in the case of head injuries.”58
Etelka Toronyi,59 a Hungarian archaeologist, writes that in Bronze Age graves in
the Carpathian Basin, trepanned skulls have been found but states that the practice of
trepanation appears to have been discontinued at the end of the Bronze Age, returning with
the Magyars in the ninth century AD. This indicates that the people who practiced
trepanation migrated out of the Carpathian Basin to the East, returning as Magyars in the
ninth century. They obviously also migrated west as Celts, since trepanned skulls have
been found in England and Ireland.
Another strange custom described by Etelka Toronyi was that of shaping the heads
of newborns to achieve an elongated skull. These elongated or “macrocephalic” skulls were
found in Bronze Age cemeteries in the Carpathian Basin and the first mention of them was
in the writings of Hippocrates 2400 years ago. This custom also disappeared from the
Carpathian Basin cemeteries at the end of the Bronze Age, returning with the Huns. Such
skulls have been found in Hun graves of the sixth century AD. Brezezinski and Mielczarek, in their book, The Sarmatians, write that the custom of skull distortion appeared among the
early Sarmatians and Alans.60
According to the anthropological data, the Sarmatian graves in the Carpathian
Basin are totally identical to the Hun graves in Central Asia.61 Therefore, we can state that
the Carpathian Basin Sarmatians were actually Huns. Otto Maenchen-Helfen states that the
pottery, agriculture, costumes and dwellings of the Huns were similar to those of the
Sarmatians.62
Tadeusz Sulimirski tells us that the Sarmatians’ way of life and their economy was
similar to that of the Scythians. Their dress and customs were also not much different than
that of the Scythians.63 Their grave goods were of the Scythian type.64 Brezezinski and Mielczarek write that the Asiatic Scythians and the Sarmatians were generally related.65

According to Sulimirski, they may be called Scytho-Sarmatians. He mentions that some of
the early writers called them the Royal Sarmatians, who took over leadership of the tribes
of ancient Scythia from the Royal Scythians.66 The Sarmatians displaced the Scythians
forcing them to migrate in a westerly direction. Eventually the Sarmatians followed and
settled in the Carpathian Basin.
The Romans, on the basis of a military agreement with the Sarmatians, sent large
numbers of Sarmatians to aid them in their occupation of Celtic Britain. Susan Tomory has studied the Sarmatian presence in England and Wales in her book, A New View of the
Arthurian Legends (unpublished). She has also written an article about the Scottish
Scythian relationship which will be presented later.
The Celts are often called “the people of iron” because they perfected the use of
iron to make their weapons and tools. But before iron there was bronze, and in the Bronze
Age, according to John Dayton, a professor at the University of London, Institute of
Archaeology, there was a large population in the Carpathian Basin producing bronze tools
and weapons and conducting extensive trade with the Middle East.67
Dr. Sándor Nagy also believes that the Carpathian Basin was densely populated
before the Indo-European migrations; therefore the “Aryans” (Indo-Europeans) had to go
farther north to find territories in which they could settle:
“At the time of the Aryan migration, the Aryans were forced to move up to
the sixtieth parallel, although they would have preferred to settle in the Carpathian
Basin, which was located fifteen hundred kilometers farther south, where the
climate was much pleasanter and the soil much richer. That indicates that the
Carpathian Basin could not have been such a sparsely populated region as the
“Vogul” theorists state.”68
It should be no surprise that the Carpathian Basin was a densely populated area
during the Bronze Age, when we consider that man had lived in this area for millennia.
Archaeologists have found human remains of 94 people dating back 2.5 million years. The
skull found at Vertesszöllős dates back 500,000 years.69 John Dayton believes that the
discovery of metallurgy took place in the Carpathian Basin and continued its development
in this area.70 He states that the European Bronze Age preceded that of the Near East.71
Dayton believes that the movement of peoples was the reverse of that accepted by
historians. He says that the movement of technology was into and not out of the Near East.72
In 2008, Eszter Bánffy the head of the Department of Sciences at the Hungarian
Academy of Sciences, stated in an interview:
It was formerly believed that every Southern European civilization came
from Mesopotamia, and artifacts found farther to the northwest were of a later date.
This concept has been rejected because it has come to light recently that those

northern finds that earlier were believed to be the same age as the Mesopotamian
artifacts of the end of the third millennium BC., are in fact 1500 years older.”73
There was a big production center of bronze artifacts and tools at Velem St. Vid in
Hungary and evidence of active trade. Velem St. Vid is in western Hungary, not far from
the Hallstatt area in Austria, where Celtic articles were found, worked in iron, and where
salt was mined. At that time there was no Hungary and no Austria. It is possible that the
ancient Bronze Age population of the Carpathian Basin evolved into the Iron Age people who became known as Celts. In fact, in “Celts: Europe’s People of Iron, (Time Life Books,
1994) this same premise is stated:
“Around the start of the first millennium BC, a new culture took root and
began to leave its traces. Skilled in bronze-work, these Europeans eventually
became masters of iron as the technology for smelting ore ... Early Greek
geographers referred to them in written works as the Keltoi.”
Olivia Vlahos, writing about the Celts, says that the Hallstatt people bore a great
resemblance to the Urnfield folk, who might also have spoken a Celtic language.74 In fact, the Hal in Hallstatt and many other place-names is a Celtic word in Welsh, meaning salt.
Barry Cunliffe writes: “Urnfield developments in the Hungarian region preceded
those in the Alpine zone to the west ...”75 This would indicate a migration from East to
West. In fact, Gerhardt Herm tells us that the Scythians, in their movement toward the
West, must have encountered the Urnfield people.76 Barry Cunliffe states that the Urnfield
culture developed in the heart of Europe as early as the thirteenth century BC in the region
that is now Hungary and western Romania.77
Returning to the language of the Celts, we know that it was not recorded in written
documents because the Druids committed everything to memory. Celtic words are found
on stone inscriptions and on coins, and manufacturers’ names are found on pottery. The
first Celtic coins were struck in Transylvania.78 Several historians, such as Christiane
Éluère79 attribute the Celts with naming rivers and other topographical markers. However,
if the Celts evolved from the indigenous people of Europe, it is more than likely that they
adopted the geographical names from the ancient population.
Gerhard Herm states: “From old river names, we may conclude that, around the
middle of the second millennium BC in the whole region between the Baltic and the Alps,
the British Isles and Hungary, a single idiom predominated.” He calls this language Old
European, not Indo-European.80
In the 18th century, Rasmus Rask and Franz Bopp, well-accepted linguists, considered that the Celtic language had been spoken in Europe “before the coming of the

Indo-European speakers.”.81 Later, however, it became accepted by historians that Celtic
was a member of the Indo-European family, and Rasmus Rask and Franz Bopp changed
their minds and accepted the view of the Indo-European linguists.
The Indo-European hypothesis, and it remains a hypothesis because there are no
known speakers of such a language, nor are there any written remains, developed during
the 17th and 18th centuries from studies of comparative linguistics. August Schleicher, a
German linguist, is credited with reconstructing the Proto-Indo-European language (PIE)
which represents the common language of the Proto-Indo-Europeans. This is the language
from which all the European and Indian language families are supposed to have developed.
Linguists generally believe that the Hungarian language does not belong in the
Indo-European language family. They state that it belongs in the Finno-Ugric family
because it is very different from any of the other European languages, and although they
see many words in Hungarian that are similar to words in other European languages, they
attribute this to the fact that Hungarians borrowed these words during their nomadic
wanderings. They have not even considered the possibility that the other European
languages might have borrowed words from the Hungarian language. Susan Tomory has
found 640 Magyar-English cognates and Professor Andor Paposi Jobb more than 2000. In
a letter to Susan Tomory, Dr. Gwion Davies, son of the founder of the Welsh National
Library, wrote the following:
Your finding ancient connections between the Magyar and Celtic languages
gives the preservation of those languages a far greater importance than that of
encouraging people, who speak them to feel that they are as good as any other
language. (...) Apart from that kind of status of the Welsh language, its possible
connections with Central European languages give it a hair-raising dignity – as
the finding of an ancient stone axe can be so stirring, in taking you back to ancient
times. It arouses a feeling of wonder, such as we get when we see the sky at night,
and the cleverness and beauty of the life around us. To think that the Welsh people
may be speaking a language descended from that spoken by proud horsemen of the
Asiatic steppes. That, if it were true, would give a lot more meaning to our national
emblem, the Red Dragon. Another very intriguing aspect of that article is the
Asiatic origin of the (Sarmatian) dragon, because it brings us a lot nearer to
Schliephak’s “hunting” grounds, in his search for the dragon and bull’s horn
motifs, on his travels from S. E. Asia to Siberia.
Dr Gwion Davies continues,
I am astonished at the apparent Celto-Magyar connections illustrated in
one of your enclosures. For instance, near Cambridge there are some low hills
known to this day as the “Gog-Magog” Hills. To think that the name has a
Scythian-Magyar origin – it amazes me. Again, on the lists of Gaelic, Magyar and
English words compared, a Welsh one would be an interesting addition. For
example, the first word, “mag” in Magyar for “seed/son” is our word in Welsh for
“seed”, as applied to the very young blue mussels when they settle. One word for
“son” is “mab” (long in both cases). The name for man is “vir” in Irish, and “gwr”
in Welsh... The Hungarian name of “Manyó” for “old woman” can be compared
with the South-western Welsh name of “menyw” for “woman”. I think that this
came from the Irish settlements there long ago, as the North Welsh word is “Dynes”
81 Davies, John: The Celts, London, 2000. p. 173-174.

(Dyn is Man). Very interesting likeness between Balaton and our Llyn (Lake) Bala
in Wales. Again, the Rivers “Don” near Aberdeen and at Doncaster – had these
indeed, ancient Magyar origins?
Although it is generally believed that the Hungarian language stands alone and
is unrelated to any of the other European languages except Finnish, there is established
research comparing Hungarian to more than sixty languages, which are completely isolated
from each other. Is it possible that the Hungarian language is related to these languages? Adorján Magyar suggests that the Hungarian language is the lender rather than the
borrower.82 Sándor Kőrősi Csoma, the author of the Tibetan-English dictionary, identified
240 Sanskrit words with Hungarian words. József Aczél stated that the Magyar people had
a close connection with the Greeks.83 Ármin Vámbéry established a Turkish-Magyar
connection.84 Bálint Gábor Szentkatolnai studied the Mongol-Magyar connection.85
Christoff Sonngott researched the Armenian-Magyar similarity. Zsigmond Varga
researched the Sumerian-Hungarian connection.86 László Szabédy studied the Latin
Magyar connection. Géza Kúr researched the Etruscan-Magyar identity.87 Dr. Mário Alinei, in his book: Ősi kapocs (Ancient links) considers the Etruscans to be the
descendants of the Magyars, and the above-mentioned Tibor Baráth proposed the
Egyptian/Magyar connection. János Fadrusz studied the similarities between the Magyar
Runic Script and the Etruscan alphabet, finding all the letters identical except four. Adorján
Magyar, who studied the Etruscan numerical system, found similarities between the
Etruscan runic numerals and the Hungarian runic numerals. He considered the Etruscan
runic script to be a later version of the ancient Magyar runic script and a more deteriorated
one at that.88
Adorján Magyar writes that it is an established fact that if a people obtained
knowledge of an object from another people, then they also adopted the name of that object.
The uniqueness of the Hungarian language is that its vocabulary shows a close relationship
to most other European languages. This quality led European linguists to state that the
Hungarian language was a language of borrowings taken from all the European nations.
Research into the antiquity of the Hungarian language began in the seventeenth
century and continues to this day, but it is not sanctioned by the Hungarian Academy of
Sciences. Researchers independent of the Academy have conducted research into the
relationship of Hungarian to many other languages, notably to the Sumerian language and,
in the 20th century, chairs of Sumerology were established in many countries.
Colonel Henry Rawlinson was the first to discover the link between the Sumerians
and the Hungarians. He discovered the Behistun inscriptions on a cliff in Iran in 1853. With
the help of the Magyar language spoken by his assistant Jácint Rónai, a Benedictine father,

Colonel Rawlinson was able to decipher the inscriptions. On this basis, Colonel Rawlinson
declared that the cuneiform was written in a "Scythian" language.89
Colonel Rawlinson and his team of scholars approached the Hungarian Academy
of Sciences in Budapest, hoping that the Academy would embrace their discovery and
continue their research. However, in 1853, Hungary and the Academy of Sciences were
under the oppressive political, social and cultural control of Austria. Under such
circumstances, it was not possible for the Hungarian scholars to work freely and objectively
for the identification of the cuneiform writings.
The research of the Hungarian-Sumerian connection was taken up by foreign
scholars. Jules Oppert in 1869, A.H. Sayce in 1870, and François Lenormant in 1874, all
published their research in their own countries. The Austrian-appointed professors of the
Hungarian Academy of Sciences flatly rejected the research of Lenormant, Oppert and
Sayce. Joseph Budenz, who did not speak Hungarian, yet who was appointed Professor of Hungarian Linguistic Science, stated, "The cuneiform writing is not a Ural-Altaic idiom.”90
There was no chair at the Academy of Sciences for the research and teaching of any
theory of ancient origins other than the Finno-Ugric theory. In the nineteenth century, Jules
Oppert, François Lenormand, A. J. Sayce, Colonel Rawlinson and others acknowledged
the linguistic connections between the Sumerians and the Hungarians, but they did not find
a large enough number of cognates to prove their theory. Only after World War I did the
Hungarian scholars begin to study the relationship between the Hungarian and Sumerian
languages.
Ida Bobula, Professor of Sociology and Anthropology at Ricker College 1951
1959, found 535 Hungarian words identical to Sumerian words in the Sumerian lexicon of
Anton Deimel. This significant discovery revived the dormant theories of the nineteenth
century researchers of Sumerology. The research of Ida Bobula and Zsófia Torma
motivated Kálmán Gosztony, a professor at the Sorbonne University in Paris, to continue
the research of the Sumerian-Hungarian connections. He expanded the number of
Sumerian-Hungarian cognates to 1200 and presented sixty grammatical rules that were
identical in Sumerian and Hungarian.91 He found that among 53 Sumerian grammatical
characteristics, 51 are identical to the Hungarian, and only 21 are identical to the Finno
Ugric languages.92 János Galgoczy, Ede Somogyi, Ida Bobula, Zsigmond Varga, and
Kálmán Gosztony have since researched the Sumerian/Hungarian connection and
discovered over 2000 cognates and many grammatical similarities between the two
languages.93

In recent times, the study of the Magyar-Sumerian relationship has taken a back
seat and other fields of research have opened up to study the antiquity of the Magyar
language. As the most ancient language in Europe, it is obvious it had an influence on all
the European languages, including Celtic and Scythian.
If the Hungarians are related to the Celts and the Scythians, and the Celtic and
Scythian languages are counted among the Indo-European languages, then Hungarian must
also belong in that family. Conversely, the Celtic and Scythian languages could be, along
with Hungarian, non-Indo-European. This gives future linguists much food for thought.

THE LAND OF THE CELTS94
The sad fate of the Celtic people, their fierce struggle for freedom and their unmerciful destiny
Who were these legendary people, who had such a great influence on the ancient
chroniclers?
The Greek and Roman chroniclers of the fifth century BC write about them and
describe them as a powerful people. They moved on horseback at full speed from the
Atlantic Ocean to the Black Sea, tended their flocks, tilled their land, mined their metals
and forged their terrifying iron weapons. They honored the memories of their bravest
warriors by burying them in huge kurgans and pit-graves and they also buried carriages
with them, in the manner of the Sumerians, the Sabirs and the Scythians. They built huge
circular churches and shrines, tended holy trees, groves and springs, which were all centers
of their spiritual and religious life, where the Táltos95 (holy men) and Druids performed
the ceremonies, blessed the newborns, performed marriages, ministered to the sick, made
sacrifices to their gods of bulls and white horses, sang the ancient folk songs and trained
the future holy-men. They cooked the plants used during sacrifice in cauldrons. It has now
been established that the Celtic people were not a primitive barbarian society of robbers,
in spite of statements by some Roman “propagandists”. With the aid of archaeology, it has
been proven that the Celtic civilization was equal to that of the Romans. Our eyes have
now been opened to the high level of culture of the Celts. The Romans adopted numerous
Celtic weapons and incorporated names and words of Celtic origin into the vocabulary of
their Latin language, e.g. gladius (from Celtic calad – sword – Hu: KARD).
Peter B. Ellis96 writes that archaeology has shown the prosperous, well-developed
and rich nature of the agricultural society of the early Celts, as well as their advanced skills
in the areas of art, pottery, goldsmith’s work, enameling, and metallurgy. In the first
century before Christ, in Caesar’s Rome, there was a great demand for the British woolen
goods, particularly the “sagi”, the Celtic woolen robe, Hu: ZEKE, ZSÁK, Eng: jerkin,
sack, which originally meant cloak. Here we can see how false the propaganda of Caesar
was, for he dared to state that the Celts did not know how to weave. At that time in Europe,
the free medical attention and the organization of hospitals, which was required according
to Celtic law, were incomparable (Ellis).
94 Translated by Margaret Botos 95 The Táltos were a high priestly class. Nobody can simply become a táltos, they are chosen by God, and fulfill their calling by His grace. (Editor) 96 Ellis, Peter Berresford: Die Druiden - von der Weisheit der Kelten, Munich, 1996; pp. 27.-35.

The ancient Celtic civilization, was described mainly by the Greeks and Romans as
a society of wild fighters, who were proud, ignorant and uncivilized, who took life
lightly, and lived with childish pleasure, often drinking themselves into a stupor.
[...] Even today, we imagine them living somewhat in this way, although this is
nowhere near the truth. [...] One of the greatest skills of the Celts was that of road
building. Their knowledge in this area was at one time often doubted but, in recent
times, archaeological research has established the existence of well-laid Celtic
roads. With this, the myth of the Roman roads has been set in its place and science
has accepted the fact that many Latin expressions, for ideas in transportation in
particular, were taken over from the Celts. [...]97
The result of their developed agricultural system was over-population. The Celtic
migrations began in 450 BC. They occupied Northern Italy and the Anatolian Galata too.
At that time, they entered upon a war with Rome. At first, the Celtic tribes had several
victories; they even took Rome in 387 BC and looted her. However, from the beginning of
the third century BC, when the power of Rome increased with her victory over the
neighboring Umbrian and Samnite tribes and also over the Etruscans, she began her
expansion into the lands inhabited by the Celts. Since the Celts, like the Scythians, did not
establish a world empire, but lived in tribal societies, forming small states, it was easy for
the well-organized Roman legions, with their superior force, to conquer them. In addition
to this, in the second century before Christ, the Celts were pressed on both sides; Rome
from the south and, from the north, the Germanic tribes, expanding toward the south.
Finally, in 191 BC, after many battles, the Romans succeeded in overcoming the Northern
Italian Senones and Bojiks, and in 133 BC, they conquered Celtiberia (Hispania) too. With
the defeat of the Arverni, Allobroges, Ligurians and Salluvos, in 121 BC, the Roman
Province of Gallia Narbonensis was established in present-day Southern France.98
Between 113 BC and 101 BC, the first Germanic tribes, the Teutons and the Cimbri
invaded the Celtic territories with their destructive force. In 72 BC, the German Suebs
appeared in northern Hessen, under the leadership of Ariovist. Other German tribes joined
Ariovist’s group and they started out toward the south and west of the Rhine. In 61 BC,
they conquered the Celtic Aedui tribe. At that, the (Celtic) Helvetians rose up in 58 BC and
decided that they would move to the south-western part of Gaul, because the German
danger, which already half a century before had forced them out of southern Germany, was
again threatening their homeland in Switzerland. Thus, the last Celtic migration began. By
97 „Die alte keltische Zivilisation wurde vor allem von den Römern und Griechen als eine Gesellschaft wilder Krieger geschildert, die stolz, unwissend und ungebildet waren, das Leben leicht nahmen, kindlichen Vergnügungen frönten und sich häufig betranken.[...] Diese Vorstellungen hegen wir zum Teil auch heute noch, doch sie haben nichts mit der Wirklichkeit zu tun.[...] Eine der herausragenden Fähigkeiten der Kelten war der Straßenbau. Früher wurde ihr diesbezügliches Können häufig angezweifelt, doch in letzteren Zeit haben archäologische Forschungen die Existenz gut angelegter Keltenstraßen bestätigt. Der Mythos von den Römerstraßen wird damit auf seinen rechtmäßigen Platz verwiesen, und die Wissenschaft akzeptiert zunehmend die Tatsache, daß viele lateinische Begriffe für das Transportwesen aus dem
Keltischen übernommen wurden. [...]“ [Ellis, 1996.] (Translated from the German, since the English text was not available to the translator.) 98 Senones, Bojiks, Arverni, Allobroges, Ligurians, Salluvos were all Celtic tribes. Translator.

the tens of thousands, they left their homes, villages and towns, burning everything behind
them. In the capital city of the Allobroges, today known as Geneva, they united with large
numbers of other migrating tribes. The number of fugitives was greater than 368,000, of
whom 92,000 were warriors. Their goal was to cross the bridge over the Rhône in Geneva
and follow the river south so that they could resettle in Southern Gaul. However, the
„merciful” Julius Caesar learned of their plan and immediately ordered the bridge to be
destroyed, since at that time, he was the Proconsul of the province. The negotiations fell
through and the Helvetians chose to take the northern route across the land of the Sequans.
They crossed the mountain passes with two thousand eight-hundred ox-drawn carts. In the
territory of the Aedui, on the banks of the River Saône, they came into conflict with the
Romans, who wanted by any means to prevent their resettlement among their Gallic
brethren. The Helvetian king, Divico, asked for a cease-fire but Caesar demanded hostages.
Divico answered him, “We are used to taking hostages, not giving them”, and he declared
war. At first, the Helvetians were winning but then their attacks came to naught and they
were forced to surrender. Caesar ordered the survivors to return to their homes in
Switzerland. A small group of the Helvetians still live there but, forced by the Germans to
flee to the mountains, they are known as “Raeto-Romans”.
After this, since his interior politics were not popular, Caesar began his destructive
campaigns in Gaul, so that he might be more successful with foreign politics and find
respect and support in the Senate. First, for no reason, he made a surprise attack on one of
the largest and strongest Celtic tribal unions, the Belgians. The Romans attacked the Remi
(the city of Reims was named after them), who were unable to defend themselves from the
surprise attack. The Belgian horsemen organized themselves too, but the legions drove
them back to the River Somme. Caesar also waged campaigns against the Armoricans
(Bretons) on the ocean shores, and demolished their fleets. His goal was to isolate the center
of Gaul. He also dreamed of taking Germania and Britannia (Albion). Caesar’s Gallic Wars
lasted from 58 to 51 BC, and he was able to occupy all of Gaul, but he was not successful
in the British Isles because he did not count on the speed of the British fighters.
The blood-baths carried out by Caesar (e.g. the massacre of the Druids) caused
anger in the occupied Celtic cities. The Gallic tribes then became united for the first time
and, by raising the young prince of the Arverni, Vercingetorix, on their shields, they elected
him their leader. One by one, the cities of Gaul sent their bravest warriors to join the army
of Vercingetorix. They organized a huge national uprising, a “Holy War” as the Druids
called it, against the Roman aggressors. At first, some disputes in distant Rome weakened
Caesar’s fame. Hearing about these, the Celtic tribes of the Carnutes, Senones and Elburoni
began to unite. The Carnutes proposed a national freedom fight. The Council of Druids met
in the forest and gave their blessing to a Holy War of Freedom as the only way to avoid
genocide at the hands of the barbaric Romans. The first goal of the attacks was to erase the
lines of communication, and then they planned to break into southern Narbonensis and fall
upon the cut-off legions of Caesar in the north in the territory of the Aedui. However,
Provence was ready for them and they fought off the attack. The freedom-fighters, using
burnt-earth tactics, retreated to the capital-city of the Biturges, Avarik (today Bourges).
Here the entire military forces of the Celts joined together. After a long and merciless siege,



25
the city fell and the Romans massacred almost the entire populace. Forty thousand Celts
lost their lives in this city. This just served to strengthen the authority of the Arvern leader
over the entire Celtic population. After this the Romans laid an unsuccessful siege to the
Castle of Gergovia, at which the Aedui rose up and killed every Roman in their country.
Caesar hesitated and decided to retreat to Provence.
Now the Gauls were certain of victory but, just as the opportunity arose for them to
expel the occupiers from their country, fate turned against them. Vercingetorix, certain of
victory, remained behind with the infantry and sent three-quarters of his cavalry ahead to
surprise the retreating Roman legions. The horsemen swore that they would not return until
they had twice cut down the enemy army. However, they did not expect the Germans who
appeared on the battlefield to help Caesar’s army. The Roman army turned and pushed
back the shattered Celtic cavalry to the camp of Vercingetorix. The freedom-fighters of
Vercingetorix, with huge losses, returned to the headquarters of the Mandubi, in Alesia.
The speculative Prince of the Arverni sent a unit of the cavalry to drum-up volunteers from
the entire territory of Gaul. With eighty thousand of his bravest warriors, he entrenched
himself in Alesia, with provisions for one month, and hoped that help would soon arrive.
The Romans laid siege to the castle and their ranks could not be crossed. No news could
be taken out of the camp to the Gallic troops offering help, so a disorganized, desperate
struggle began, a battle without an end in sight. During the battle, many Celtic warriors
died heroically, but finally the superior force of the occupiers was victorious.
Vercingetorix, the hero of the freedom-fight, was taken into captivity in 51 BC. During the
course of the Gallic Wars, a total of 800 Gallic towns and villages and three million Celts
fell victim to the Roman barbarians. A head-hunt began for the Celtic leaders and Druids.
At this time, the largest settlement of the Celts was destroyed. The Germanic tribes
gradually moved into what is now Germany, most of the time peacefully, and they
assimilated into the remaining Celts, although there was some „ethnic cleansing”. In Gaul,
the Romanization began. They eliminated the intelligentsia, the Druids, killed the political
leaders, and cast the population into poverty. Roman settlers were brought in, and the use
of the Celtic language was prohibited. In some areas of the country, the population was
taken into slavery and transported to other places in the world. In others, the men were
pressed into armed service, to serve as foreign legions to defend the Empire. In their place,
Roman legions were settled who took the remaining Celtic girls as their wives, and their
children became Roman citizens. These are just some of the “civilized” Roman ways to
annihilate a people and culture. Although the Celtic uprising was unsuccessful, it shook
the whole Roman world. The ensuing civil war against Caesar lasted from 49 BC to 46 BC.
Thus it was only after this interior uprising was put down that Vercingetorix, the Celtic
hero, was executed. Soon after that, on March 15, 44 BC, Julius Caesar, the butcher of the
Gauls, was assassinated in a conspiracy in which his adopted Celtic son participated
(according to Christiane Éluère).
In the following years, the last continental Celts also lost their independence, first
the Galati in 25 BC, then in 15 BC, Noricum north of the Alps as far as the Danube and, in
AD 10, Pannonia also fell into Roman hands. Only in the northern and eastern parts of the
Carpathian Basin were some Celtic tribes able to preserve their independence, like the



26
Anarti, Osi, Kotines, Karpi and a few smaller tribes that, together with the freed
Pannonians, survived the Hun occupation.
After centuries of battles and genocides, in AD 43, after a siege which lasted for
four years, the last British castle, Durnovaria, (Mai Dún – the camp / fortress of the
chieftain Mai) finally fell, and there almost ten thousand Celts lost their lives. However,
even then, the Celtic resistance in the islands did not erupt. It was not until AD 61 that they
rose up under the leadership of Boudicca, the brave queen of the Iceni. The occupying
forces ran down a large part of the cities of Camulodunum (today’s Colchester) and
Londinium (London). Finally, the Romans were victorious, Boudicca committed suicide
and, from AD 77, the greater part of Anglia belonged to the Roman Empire (according to
Christiane Éluère). Only Wales, Ireland and Scotland remained independent until the 9th
century, when the Normans came.
For a short time, between 260 and 274, Gaul and Britain were free, while the
Romans were concentrating all their military strength in holding back the Germanic tribes.
In 260, the independent Gallic state was established, which was dissolved in 274 by
Aurelianus Caesar.99
The Celtic national consciousness still existed during the time of the Hun attacks
on Rome. When Atilla besieged Aureliani (Orleans) during the Gallic campaigns, the
Bagauda in the city (anti-Roman Celts recruited from the lower class), rebelled under the
leadership of Eudoxius (Gallic: AUDAX, Hu: ÁDÁZ ferocious) a Celtic doctor, who had
lived in Atilla’s court since 448.100 Today, we can find only slight traces of this once
powerful and splendid people. Some Celtic states weathered the storms of time to survive
on the perimeter of Western Europe. These are not all independent. Only Ireland, which
since 1171 belonged to Britain, was successful in obtaining her freedom in 1916 and 1922.
Of the “four green meadows” only one part remained independent. One part, Ulster “the
land of Ulaid” (Northern Ireland) is still in foreign hands. However, despite all the
oppression and hardship, the language of the Celts has survived.
CELTIC MAGYARS
Since I live in the West, I like to travel the world and I like to breathe in Europe’s
past and its secrets. The past is all around us. We just need to open our eyes and then we
shall see it. Memories of the past lie everywhere in the dust on the road, and they are
waiting for someone to pick them up. They immediately begin to speak. Their tales are
very exciting; we just have to pay attention.
On my travels with my children, I visited Wales, the land of the Cimmerians
(CYMRU). When the car passed over the Severn Bridge, the border of England and Wales,
and we were already in Wales at the entrance to Casnewydd (Newport), we saw a puzzling

27
sign at the first exit in Wales. On the sign was written: MAGOR / MAGWYR. Intrigued,
we took the exit.
The name of our people (Hungarians, Magyars) has been written and pronounced
in many different ways throughout the course of history. We have been Huns and Ungars,
who threatened the still young, Christian Europe. We were called Avars and Onogurs,
Ugors, Turks, Szabirs, Baskirians, Agerens, Gyaurs etc. but we were never called
Magyars. This is why it was so surprising and heart-stirring to find in a foreign land such
a familiar and impressive sounding name, “Magor” in English, “Magwyr” in Welsh. The
meaning of the name of the little town has been eroded in the mists of time. The owner of
the gas-station at the entrance to the town, who only speaks English, stated that perhaps
the name of the town meant “castle standing on a high hill”. In Hungarian this would be
MAG(as) VÁR / MAGURA = Welsh: MAGWYR. In actuality, before the main square
can be found the ruins of a castle from the tenth or eleventh century, built to protect the
town from the Viking invasions, and in the center of the castle are the ruins of a castle
church. Moreover, the little town (MAGOR) has today almost grown together with a
neighboring village, called UNNI. This is in Great Britain, in Wales, a few miles east of
Caerdydd (Cardiff) on the border with England! This got us all so excited that we
immediately bought an English-Welsh dictionary. Of course, the Welsh language today
has been influenced by Latin and English but there are surprisingly many Magyar words
in it, although the two peoples could not have met in the past and the Celts lived in
isolation. It was exciting to get to know the Welsh language, which tradition calls the
language of Heaven.
I know there are some who will smile and say that this is just a coincidence. We,
Hungarians, who were born in the Finno-Ugric cradle, forced back across the Russian
Steppes by the Turks, and pursued by the Pechenegs into the Carpathian Basin, could have
nothing to do with these people . . . Or could we?
Our journey took us from Magor toward the north. We stopped in BALA, a small
town in North Wales in the Snowdon region. The meaning of Snowdon is snowy plain, in
Hungarian: Havasalföld. It seems that the English name is just as illogical as the
Hungarian, and refers to the same kind of geographical territory, a plain beyond the snowy
peaks, a flat area bordered by a semi-circle of mountains, which serves as a passage
between the mountains and the neighboring shores of the ocean. To my knowledge, the
name Havasalföld (Snowy Plain) is not found anywhere else in the world, just in Hungary
and among the Celts. The town of BALA is situated on the shores of Lake BALA. The
name means a bay or cove off a river or lake, Hu: ÖBÖL (cf. Vogul: BÖL). The lake,
TEGID, was formed when a cliff broke off from the side of the river and blocked its
passage. Here the water rose, Hu: meg-DEGED (cf. Irish-Gaelic: TÓG = lift, raise, build,
rear > TÉAG = substantial, bulky, Hu: meg-DAGAD).
Our last stop among the British Celts was the famous village of LLANFAIR:
LLAN [hlan] originally a clan101, or community, has a religious meaning of church
community + FAIR, (Mary) meaning good, loved or happy, which in Hungarian is
101 The Celtic word: „clan” meant a tribal union. Ir: CLANN = descendants, followers. Its base-word was GAOL ~ CAOL meaning ‘family, extended family, relations. (> Hu: CSAL-ád)



28
Boldogasszony falva or village of the Blessed mother / also Fehéregyháza, or White
Church. The full name of the village is:
LLANFAIRPWLLGWYNGYLLGOGERYCHWYRNDROBWLLLLANTYSILIO
GOGOGOCH which, according to the Welsh, is the longest place-name in the world.
This is one word, which can be expressed in English with 24 words: Saint Mary’s Church
in the hollow of the white hazel, near the rapid whirlpool of the Church of Saint Tysilio of
the red cave. Broken down, it is LLAN-FAIR-PWLL-GWYN-GYLL-GO-GER-Y
CHWYRN-DRO-BWLL-LLAN-TYSILIO-GO-GO-GOCH. LLAN= Church; FAIR =
MARY (good, loved, happy, Hu: FIRTOS – the name of the good fairy); PWLL = hollow
(Hu: VÁLYU – VÖL-gy valley); GWYN = white (cf. Ir: FIONN; Hu: FEHÉR, FÉNY
light); GYLL = hazelnut (Hu: DIÓ, formerly GYIJÓ); GO = to; GER = near; Y = A (the
indefinite article); CHWYRN = rapid; DRO, TRO = turning (Hu: TÉRŐ); BWLL = lake,
basin (PAL- Scythian word meaning lake, Hu: ÖBÖL102); DROBWLL = whirlpool;
(LLANTYSILIO = the church of Saint Tysilio; GOGO = cave; GOCH = red).
Translated into Hungarian, it would look like this:
GYORSTERELŐÖBÖLHÖZKÖZELIFEHÉRMOGYORÓVÖLGY
BOLDOGFALVA
In connection with the Sumerian language, Viktor Padányi called this a chain of
words. In this the Welsh are world champions.
I stood amazed, two and a half thousand kilometers from my home and could hardly
pull myself together. The words of Gyula Fekete (Hungarian poet) came to mind:
The past is what does not allow a nation to die out; the future is what gives her
reason to live. [...] We have a newly emerging historical sin. In that period, when
we should have been creating and building a socialist nation, we were totally
occupied with demolishing our national identity with irreversible consequences.
This is clear to every thinking person...103
Who, then are the Celts? What connections could they have with us, Hungarians?
Elek Benedek writes in Hazánk története104:
102 Scythian „PAL-us Meotis” = the lakes of Meotis; PAL-ki-na (> VOL-chi-nia) name of the Pripety marshes;
Etruscan: BAL-si-na (> Lake BOL-za-no, HU: Lake BAL-aton, VEL-ence, PAL-ics) see Hu: ÖBÖL 
Welsh-Cymraeg BWLL (see Vogul: BÖL = wider part of a river between two bends, looking like a lake); Hu:
PÁLL-ik = changing to water; Hu: PO(L)-csolya = shallow, dirty standing water, puddle.

The first people to live on this land (Hungary), whose name survived, were the
Celtic people, who came out of Asia in the sixth and fifth centuries before Christ.
These people already knew how to work iron, which was more perfect than stone
or bronze. With weapons made of iron, they occupied this territory and became
lords of this land. They worked the land, were occupied with animal husbandry and
were involved in trading...”
When the Celts are mentioned, everyone thinks of the people in the animated film,
Asterix, but do we ever think about the fact that the person who placed the crown on the
head of the first Hungarian King (Stephen) was a Celt, named Asterik? The tourist, who
visits Budapest is taken up to the Gellert Mountain. Here, he finds menhirs preserving the
memory of the Celts. How many Hungarians know that in the 3rd district of Budapest,
there is a Kelta Street, or that Budapest itself was built on the site of an ancient Celtic
settlement, Aquincum?
North of this, rose up the formerly famous Celtic castle of SICAMBRIA, which,
before it was Latinized, was called SICAN105-BHARR, Hu: SZÉK-BERC (a “Szék” or
center on a high hill). Such was the Hungarian word-order at that time, e.g. Hegy-magas
(mountain-high), Becs-kerek (esteem-high), Kereszt-Úr (Cross-Lord) etc. In Irish,
SUÍOCHAN [si:xa:n] means: seat, place, bench; (county)-seat; gathering-place (cf.
ancient Turkish: SÄKU = seat, Tartar: SEKE = bench, Japanese: SEKI = seat, place) +
BARR = peak, crag.
The Huns laid siege to the Roman guard defending the Danube line and, perhaps
with the help of the local Celts, won a glorious victory. Victory in the Celtic language is
BOUDA. Quite possibly they welcomed the incoming Hun regiments with a cry of
pleasure: “Bouda!”. The victorious Huns had a liberating influence on them, because their
society did not know the “merciless” custom of the “civilized” Romans of taking slaves.
Here BUDA castle was founded, the “ancient Buda” which we know from history as
“Atilla’s Castle” (Etzilburg).
It is quite possible that the Celtic-Pannonians and the Hun-Magyars were able to
understand each other, especially when sharing a mug of fine Celtic mead. (Celt: MEDU
= Hu: MEDOS = Hu: MÉZES). We learn from the Greek chronicler, Diodorus, that the
Celts loved to make merry, revel and have fun; they loved to eat, and they ate in an orderly
manner; the lords and the servants ate together, sitting around a huge cauldron of meat.
The warriors, who had fought in a battle, received the best cuts of meat. They chewed on
the large knuckles, but they used the dagger that they wore in a sheath at their side for the
pieces that they could not bite off. While they were eating, bits of food got caught up in
their long, thick moustaches. This imposing moustache served as a sieve and allowed the
sweet drink to pass through. The Celts drank beer and mead, which was wine mixed with
honey: “Zugabe von Wasser und etwas Honig” (Breton: MEZ = Hu: MÉZ = honey). They
often got drunk, got into fights because they were allegedly very short-tempered, and they
105 „He (Paris) immediately liked this paradisical place, and he gave an order that a huge castle be built on the top of the Szikan mountain.” (Tárih-i Üngürüsz, or History of the Magyars).



30
fought till they drew blood. The Celts liked to make merry, Hu: SZÓRAKOZ; Ir:
SORCHA = merry, jolly, SCORAIOCHT = merriment. There were always musicians
(lute-players) at their weddings, as can be seen from a vessel that was discovered in
Sopron; they liked to talk away the time, recite poetry (bards), test their strength in
competitions106, play matches in teams or play chess, which they called FIDCHELL which
means wooden wisdom. Diodorus mentions that on a plaque can be seen a game of war,
played with wooden dolls107, that is, he talks of a FA-CSEL = Hu: FA-JÁTÉK = wooden

Our everyday Hungarian language is so much a part of us that nobody questions
why we use in our daily colloquial language such expressions as SRÁC (kid), CSITRI
(teenage girl), KAMASZ (adolescent), BAKA (foot-soldier), GOBÉ (wily highlander),
BALHÉ (rough-house) or BAKI (slip-up).
There would be nothing surprising about this except that these words also appear
in the Celtic language. In today’s Irish language, the above-mentioned words are as
follows: SRAC-úil (honest, lively, quarrelsome, mischievous boy); CAITHRE (adolescent
girl); BUACHA (young soldier); BACAIN (military training); GOBÁN (funny, wily; jack
of-all-trades); BUALLEY [buahle] (discord, fight, argument) and BACAI (to trip; slip of
the tongue), BAC (barrier, bar)! All these words along with many other concepts are the
“offspring” of the common language that spread in the last century’s industrialization, the
language of the rural communities that moved into the capital city. I don’t believe any of
our linguists would ever think of making a statement that these words were brought from
Ireland by a laborer, as „borrowed” slang. (...)
Unfortunately, our history writing is full of falsified dogmas. The first and most
important is that everything that indicates an important advance in the history of humanity,
which is preserved in exhibits in the world’s large museums, must have been accomplished
by someone who belonged to the great Indo-European people. Therefore, every people
worthy of notice (with a few exceptions, e.g. the Semites) automatically had to be Indo
European (such as the Hittites, the ancient Greeks, the Medes, the Scythians, the Celts
etc.). The second dogma suggests that if the wonders of the world are attributed to the
manual and intellectual talents of other peoples, these peoples have disappeared or have
been lost or destroyed in the tempests of history and there are no traces of them. There are
exceptions here too, the Chinese or the Indians, but the history-books do not tell us which
Chinese, or which Indians. Thus the Mesopotamians (Sumerians), the Egyptians and the
Canaanites etc. have been erased from history. A third dogma that the historians propagate

is that “somewhere in Russia”, where the geographical and climatic conditions could
hardly support life, a people and language developed, called Magyar. László Götz, in his
book: Keleten kél a nap (The sun rises in the East), writes the following:
Our researchers of ancient history search for the ancient homeland of the Ural
Finno-Ugric peoples [...] in geographical territories in which, according to
archaeological research, man could not have lived in the years preceding 4000 BC.
Between 4000 BC and 2000 BC, there are indications of only sparse Paleolithic and
Mesolithic groups, whose numbers, according to the most recent ethnographic
research could not have risen above the average for hunter-fisher-gatherers.109
Let us pause for a moment ... What does this actually mean?
We, Hungarians, were born where it was not possible for a nation to be born, where
the Finno-Ugric language supposedly developed. Because of the sparse population, people
met each other, at the most once a month, to exchange conversation, one on one.
In order to avoid any misunderstanding, I would like to emphasize that it is not that
we are counted as belonging to a Finno-Ugric language family that causes me a problem,
but that, along with this, our students are urged to accept a theory that we were nomads
and also that the whole theory of language families is rather vague and secretive, opening
it up to confusion and, in this confusion making it easier to deceive people.
I was horrified when these words from the Bible came to my mind:
“...when the overwhelming scourge passes, it will not reach us; for we have made
lies our refuge, and in falsehood we have found a hiding-place.” (Isiah. 28, 15-19)
because:
“...that nation that allows its memories to be forgotten prepares its own epitaph.”
(Arnold Ipolyi)
“For there is nothing hidden that will not be made manifest; nor anything
concealed that will not be known and come to light.” (Luke, 8. 17)
Dogma is the true “everlasting truth” because it is the pillar of “our edifice” and to
interfere with it is very dangerous, even a capital sin, because our castle of cards, called
“historical research” would at the same time come crashing down!
The first step should be to establish that the dogmas are mistaken. Let us not replace
them with new theories surrounded by bastions of illusions, ploys, or nationalistic lies. We
should begin our argument with the following basic assumption that: nowhere on this
earth would a people name the objects in their immediate environment with names
that have no meaning in their own language!
109 Götz László: Keleten kél a nap, 1994



32
Of course the immediate official counter-argument would be that, today, we do not
know what language the ancient Near-eastern people, ancient Germans, ancient Celts or
ancient Scythians spoke. Obviously this is true. At the same time, it is a fact that, today, in
Europe and the countries on its perimeter, there are very few meaningful geographical
names but, coincidentally, the map of this region contains a large number of names, such
as place-names, bodies of water or mountains, which have a meaning in Hungarian and
they could not be descended from the Germanic, Romanian or Slavic languages of
today.110
Who founded the first “civilization” in (Western) Europe? THE CELTS!
***
Ephorus, the Greek chronicler from the fourth century BC, lists the Celts as one
of the world’s greatest peoples, along with the Scythians, the Persians and the Libyans.
The Celts populated Europe from the British Isles to Transdanubia and even beyond, to
Scythia and Asia Minor. In around 500 BC, the entire territory of Europe was “in Celtic
hands”. As is well-known, after the Romans tried to prevent them from settling in Northern
Italy, they decimated the enemy legions and even ran down Rome, plundered it (as the
later imperial chroniclers lamented) and occupied it. After a few months, they were forced
to give up Rome because (as always happened at the very best moment) the plague broke
out in the Eternal City.
The Celts were not unknown to the Hungarian chroniclers either. In the first part
of the Illustrated Chronicle, the Book of the Creation, the chronicler refers to Josephus
Flavius and Hieronymus to give a short report on the three sons of Noah: “They scattered
to three different parts of the world, Sam to Asia, Cam to Africa, and Japhet to Europe.”111
From the book of Josephus Flavius, History of the Jews, we know that Japhet had seven
sons (the Hettites, Hittites?), “whose countries extended from the Taurus and Amanus
Mountains in Asia to the River Don (Tanais) and Gadira in Europe. These territories were
quite unpopulated, so the settlers gave their own names to them.” The Jewish historian
also gives us the names of the seven sons of Japhet: Gomar, Magog, Madai, Javán, Tubal,
Mosoch and Thyras. Their peoples took their names from them. “Thus the present-day
Galatians were at one time Gomars and the present-day Scythians were called Magors
after their ancient forefather, Magog.”, wrote Flavius. The Illustrated Chronicle calls the
Galatians, Gauls and writes that, after the fall of Troy, they fled to Pannonia.112 In
summary: the Celts (Gauls, Galatians) are descended from GOMAR, the son of Japhet
see the Celtic name for Wales – CYMRU, and the Magyars (Magors, Scythians) are
descended from his brother, MAGOG. According to the Irish traditions, the first
conquerors of Ireland, Partholon and Nemed, were the descendants of MAGOG!

The earliest known Celtic archaeological finds are from 1000 BC, (finds from the
Austrian town of Hallstatt). These represent the transition between the bronze and iron
cultures. A Scythian kurgan from the Bronze Age was also found here. The settlement
disappeared in the fourth century before Christ, following a landslide. It was followed by
the La-Tène culture, which began around 450 BC. This was a typical Iron-Age settlement.
Friedrich Schwab, who discovered the La-Tène culture, informs us that it was during the
excavations of the region around Lake Neuchâtel (Neuenburgersee) in Switzerland that
they came upon the traces of the ancient settlement that is now covered with water. This
Celtic village was discovered on the eastern shore of the lake where the water was quite
shallow. The local people (the French-speaking Swiss) called this place La-Tène, which
the experts translated as “Untiefe” meaning “shallow” (Hu: ZÁTONY = Ir: ATÓIN)113
The two words have a similar form, pronunciation and meaning = LA TÈNE. That
Hungarians speak a language that belongs to the so-called Finno-Ugric language family,
is possible – and might be proven by the fact that we have many ancient, or supposedly
ancient cognates and a related grammar – only the „presentation” is bad.
In the light of the above statements we may rightly ask:
What language did the Celts speak?
Is the Hungarian language related to the language of the Celts?
Is the Celtic language related to the language of the Magyars?
The influence of the Scythians on the Celts was not just obvious in the metal objects
(first bronze, then later iron) that came to light in the excavations, but it was visible in their
“kurgan” (tumulus) burial customs too. Numerous similar burial mounds (Scytho-Hunnic
mounds) can be found all across the British Isles: near Stonehenge the “Giant”-kurgan and
the famous “crop-circles” in Marlborough in Wiltshire, Newgrange in Ireland, as well as
those in Brittany (e.g. in Carnac, where the famous Celtic causeway, and the tumulus of
Saint Michel can be found).
Unfortunately, we know very little about the identity of the ancient Celts, but these
powerful people have left us a huge material and spiritual legacy. It has come to light that
not only the names of some of their weapons (e.g. CALAD = ‘gladius’ sword) but words
connected to all kinds of technical developments passed from the Celtic language to the
Latin language. Moreover, researchers have established that the network of roads,
crisscrossing Europe was not built by the Romans but by the Celts, in the period before
the Roman occupation. They used these roads for their CARBANTU, their ox-drawn carts:
CAR cart, BAINT connection, Hu: VONT connected, VONAT train.114
The official linguists state that the Celtic language was Indo-European, although
the few geographical names, names of gods or important people that remain to us – in a
Latinized form – from Ireland, across Gaul to Hungary, show very few Indo-European
characteristics. Thus ANU (Hu: ANYA = mother), is the ancient mother, the “Mother of
113 George/Brown/Anker: Die Kelten: Europas Volk der Eisenzeit, Time/Life. 1995, p. 28. 114 Ellis, P. B: ‘Die Druiden’ / ‘Die Kelten: Europas Volk der Eisenzeit’



34
all the Irish gods”.115 ESUS (Hu: ŐS = ancestor), the name of the ancient god of the Gauls
(cf: Welsh: OES, Breton: OET = old, ancient), or the Irish DAGHDHA = the “Good God”
(cf: Old Irish DAGH, Welsh: IACH = good, Hu: JÓ and Ir: (A)DHA – Hu: ATYA = father)
who was the son of ANU, the mother goddess and BÉL the old father god, and thus the
ancient father of all the Irish; or the name of the Irish chieftain, ULAID, who was “the first
in his land” (cf. Hu: ELŐD ancestor, “the first one”). See also the modern Irish “Cúige
Ulaidh” – “the province of Ulaid (Előd)” – the name of Northern Ireland – the English
“Ulster”.
If we think about the name of the hero of the Gallic freedom fight:
VERCINGETORIX116 and his castle of AVARICUM it would be difficult to establish
without a doubt that these are words or names of Indo-European origin.
It is interesting that the Franks who invaded Gaul did not even consider that they
had common Indo-European roots. The present French city of Bourges (its name from the
German burg – castle, Hu: VÁR) was built on the ruins of the destroyed Avaricum. Could
this be a coincidence or a literal translation?
C. Lévi-Strauss, a French anthropologist, stated at one time: “There is no eternal
truth. The scientific spirit seeks not so much the right answer; rather he asks the right
questions.”117 P. B. Ellis, the author of the book about the Druids, adds that nowhere is it
more necessary to ask the right questions than in the search for the truth about the Celts.
The “truth” at the present time is actually that which, in the eyes of some researchers, is a
fact but which, in the eyes of others, is only fantasy. Since the beginning of the 16th
century many researchers have written about the Druids and all that they represented, but
their explanations are inadequate because they have misunderstood the subject. The most
basic problem for researchers of the Celts is that the Druids and their contemporaries did
not leave behind them any written documents. In spite of the fact that we know of some
Greek sources that write about the Celts, the majority of the “classical” writings come
from the anti-Celt propaganda of the Roman Empire.118 The Romans did their utmost to
annihilate the Celts. First, they concentrated on “liquidating” the intelligentsia which was
represented by the Druids – which they did in the “civilized” Roman way, by massacring
them. They did this (Emperor Claudius decided in AD 54 to completely eliminate them)
not only because the Druids, as the only intelligent stratum of the population, were the
only ones capable of organizing a war of independence (which they had already done
several times in Gaul and in the British Isles), but also because they represented an
incredibly dangerous enemy to the “materialistic” Rome: “idealism” – as Peter Berresford
Ellis writes in the above-mentioned book, quoting Nora Chadwick, a Celtologist.

118 Ellis, P. B.: ‘Die Druiden’, Munich, 1996, p. 9.”[...] der Großteil der ‘klassischen’ Berichte besteht jedoch aus der antikeltischen Propaganda des römischen Imperiums.”

The researchers of the 17th and 18th centuries, who believed blindly in the “true
statements” of the Latin writers (some of them even believe them today), painted a very
dark picture of the Celts, whom they portrayed as barbarian, primitive, ignorant,
plundering hordes. They isolated the Druids from the Celts (because the Celts were
perceived as “primitives”), and counted them among the ancestors of the Germanic
peoples. See the writing of Elias Schedius: ‘De Dis Germanis’ published in Amsterdam
in 1648. Others, like the Englishman Thomas Smith, in his work: “Syntagama de Druidum
moribus ac institutis” (1664), stated that the Druids were actually the descendants of
Abraham. According to Inigo Jones (1652), Stonehenge was built not by the Celts but by
the Romans, since “the ancient Britons were remarkable in that they were untrained in
any kind of cultural activity”, and „In my opinion, Stonehenge was the work of the
Romans, and they alone built it. . .”119
It just as if we can hear the opinions of the Finno-Ugric scholars about the
ancient Magyars.
Although, in the following century, there were still those who believed this fantasy,
there were yet other historians who rather attributed the establishment of Stonehenge to
the Vikings or the Danes. This could be read in the work of Dr. Walter Charleton: Chorea
Gigantum (1663) or in the poems of John Dryden. These things were written in that
England, where Oliver Cromwell displayed on his banner the “final solution” to the Irish
question.120
What was the reason for the continued insistence on the uncivilized and barbaric
nature of the Celts? The answer is quite simple: The Celts were not considered to be “Indo
European”, in other words, they were not equal to the Romans or the Germanic peoples.
Then, at the beginning of the 19th century, the Celts were thrown a life-belt in the Indo
European Studies advocated by Jacob Grimm, a fabrication, which, unfortunately for the
leading countries of that time, was politically beneficial. After “Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs”, based on the Indo-European theory, the “Übermensch” was also born. The
“wonder” of Göttingen immediately brought the “useful” change in the leading opinions
of the world about the Celts, and they suddenly became acceptable in society. Stuart
Piggott commentated on this change-around: “As a consequence of this change of opinion,
the defenseless Celts could change and could actually be portrayed in a romantic light.”121
The proponents of the Indo-European hypothesis needed to embrace the Celts, if
they did not wish to admit that a large part of the German vocabulary (including many
ancient words and names of gods) – which they could not trace back to German or Latin
were taken over from the Celts. Moreover, since they did not want to accept their “cultural
underachievement” (das kulturelle Gefälle), they contrived the theory that all these words
had common Indo-European roots, and they did not shrink from stating that these lies were
“eternal truths”. The basic pillar of this lie was the fabricated ancient “common Indo

36
European language”, more accurately a huge collection of Indo-European words, in a
language that nobody spoke.
In the spirit of the Indo-European basic rules, even the Japanese were included in
the great and wonderful Indo-European family of peoples. When they noticed this blunder,
the Indo-European linguists tried to get out of this mess by saying that the Japanese
language was influenced by the language of the highly-cultured Indo-European peoples,
precisely the “Iranian-Scythian” peoples. In other words, a new lie (fabrication) was
necessary to support the false hypothesis, and so lies built on lies create the “perpetual lie”.
The goal of examining this or simply an attempt at a clarification of these hypotheses is
the equivalent of the sin of sacrilege. However, there are some German historians, who
have a different opinion of the “eternal truth”. Kinder and Hilgemann, for example, state:
The Indo-European language family can be proven to exist, not so much with
archaeological artifacts, but rather with language. (...) The ancient homeland of
the Indo-Europeans is probably the region between Central Europe and southern
Russia. (...) It is not possible to establish a certain territory with certain borders.
Therefore, it is wrong to talk simply of an „ancient language”, an „ancient
people”, or an „ancient homeland” of the Indo-Europeans. (...) The establishment
of the individual Indo-European languages can be attributed not only to
fragmentation, but also to intermixing with elements of foreign languages.122 (...)
As for the origins of the Celts, the Hungarian history-books present them as
arriving in Hungary from the region of the source of the Danube and the Rhine, and in the
guide-book of the Hungarian National Museum, published in 1992, we read on page 54:
“Inspired by the early Celts of the Rhine region, there emerged here (in Hungary) a typical
“Hungarian-style sword” with carved decorations, which was reminiscent of a civilization
on a European level.” According to Irish historians, the forbears of the Celts originated in
Anatolia and, sometime at the beginning of the 6th or 5th millennium, they arrived in
several waves in the lower Danube region, from where, by following the River Danube,
they gradually settled Western Europe. Around 2000 BC, they reached the Atlantic Ocean
and then settled into the British Isles. (Nora Chadwick, A.C. Renfrew) Caesar portrays the
Celts as an equestrian people in his work: “De Bello Gallico”. The Celtic warriors were
buried with their favorite horses (see the Bronze Age horse burial in Ribemont-sur-Ancre
in Gaul).
At full gallop, they were still able to direct their horses and guide them to where
they wanted to go, and they were able to stand on the shaft of the chariot and swing the
famous two-edged “Celtic sword”. The Celtic warrior would charge the enemy on
122 Kinder, H., Hilgemann W.: Atlas zur Weltgeschichte, 1987, p. 33. „Die Indogermanen lassen sich als Völkerfamilie nicht so sehr aus Bodenfunden, sondern von der Sprache her nachweisen. [...] Die Heimat der Indogermanen ist wahrscheinlich das Gebiet zwischen Mitteleuropa und Südrußland. [...] Ein genau begrenztes Kerngebiet ist unbekannt. Es ist daher falsch, vereinfachend von einer ‘Ursprache’, einem ‘Urvolk’ oder der indogerm. ‘Urheimat’ zu sprechen. [...] Die Entstehung der indogerm. Einzelsprachen braucht nicht durch Abspaltung, sondern kann auch durch Mischung mit fremden Sprachelementen erklärt werden.“

horseback, cut off his head with one blow, and hang it on his bridle. As was the custom of
all the equestrian peoples, the “soul” played an enormously important role in their religious
beliefs. Cutting off the head of the enemy (where the “gate” of the soul was found), not
only served as proof of the warrior’s bravery but also allowed him to take possession of
his defeated enemy’s soul, and thus prevent the soul from wreaking vengeance on him.
The leaders wore helmets decorated with the hawk, because the hawk was the symbol of
the God of War, who helped them in the battle. At the start of the battle “they made an
enormous noise” – writes Livy, a Roman chronicler of the first century BC. “With terrible
songs and shouting”, they gave themselves courage and scared the Romans. “Their battle
cries and battle-songs, as well as the terrible noise they made by clanging their shields
together, achieved one goal and that was to make the enemy afraid.”, wrote the chronicler.
This threatening demeanor was embellished with the application of lime, hardened into
their hair, which they wore combed back – to imitate the mane of their horses – and the
long, thick mustaches which hung down beside their faces. According to Diodorus, they
posed a really frightening picture. The Celts were exceedingly brave in battle, daring and
ready to sacrifice their lives, and their bravery was highly praised. They told Alexander
of Macedon that they feared nothing except that “the sky might fall on their heads”! What
other people would have such a distorted mindset? Only the Hungarians! We also say
that the sky could fall on our heads (and it has done so several times). In our folk tales we
read: "Égszakadás-földindulás, fejemen egy koppanás, szaladj te is pajtás" – “The sky is
falling, the earth is moving, there is a thump on my head, run, friend, run.” Is it possible
that this is just a coincidence?
As I have already mentioned, the Illustrated Chronicle also spoke of the Celts as
the people of Magog’s brother, Gomar, who, following the loss of the Trojan War, fled
from Asia Minor and settled in Pannonia, where they stayed for 400 years before
continuing on to Gaul. What is important here is not whether it is true or not that the two
peoples (Magyar-Scythian and Celts) had common ancestors in Biblical personages, but
rather that the Chronicle writes about the rise and fall of the Hallstatt culture five centuries
before it was discovered.
There are many proofs that here, in the Carpathian Basin, a “new” people was born.
First of all, the concept of the Good Mother, the “Goddess”, called DANU, another name
for ANU (the Ancient Mother), Ir: DEA-ANU = Hu: JÓ-ANYA (‘Good-Mother’) came
to life here. The River Danube – Hu: DUNA – was named after the mother-goddess
DANU, and this name was used interchangeably with the more ancient name ISTER. The
name ISTER is also probably of Celtic origin since, in the Breton language of today, STER
means “river”. An interesting coincidence: in Brittany, there is a river named Laïta, which
divides the province into Lower and Upper Brittany. In (Great-) Hungary, there is also a
river named Lajta, which separates the Roman provinces of Lower Pannonia (today
Dunántúl) and Upper Pannonia (today Lower Austria). The Celts, spreading from the
Carpathian Basin in all directions, since they could not take with them the Ancient Mother
– DANU – (as the Irish Chronicles write), they took her name, which lived on in their
rivers: from the River DON in England and in Scotland to the River DON in France, for
they were the “sons of DANU” (Tuatha Dé Dannan, the “Danu” tribe). The DUNA



38
(Danube) became the “holy river” because the ancient Mother, DANU, lived within it.
That region, where they were forced to leave behind the Ancient Mother (the God(dess),
because God was Mother) they called ANNWN (“the Motherland”). ANNWN [annoon]
also became the name of the “Otherworld” to which their loved ones returned. It was also
called the “country of the women” – BANNWN [pron. bannoon]. In this name we can
easily recognize the later Latin “Pannonia”, the country of DANU, the “Good Mother”,
Hu: JÓ-ANYA (Ir: DEA-ANU), later, the country of the Virgin Mother, the Blessed
Mother (Boldogasszony). This country was also called MAGH MÁR, meaning “meadow
wide” or “wide meadow”, “the country of the rivers of sweet waters” where there was “a
wide choice of honey and wine” and where there lived “unblemished and beautiful
people”, as we can read in MacCana’s “Celtic Mythology”.123 In this country: “there is
no ’mine’ or ’yours’ (...) their splendid attire is a joy for visitors to behold, the shades of
fox-glove colors are reflected in their faces” and “although it is good to see the beautiful
plains of Fál (Ireland), after Magh Már it appears to be a barren region.”
In Europe, there is only one “Wide Meadow” (Magh Már), where today still lives
the memory of the “Ancient Mother”: Hungary, the “country of the Blessed Mother”
unique in Europe!
The ancient writings do not offer much about the Scythian-Celtic relationship, nor
do the modern history books, but we now know that, although it was not always peaceful,
it was much more intense than previously thought. The German historians Kinder and
Hilgemann write the following about this relationship:
With the adoption of the Taurician culture, the Cimmerians strongly influenced the
older Hallstatt culture and became the intermediaries for the cultural elements of
Asia Minor. The Scythians influenced the later Hallstatt culture and the La-Tène
culture. (...) They buried their dead, stretched out on wagons, in burial mounds
(obviously under Scythian influence).124
Kinder and Hilgemann continue to describe the La Tène culture (typically Celtic): – “In
the outlying regions, a strong Celtization of the indigenous population took place.”125
Christiane Éluère, a French historian, in her book: “Die Kelten” (1994) calls this “die
Keltisierung Europas” (the Celtization of Europe). “Until the first century BC, the Greeks
and the Romans regarded all northern Europeans as Celts and Scythians.”126 O. F.
Menander, a historian from Helsinki, who, after he had established that the ancient Finns,
bringing the typical Comb Ceramic Culture, had settled in the Eastern Baltic region by the
end of the third millennium BC, continued thus:
123 MacCana, P.: Celtic Mythology, Feltham, England, 1983, Kelta mitológia, Budapest. 1993. p. 125. 124 Kinder, H., Hilgemann, W.: Atlas zur Weltgeschichte, 1987, p. 21. “Die Kimmerier wirken durch Übernahme der Taurischen Kultur stark auf die ältere Hallstatt-Kultur ein und werden dadurch Vermittler vorderasiat. Kulturelemente, die Skyten wirken auf die jüngere Hallstatt-Kultur und die La Téne-Kultur. [...] Die Toten werden unter Grabhügel auf einem Wagen beigesetzt (wohl unter skytischem Einfluß).” 125 “In den Ausstrahlungsgebieten findet eine starke Keltisierung der einheimischen Bevölkerung statt.” 126 George/Brown/Anker: Die Kelten: Europas Volk der Eisenzeit, 1995, p. 122. “In den
Ausstrahlungsgebieten findet eine starke Keltisierung der einheimischen Bevölkerung statt.”



39
The arrival of the people of the Corded Ware Ceramics and Battle-Axe culture (the
Scythians) (2400-1900 BC.), who are often recorded as being Indo-Europeans, at
least linguistically, played an important role in the formation of the Finn people.127
In other words, the mixture of the ancient Finns and the Scythians, which took place in the
Baltic region, was the basis of the “present-day” Finnish people and language.
Kinder and Hilgemann refute the assertion that the Battle-Axe people were Indo
European, stating that: “The people of the Corded Ware Culture (the Battle-Axe people)
were not Indo-European, although they had a role in the Indo-Europeanization of
Europe.”128 We have more data to prove the Scythian-Magyar connections.
Barry Cunliffe, British historian, writes the following:
North of the Caucasus [...] there is endless grassland, which reaches from
China to Europe and provides the necessary conditions for the constant
migrations. Huge rivers: the Volga, Don, Dnieper, Bug, Dniester and the Lower
Danube cut into this region which, in the South, is grassland and tundra in the
North. The still nameless equestrian and livestock-raising peoples roamed in this
“endlessness”. They were called in later historical writings: Cimmerians,
Scythians, Sarmatians, Alans, Huns, Magyars, Bulgars and Mongols. They, too,
influenced the culture of Europe, when they crossed the Danube-corridor or,
circumventing the Carpathians, they arrived in the Northern European flatlands.
[...] The people of the Puszta (Steppes) played an important role in the
development of European culture.129
In connection with this, we can read the opinion of Kinder and Hilgemann about
the equestrian peoples. All these peoples (Huns, Bulgars, Avars, Kazars, Pechenegs,
Cumanians and Magyars) were possessed of similar characteristics:
The characteristics of all equestrian peoples, who possess a similar culture and
view of life, are a patriarchal society, a talent for organization, far-reaching
plans and the establishment of a world empire on a federative base. (...) Religion:
The wide horizon of the Steppes directs the view of the archers toward the Heavens
from where the rain falls on the meadows. There is the seat of the ‘all-knowing
Father of the Heavens’. The connection with the Gods is made through the
sacrifices offered by the shaman, who, in his ecstasy, leads the souls of the dead
into the other world. (...) Society: At the head of the hordes of free and equal

warriors is the Prince, who is known as the “Kagan” in the world empire of the
nomads. Many of these princes are prepared for their calling by their occupation
as smiths or swordsmiths (Hu: TÁRKÁNY). The smith has a connection with the
Gods, who teach him his trade, and he is often the chosen-one of the Gods
(swordsmith kingdom, Hu: TÁRKÁNYKIRÁLYSÁG). (...) Concept of a world
empire: The sky offers the only possibility for orientation in the boundless expanses
of the Steppes. The universe revolves around the Polar Star, the „axis of the world”
under which the Mongolian world ruler has his throne (the center or “navel” of
the world), where the center of the world and the headquarters of the people
coincide. Based on this world-view, the nomadic peoples believe they have the
responsibility to subdue the peoples of all four corners of the world and help them
to live in peace.”130
That is what an „objective” historian writes about the ancient Magyars.!
Really, given the geographical location of our place of birth, our ancestors could
do nothing without a well-considered plan – and certainly could not have planned the
establishment of a homeland on a whim, or in a situation of necessity. The German
historians Kinder and Hilgemann, emphasize that:
 Our ancestors, the people of the Steppes, because of their spiritual frame of mind,
could not have acted in any other way, other than with a well-thought out, premeditated plan, for Kinder and Hilgemann characterized them as being “skilled
in organization and far-reaching planning”. Only in this way could they have
brought into being the establishment of a homeland, on the basis of a perfect plan
many years in the making, with organization that worked with precision and
exceptional execution, with the result that our “new” homeland was established in
Hungary, within the Carpathian Basin.
 Our swordsmith kings (Hu: TÁRKÁNYKIRÁLY) learned their trade from God.
(cf: “Tarquinus” Etruscan leader, “Tarján” Hungarian tribe, “Taranis” Celtic
“bringer of thunder”, the God of the swordsmiths).
130 Kinder H., Hilgemann, W.: Atlas zur Weltgeschichte, 1987. p. 113. „Kennzeichen aller Reiternomaden, die eine gleiche Kultur und Lebensauffassung besitzen, sind Herrentum, Organisationstalent, weiträumiges Planen und Weltreichsbildungen auf föderativer Grundlage.[...] Religion : Der weite Horizont der Steppe lenkt den Blick der ‘bogenspannenden’ Völker zum Himmel, von dem der Regen für die Weiden kommt. Dort ist der Sitz des ‘allwissenden Himmelsvaters’. Die Verbindung zu den Göttern stellt durch Opfer der Schamane her, der auch in der Extase die Seelen der Verstorbenen ins Jenseits geleitet. [...] Gesellschaft : An der Spitze der aus freien und gleichberechtigten Kriegern bestehenden Horde steht der Fürst, der im nomadischen Weltreich zum ‘Kagan’ wird.

Aus diesem Weltbild ergibt sich für den Nomaden die Aufgabe : Unterwerfung und Befriedung aller Völker der ‘Vier Ecken’ (= vier Himmelsgegenden).

 The ancient Magyars were monotheistic. (They worshipped the “all-knowing
Heavenly Father”.)
 Our ancestors had a world-view that was established by the very knowledgeable
Táltos. In this world-view, the whole world as well as the cosmos had its
determined place and role: The concept and importance of the Center of the World,
“Middle Earth” is a characteristic of Hungarian folklore.
 The prince, whose throne was at the Center of the World, “KÁN” (Ir: CEANN =
head, chief, leader) wished to subdue and bring peace to the peoples of the four
corners of the world. (Sumerian: HUN = peacemaker, Celtic-Irish: CIÚNA-igh
[pron: ku:ni] = to reconcile, make peace).
Gyula László in his book entitled: “Árpád népe” (The people of Árpád) describes the
hierarchy of the Hungarian society at the time of the founding of the state: Prince and his
court, (holy man [Táltos], treasurer, interpreter etc.), tribal chiefs, clan leaders, important
clan members and commoners.131
There was a similar hierarchy in Celtic society: “The early Irish society was
divided into Druids, fighting noblemen (flatha) and freemen (bó-airigh) and can be
compared to the Gallic society that Caesar divided into Druids (druides), horsemen
(equites) and commoners (plebs).”132
DRAOTA (Torda) the druid: he was the holy man and teacher of the Celtic society,
the intermediary between men and their ancestors / their gods. He was the Táltos: Ir:
DIAIL = Hu: DALIA, DELI amazing, wonderful. In a trance he was able to contact the
Mother-God and the Otherworld: Ir: RAMHAILLE = Hu: RÉVÜL-és trance. He made the
sacrifices (Ir: ALTU = Hu: ÁLD-ás thanksgiving, Ir: ALTA-igh = Hu: ÁLDA-ni speak a
blessing, bless). The Celts as well as the Scythians-Huns-Hungarians sacrificed a white
horse to the “Good-God”, Daghdha – a name similar to the Hungarian “Jóisten” (Good
God). Although the Celts had shrines (NEMETON), cf: Ir: NEAMH = Hu: MENNY
Heaven, Ir: NAOMH = Hu: NEMES: noble, holy, blessed. (cf: Turkish: NIMET blessing),
the Druids prayed anywhere, at any time: under an oak tree, at springs, on the top of a hill
etc. with upheld arms, stretching toward the sky, their palms turned toward the sky. Sir
John Rhys considers the Druids to be a “non-Aryan priesthood”. In his article that
appeared in the “Celtic Review” (On the Origins of Druidism), Julius Pokorny writes the
following: “Druidism possesses many characteristics that are completely foreign to the
Indo-European religions.”133
The Celtic religion was “heroic”: the heroes were “gods” and the gods were
heroes134; they did not look on their gods as creators but as their ancestors.135 The Celtic
religion that was characterized by Druids was primarily “monotheistic”. According to a
131 László Gyula: Árpád népe, 1988, p. 61. 132 Mac Cana, P.: Kelta Mitológia, Budapest, 1993, p. 60.
133 Ellis, P. B.: Die Druiden, Munich, 1996, p. 48. “Das Druidentum trägt viele Züge, die indoeuropäischen Religionen völlig wesenfremd sind.“
134 Ellis, P. B.: Die Druiden, Munich, 1996, p. 129.
135 Ellis, P. B.: Die Druiden, Munich, 1996, p. 124. „Die Kelten betrachteten ihren Gottheiten nicht als ihre Schöpfer, sondern als ihre Vorfahren, das heißt als eine Art übernatürlicher Helden und Heldinen...“

statement made by Origenes (AD 185-254), the leader of the Christian school of
Alexandria, The Celtic Druids prayed to One God, even before the coming of Jesus.
(“...dem einen Gott angebetet [...] vor dem Kommen Christi.”) Therefore, the Celts were
in agreement with Christianity, on the basis of the teachings of the Druids, who taught that
there was only One God. (“...waren dem Christentum lange schon geeignet aufgrund der
Lehre der Druiden [...] die bereits die Doktrin von der Einheit der Gottheit verkündet
hatten.”)136 The Celts were the first “Christians” in Europe and the “Christian” Druids
preached peacefully throughout Europe. St. Martin was a Celt, who was born in
Szombathely. The old name for Pannonhalma (Hungary) was Martonhalma (Hu: HALOM
= En: hill). In German, it is still “Martinsberg”. Ireland was already Christian in the fifth
century.
FLATHA was the name for the horse-men (equites): cf. Ir: LÓTH = Hu: LÓ horse,
steed; Ir: LÁIR (Welsh: LLWAN) mare; Old-Ir: LÁEACH = Hu: LOVAS horseman,
rider. Naturally the ancient Hungarian name for the Magyars comes to mind: “sabartoi
asphaloi”. Many scholars have already tried to explain or translate this name, and I would
also like to do so, because this name is understandable in the Celtic (Irish) language too,
and can be explained with the help of the Irish language.
See Ir: SAIBHIR = rich man + OS- = Hu: FŐ (chief), ÉL- ELSŐ (first) + FLATHA
= Hu: LOVAS, LÓFŐ (rider, lead rider). Therefore, the meaning of “sabartoi
asphaloi” is “rich (noble) lead rider”.
The Kazars called themselves “Sabirs”. The name “Kazar” comes from the
Persians, and even today in the Ossetian language, it means “rich”! Around 1120, Marvazi
wrote that the Magyars “had many possessions and were obviously very rich”.137
The Celts were crazy about horses (Caesar). They were willing to do anything to
obtain a good horse, which they purchased in the East. Even today, the Irish are the greatest
and most famous horse-breeders and, in Ireland, when a youth reaches his 18th birthday,
he is given a horse, so that, similar to the Breton youths, he might take his bride (Hu:
MENNYASSZONY; Ir: MIONN = Hu: ESKÜ = oath, vow), seated on the saddle, to the
exchange of vows, (Hu: ESKÜVŐ, MENYEGZŐ = wedding), in the church.
BÓ-AIRIGH (the free-men) analyzed: Ir: BÓ (Manx: BOOAG) cow: Old-Hu:
BUGA + Ir: AIRE = attention, vigilance, safe-keeping, care > AOIR-igh = care for, attend,
guard > AOIRE pastor, guard = Hu: ŐR. The concept is that of pastor (guard) and means
rich (free) owner of animals (cattle). Even if the two names are not exactly the same, the
BÓ-AIRIGH is the same concept as the Medieval-Hungarian “BŐ-URAK” = rich-men.
Up until the end of the 19th century, it was universally accepted that the Scythians,
Huns, Avars and Magyars were identical:
 The Roman Catholic Popes, Orban V and Gregory XI, and also Nicolas Mysticos,
the Patriarch of Byzantium all named the Magyars “Royal Scythians”.138

 According to Procopius, the ambassador of Emperor Justinius, the Massagetae were Huns: “Massagetae, quos Hunnae appellamus. . .” and in another place he
calls the Huns of Atilla Massagetae: “Attilam Massagetarum Scytharumque
exercitu armatum adversus Aetium processisse”.139
 Pope Sylvester II, in connection with the coronation of King István (Stephen) also called the Magyars Scythians. “Ours, ours is the Roman Empire. The fruits of
Italia give it strength, Gaul and Germania provide soldiers, and we may include
the powerful King of the Scythians.”140
 “The first King of Scythia was Magog, the son of Japhet and his people were called
Magyars after their King Magog. The descendant of this king was the famous,
powerful king, Atilla, who, in the Year of Our Lord 451, set out from Scythia with
a strong army.”141
 “In the Year of Our Lord 889, the Magyars, the most unrestrained and most
merciless savages, came out of the land of Scythia and crossed the marshes that
are continually flooded by the River Don. . . If we read the notes of the historians,
we will learn some things about the location of Scythia and the customs of the
Scythians.”, writes Regino142
 According to the Chronicle of Simon Kézai: “There were about three thousand
men among the Huns, who fled from the Battle of Krimhild, who in fear of the
western nations fled as far as the people of Árpad in the Meadow of Csigle, where
they were then no longer called Huns, but Székelys” 143
 According to the Fulda Year Book: „896 . . .In that same year, the Greeks made
peace with the Avars, who are called Magyars.” 144
From the above list, it is clear how untenable is that improbable and unscholarly
“thesis”, which states that we, Hungarians, live in the heart of Europe unrelated to any
other people. Truly erroneous is that “historical” concept that insists that the ancient

Erőt ad gyümölcsben Itália, katonát adó Gallia és Germánia, s nem hiányzik nálunk a szkíták hatalmas királya sem.” 141 Anonymus: ”Gesta Hungarorum” [Kristó Gy. ‘A honfoglalás korának írott forrásai’, (The written

Many Hungarians still live there and in some villages they make up the majority of the population. Transylvania is still struggling to establish its autonomy within the Romanian state. (Editor)

home of the Magyars is situated north of the bend of the River Don. According to
Hungarian legends, our ancestors (Hunor and Magor) were led to the region of the
Meotis marshes by the Miraculous Stag. The afore-mentioned quotations emphasize the
Scythian-Hun-Avar-Magyar continuity in this very same geographical location.
The Finnish linguists and historians have their own opinion about the “Finno-Ugric
hypothesis”, which has survived to this day. One of their spokesmen is the Finn
Meinander, who, in his book, entitled: “Die Ethnogenese der Finno-Ugrier” (The
Ethnogenesis of the Finno-Ugrics), states the following:
Finno-Ugric or Ugro-Finnic is a fabricated linguistic expression, which describes
a group of related languages in Northern Europe. (...) It is a “parabola” of the
same kind as “Indo-German” (Indo-European). The philologists are convinced
that the determining part of the language of these peoples was formed at one time
by a group of people who had a unified language and was probably of the same
race and culture, from the same geographical territory, and therefore it is
reasonable to speak of an ancient people and their ancient homeland and also of
a territory where this ancient people subsequently established a unified closed
community. I do not believe that it is out of the question that this concept is merely
a fiction.145
Many scholars have already raised their voices and pitted their wits against the
flood of “official” lies and defamations, from Ida Bobula to László Götz. Many of them
have taken up their pens to uncover the serious and – if they did not cause exceptionally
harmful consequences to the formation of the consciousness of the youth, if they were not
so sad and painful – we might say ridiculous false explanations of the origin of the
Hungarians and their supplementary concepts. Our official linguists and historians have
forgotten about a true perpetual truth; in fact, they have forgotten that there is no perpetual
truth!
The Celts who settled in Pannonia survived the Roman occupation and came in
contact with the Huns. Atilla’s doctor was a Celt, Eudoxius, who led him across Gaul.146
Atilla’s (Atila147) relationship with the Celts is characterized by the fact that, prior to the
Gallic campaign, he wished to convince them of his good intentions. “According to the
writings of Amadé Thierry, Attila, in all his letters and his speeches, had a good
145 Bernhard, W., Kandler-Palsson, A. : Ethnogenese europäischer Volker, 1986, pp. 363 - 364. „FinnischUgrisch oder Ugro-Finnisch ist ein konstruiertes, sprachwissenschaftliches Fachwort, das eine Gruppe von miteinander verwandten Sprachen in Nordosteuropa bezeichnet. [...] Das ist ein Parabel von derselben Art wie ‘Indogermanen’. Die Philologen sind davon überzeugt, daß der sprachbestimmende Teil dieser Volkherschaften einmal eine sprachlich, wahrscheinlich auch rassisch, kulturell und geographisch einheitliche Gruppe bildeten, und daß es somit berechtigt wäre, von einer Urvolk und von seiner Urheimat zu reden, also von jener Gegend, wo das Urvolk zuletzt eine geschlossenne Einheit bildete. Ich halte es nicht ausgeschlossen, daß diese Begriffe nur Fiktionen sind.” 146 Bona István: Historia 1995 – No. 8. p. 4. 147 ATILA in Turkish means attacking, beseiging, skirmishing ; battle



45
understanding with the Gauls, and he wished to inform them of his good intentions and
good wishes.”148
The Huns may have made an alliance with the Gauls. At that time, the center of
the Gallic resistance (bagauda – from Old Irish: BUACHA = Hu: BAKA soldier) was the
present-day Orleans. Atilla surrounded the city for more than a month but he did not take
it. Presumably, the siege was intended to aid the freedom fight of the Gauls, to prevent
supplies getting to the Romans, because: “the Bagauda, who lived in the city, were
members of the anti-Roman movement, recruited from the lowest strata of the people of
the province, and supporters of Attila” and their leader was Eudoxious himself (writes
István Bona, in the above-mentioned article).
After the death of Atilla and the loss of the Carpathian Basin, part of the Hun
Empire, the Pannonian Celts (together with the Scythian-Hun-Székelys) must have
remained here in the land of DANU-DUNA, in their “Motherland”, because later, Celts
could be found in the Avar armies. The Celts “survived the centuries of Roman rule and
weathered the storms of the migrations in the Baranya triangle. (...) Therefore, on the side
of the Avars, not only Scythians, that is Alans, but also the descendants of the Celts took
part in the battles.”149
The Celtic influence has survived not only in the European-ranked Hungarian style
of sword making or in our living language of today, but also in our arts and even in the
names of some settlements. The most famous neck decoration of the Celts is the so-called
“TORC” (torque, neck-band) (cf: Old Turkish TARYQ-mag, to tighten). For no other
European people is it characteristic, with one exception:
The migration of Hun leaders from the East to the West, from the provinces
of one of the tributaries of the Lena River in Inner Asia as far west as the Rhine,
can be traced by archaeologists, who found in the graves of the Hun men very
heavy golden torques or neckpieces. It is very significant that almost a third of
these neckpieces, and the heaviest of them, were found in the Carpathian Basin
and the Vienna Basin”, write Éva Garam and Attila Kiss.150 (...)
It is quite possible that even Árpád’s Magyars, who established or reclaimed their
homeland in the Carpathian Basin, came into contact with Celtic inhabitants. Otherwise,
why would the people of Árpád have given so many settlements names formed from the
root-word GAL- / GEL- or KAL- / KEL-? These settlement names are not derived from
the name of Saint-Gall (Gallen, Gallus, c. 550 – c. 646), since they existed well before the
first Christian missionary from Sankt-Gallen came into Hungary (c. 900).

Arnold Ipolyi writes: “. . . that nation, which allows its memories to be lost, is
preparing its own grave.”
„...azon nemzet, mely emlékeit veszni hagyja, azzal saját síremlékét készíti.“
(Ipolyi Arnold).
The music of the Celts is, even today, pentatonic and strongly resembles Hungarian
music. One of their prettiest dances is the COR (turn, twirl), which, together with the Celtic
word DEAS (pretty, splendid) is the forerunner of the Hungarian CSÁR-DÁS. The
Romans called the dance of a transalpine people CORDAX, which, according to the
dictionary definition was a “splendid, beautiful, ornate dance” (German: üppiger tanc)!
What people was it, Celtic or Scythian-Hun-Magyar, whose dance the Romans liked so
much? Lars Kabel, in his “Irisch-Gälisch Wort für Wort” (Irish-Gaelic Word for Word)
handbook writes that the Irish music is “ein uns fremd anmutender, beinahe orientalisch
klingender Klagegesang” (to us a foreign, sweet, almost oriental sounding lament).
The music world of the Irish and the Moldavian Hungarians is not only
spiritually and temperamentally similar, but also in its pentatonia, in the structure,
arrangement and variety of the dances. The jig, one of Ireland’s oldest men’s
dances, strongly resembles its eastern counterpart, in which the men and women
swing each other around, with alternately recoiling steps, which can be found in
every rural community.151
The Celts themselves search for the origin of the folk dress of today’s Celts
(Breton), together with the roots of their language in the Turanian territory. The folk
embroidery of Kemper in Brittany is almost identical to that of Kalocsa in Hungary and,
in general the Breton traditional folk customs, stick-dances or equestrian parades can
compete with those of Kalotaszeg in Transylvania.
Kemper is a mid-sized city in western Brittany, the center of the province of PENN
AR BED (Head of the World), which is the citadel of the „revival” of the Breton language
and culture. The poster of the Breton Museum of Kemper advertising the wonders of the
Breton folk art is to us, Hungarians, very familiar. It shows symbols and motifs that could
be also Hungarian.
The ancient Celtic writing was a runic script, carved onto wooden rods, which
Gyula Sebestyén wrote about already in 1903-1904, in a series of articles entitled „Rovás
és Rovásírás” (Runes and Runic Writing) in the journal „Ethnographia”: “The oldest of
Ireland’s ancient populace say their prayers not with the Rosary beads but they read them
from the runic rods.”152
In the development of civilization, the most important moment was the discovery
of writing. Jules Oppert, a French astrologist, to whom the name „Sumerian” is attributed,
151 (Magyar Nemzet, November 5, 1998. „Tiszán innen Dublin túl” (From the Tisza to beyond Dublin) Irish and Moldavian Csángó Folk Music.)

47
in his writing entitled: “Rapport adressé a S. Exellence M. le Ministre de l’instruction
publique et des cults. Archives des missions scientifiques et litteraires” (Paris. T.V., 1856,
177 lap.) writes: “It was not the Semites, that is, not the Assyrians, who discovered (. . .)
The people who invented cuneiform writing belonged to the great Uralic (Scythian, Tatar
or Turanian) group of people.”153
The ancient signs that are found on monoliths in Scotland, Ireland and Northern
England are called OGHAM-signs (cf. Old Irish: OG = Hu: ÉK- carve, cut into, engrave),
in Hungarian: ÉK-writing (cf. Hu: „ÁKOM-BÁKOM” – an incomprehensible childish
writing). This writing was a system of signs made up of straight lines carved onto stones
or wood, and it was used to record special events, holidays or commemorations.154
Today, they use the Latin alphabet and struggle with it, as do we Hungarians. The
Hungarian concept of carving, “rovás”, could not have been taken over from any other
people, because the word “rovás” is only understandable in Hungarian and Irish (Hu:
ROV-ás, Ir: RIABH = stripe, band, line, trace) and is derived from the verb RÓNI (to
carve) (cf. Old Irish: RIONN = to carve).
In the beginning, writing was every people’s “secret”: in Irish RÚN means
“secret”. The early Germans adopted this “secret” and called the writing that they took
over from other peoples “Runenschrift” or “secret writing”. The word to carve in German
is “gravieren, stechen, einmeißeln” (Gothic: “gameleins” writing).
So who “borrowed” from whom, when and why. . .?
If we examine the origin of the basic vocabulary of the Hungarian language, as
described by the “official” linguists, we can notice that the vast majority of words in our
vocabulary (49.3%) are designated as of unknown origin, onomatopoeic, or children’s
vocabulary, which are also words of unknown origin. These words are of unknown origin
because it has not yet occurred to any of our linguists to look into a dictionary of the Celtic
language. Yet the Druids, the Celtic holy-men (Táltos) here, on the banks of the Danube,
searched for and achieved the ÉICSE, “the wisdom, knowledge, the highest level of
foretelling and poetry” (Hu: ÉSZ), writes P. B. Ellis in his book “Die Druiden” (The
Druids), 1996, p. 128.
In the course of my research, I have collected more than 1650 Hungarian-Celtic
cognates which have the identical or very similar meaning and which are pronounced in a
similar manner. Most of these words, which have common roots, are exactly those words
that are designated as of unknown origin – here is just one example: Hu: GYEREK = Irish:
GARLACH child, urchin (cf. German: KERL) and its counterpart of Hu: GYERMEK
child, little boy, Ir: GARMHAC grandson, cf. Ir: GEARR- = Hu: GYAR- small, young;

The Székely (Szekler) Origins of the
Scythians155
According to popular belief, the Magyars, led by Árpád, entered the Carpathian Basin from
the East; according to official historiography, they came from their ancient Finno-Ugric
homeland and, according to the Hungarian Chronicles, they came from Asia and were of
Asian origin. In the last few decades, particularly in the writings of K. Endre Grandpierre
(1979, 1990, 1996, 2005 and 2006), a third theory has evolved (earlier, similar results were
found by Bálint Gábor of Szentkatolna, 1901; Lajos Marjalaki Kiss, 1929; Adorján
Magyar, 1930), according to which the Hungarians are autochthonous to the Carpathian
Basin and Árpád’s Magyars were merely returning to their ancient homeland. In recent
years, a number of archaeological studies have appeared that support the theory of the
origin of the Magyars in the Carpathian Basin, their migration from their homeland and
their return. The migration of the Magyars out of the Carpathian Basin and the migration
of the ancestors of the Scythian people took place in the 6th millennium BC. In 2001,
Douglas T. Price and his colleagues published the results of their examination of the
strontium isotope in the archaeological review: Antiquity (Price et al., 2001). According
to these scholars, the people of the Linear Pottery brought the first advanced civilization to
Western Europe, beginning in 5700 BC, in small groups of 10-20 people, comprising
mainly of women. This civilization reached the Rhine in 5500 BC and later gradually
spread their advanced culture throughout the entire territory of Western Europe. In contrast
to this small migration to the West, the ancient populace of the Carpathian Basin made
thorough preparations for the migration toward the East, because this was an undertaking
of much greater proportions. Six hundred years after the migration to the West, the
migration to the East began in incomparably large numbers. This fact is particularly
important in the light of the newest discoveries.
In 2004, Blagoje Govedarica, Professor of Archaeology at the University of Hamburg,
published his monograph: “Zeptertrager - Herrscher der Steppen” (People of the Scepters
– Rulers of the Steppes). One of his main conclusions was that, from 5100 BC, from the
Carpathian Basin, more precisely from the Upper Tisza region of Transylvania (I) a large
number of people migrated to the Lower Danube region (II), Lake Meotis (Sea of Azov)
(III), the Volga Bend (IV) and the Caucasus (V) (Illustration 1).

Illustration 1. The Transylvanian Civilization (I), the migration of the People of the
Scepters to the Eurasian Plain from 5100 BC.
For millennia these five centers of civilization influenced the development of Eurasia.
These mass migrations, which began in 5100 BC, must have involved a population of
millions, since we are talking of several thousands of settlements with an average
population of several hundred to several thousand people. Igor Manzura, a Russian
archaeologist, published the results of his research in the Oxford Journal of Archaeology
in 2005 (Manzura, 2005), according to which, from the fifth millennium BC, large numbers
of people migrated from Transylvania farther and farther toward the East in waves of
settlements that they established in the western Eurasian Plain. The following question
comes to mind: Why did the inhabitants of the Carpathian Basin at that time decide to send
only small groups toward the West, whereas they migrated to the East in huge numbers?
The answer to this question first came to me when I realized that a similar situation
occurred in AD 1492, when the Hungarian King Ulászló II sanctioned the, until then
unwritten, ancient law of the Székelys (Szeklers) that stated that the Székelys were
permitted to be conscripted in the case of a war, but only one out of ten was to be called to
serve against the West, whereas every other man could be called to serve as a soldier
against the East. At first glance, it appeared surprising that, according to the ancient
unwritten law of the Székelys, it was not all the same to them on which battleground they
had to risk their lives. I found the explanation to this phenomenon in the fact that there is
a zone in the eastern Carpathian Basin that is part of the plant and animal life of the
Eurasian Plain. (Illustration 2) The living conditions indicate that a similar connection has
existed for millions of years, making it conceivable that not only the plant and animal



51
kingdom of the ancient Carpathian Basin spread eastward, but also Homo Sapiens, on a
timescale of millions of years. Therefore, it is almost certain that, during the time of the
migration of peoples, the ancient people of the Carpathian Basin initially chose to migrate
toward the East.
Illustration 2. The Eurasian Plain stretches from the Carpathian Basin to the Pacific
Ocean
There is evidence of migrations of people out of the Carpathian Basin from the time of
Rudapithecus to the Gravettian Culture. (Grandpierre, 2010) Thus the descendants of the
ancient people of the Carpathian Basin, who honored their ancestors and the land of their
ancestors, initially migrated to the East in order to ensure the continuation of their race.
The ancient unwritten law of the Székely people must also have originated from their
ancient customs; this places the ancient origins of the Székelys in a new perspective. If
this conclusion is supported by additional new facts (see Orbán-Grandpierre, 2009), then
the people, who received the name Scythians from the Greeks only in the first millennium
BC, were descendants of the ancient Székelys, who lived in Transylvania in the sixth
millennium BC. This startling conclusion is supported by a whole list of significant facts.
We shall mention some of them.
K. Endre Grandpierre (1996a, 22-36) and, following him, Dezső Orbán (Orbán,
Grandpierre, 2009, 29-37) has shown that the names Székely and Szkíta are two variants



52
of the same name. Furthermore K. Endre Grandpierre deduced that the Székelys and the
Scythians were the same people (1996a, 29 and the following pages). If this identification
indicates the Székely origin of the Scythians, then this calls for one of the greatest
turnarounds in the writing of the history of the Hungarians.
It is noteworthy that Govedarica calls the “People of the Scepters” the “Rulers of the
Steppes”. The scepter is without doubt a symbol of royalty; therefore, the “People of the
Scepters” were a royal people. How numerous could this royal people have been?
Manzura has recorded data about more than 800 settlements. The average number of
inhabitants was between 30 and 1000. At the time and place in question, the people
occupied several thousand settlements, therefore the population must have been several
hundred thousand, even millions, in the fifth millennium BC. Their new environment
encouraged enormous growth, evidenced by the construction of the royal kurgans (see
below). The culture of the “People of the Scepters” lasted for 3000 years and was followed
by the pre-Cimmerian culture (Timber-grave culture, Srubna culture) and the pre-Scythian
culture (Andronovo culture) (Illustration 3.) in the huge territory between the Carpathian
Basin and Korea (Govedarica, 2004).
Illustration 3. The territory of the Srubna people (Timber-grave culture, pre-Cimmerians)
and the Andronovo people (pre-Scythians or Magyars) in the entire Eurasian Plain about
1900 BC.
In the first half of the first millennium BC, the Cimmerians, Scythians and, in the East, the
Huns, ruled the entire Eurasian Plain. According to every indication, these three names
referred to the same people. According to Herodotus, at the beginning of the first



53
millennium, the royal tribe of the Cimmerians and the people of the Western Eurasian
Plain, who co-existed with the Royal Cimmerians, were equipped with similar military
strength. (We should note that in the Hungarian translation of Herodotus: The Greco
Persian War, Volume IV, § 11, 1989, p. 269, the English word “natives”, meaning
autochthonous, indigenous people, was translated as “Cimmerians” and thus the original
meaning of “autochthonous or indigenous” was lost.) Thus, the population of the Royal
Cimmerians and the population of the people who had been living on the Western Eurasian
Plain for millennia should be considered as populations of a comparable number.
Moreover, this royal people had a high level of culture and were extraordinarily rich in
knowledge and wealth.
Govedarica noted that the people in territory (I), (II), (III), (IV) and those in territory (V),
at least from 5100 BC, were closely connected to one another. This means that, throughout
several millennia and across thousands of kilometers, these people were able to maintain
their unified organization; in other words, they were endowed with an unusual ability to
organize a state. This remarkable ability for state organization was a special characteristic
of the „Magi” or wise-men in ancient times, just as were the high level of culture, the
respect for women and the remarkable level of knowledge possessed by the women. The
combination of these characteristics indicates that, in the millennia before Christ, the
Carpathian Basin was the center of the Magi, and also that it was the ancient homeland of
the peoples of the Eurasian Plains.
Archaeologists generally name the culture of an ancient people after the style of their
pottery, their burial customs or the first important site of their finds. This people, which
Govedarica names the “People of the Scepters” after their burial customs, most other
researchers call the Erősd (Transylvania), Cucuteni (today: Moldova), or Trypillian
(Tripolye today: Ukraine) culture, after the location of their finds. This Erősd-Cucuteni
Trypillian culture (Illustration 4.) is today considered to be the first European civilization
(History of Europe, 2010).



54
Illustration 4. Territory of the Erősd-Cucuteni-Trypillian Culture, 5500 – 2750 BC.
This people possessed a well-developed writing system at the end of the 6th millennium
(Tordos, Tatárlaka and Vinča) and this writing system of Old Europe (Coppens, 2011)
spread from here to southeast Europe (Fehérné Walter Anna, 1975, Volume 1. p. 37; map
by Todorovic, Illustration 5).



55
Illustration 5. Todorovic map, illustrating the spread of the Ancient European script from
5500 BC.
Natalia Taranec of the Sydney Powerhouse Museum, in her article that appeared in 2005,
(Taranec, 2005) notes that the descendants of the Cucuteni-Trypillian people, living in the
western part of the Eurasian Plain from 5500 to 2400 BC, were the Scythians. (Cucuteni
Trypillian Culture, 2010) Therefore, if the people of the Eurasian Plain were the
descendants of the ancient inhabitants of the Carpathian Basin, then the autochthonous
people of the Carpathian Basin were the ancestors of the Scythians. Since the Székelys
speak the Magyar (Hungarian) language and preserve the ancient traditions and customs of
that ancient people, then we must come to the conclusion that the ancient people of the
Carpathian Basin, the Scythians and the Székely-Magyars, were all the same people, who
received different names at different periods in history.



56
They possessed particular characteristics and therefore, from their burial customs, they also
received the name Kurgan or Tumulus Culture. Tumulus burials were common from the
fifth millennium BC to the beginning of the second millennium AD, primarily in the
Eurasian Plain that spread from the Carpathian Basin to Korea. Archaeologists divide this
huge time-span into smaller sections. In chronological order, they are the following: the
Sredny Stog culture that is connected to the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture (this includes the
birth of the equestrian culture in the 5th millennium), the Pit-Grave, Timber-Grave,
Scythian, Sarmatian, Hun and Kuman-Kipchak cultures. If the construction of kurgans can
be attributed to one particular people, then this people is the Scythian-Sarmatian-Hun
Kuman-Kipchak people. Moreover, archaeologists have counted 40,000 kurgans in the
Great Hungarian Plain. The Kurgan people possessed remarkable knowledge, a superior
intellect, and technical, cultural and material wealth. For example, around the period from
3500 to 3300 BC, they began to construct splendid, rich, obviously royal kurgans in the
forested plain of the region of Kubán, which lies at the foot of the northern slopes of the
Caucasus. Stone pillars surrounded the huge kurgans that had secret chambers deep within
them, filled with treasures. In the chambers, 70-liter cauldrons were also found, which
came from the Caucasus, made with bronze containing arsenic; beside them were vases
made of gold and silver-plate, decorated with images of animals, silver rods decorated with
golden bulls, bronze battle-axes and daggers and several hundred tools of gold, turquoise
and chalcedony. (Anthony, 2007) Cauldrons are recognized as typical utensils of the
Scythian, Hun and Magyar peoples. (Illustration 6. Hun cauldron from Törtel)



57
Illustration 6. Hun cauldron from Törtel, ca. 400 AD.
Archaeologists label certain peoples after the characteristics of their artifacts, therefore
they regularly limit certain people and artifacts to increasingly narrower time-periods and
territories. (Grandpierre K. Endre – Grandpierre Atilla, 2006) It is obvious that the
Hungarian people of today use different utensils than people used a hundred or a thousand
years ago, yet we are still talking of the same people. Similarly, the historical names of
peoples are often limited, particularly in the case of an ancient people living in a large



58
territory over a long period, because those people, in different time-periods, were organized
in different ways, and the neighboring peoples called them by different names. Moreover,
a certain people might have several important characteristics and only one of them is
emphasized when the people is named. The People of the Scepters (Govedarica, 2004)
lived in the exact same time-period (5100 - 2400 BC) in the exact same territory (the
Carpathian Basin and the Eurasian Plain) and displayed the exact same characteristics as
the people of the Erösd-Cucuteni-Trypillian culture (Cucuteni-Trypillian culture, 2010),
and the people of the Kurgan culture (Kurgan Culture, 2000); therefore, these three names
actually refer to the exact same people. Is it possible among these separate peoples,
recognized by historians, to identify whose ancestors we are talking about? Let us try to
examine this question independently of the already mentioned facts. To do this we shall
examine a different archaeological characteristic – the huge cauldrons that are a
distinguishing characteristic of the Huns (Bóna-Cseh-Nagy et al, 1993). It is interesting
that, in the English Wikipedia, in the entry entitled: „Cauldron”, there is a picture of a
Hungarian „bogrács”, (Cauldron, 2010). Scythian cauldrons have also been found in
Transylvania (Illustration 7).



59
Illustration 7. Scythian cauldron from Transylvania, ca. 600 BC
The Kurgan people also produced huge cauldrons (Sylvia, 2000) and this indicates that the
descendants of the Kurgan people were the Huns. From the depths of the huge Issyk Kul
Lake, which lies at the foot of the northern slopes of the Tien-San Mountain Range, (today
Kyrgyzstan), archaeologists unearthed a huge cauldron, 2500 years old, which was an
amazing work of craftsmanship. According to the experts the separate parts fit together
with such precision that could be achieved today only by working the metal in an inert gas.
It is a riddle how the two Royal Szaka-Scythian peoples, who lived here for more than
5000 years were able to achieve such a high level of technological perfection. Of
particularly high quality are the bronze mirrors, the ornamented horse equipment and many
other objects. Under the water, they found small gold wire-rings and large six-sided
nuggets of gold (Lukashov, 2008). This civilization was at least of equal rank to the
recognized highest level civilizations of old, the Greek and the Egyptian. The clothing of
the Royal Szaka-Scythians also displayed extraordinary craftsmanship and wealth.
(Illustration 8) We may add that, according to the most recent anthropological research, the
characteristics of the skulls of the Timber-grave culture were identical to those of the
Scythians, who succeeded them in that territory (Dolukhanov, 1996).

Huns who arrived in the region of Ordos in the 8th to the 6th century BC, were called
Scythians by the ancient Greeks (Gilbert, 2002, map 2; illustration 9); therefore, both
names indicate the same people at that same time-period.



60



61
Illustration 9. The Huns that migrated from East to West into Hungary were called
Scythians by the Greeks. (Martin Gilbert, 2002)
It is interesting, for example, that the Scythians arrived on the island of Cyprus in the 8th
century BC. In their tracks, they left a flourishing society, with royal graves which,
although they have been plundered, still dazzle us with their royal opulence. Traces of
horse sacrifice, bronze trestles, and huge cauldrons decorated with sirens and griffins,
ornamental carts, horse equipment, ivory beads and thrones decorated with unparalleled
elegance are all witness to their high level of civilization (Prehistoric Cyprus, 2010).
No doubt, those ancient place-names, which have not been changed by the linguistic
imperialism of the conquering states driven by bias, can be counted as certain proof of the
presence or absence of one or another people (Grandpierre K. Endre, 1996). The
examination of the Eurasian place-names supports the theory of the Transylvanian-Székely
origin of the settlements of the Eurasian Plains. (Bihari, 2004) Herodotus writes that the
Scythians called themselves: “Szkolota” or, if we remove the –ta suffix indicating the name
of a people, we will arrive at the “Szkol, Szikul, Székely” people name. The computer
examination of the several hundred million place-names indicates that variations of the
place-name “sz*k*(l)” (here the * indicates the possible vowel) are found most often in
Transylvania and Moldova, in the Carpathian Basin and then in Eurasia. In the wider search
of all of Eurasia, the Transylvanian place-names come up in large numbers. Bihari writes
(op. cit. p. 91) that, according to the witness of the place-names, the Székely names are
none other than the modern version of the ancient Szaka names. However, the above
mentioned facts would lead us to conclude that the situation is the reverse: the Székely
names are the older versions.
According to our examination, the Scythians are of Székely-Magyar origin. From 5100 BC
to the time of the ancient Greeks, their population must have multiplied many times. In
that geographical territory in which they lived for millennia, from 5100 BC to AD 453, to
the time of Atilla’s assassination, they spread from the Carpathian Basin to Korea and
Northern India (Grandpierre K. Endre – Grandpierre Atilla, 2006; Grandpierre, 2007;
Aradi, 2005). This fact is supported by the observation that the ancient historians
considered the Scythians to be the most ancient people with the largest population. “For
if the Scythians were united, there is no nation which would compare with them; I do not
say in Europe, but even in Asia...” (Thucydides, 431 BC, translated into English by
Benjamin Jowett, Volume 1, 1881, Clarendon Press, Book II, §97, p. 163). Terdzsüman
Mahmud, the scholarly Hungarian interpreter of Sultan Suleiman I, in his ancient chronicle
of the time of King Árpád, written in Hungarian, the Tárih-i-Üngürüsz (History of the
Magyars – the name „üngürüsz” was the name of the Magyars in the Turkish language)
similarly recalls the people found by Hunor in the Carpathian Basin in the time following
the Deluge: Hunor, son of Nimrod – “left the Padisha of Adzsem (Persia) and, with his
people, moved to the Province of Pannonia. When they arrived in this province, they saw
that there was an abundance of fruit and grain in this country and, in their language (that
is in the language of the people of Hunor), they were able to speak to the inhabitants.”



62
The ancient chronicle, written by the bards (“regös”, in Hungarian) at that time (before 896
A.D.), proves that the “Üngürüsz” people were descendants of the people of Hunor.
This is a perfectly clear line of reasoning that proves the thousand-year-old antiquity of the
ancient existence of the Magyar people, and it is a proof that the Magyars were living in
the Carpathian Basin in the time following the Deluge, and that they migrated from here in
undetermined times to the other land of the Scythians, east of Europe. Endre K. Grandpierre
(1979, 1990) has shown that our legends of the Wondrous Stag look back over several tens
of thousands of years and bear witness to the return of the Magyars to their ancient home,
the Carpathian Basin, according to the will of God.
In agreement with Thucydides, Xenophon also writes that the Scythians ruled Europe: “in
Europe we find the Scythians ruling, and the Maeotians being ruled.” (Xenophon,
Memorabilia, Book Two, cca. 371 B.C.) This statement is fully supported by the
archaeological finds (see the map of the Scythian archaeological finds, Illustration 10.).
Illustration 10. The map of Scythian archaeological findings, 1st millennium B. C.
The Scythian influence spread to Korea and Japan. Certain Korean artifacts, even some
very important ones like the crown of the Korean Silla kingdom, show Scythian
characteristics. Archaeologists have found similar crowns with Scythian characteristics in
the Kofun period of Japan (AD 250-538), or the so-called Hun age (Cambon et al., 2006,
282). The Chinese took over from the Scythians the animal style (Mallory, Mair 2000).
The influence of the Hun-Magyar folk music on the Chinese folk music can be shown to



63
be of great importance even today (Juhász, 2005). In very ancient times, before the dawn
of the Chinese religion, there could have been organized parishes of the Magus religion (de
Groot [1982, VI, II:1187]). In the millennia before Christ, the Magi played a leading role
in the Chinese religion (Schafer [2005, 234]). Victor H. Mair, Professor of the Chinese
language and literature, found archaeological and linguistic proofs that the Old-Chinese
word “*myag” meaning magus, natural healer, philosopher, was not of Chinese but of
Central Asian origin (Mair [1990]).
In China, the teachings of the Magi were primarily most important in the ancient royal
religion. (Harper, 1995). The Chinese Universalism, Confucianism and Taoism were built
upon the teachings of the Magi. We learn from the books of Professor Modi (Modi, 1926)
and Eva Aradi (Aradi, 2005) that the Scythian-Magyar-Hun culture had a very basic
influence on the history and civilization of India (Grandpierre, 2007). The authoritative
and trustworthy historian, Josephus Flavius (AD 37) writes in his work: Antiquitates
(Flavius, 1957, 59) that the people of Magog and Gomer, after the Deluge, went “as far as
the Tanais (Don) River, and in the West as far as Gadeir (today Cadiz), occupying the land
which they came to and which before them nobody had occupied, and in their own
language, they named the people.” In his ancient legend about the Scythians, Herodotus
notes that Hargita was the first man to be born in the “uninhabited territory”, in other
words, Man appeared in the Carpathian Basin with the Scythians.
In the Hungarian chronicles of the Middle Ages and in Hungarian folk traditions, is
preserved the belief that the Magyars were at one time the most populous people of the
world. The ancient kings of the Magyars were the rulers of the four points of the compass;
they organized the network of the guardians of the four points, including the four rivers
and the four sections of the coat of arms of the lion of Esztergom. The affection for the
ancient homeland is expressed in the Medieval slogan: “Extra Hungariam non est vita.”
(There is no life except in Hungary.) (Grandpierre K. Endre, 1996). The several thousand
year-old antiquity of the Székelys in Transylvania has only recently come to light. (Orbán
Grandpierre, 2009).
In the light of all this, it is time that we recognize that it is more appropriate, in place of the
Scythian-Hun origin of the Székely Hungarians, to speak of the Székely-Magyar origin of
the Scythian-Hun people.

Scythian / Hun / Avar / Magyar Cultural Connections156
According to Otto Maenchen-Helfen, the Latin Chroniclers of the fifth century A.D. knew "next to nothing about the Scythians, Cimmerians and Massagetae, whose names the
Greek authors constantly interchanged with that of the Huns."157 He says that Jerome
identified Herodotus' Scythians with the Huns,158 and he himself identifies the Huns with
the Royal Scythians.159 Renate Rolle describes the Scythian costume, as depicted on a vessel found in the Pazyrik graves in Siberia: "The long, braided tunics are of embroidered,
fur trimmed leather. Trousers, embroidered lengthways, and soft ankle-length boots
complete their outfit."160 The Hun shepherds wore a pointed sheepskin hat, sheepskin vest
or tunic and wide trousers and boots. According to Gyula László, the Magyars of the time
of Árpád wore a similar costume.161
The Scythian horseman trained his horse to kneel down. Renate Rolle tells us:
"This was very important in battle as kneeling on command could mean the
difference between life and death for a fallen and heavily armed warrior, relatively
immobile on foot, who could save time getting swiftly back on his kneeling horse."
This was not a custom known to the Greeks. "If it had been Xenophon would not
have left us such exquisite instructions on the mounting of a horse - by clutching
the mane or using the lance in a kind of pole-vault in order to catapult onto the
saddle. He lays particular emphasis on 'posture'. The ancient writer warns that the
rider might otherwise present 'an indecent sight from behind' since trousers were
unknown to the Greeks."162
The Scythians/ Huns/ Avars/Magyars all used saddles, stirrups and horseshoes. The Roman
army, even in the third century A.D., went to war without those essential pieces of
equipment, which were introduced into Europe by the Germanic people, a thousand years
after the Huns.163 The stirrup came into use in Europe around A.D. 700. The acceptance of
the use of the stirrup led a whole era into Europe - the age of Chivalry, according to Viktor
Padányi.164 At this time the stirrup had been used by Turanian peoples, in particular the
Uz people, for 2500 years.

The tents of the Hun villages were on wheels and were artistically created. These yurts
were comfortable and warm and contained a cooking stove and chairs. The Chinese
adopted the Hun custom of sitting on chairs. The Hun families had many children; the
Scythian, Hun and Magyar children rode on the backs of the sheep and learned how to use
the bow and arrow.165 There were more women around the tents than men. The women
were partners to their husbands and had a voice in decision-making. Hun women had more
rights than Chinese women; this is why the Chinese gave some of their women to the Huns
for wives. A few of the Chinese wives even organized coups in the Hun history. The Huns
had large numbers of skilled workers to supply the hundreds of thousands of soldiers with
the equipment they needed, the saddles, stirrups, bits and bridles, the bows and arrows,
carriages and wheels etc. Their principal foods were milk products and meat from the hunt.
The Huns enjoyed their fermented milk, "koumiss", and the Scythians and Magyars
likewise. They all had a custom of riding with a piece of meat under the saddle. It has been
commonly believed that they did this to soften the meat and eat it raw, a custom attributed
to barbarians. Who would have thought that these "barbarians" knew that the raw meat had
healing properties which eased the saddle sores on the mount's back?
In battle the Huns, Scythians and Magyars used the tactics of repeated attack and
retreat. The horsemen must have trained rigorously and diligently to have been able to react
obediently and swiftly to the signals to attack and retreat, turning their bodies in the saddle
and continuing to fire their arrows as they retreated. At another signal they turned around
and again attacked the enemy. This was later named the "Parthian shot" and may well be
the origin of our phrase "parting shot". The Greeks called the Scythians "horse-archers"
because they were so skillful with their small composite bow. These horse-archers were
ambidextrous and extremely accurate and their arrows traveled a great distance (over 500
meters). A practiced archer could shoot around twenty arrows a minute. According to Renate Rolle, "a composite bow of this nature would have taken between five and ten years
to produce, as special types of wood and horsehair string were used and long periods of
seasoning were necessary."166 It required a significant amount of skill to produce such a
bow. The arrowheads used by the Scythians were made of bronze. The later Huns
introduced arrowheads made of iron which could penetrate metal armor.
The Hun horseman who brought home a head from battle received a glass of wine from
the Senyő (emperor). There is no evidence to show that the Huns kept slaves. Bravery was
held in high regard and even a brave prisoner was allowed to fight among the leaders. The
Huns took care of their injured fighters, about two thousand years before the other peoples
of the world. It was the soldier's duty to bring out of the battle the body of a comrade who
had died. Those who brought out a corpse inherited all his movable goods.
There is no evidence that either the Scythians or the Huns were fishermen but, according
to Renate Rolle, some Scythians were farmers. They grew barley, millet, rye, peas, lentils, beans, flax and hemp. "In recent years, indications of horticulture have been increasing.
The charred pips of apples and cherries verify their cultivation; drying ovens for fruit show
a kind of preserving system which is still in use today."167 Otto Maenchen-Helfen also

writes that the Huns practiced agriculture.168 Claudius and Ammianus denied them the
knowledge of agriculture.
The Huns were the first to develop a tribal system. Later, one tribal leader became ruler
over all the tribes. This unified the entire Hun people. The Magyars had a similar system.
Within the empire there was a loose territorial interdependence. There was almost total
autonomy from the Emperor. Civil wars between the tribes, instigated by the Chinese,
caused the fall of the Hun Empire.
A world power such as the Hun Empire must have developed an organized system for
keeping order. Their military organization was based on the decimal system. That in itself
shows a great level of civilization. The Chinese Annals mention twenty-four high
dignitaries. Under each of these were 10,000 men. There was one commander or corporal
for every ten men. (This commander in Hungarian is called a "tizedes". "Tiz" means "ten".)
For every ten corporals there was one captain. (Captain in Hungarian is "százados". "Száz"
means "one hundred".) Over ten captains, was the colonel. (Colonel in Hungarian is
"ezredes". "Ezer" means "one thousand".) In charge of ten colonels was a commander
called "tizezredes". "Tizezer" means "ten-thousand". The entire army was divided into four
army corps. Each army corps had 100,000 men and a commander who was called a
"százezredes". ("Százezer" means "one hundred thousand".) These four commanders
reported directly to the Senyő (emperor). If the Huns were so "boorish" and "barbarian" as
they are so often called, they would not have been able to develop such a precise system,
and moreover maintain it for a long period of time. In later years, the Magyars also
organized their armies according to the decimal system. The Chinese Annals praise the
Hun laws. Between the Senyő and the nation there must have been an agreement that the
new Senyő must be elected from among his descendants. In their three-thousand-year
history there was not one occasion that the Senyő was elected from another family. The
Huns, Scythians and Magyars all had the custom of swearing an oath with blood, (blood
brotherhood). By drinking a mixture of wine and their own blood, into which their weapons
had been dipped, they swore allegiance for life. Two warriors drank from a single drinking horn. Renate Rolle says: "This simultaneous drinking was obviously important; it sealed
the bond to the death and perhaps even beyond into the next world."169 Renate Rolle shows
a picture of a gold plaque depicting two Scythian warriors swearing blood brotherhood.
This plaque was from the Kul-Oba kurgan from the 4th century B.C. This shared custom
of swearing blood brotherhood proves the relationship between the Huns, Scythians and
Magyars more than anything else does. In a nation's history, the language might change
but the customs generally survive.
There is another custom which is shared by the Huns and the Magyars. Once a year,
when the leaders came together for a National Assembly, those who did not participate
were expelled from the union. The Senyő nominated his heir but the National Assembly
elected him. The rite of election was not regulated. This caused the wars of succession
among both the Huns and the Magyars. Benedek Baráthosi Balogh writes that the Magyars,
in their thought, their customs, their laws and their temperament were completely identical
to the Huns. The Huns were a warlike army people but according to the Chinese Annals,
they did not have the custom of vendetta or blood feud.
168 Maenchen-Helfen, Otto: Op.Cit. p. 174-176. 169 Rolle, Renate: Op. Cit. p. 62.

Benedek Baráthosi Balogh reports:
"Whosoever raises his sword against another, shall be killed. Whosoever steals
from another, his family shall be taken (probably as servants). For smaller
infringements of the law, the penalty is a whipping. For larger ones, execution. The
longest term of imprisonment was ten days and very few prisoners could be
found."170
The Szekel Chronicles of Csik, about 1796, state that the Székelys are the descendants of the Huns and one of their laws stated: "To be born as a Székely means to be born free."
The chronicles do not mention imprisonment as a punishment for crime. It is commonly
believed that the name Székely (Szekel) is derived from Scytha (Scythian).
As for the religion of the ancient Scythians, they worshipped the Sun-God and they also
had a custom of sacrificing a white horse. In China, the Huns did likewise but the Magyars
no longer sacrificed horses. They honored the white horse and valued horses so much that
they buried many horses along with their master. Some of the Hun/Scythian burial customs
were carried on by the Avars and Magyars who also buried servants, horses and treasures along with their lord. "The Hun custom of disfiguring their faces with deep wounds as an
expression of mourning was also found among the Magyars. Jordanes mentions it in
"Getica."171 The Scythians also practiced similar mourning rituals of disfigurement.172 The
Scythians, Huns and Magyars all believed in life after death and provided the corpse with
all the comforts he would need on his journey to the next world. They regarded the
cemetery as sacred ground. The Huns and Magyars also practiced religious tolerance.
Among the Huns of Atilla, Buddhism, Nestorianism, Manicheism and Christianity were all
accepted. Manicheism, which was the practice of Christianity excluding the Old
Testament, originated in the Parthian Empire. Nestorianism was a similar religious
philosophy. When the Sassanid dynasty of Persia broke up the Parthian Empire in A.D.
302, the Parthians, who were also known as Aparni, Avars, Huns and Magyars, formed a
new empire in the Carpathian Basin which became known as the Avar Empire, and they
brought with them these sects of Eastern Christianity. (The Magyars were just as tolerant
as the Huns and the Avars. In 1568, at the National Assembly at Torda, Hungary was the
first country in the world to announce freedom of religion.) The Senyő of the Huns greeted
the rising sun every morning with open arms and every month he greeted the new moon in
the same manner. The Huns believed in the spirits of Heaven and Earth. They believed in
foretelling the future by the stars. This was a very ancient custom. There were Magi
(shamans) among the Huns as among other Turanian peoples.
When the history of the Eastern Huns came into public knowledge, it was not accepted
by many of the Western historians because some of the dates did not correspond with those
of Western history. The major reason for this reluctance to accept it was that, on the borders
of Europe, Hun tribes were found at the time that they were recorded to have existed in
China. Western historians did not realize that the Hun Empire was so large that it reached
almost to the borders of Europe. In about A.D. 452, the King of Suk-tak sent an envoy to
170 Baráthosi-Balogh, Benedek: A hunok Három Világ Birodalma, Buenos Aires, 1974. quotation from the Chinese Annals. 171 Maenchen-Helfen, Otto: Op. Cit. p. 274 172 Trippett, Frank: The First Horsemen, Time Life Books, 1974, New York, p. 118.



70
the Hsiung-Nu Huns to ask the Huns to release the merchants who were captured at the
Conquest of Kutsang. The country of Suk-tak was the country that the Western historians
called the country of the Alans. Because the King of the Alans died fighting against the
Hsiung-Nu Huns, his country became part of the Hun Empire. We know from the Western
Chronicles, that the Huns, together with the Alans, attacked the Eastern Goths in A.D. 375.
The people of the Csitki Huns, in the middle of the first century before Christ,
disappeared from the records of the Chinese. In 91 B.C. the same thing happened with the
people of the Northern Huns. They ceased to be mentioned in the Chinese chronicles. In
A.D. 261, the Topa peoples were pressing all the peoples who were in their way, including
the Huns. At this time, the Black Huns173 were living in the territory of the Urals. The
White Huns were living on the Eastern shores of the Caspian Sea. Ammianus Marcellinus
records the home of the Huns to be beside the Caspian Sea. Marcianus Heracleata writes
that the Huns lived in the Boristhenes territory after the Alans. The Magyar Chronicles
from A.D. 373 on, record that the Hun leaders were the ancestors of the Magyars.174 They
mention Béla, Köve, Kadicsa, and also a leader named Kádár. The Chronicles mention that
two Hun families were eligible for the election of the Senyő, Zemény and Érd. Senyő Kun
originated from the Zemény family and also Karotán, Uld and Rugacs. With Rugacs, the
family died out. The Érd family was well-known for the Senyős Oktár, Rof, Etele (Atilla)
and Buda.
Not only are similarities in customs an obvious connection between the Huns,
Scythians, Avars and Magyars but also similarities in the motifs in their art and music. Dr.
Miklós Érdy has conducted research in Central Asia in Uighuria, Chorezm, Turkistan
(Bukharia), and East Turkistan. He collected folk motifs in embroidery and folk songs,
which are identical to Hungarian folk motifs, and brought them back to Hungary. On one
of his journeys, Dr. Érdy became acquainted with Du Yaxiong, who conducts research in
Chinese folklore and music, and who, contrary to the usual lines of research, is researching
the connections between the Hun and the Magyar folk music following it from East to
West. Du Yaxiong has stated that the structure of the Magyar folk songs, which are on a
pentatonic scale, strongly resembles that of the Uighur folk songs. He supports the
statement of Zoltán Kodály that the Magyar folk music is "totally different" from the
Finnish folk music. In 1987, Zoltán Kallós, a Hungarian ethnographer, also emphasized
that there was no relationship between the Hungarian and Finnish folk music. Where
similarities between the folk music of these two peoples were apparent, it was concluded
that they were due to the Turkish influence on both. Du Yaxiong states that the Uighur language was "the same as the Hun but with a slight difference."175 Dr. István Kiszely also
supports the relationship between the Uighur and Magyar folk music and folk motifs in
embroidery.176
Both Béla Bartok and Zoltán Kodály noticed that the character of the Chinese folk songs
and Hungarian folk songs was very similar but neither of them suggested the influence of
173 The Chinese recognized five compass points, each represented by a color. Black was the color of North. West was white, South red, and East was blue. Yellow was the color of the center of the compass. The Western Huns or Ephthalita probably received their name from this. They are often called the White Huns. (Baráthosi-Balogh Benedek: Op. Cit.) 174 Baráthosi-Balogh Benedek: Op. Cit. p. 134-135.

the Huns' migration to the West. Kodály said: "Time wiped the Easterners' character from
the Hungarian people's faces, but cannot stop the flow of melodies from the depths of their
hearts and thus shows the ancient East." He also said that the Hungarian folk music was
"the ancient tributary of that great thousand-year old Asian music and culture."177
The Huns began to move towards the West in A.D. 91. The characteristics of the songs
of the Hun peoples remained in the folk music of the Uighurs and the Magyars. According
to the French and American history books, the Uighurs in the sixth century were the
teachers of the Asian countries. In their zenith they were more advanced than the Indians
and Chinese, and the Arabs learned from them. Dr. Érdy states that the German researchers
support the Hun-Magyar connection. The research of the Chinese folk music indicates that
the Magyar folk music is rooted in the Hun music. There are numerous written documents
dating back more than a thousand years, the Magyar Chronicles, the legend of the
Enchanted Stag,178 the writings of Constantine Porphyrogenitus, all of which support the
Hun-Magyar connections. Constantine Porphyrogenitus called the Magyars "Sabir
Asphaloi". It is a known fact that the Sabirs or Subareans were a Hun people.
In the Hungarian folk art, the favorite motif is the tulip. Ethnographers believe that this
tulip motif is one of the most ancient ornamental motifs of the Magyars. In spite of its
ancient origins, historians state that tulips were introduced into Hungary in the seventeenth
century from Holland. In his Asian research, Dr. Érdy has found that the tulip motif is a
very old motif. The home of the wild tulip is in Central Asia, where there can be found a
hundred and twenty-five varieties. Royal Hungarian ornamental objects from the 11th, 12th
and 13th centuries, along with money and paintings, have been found bearing the tulip
motif. The ivy motif was the favorite motif of the Árpád dynasty. It was found on Atilla's
sword and other articles. The tulip motif can be found on the coronation robe of King
(Saint) Stephen, which was made in the 11th century. This tulip motif can be traced back
to the 5th and 4th centuries B.C. In the Pazyrik mound graves of Huns or Scythians in the
Altai Mountains, carpets were found ornamented with this motif. According to the design
on one carpet, the dead Hun or Scythian ruler, on his horse, is riding before God who,
sitting on a throne, is handing him an ivy vine, with the flower of life, the tulip, at the top.
That symbolized life after death.179
Dr. Érdy describes how the people of the Steppes celebrated the coming of spring. After
a long, cold winter, in the middle of April, when the sun warms up, millions of multi
colored flowers cover the Steppes. The people living there count this flowering as the
beginning of their year. They count their years, not from the rotations of the moon or the
earth, but from the number of times the Steppes have flowered. This is why the tulip flower
became known as the flower of life.180
177 Du Yaxiong: Op. Cit. from Kodaly, Zoltán: On the Hungarian Folk Music. 178 The Legend of the Enchanted Stag (also called Miraculous or Wondrous Stag) is the origin legend of the Magyars. The two sons of Nimrod, Hunor and Magor, when they were hunting, followed a beautiful doe with stars on its antlers to the land of the Alans, where they found the two daughters of the king, each with fifty handmaidens. Hunor and Magor married the daughters of the king and established the two peoples, the Huns and the Magyars. The Hungarian „szarvasünő” in the legend means „antlered doe” which traditionally is translated as „stag”. (Editor) 179Trippett, Frank: Op.Cit. Picture on p. 132. 180 Szittyakürt, 1989, Mar-Apr. p.8. (Later mentioned in Érdy Miklós : A magyarság keleti eredete és hun kapcsolata, Budapest, 2010. Editor)



72
The Hun peoples brought with them from the Steppes the motifs of the ivy and the tulips.
According to Gyula Németh, the ancient name of the tulip was "Lola", and it remains in
the Persian and Arab languages as "Lola", later becoming a girl's name. In the Turkish
language the tulip is called "la-le".
Besides the tulip, there is another ornamental motif on the coronation robe of King
(Saint) Stephen, the bird motif. Until recently, it was thought to be used as a filler, having
no significance, yet in heraldry, birds have an important position as protectors. On each
side of the tulip, they stand in a watchful stance with their heads turned backwards facing
the tulip. The "daru" (crane) is the noblest species of the protecting birds of heraldry
because of its extraordinary vigilance. Between the tenth and fourteenth centuries it was
widely favored among the Magyars as a domesticated bird used for warning against
strangers because its hearing was even sharper than a dog's. This is why it was given a
place on the coronation robe as a guard-bird. Two species of these cranes were widespread
in Hungary. One was the common grey crane (Grus g. grus) and the other was the
demoiselle crane (Anthropoides virgo). Both species made their nests in almost all the
territories where the wild tulips grew. The grey crane nested more to the north of the
demoiselle crane. The Magyar people became acquainted with these birds on the Steppes
of Central Asia and came to like them. An interesting fact is that the Goths were also steppe
people originally, but in the German folk motifs or religious heraldry, these guard-birds
can be found in only a few places. At the same time, they are wide-spread in Hungary.
From the early Western European, Byzantine, Armenian, Arab, and Persian sources, it
can be shown that the Magyar folk-poetry, folk-tales, folk-art, archaeological findings such
as swords and arrows, horses, dogs, Magyar burial customs, their horse burial customs all
show connections with the Huns. In caves in China, used by the Huns, Dr. Érdy discovered
cave drawings depicting the legend of the Enchanted Stag. He found these drawings in
Cave No. 249 at Dun Huang, in the county of Gasu, in northwest China and published his
findings in 1984.
Another Hungarian legend, the dream of Emese, can also be found among the legends
of the Buryats in Mongolia where the highest shaman was supposed to have been born
from a mother who was inseminated by an eagle. According to the Hungarian legend,
Ugyek, the descendant of Atilla, took Emese as his wife. On their wedding night, Emese
was visited by a great bird, the TURUL bird, a huge eagle, which descended upon her,
covering her with his black wings. Half asleep, half awake, Emese had a dream. It seemed
that a crystal spring had sprung from her loins and began to flow toward the West, growing
bigger and bigger, into a swelling stream, flowing over snow-covered mountains, finally
reaching a beautiful plain. There, the river stopped, and a magnificent tree sprang up from
its waters. Every branch and leaf of that tree was of pure gold, as was the fruit which grew
abundantly on the miraculous tree. Emese, in her dream, lay down under that tree, in the
middle of the beautiful land, and fell asleep. When she awoke, she was back in her
husband's tent. The memory of that dream stayed with her forever. Nine months later, a
son was born to Emese, the first-born son of Ügyek. He was named ÁLMOS (Boy of
Dream) and became the father of ÁRPÁD, who led the Magyars across plains and
mountains into that beautiful land which once belonged to the Huns and which was,
according to the minstrel's songs, their rightful inheritance.181

In 1983 and 1984, Dr. Érdy researched the Hungarian folk motifs. He found 23 basic
motifs identical to the Scythian, Hun, Subarean and Altaic peoples, and none which were
similar to those of the Finno-Ugric peoples. In 1989, Dr. Érdy presented the results of his
researches to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and opened a new avenue of research.
In 1988, Professor Izabella Horváth, an art historian, in a paper entitled "From Inner
Asia to the Carpathian Basin" presented the results of her research into the art of the
Magyar people, and contested the theory that it was influenced by the Byzantine, Persian
and Islamic art.182
Izabella Horváth and her colleagues collected animal motifs in the territory of Eurasia.
They studied artifacts from the museums, and pictures in archaeological reviews. They
developed three charts showing those cultural characteristics which they intended to
analyze. The thirty-eight animal motifs were divided into five groups. The chart showed
that the motifs of the Scythians, Huns, Avars and Magyars were for the most part identical.
The second chart showed so few resemblances between the Finno-Ugric and Magyar
motifs, that they can be disregarded. The third chart showed much less of a resemblance to
the Sassanidan, Persian, Byzantine and Islamic art than to the Scythian-Hun-Avar art. In
the first chart, the griffin motif appears in a substantial number of designs, more than any
other animal. The second chart compares the griffin motif in the same way as the first chart.
Here it can be seen that the griffin motif appears more often in the art of the Huns,
Scythians, Avars and Magyars than it does in the art of any other people. Griffins are often
depicted guarding the Scythian gold. Again it was very obvious that in the Byzantine and
Islamic art, the griffin motifs were much fewer in number than in the art of the people of
the Steppes. In the German or Carolingian arts, the griffin motif appeared even less often,
yet Minns, Fettich Nándor, and Talbot Rice, stated that the arts of the Germans originate
from the Scythian art.183 They based their assumption mainly on animal motifs. Yet in the
Hungarian folk art the griffin appears in much larger numbers than among the Germans.
This is why it is advisable to reexamine the former conclusions.
Western historians have attributed the origins of the Hungarian folk arts to the Byzantine
folk arts, because it never even occurred to them that a "barbarian, nomadic people” with
"Finno-Ugric" origins could have developed such beautiful motifs.
It is a well-known fact that among the peoples of the Steppes, birds of prey signified
godly origins. The lion and the tiger signified the power and strength of royalty. This is
why, in the folk art, the bird of prey and the lion or tiger blended into a single motif and
the griffin evolved with a bird's head and a lion's body. The griffin came to signify the
godly origin and power of the royalty and the griffin motif was found most often on royal
possessions and garments, for example the Hungarian coronation robe, the artifacts in the
Pazyrik graves of the Scythians and the Noi-ula Hun graves.
In the Magyar legend of the dream of Emese and the legend of the origins of the Buryat
people, the nation originated from God in the form of an eagle. The doe was the ancient
mother of the nation. The leader whose father was the Turul bird or eagle, (legend of the
dream of Emese) and whose mother was a doe, (legend of the Enchanted Stag) must have
had great power at that time. The pair of griffins guarding the tree of life is a motif which

often occurs in the folk arts of the people of the Steppes and the Magyars. The conception
of Álmos, the son of Emese, by the Turul bird, signifies his heavenly origins. Arnold Ipolyi
describes Álmos and Árpád as priest-kings.184
In the folk arts of the Steppe people, the griffin motif indicates the duty of the priest
king towards his people. This cannot be found in the art of the Ostyak and Votyak people
living near the river Ob in Siberia, who are supposedly the ancestors of the Magyars. Álmos
originated from the TURUL clan from which the Turks, who ruled for a long period in the
territories of the steppes of Eurasia, also originated. Csernyecov demonstrates that the
Steppe peoples migrated from the south and east toward the north and not, as the Finno
Ugric linguists state, from north to south.185
The data from the folklore show that there is a resemblance between the Magyars and
the Eastern peoples.186 The tale of the Tree which reaches to Heaven is the most often
mentioned. A dragon kidnaps a girl and carries her to the top of the tree which reaches to
Heaven. Those who started out to try to save her all died in the attempt. Finally, the little
swine-herd tried to free her. With his axe, he cut steps in the trunk of the tree and climbed
higher and higher, reaching the different levels. On each level was a different world. On
one level lived the Wind, on another, the Moon, and on another, the mother of the Sun.
These all helped the little swine-herd to reach his goal. The researcher stated that this folk
tale represents the ceremony of the táltos or shaman (holy man). The shaman, in a similar
way, climbed higher and higher up a tree which was raised in the middle of the tent. This
folk-tale preserves the beliefs of the ancient religion. The ancient people believed in the
tree of life which was the life-giver and preserver of every living creature. That there were
connections to the cosmos is shown by the fact that on the seventh and ninth branch of the
tree lived the Sun and the Moon. Adorján Magyar has related the legend of the Enchanted
Stag187, in which he describes the twins, Hunor and Magor, growing up into hunters. He
describes their adventures as small children, climbing higher and higher up the mountain
in search of the mother of the Moon and the mother of the Sun.
The archaeological findings seem to prove that the people who used the griffin and ivy
motifs were made up of people from three different territories which were far from each
other. The people who used only the griffin motif came from the territory of the Iranian
plateau into the Carpathian Basin, but not by a direct route. They first went to the territory
called Magna Hungaria where they joined with the people who used the ivy motif and here
a people who used the acanthus motif, who originated in the Caucasus, obtained power
over them. This consolidated group, now called Avars, then migrated to the Carpathian
Basin to rejoin their brother-peoples in the land of Atilla.
Those who used the griffin motif came from a territory where there was no forest and
birds of prey were dominant. This is how they developed the griffin motif. Those who used
the ivy motif came from a territory of dense forests. The griffin is connected to the Magyar
legend of the Turul bird and the ivy to the legend of the Tree of Life.
Géza Radics writes: "Herodotus, the father of history-writing, in the 5th century,
mentions a revolution which broke out among the Scythians. As a result of this revolution,
184 Ipolyi, Arnold: Magyar Mytho1ógia. 1854. 185 Csernyecov: The Prehistory of Western Siberia, (1974). Izabella Horvath: Op. Cit. 186 Berze-Nagy, János: A Magyarság Néprajza III, Ch.3, "A Mese" (The Folk Tale), Mossy, Sándor: Keleti Elemek Népmeseinkben (1927), p.38-43. 187 Magyar Adorján: A Csodaszarvas, Budapest, 1991



75
the Scythians were forced to leave their territory north of the Black Sea. According to
Herodotus, the Scythians settled in the above-mentioned territory of Magna Hungaria. It is
not impossible that the ancestors of the people of the griffin motif could be found among
these Scythians, who were living near the people of the ivy motif in Magna Hungaria or
even together with them until they went together to the Carpathian Basin. It is probable
that the Scythian/Magyar identity evolved from here."188
The story of the tree of life was widespread in almost every territory where the Magyar
language was spoken. At the time of the people of Árpád, it must have been even more
well-known. This is why we would expect the ornaments of the Arpád era to reflect the
knowledge of this tree of life, just as it is reflected in the folk-art of the Eastern peoples.
However, in the folk art of the Arpád era, not one artifact represents the tree of life. In the
folkart of the Árpád people, the palm motif was often used. Among the early Avars, we
can find the motif of the tree of life carved on bones, and also among the later Avars, carved
onto belts and belt-buckles. Gyula László writes that wherever the motifs of the griffin and
ivy were found, the language was Magyar and suggests that the Magyars inherited the story
of the Tree of Life from the Avars.189
Historians have stated that the legends of the Tree of Life, the Turul bird and the
Enchanted Stag are actually totem legends. The progenitress (ancestress) of the twin
brothers, Hunor and Magor, was the Doe, which led them through the Meotis Marsh. The
belt buckles of the later Avars carried the design of the doe. We may conclude that the
legend of the enchanted stag and the legend of the tree of life both originate from the later
Avars.
In Hungarian territory, archaeologists have found belt buckles of the later Avars,
ornamented with animal representations such as the deer, the bird, the lion, the wild boar
and others. The Árpád Chronicles only mention one totem animal, the Turul bird, which
Árpád inherited from Atilla. The origins of the belief in the totem animals go back much
further than the time of the homecoming of Árpád. Among the Székely Hungarians there
is still the belief that they are of Hun origins.
The legends of the Enchanted Stag and the Tree of Life, and the folk music all indicate
Avar-Hun connections. The Saint László legend also reveals pagan connections. Saint
László, the blond horseman, fought against the black-haired Kun (Cumanian) horseman
who had kidnapped a Magyar girl. Originally the legend probably had pagan protagonists,
but in the eleventh century, Saint László was the hero. This was originally a cosmic drama
in which Light fought against Darkness and Good against Bad. Both warriors were
invincible but the Kun had only one vulnerable point, his heel tendon. The Magyar girl cut
this tendon and the Kun warrior was defeated. The horses followed their masters' example
and fought each other, biting and kicking each other. This legend is also found among the
Scythians who predated the Greeks. The Greek legend of Achilles must have been adopted
from the Scythians.
These data are important for several reasons. Firstly, because the date of the Magyars'
reclamation of their homeland is about four-hundred years earlier than is now accepted.
Secondly, the Carpathian Basin was not a sparsely populated area occupied by Slavs, as is
commonly believed and thirdly, the Magyars who reclaimed their homeland were not

barbarians but had connections with the Scythians, Huns, Avars and the ancient populace
of the Carpathian Basin who had lived there for millennia.

THE SCYTHIAN - SCOTTISH – HUNGARIAN
RELATIONSHIP
Hungarian schools do not teach the possibility of any Scottish-Hungarian
connections. Chance meetings or visits with the Scottish people inevitably initiate a line of
thinking, especially when one hears the first syllable of so many Scottish names, Mac,
which seems an echo of a distant past to Hungarian ears. In the Scottish language, Mac
means a boy, a descendant or the seed of someone. (The Irish use Mc.) For example, the
name MacArthur can be translated into Hungarian as the mag (seed) of Arthur (Artur
magja), where the Scottish Mac and the Hungarian Mag appear to be twin brothers. After
this linguistic curiosity, one begins to pay increased attention to the very Hungarian
sounding geographic names in the British Isles, like Lake Bala, the River Don and the
River Thames, which all have their counterparts in the Carpathian Basin as Lake Balaton,
River Duna and River Temes. One learns of the historical hardships of our new Scottish
acquaintances, their unfair treatment by historians, their love for freedom, their generous
spirit, and all these ignite a feeling of kinship in any Hungarian soul, since their fate and
spiritual aspirations are very much akin to those of the Scottish peoples. Even their beloved
instrument, the bagpipe, is familiar, since they too „blow their sorrow into sheepskin” – as
the Hungarian saying goes – like their Hungarian counterparts. The name of the River Don
encompasses a large territory with identical culture and language from the Russian plains,
through Hungary, all the way to the British Isles. The little box with Magyar runic (rovás)
characters, from the 8th century AD190 – which was found in Ruthwell in Northumbria
also indicates some ancient connection between these cultures. When and where did this
connection begin? The twin of the Hungarian mag (seed), the Scottish Mac (or Irish Mc),
leads us into the Scythian antiquity of the Scottish people and, through this, we find the
ancient homeland in the Carpathian Basin.
The Scottish fight for freedom and independence is not a new and fleeting interest;
it goes back untold centuries. The Declaration of Arbroath191 – composed in 1320 in the
Latin language – was made public on April 6, 1320 at Arbroath Abbey, which is not far to
the north from the famous St. Andrew’s Cathedral. The goal of this declaration was to
convince Pope John XXII, in Avignon, that the Scottish people formed an independent
nation and, for this reason, the British demands for their throne were not just. The famous
Scottish warrior, Robert the Bruce, defeated the British at Bannockburn in 1314, and
reoccupied the border town of Berwick-on-Tweed in 1319. For Hungarians, the most
interesting section of this declaration is the part where they talk about their Scythian origin.
This Scythian connection is this people’s ancient inheritance, which they do not fail to hand

over to their children as do the Hungarian people, even under the watchful eye of hostile
occupiers. This common Scythian connection of the Scottish and the Hungarian people
may open up many hitherto unresearched avenues of this Scottish-Hungarian relationship,
with the promise of success.
The history of the Scots is intertwined with the history of the Celtic population of
the British Isles. The history of the British Isles leads us back into a pre-nation antiquity.
Their legends and landscapes are filled with beings of light, fairies, and giants. The first
historical people there, recognized by today’s scholars, may be the Picts. Originally, they
came from Scythia in the third century AD, a rather recent event. Their king, Sodrik, died
in battle, while attempting to occupy land on the British Isles. They were banished to
Caithness, where their population increased greatly. Their society was matrilineal. At the
time of their arrival, they had their own script, which appears to contain a pre-Celtic
language, according to western scholars. The name by which they called themselves is not
known. The term Pict was given to them by the Romans. Drust, the son of the best- known
Pict king, Erp, “ruled for a hundred years”, mainly in the fifth century AD. They were
noted for their tattoos and the name, Cruithne, given to them by the Irish, means “picture
people”. The Picts and Scots united in the 9th century. The Pict matrilineal society may
have paved the road toward the acceptance of Queen Margaret’s strong rule.
The cult of the “Stone of Destiny” goes back to Pict origins. Their coronations used
to take place in Scone, near Perth. The person to be crowned was seated on a stone. As
Scythian descendants, the Scots occupied more and more lands. Finally, Kenneth
MacAlpine, claiming Pict ancestry, had himself crowned King of the Picts and Scots.
According to Scottish legends, originally a Princess Tea brought this coronation stone from
Sumer to Ireland, where she married Tamair. According to Christianized mythology, Jacob
slept on this stone and it is known as Jacob’s Pillow. This Biblical belief places the origin
of this stone in the Sumerian City of Ur, where it was probably also held sacred and
probably used in marriage ceremonies or some other holy occasions, and it was for this
reason that it was brought to the British Isles, so far from Sumer. The names Tea and
Tamair have a linguistic connection with Sumerian and the names of the rivers Temes and
Thames are also connected with the Magyar szem culture. Tara’s landscape (in Ireland) is
adorned with round, flat topped mounds clearly discernible even today. These are
connected with the Hungarian tár-tér words of return, also the name Turan. This stone has
been used ever since for coronations. Prince Fergus, the founder of Dalriada192 brought
this stone from Ireland to the Island of Iona. This name is connected with the Jász-Magyar
group’s name of Iona.193 Later, Kenneth MacAlpin, King of the Picts, brought the stone to
Scone. Edward I of England captured the stone in 1296, and ordered it to be taken to
Westminster, to be used in the coronation of the English monarchs. Queen Elisabeth II
ordered it to be taken back to Scotland in 1996.
Since there are no coincidences in this world, it is interesting to note that the
Scottish Coronation stone, the Stone of Destiny was moved back to Scotland, ready for a
192 Gaelic kingdom in Northern Ireland and Northwestern Scotland (6th c. AD.) 193 Magyarságtudományi Értesítő, 1966. No. 2.

new coronation and, at the same time, the Hungarian Holy Crown moved back into the
Hungarian Parliament building, also ready to crown a new King.
The Hungarian word oath (eskű) contains the word stone (kű). According to
ethnographer, Adorján Magyar, in pre-Bible days some of the Magyar nations used to
swear an oath on a meteor-stone, which was considered pure and uncontaminated, coming
from above. Such a holy stone today is the Black obelisk of the Muslim world, which they
call Kaba and sometimes even Csaba.
A governing council of seven people ruled the country (Scotland) in the absence of
the King. The same custom is echoed in the persons of the Seven Dukes in Prince Árpád’s
time.194
Molmutin, the founder of a new royal family, divided his rule according to a dual
kingship between his sons Belinus and Brennius. Belinus was the main king; Brennius
became lord over the northern parts of the country (4th century BC). Hungarian ancestry
also recognizes the idea of dual-kingship. The names of Belinus and Brennius conjure up
many Magyar connections especially with the Palóc and Avar ethnic groups.
The newly awakening Scottish interest in their Scythian ancestry turns their
attention toward the Scythians of the Middle East, Egypt and the „lost tribes of Israel.” At
this point, I would like to remind our Scottish brethren that, even though historians of our
days do not like to think about the Scythian presence there, the still standing walls of
Scythopolis are testimony to their Scythian builders, inhabitants and rulers. According to
the origin saga by Diodorus Siculus, the descendants of Skythes extended their rule to the
Nile River in Egypt, then to the Eastern Ocean on one side, and the Caspian Sea and the
Maeotis Lake on the other. The Scottish legends about Egypt are also supported by
historical works. According to Hungarian legends, Palos, the son of Skythes rests in one of
the caves of the holy Pilis Mountains awaiting his time of awakening. We also have to pay
attention to Professor Lajos Szántai’s lecture195 in which he tells us about the coronation
of Hungarian Kings from the house of Árpád, as represented in the Illuminated Képes
Krónika. The about-to-be-crowned King is standing on a “dobogó”, a podium. The word
dobogó is connected with the holy Center of the Pilis Mountains and the Dobogókő, the
Stone of the Beating Heart. There seems to be some unknown, holy connection between
this stone and the Stone of Destiny, in the hope of resurrection.
According to Scottish legends, one of their noblemen married the Pharaoh’s
daughter Scota and they have used her name as their own since then. Later, the Scots (Celts)
were expelled from Egypt; they wandered for forty-two years looking for a new homeland
and finally settled in Spain. This wandering preceded the Mosaic wandering by centuries.
The Scots (Celts) remained in Spain for a thousand years and later moved to Ireland and
Scotland’s Argyll County, which the Scots called Dalriada in their own language. The first
home of their kings was Dunadd. All these names are connected in form and meaning with
the Hungarian language.
Before the Scottish occupation of the British Isles, the ruler of Ireland was a Queen
by the name of Cessair, whose father was Bith, son of Noah. The name Bith is connected
194 Prince Árpád ruled in 896 AD. The seven dukes were Álmos, Előd, Ond, Kont, Tas, Huba and Töhötöm. 195 http://www.magtudin.org/Kiralyi%20dobogo.htm

with the Hungarian viz (water) – which is a logical name for someone who survived the
flood – and it is a part of the Hungarian B-S word-group. According to another legend, the
sole survivor of this region was Fintan, whose name is related to the Hungarian word fény
(light). According to legend he was one of the ancient “shape shifting” people, a talent
which is often mentioned also in Hungarian stories along with the search for eternal life.
Before the Scottish arrival in the British Isles, the Iron Age people in the northern
part of the island were in contact with the European Celts, so can be considered to be related
to the Celts in Hungary. Later, the influx of Magyar related peoples continued in several
waves. One of the last such waves was during the time of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius
when – according to a military agreement – Sarmatian and Jász military which formed the
6th Roman legion, came to serve on the British Isles. When we follow their presence we
find many Hungarian related geographic names, but they all preceded the Sarmatian
arrival, since they were already firmly established in the geography of the British Isles.
Professor Littleton196 brings the Sarmatians into relationship with the Scythians and the
Alans. He believes that the King Arthur legend originated with the Sarmatians. He also
identifies Sir Lancelot with the Alans, who arrived here in the 5th century AD, who had a
personage with the same name and role. He also believes the following to be part of the
Sarmatian-Alanic cultural sphere: the sword of Arthur, his round table and his heroes and
196 C. Scott Littleton: Were the Sarmatians the source of Arthurian legend? Archaeology, January/February 1997

the legend of the Holy Grail, which all became embellished during the adoption of
Christianity with the legends of the new faith, which were never really supported by the
official church.
The Celtic and Scottish population of the British Isles were not unfamiliar with the
Hungarian place names, which they had known from ancient times on, from the Carpathian
Basin, and also from Egypt. The Hungarian-sounding place names are also supported by
local legends which show a close tie with the Hungarian legends.
The White Horse was a famous symbol of the ancient inhabitants of the British
Isles. We are informed by the huge representation of this white horse at Uffington and also
the medallions of Silchester. According to both, the ancient population, who created these
images, believed themselves to be the sons of the White Horse. Women, even today, visit
this image with the hope of increasing their fertility. The 374 ft. White Horse of Uffington
dates to the 5th-4th centuries BC. It is also believed to be the totem-animal of the Iceni
people who flourished in the 2nd-1st centuries BC. Many other horse figures can be found
on the British Isles, such as the representations of Cherhill, Pewsey and Alton Barns but
these all date from the 18th-20th centuries AD and show the tenacity by which ancient
symbols survive.
King Alfred (849-899) is also connected with such White Horse representations.
His name is explained as „Elf-rede”, where the first syllable places him into the ancient
times of the Fairy folk which inhabited the Isles. He was a courageous, cultured person and
his laws ended the bloodshed. The same region also honors a “Horse-goddess” by the name
of Epona, whose cult was also adopted by the Romans, who called her Regina. Epona’s
name is connected with the name of the Pannon-Magyar ethnic group’s name, their
mother-goddess, Panna, and also the words for sun and light (nap, fény).
Cerne is the devotional center of the God Helith, Helis or Heil. The rock drawing
of the Giant of Cerne shows him holding a huge club (kalló in Hungarian) and he also
shows other signs of his masculinity, which elevate him to a symbol of fertility. Here both
the name of the town Cerne and the God Helith are connected with the Hungarian kör, kel,
(circle, to rise) and also Kolos, Kallós names. These names are preserved in several city
names in the Carpathian Basin, like Kolozsvár in Transylvania. The name of the Roman
Hercules, who was always represented with a huge club was derived from this word group,
but they did not understand the connection to these names. The name of the Scythian
Kolaxis, whom the Greeks mentioned, and Gelonos, who was the son of Heracles, belong
here too.
The meaning of the County of Kent is “staff”, which is connected with the
Hungarian word Kan, meaning maleness. The inhabitants of northwestern Spain, who were
defeated by the Roman Emperor Augustus, are called the Cantabrians. Agricola, the
governor of Britannia (78-85 A.D.), settled the Belgian Tengri people here as
peacekeepers. These are shown on the early maps of Belgium as Civitas Tugrorum.
An ancient king or hero of Kent was Brethwald, whose name later became a title of
nobility. Aethelbert ruled Kent in 597 AD.; the King of Northumbria was Aetelfrith. These
names signify royal descent and belong in the Atilla-Etele line of history.



83
The first syllable of the names: Cantium or Cantawara, in Kent, is identical to the
Hungarian kanta, kancsó (pitcher), which gave rise to the Latin word cantharus and the
Greek Kantharos, which means a pitcher with long handles (kantáros in Hungarian); the
same name and object were also used by the Etruscans. The internal space of the pitcher
was considered a receiving, feminine symbol; the pouring of a liquid from the pitcher a
masculine, inseminating symbol in many cultures of the world. Pagan holy places or
churches were usually erected near a natural well to express the same symbolism, which
received a meager expression in the holder of holy water in Catholic churches. Adorján
Magyar showed in his drawings that the ancient pagan churches followed the form of a
female body, since their role and capacity to enclose is a female symbol. The Hungarian
word anyaszentegyház (holy mother church) brings old pagan times to mind. While the
word egyház was derived from the name Ég (God), the Egyház (church, lit.: the House of
the One) designates a spiritual community.
The Romans built their holy places in the occupied territories upon already existing
religious centers, and they did so in Kent or Cantawara too. Here they built a devotional
place for Apollo and this tells us that the ancient population dedicated this ancient place to
the Sun. Later, in the Christian era, in 597, they built an abbey to honor St. Augustine,
which later became the Archbishopric of Canterbury.
Returning to the name kancsó (pitcher), its folk-name is also “kincső”, which the
people also call the Big Dipper.197 This name turns our eyes toward the sky. The word kincs
also means treasure, light and richness. According to this, the ancient name of Cantawara
indicated that this castle was a place of light, life and treasures. The ending syllable “-wara”
of this name also indicates the presence of the ancient Avar, or Várkun Magyar ethnic
group.
The historian David McRoberts tells us about the rocky road of the Scots toward
developing a central government. After the withdrawal of the Roman legions in the early
fifth century, four kingdoms began to take shape in the territory of today’s Scotland:
Cumbria, between Glasgow and Carlisle, Bernicia between the Firth of Forth and Tyne,
the kingdom of the Picts and Argyllshire, which was also called Scotia, to which a few
western islands also belonged. These latter ones were inhabited by Scots from Ireland,
whom historians called by the name of Picts, meaning painted people. The rest of the
territory was Pictavia, with loosely defined borders.
The Scots, who claim to have Scythian origins, called their Argyll Kingdom
Dalriada in their own language. Prince Argyilus198 is a treasured part of Hungarian folklore
and became part of later literature too. Dalriada’s famous hero in the sixth century A.D.
was Colum, noted not only for his literacy, but also his voice which carried for miles, with
which he was able to assemble his troops from great distances. The consonants of Colum’s
name are similar to the consonants of the Hungarian kürt (horn). Considering that his field
of action was connected with the church of Saint Finnian and the name Finnian suggests
pre-Christian times, Colum must have been the descendant of an ancient personage, who

gave Dalriada its name with the meaning of Battle Song, a call to battle (dal = song, riadó
= alert). The later King of Dalriada was the Scottish Kenneth MacAlpine in 843 A.D. He
occupied the lands of the Picts and brought the Stone of Destiny to Scone in Alba
(Scotland)199.
The settlement of Ireland was accomplished in five waves. One such wave was
according to the Historia Brittonum – the arrival of the one thousand people of Partholon,
who were expelled from their country in the fourth century BC, and finally arrived in the
British Isles. Geoffrey of Monmouth places them in this historical era too, but, according
to him, they arrived from Spain to Orkney and settled later, with royal permission, in
Ireland. According to one theory, the present Irish are their descendants. They were
farmers, busying themselves with animal husbandry, beer-brewing and building projects,
and so they brought with them the tools of a peaceful life-style. Partholon’s descendants
were Nemed and Fir-Bolg, who in time developed small kingdoms. The name Partholon
and the story of the expulsion from their former home bring him into connection with the
Hungarian words part, pártos (border, dissenter) and the Parthian Empire and deserves
further research.
Nemed’s name reminds us of the name Nimrod, ancestor of the Hun-Magyar
people. J. B. Hannay, who did not speak the Hungarian language, translated the name
Nemed as “the begetting rod”, which is the exact translation of the name Nimrod too.
Arnold Ipolyi brings up a quote from Műglein from the Chronicon Rythmicum 6.: Nemprot
avus Hunorum / triginta cubitorum / me recolo legisse / in longum extitisse, which speaks
of the truly remarkable manly qualities of Nimrod, fit for a pater familias. Nimrod here is
the rod of procreative powers. The giant drawings of male figures on the British Isles echo
this concept; they are still visited by women hoping for children. The survival of giants
was the longest in Cornwall, from where “Gogmagog” originated. One of our great
Hungarian poets, Endre Ady begins one of his poems: “I am the son of Góg and Magóg...”,
bringing the land of the Magyars and Cornwall into close relationship.
Arnold Ipolyi also mentions the name Nemere, which is the name of a high
mountain, and also the north wind of the Székely (Sicul) land in Transylvania, which can
even kill people. The composition of the name Nemere again contains the procreative
powers. We know that the winds are not only the agents of destruction, but also of life by
pollinating flowers. One Székely folk song says the following: „Nemerének hideg szele, /
fú a kalászos rétre le / attól rózsám meg nem fázik, / sőt inkább megpirosodik.”200 (The
cold wind of Nemere blows onto the fruitful meadows; my sweetheart will not catch cold
from it, and what’s more her cheeks will get red...)
Scottish traditions preserved the most ancient Celtic names for us. The same
legends preserved the Fin legends and words, and the later incoming Scots probably
adopted many names, words and customs from the ancient inhabitants. The Scottish people
lived under patriarchal rule. Out of forty of the ancient Scottish names I collected, there are
only seven that don’t begin with the initial Mac, and this hints toward their Magyar

ancestry. The very important MacArthur family’s name in Hungarian means the seed of
Arthur, it can also be stated as Arthurfi. The „fi” particle means a man-child in both
Celtic and Hungarian.
It is also interesting to note that, from the forty ancient Scottish families twelve
lived in Argyll, which brings the story of the Hungarian Prince Argyélus to mind. It is also
important to note that the most ancient Scottish families’ burial place was Iona which is
the name of the indigenous Jász population of Transdanubia, which is also connected with
the concept of Jász and gyász (mourning).201 The Ionreach family’s home was in Kintail
County: both preserved the Jász and Kun connection on the British Isles as they live side
by side in the Jász-Kun region of Hungary. Presently the MacKenzie family states that it
originates from here and so this name serves as a bridge again toward the Ion and Kun
branch of the Magyar people.
The symbolic flower of these families was almost exclusively the fir tree or some
other evergreen plant, a sprig of which they traditionally wore on their hats. The evergreen
fir was the symbolic plant of the White Hun ethnic group. The color of Scottish attire and
their symbolic flowers belonged to a certain family and could not be used by anyone else
and they could not use their crest either. These colors and flowers were part of a pre-crest
antiquity, the Golden Age.
The MacArthur family was believed to be of royal descent. The English had the
head of this family executed; their holdings were taken away. The fate of Scottish nobility
from then on resembled that of the Hungarians during the rule of the Hapsburgs, who were
Emperors of Austria and Kings of Hungary. The popular saying in those days was the
following: “The Austrian Emperor forever wages war against the Hungarian King.”
Their family crest includes the isosceles sun cross, which is probably mankind’s
most frequently found and most ancient symbol, and three crowns. Their name carries the
name of the legendary Arthur. Many Hungarian legends include motifs of the Arthurian
legends. Among these are legends of the sword, and a holy cup, known in later centuries
in Western Europe as the grail. These legends again are connected with the Golden Age of
mankind. The name Arthur brings to mind the hero of the Arthurian legends and almost all
elements of the saga of God’s Sword (Isten Kardja). Among the heroes of the Round Table
we find his son Bors, whose name is part of the geography of the Carpathian Basin, such
as County Borsod (i.e. the place or seat of Bors). Archaeologist Ilona Sz. Czeglédi
considers this name to be of Slavic origin, in her article in the Journal of Archaeology202,
and does not take into consideration the many place-names that are based upon the word
Bors, nor does she consider the linguistic connections of this word. For example, there is a
Bors township in Bihar County, a Borsa town in Transylvania and Máramaros, some
smaller settlements called Borsád in Veszprém County and, with the help of a good map,
we could continue this list ad infinitum. I, myself, believe the origin of this word lies within
the B-R word-group, where it means a round, hard seed. It is related to the boróka (juniper),
which the Székely call borsika.203

A most thorough research was done by Miklós Szabó concerning the Celtic names
of the Carpathian Basin in the first and second centuries A.D. He based his research upon
the Greek language, because “it is characteristic that, even in the most ancient layer of the
Roman personal names, there is hardly any common Indo-European system.” He mentions
Cuchulainn as an ancient Irish name, where the first syllable “Cu” means dog, which is
kutya in Hungarian. The original Hungarian dog breeds carry the “ku or ko” syllable, like
kuvasz, komondor, which also hints at their wedge (ék) shaped heads. The reciprocal of the
Ku contains the symbolic word ék of the Huns. Szigeti says that the Setantii204 clan’s name
is also ancient Irish, which means “westerner”. In Hungarian, sötét means darkness and
there is a clear connection with the direction of the sunset, which is west. (cf. Setantii and
sötét)
At the excavation site of Potzneusiedl-Gattendorf, an inscription of the word
“mutsa” was found, which was translated by a researcher, Holder, who did not speak
Hungarian, as “mocsok”, meaning dirt.
Szigeti mentions, as a Celtic name, the Welsh family name of Euryn, “arany” in
Hungarian, which means gold. He also found several connections with the word “matu”,
like Matumarus, Matugenta, Maturus, Matto, Matta. All these names are connected to the
Hungarian words mét, megye, mező (land, county, meadow). Miklós Szabó brought these
into connection with the M-T word-group’s medve, which was a solar symbol. He does not
use the Celtic names which were supposedly mixed with the language of the Veneti205, but
I have to mention the words containing the il(l)o suffixes like Ab-ilus, Bas-ila, Diar-ilos,
Suad-illus, Mag-ilo, Cucc-illo since they are in connection with the Hungarian words élet,
lélek and illó (life, soul and volatile).206
During the Celts’ sojourn in the Carpathian Basin, they became closely connected
to the language and culture of the Magyars. When the opportunity for a new meeting
presented itself, during the time of the occupation of the Irish islands, they were even more
easily able to retain these memories, which can still be recognized in their different cultural
elements. A Hungarian historian, Dr. Tibor Baráth, originates the word Celtic from the
Magyar word keleti, meaning eastern.
The Celtic migration from the Carpathian Basin is connected with the Hallstatt (8th
6th c. BC) and La Tène (5th c. BC-1st c. AD) cultures. The famous settlement of the late
Hallstatt era is Heuneburg on the Danube. Its inhabitants possessed all the achievements of
a cultured and settled life and also maintained trade routes with the Mediterranean cultures.
Western scholars attribute their high life-style and architecture to the influence of the latter.
The grave of a Celtic princess, which was excavated at Mt. Lassois near the Seine is by no
means inferior to the pomp of the famous and well known Etruscan and Egyptian burial
places. Brian Fagan writes that the design of the gold jewelry “contains classical elements,
like the very complex palmetto design which was mixed with the indigenous Hallstatt and
nomadic elements.”207 He does not tell us that in that age, in the fifth century AD, the

87
indigenous Hallstatt and the classical culture were both in close connection with the
decorative elements of our ancient Magyar peoples. Neither does he mention that the
ancient culture of the Carpathian Basin arrived in Western Europe several thousand years
later.
Considering that, from the time of the ancient meditative movement, which took
hermits to the sulfur caves of Ireland and they became known as “the heroes who visit
Hell”, the connection between Ireland and Hungary was established. We believe, based on
certain evidence, that these connections began in the pre-Christian era. The first written
sources date from the 14th century and the Abbey of Melk. The Royal Library of Vienna
holds the writings of a Hungarian priest from Losonc concerning this age.208 The first
student at Oxford was also a Hungarian. His name at the time of registration was Nicola de
Hungaria, and his education was supported between 1193 and 1196 by Richard the
Lionhearted, the brother-in-law of Queen Margaret.209 It is no accident that the origin of
the Magna Carta and the Magyar Golden Bull are so close in time.
Taliesin was among the four great poets of Rheged.210 His name is translated as
“Radiant Brow." He preserved the memory of an ancient home among the summer stars.
The first syllable of his name (Tal) is connected with the Hungarian words for shine,
splendor (dél, deli), song (dal) and also the name of the Magyar Táltos priestly class, whose
members taught people through song. Arthur’s name belongs in the same word-group (T
R, T-L). The last syllable of Taliesin’s name (sin) has the same root as the Hungarian word
szem, szen meaning eye, seeds (which are eye-shaped, like the grains of wheat). The
Hungarian meaning of Taliesin’s name is Shiny Eye. His home “among the morning stars”
may also be connected with Arctouros (Arcturus) and the rotation of the sky. This celestial
drama is the original source of the Arthurian legends. As a matter of fact, the Shiny Eye
may carry the meaning of star too. The Hungarian tale of the Star-Eyed Shepherd preserved
this image for us. The image of “star-eyed” individuals was quite common and was part of
folk and representational arts.
The ancient memories were preserved by the poets of Rheged on the British Isles
and the regős in Hungary. Their voices were drowned out in blood. The great Hungarian
poet, János Arany, in his poem, The Bards of Wales mourned both.
Albactanus, King of Scotland, was killed by the Huns in a battle, 25 years after the
arrival of the Trojans, according to one tradition, around 1070 BC.211 Later they were
expelled from the southern parts of the Isles where – during flight — the leader of the Huns
by the name of Humber drowned in a river. Since then, this river has been called Humber.
The Huns were present in the British Isles before Christ, so much so that they even wrote
their names into the geography. In the patrilineal Hun society, the rivers were symbols of

masculinity to which the words ondó and ont, önt (semen, to pour) testify. Professor Ashe
believes that the Hun name stems from an error of later ages, since this Humber of 1070
BC precedes the Huns of Atilla by centuries. Therefore, he is unable to make use of the
ancient Hun vocabulary to which the Hungarian word hon and the English home belong,
along with the Hungarian him (male) and the words homo, human which are believed to be
of Indo-European origin but can be traced back to the ancient Hun vocabulary. The
Hungarian hamu (ashes) belongs here too. In ancient times this was the symbol of a settled
life, of people around a fire. The poetic expression of this can be found in the story of
Hammas Jutka, the Cinderella of the British culture and the story of the boy who turned
into a deer, whose figure was immortalized by Béla Bartók’s Cantata Profana.212 The very
important symbolism of this ballad was explained by Gábor Pap.
The river name, Habren, also has Hungarian linguistic connections, where hab
means water. This river is sometimes also called Sabrina in the Latin environment and
Severn in English. The first syllable of both is the Hungarian viz (water). According to
Professor Ashe, neither name can be explained from Indo-European languages. They lead
back to untold antiquity and he believes that these names represent the ancient guardian
spirits of the waters.213
Considering that most water names of the British Isles originate in a pre-British age
and many of them are identical to Hungarian river names still alive in Hungary, which can
be explained easily with the Hungarian language, we have to recognize the presence of
Magyars in these ancient times in the British Isles and its population. This Western
European line of Hungarian history was neglected by Hungarian historians and also
by the West, to favor the non-existing Asiatic origin of the Magyars. With this, western
scholarship was prevented from fully understanding the elements of the ancient Magyar
past.
Belinus, the son of Molmutin (4th century BC), the primary king of the dual
monarchy and his brother Brennius, the King of the North, bear names which are echoed
in the vocabulary of the Palóc-Magyar ethnic group and in the name Béla, the name of the
ancient Sun-god.
Athelney is the name of the marshland near Glastonbury. The word Athel here is
connected with water, following the lead of the Atil-Etel word-cluster, which means water,
river, and it is also connected with King Atilla’s name. “Ætheling”, (presently “atheling”),
a title of British nobility, is also interesting, since it signals a direct royal descent. The early
and ancient English masculine form is ætheling, the feminine version is æthelu. The long
time settlement of Árpád’s Magyars was Etelköz, which, in view of the above, gains the
added meaning of “royal island” ; the “köz” particle until now signaled the womb and
birthplace and also a land protected by rivers. Similar territory can be found between the
rivers Duna and Tisza and the Csallóköz. Since the British legends talk about the Huns
well before the time of Atilla, this title takes us back into antiquity and has preserved the
title of an ancient Hun office. According to this Atilla’s name Etele may have meant a
212 Pap Gábor Csak tiszta forrásból. Adalékok Bartók Cantata profanajának értelmezéséhez.

89
Royal Prince, deservedly so, as he was the son of Bendeguz. In the works of the historian
Anonymus, Atilla’s name appears as Athile (Anon. 1 and 5). The later spelling of “Atilla”
with two “t”-s conforms only to Germanic linguistic customs. His name, Athile, may also
have meant that he was part of the Royal Scythians. Early historians called the Scythians
Royal. The word “ætheling” changes in German to “Edel” which means noble. I must
mention that the symbolic colors of the White Huns were white and light blue. The flowers
of their former territories, now in Austria, the silver-white Edelweiss and the blue, tulip
like Alpine flower, the Gentian, were their symbolic flowers.
Later, the dream of Emese214 of a future dynasty, symbolized by a huge river, also
belongs into the Atil-Etil-Itil saga and word-group. Historian Arnold Ipolyi, summarizes
the traditions concerning Etele, stating that the name Atel, Etel is identical to the name of
the ancient Etelköz, just as another ancient pater familias, Tana, is identical to the Don
Tanais River. It reminds us of the elemental origin of the heroes and demigods of old,
which again surfaces in the life of Álmos, just as it was present in the old Scythian sagas
that tell that Targitaus, the ancestor of the Scythians, was the son of Zeus and the nymph
of the river Boristhenes (Herodotus 4,5).215
Thus Ipolyi traces the name Etele directly back to Scythian ancestral traditions,
from where – as I have demonstrated in my paper concerning the Arthurian legends – the
image of the Holy Grail, as a symbol of life, began. Antal Csengeri mentions 216 that the
Finnish word eteletär means the daughter of the South-wind. Here the last syllable, tär,
means a girl, the Etele here is the name of the South-wind and can be connected with the
Transylvanian Nemere: both contain the name of the Hun pater familias and mean a force
of nature. We have to recognize in these names the name of God, whom these peoples
revered, who is manifested through the world of nature, may it be a wind storm or a flood.
The descendants of these peoples adopted His name for their own children of this world.
Considering that today’s historians date the origins of British history to the arrival
in the West of the Trojan refugees or of the ten lost Israeli tribes, their modern history
begins with William the Conqueror in 1066. The Scythian origin sagas, on the other hand,
take us back to the dawn of history and I consider these sagas, and the names of rivers and
names of honor a part of the earlier Magyar traditions. We have to remind ourselves that,
214According to the Hungarian legend, Ugyek, the descendant of Atilla, took Emese as his wife. On their wedding night, Emese was visited by a great bird, the TURUL bird, a huge eagle, which descended upon her, covering her with his black wings. Half asleep, half awake, Emese had a dream. It seemed that a crystal spring had sprung from her loins and began to flow toward the West, growing bigger and bigger, into a swelling stream, flowing over snow-covered mountains, finally reaching a beautiful plain. There, the river stopped, and a magnificent tree sprang up from its waters. Every branch and leaf of that tree was of pure gold, as was the fruit which grew abundantly on the miraculous tree. Emese, in her dream, lay down under that tree, in the middle of the beautiful land, and fell asleep. When she awoke, she was back in her husband's tent. The memory of that dream stayed with her forever. Nine months later, a son was born to Emese, the first-born son of Ügyek. He was named ÁLMOS (Boy of Dream) and became the father of ÁRPÁD, who led the Magyars across plains and mountains, in 896, into that beautiful land, the Carpathian Basin, which once belonged to the Huns and which was, according to the minstrel's songs, their rightful inheritance.

while Hungary had a well-established central government and county system by 1,000 AD,
the same came about only eight-hundred years later in Germany and Italy, after the
unification of the small kingdoms.
Incidentally, in the time of Tiberius, during the tax revolt, the Romans encountered
fierce resistance in Sirmium around Mons Almus, which is now known as Fruskagora.217
Since Álmos was also mentioned as Almus in the Hungarian Gesta Hungarorum218, this
Magyar name existed at least one thousand years before the arrival of Árpád and the
Magyars in the Carpathian Basin. Returning to Tana’s name:
Tana, the ancient father of our (i.e. Hungarian) chronicles may well be the first
Scythian ruler with the name Tana... In the Hungarian language, tanya means a
settled mode of living, a permanent base and, as we have seen, it may mean a
“seat”’, settlement meaning the “descensus” of the earlier generation. 219
Here Ipolyi also mentions the historical names of Duna, Don and Dentumoger
which are part of the geography of the British Isles. The Hungarian names Dana, Damasek
are ancient names for God and tie the Mesopotamian Dumuzi’s name to our ancient
memories.220
Athelstan, the son of King Edward the Elder and grandson of King Alfred the Great
(Elf-rede) lived in Northumbria and ruled there between 925 and 940 AD. His name is
connected with the Etel, Atil word-group. One of the legends about King Alfred relates
that he took shelter with a poor family after a battle. The wife of the poor man, who did not
recognize the king, asked him to watch the cakes while she left to do something and he
accidentally burned the cakes in the fire. This story is a half-forgotten Hungarian legend,
when heroes embarking on a mission always take little cakes baked in ashes with them. It
is also connected with the word-group of hun, hon, hamu we discussed earlier.
The white horse is an integral part of the Welsh mythology, along with a deer hunt,
in which Annwfyn’s gleaming white dogs with red ears try to capture a stag. Both the stag
and the dog are symbolic animals of the Magyar peoples. The conical head of a dog is
present in an architectural motif of the roof-structure of an early Stone Age house at Röszke
— Lúdvár in Hungary.221 The stag — the Miracle Stag, Stag of Light — is central to
Hungarian mythology as the symbol of the sky and as God’s messenger. In the Annwfyn
legend the Lord of the Otherworld is Arawn, a name which echoes the Hungarian word
arany meaning gold in present usage, although its original meaning was shine.
The Cornish descent from the giant Gogmagog, who came forth from the Princess
Albina’s union with demons, and her subsequent giving birth to giants are also part of the
stories of Scythian-Magyar origin. Ipolyi believes the Hungarian legend of origins from

Góg and Magóg is an authentic pre-Christian Magyar tradition222. He refers to Anonymus,
who related an ancient tradition, which – although having become somewhat clouded in
the course of centuries – nevertheless had preserved knowledge of the Scythians and the
neighboring peoples.
The Tristan and Isolde stories originated in the Pictish legend of Drust. Isolde’s
name was variably Essylt, Iseult, Isolt, Yseut according to tradition. Tristan’s name belongs
to the same T-R word-group as Arthur’s. The Es-Is-Ys- syllable shows Jász (Iasy)
influence and a connection with waters. In this respect, the Tristan story is an almost
forgotten fragment of an ancient solar myth concerning fertility and creation. There is
mention of a Tristan stone in Cornwall near Castle Dore. A Latin inscription states the
following: “Drustanus lies here, the son of Cunomorus.” The latter name is spelled
Kynovawr. The syllable “cuno” brings the Hun, Kun group to mind and the Várkun name
of the Avars, meaning “the Kuns of the castle.”
Mr. Gwion Davies, the son of the founder of the Welsh National Library researched
the Scythian origins of the Welsh people. He spoke in his letters about linguistic similarities
between the Welsh and Hungarian languages and also the possible relationship of the
carving of numbers of the Magyar rovás and the Welsh system of carved numbers.
Regrettably, our correspondence had to stop, due to his age and illness. I sent him my
rendering of the poem by János Arany, the great Hungarian poet, entitled “The Bards of
Wales”. He wrote the following in his answer: “I was surprised to learn of the lament by
János Arany over the loss of the Welsh Bards, and of the kinship felt between the
Hungarians and the Welsh...”
*
The life of the Scottish Queen Margaret223 seems to be the summation of the Celtic
Scottish-Hungarian relationships. She was born of the Saxon Aetheling family, as the
daughter of Edward, who was expected to become King. He and his family were exiled
and they lived in the town of Nádasd in Hungary, as the royal guests of King István I.
Margaret was born in Hungary, around 1045 A.D. and was educated there until the age of
twelve. During these formative years, she acquired literacy, the love of arts and especially
embroidery.
They returned to England, in the company of Hungarian nobles, upon the invitation
of King Edward the Confessor. Unfortunately, Margaret’s father died in England
unexpectedly, so the family decided to return home to Hungary. A storm forced their ships
to land on the shores of Scotland – and the rest is history. Margaret married the Scottish
King Malcolm III, introduced literacy to the court and became a supporter of arts and
sciences. Moreover, she cared for the less fortunate and served their meals herself along
with her husband, the King. As the treasury became more and more depleted due to her
charity work, the Scottish nobility competed with each other to see who could donate more
to charity. Reading this, I was reminded of the Hungarian St. Elizabeth, who married the
222 Arnold Ipolyi Magyar mythologia vol.I:203-204 223 http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/STMARG.HTM



92
Duke of Thuringia, practicing love and charity to the dismay of the Thuringians, who
accused her of depleting their treasury. The care for the less fortunate is a long standing
Hungarian tradition, which was practiced by these holy women outside of their homeland
too.
The chronicler of Margaret’s life was a priest by the name of Turgot from Durham,
who eventually became the Bishop of St. Andrews. According to him, Margaret was related
to the House of Árpád and the Teutonic royal house, and Gizella, wife of St. King István
I. of Hungary was her aunt.
She had eight children whom she raised strictly. This upbringing gave seven very
strong kings to Scotland. The Church made her a saint on September16, 1249.224
*
The following is not directly connected with Scotland, but with the English
Hungarian connections. The mother of their beloved Queen Anne was a Hungarian from
Transylvania, the countess Rhédey.
As we can see the Hungarian connection with the British Isles was a continuum
from the dawn of history to ancient monastic times, through St. Margaret, Queen of Scots,
the first student at Oxford, Nicola de Hungaria, to Queen Anne, to mention only the most
outstanding events and personalities.
*
As a conclusion I have to mention that the history of both the Scots and the
Hungarians was written and propagated by their oppressors and enemies. The chronicler
of St. Margaret’s life, for example, talks about the Hungarians of King St. István’s time as
uncouth, wild, oriental people and does not realize the contradiction: St. Margaret learned
literacy and the arts from these barbarians. The same is true in the case of the Scottish
historical picture. Present historians, like David McRoberts, almost apologize for these
images, sensing that this must be an inaccurate representation of these people.
It is the same spirit which tries to preserve the heritage of the ancestors in both
Scotland and Hungary. I wonder if these ancestral traditions have gained a place in public
education in Scotland. The other Celtic-Scythian nation, the Welsh, finally gained
permission within recent memory to erect a national library. There are no universities for
Hungarian Studies in Hungary even though the Hungarian Academy of Sciences was
founded with such a purpose by Count István Széchenyi.
The Trianon dictate of 1920 severed the body of Hungary and she lost two thirds
of her territory and population. The most Hungarian region, Transylvania, fights for its
existence amidst cultural and ethnic genocide as we speak.
The only independent university in Hungary, founded by Dr. Agnes Gyárfás, the
Nagy Lajos Király University, was deprived of its school-buildings, even though this is the

last citadel of Hungarian Studies and Hungarian scholarship. It is presently existing through
donations from Hungarians around the world.
To preserve the past, it would be very important to establish a sister-institute with
a similar University in Scotland, since this could resurrect the ancient Scythian ties. I
have written this short study, hoping to awaken interest in this subject.
In the following Appendix, I present names in the British Isles related to
Hungarian names.

Excerpt from Appendix
Hungarian Connections to the Geographical Names
of the British Isles.
The following geographical names form only a Baedeker-like list. Even so, they contain
enough similarities with Hungarian mythology and language to warrant further research
into this subject.
Aesica is the name of a stronghold and contains the Hungarian word ős (ancestor).
Aran is a mountain. The Hungarian river, mountain and county name, Aranyos, is
identical to it and it is connected to the word arany (shine in ancient times, now gold).
Armagh is a stronghold, built in the fifth century. According to legend, it was built by
queen Macha. Her ancestor, the fairy, Macha, bore twin boys from her marriage to a
mortal. The Magyar, or Makar origin legends are based upon the twin sons of Magor, the
Sun god. The names and the twins point to a common origin of this legend. According to
this legend the Irish society had its origins in the fairy-folk, just as did the Magyar.
Avebury is famous for its stone circles. The island’s first agriculture was practiced near
the Windmill Hill (Szélmalom domb). Silbury’s hill was 50 ft. high. It is affiliated with
the many Szil place names we discussed in connection with the Sarmatian-Magyar
presence in the Carpathian Basin. The word szil belongs in the same word-group as szél
(wind). For this reason, I believe the name Windmill Hill is a later translation of the
szélmalom domb at Silbury or Szélvár (Castle of the Wind).
Ure valley is near the Yorkshire Dells. The first word seems to be connected to the
Hungarian word Ur, meaning Lord. (We find a similar meaning in the words Altai Ural
and, which translate into “the lowlands call the mountains Lord” or the mountain rules
the lowlands.)
Derivatives of the Hungarian word - Bál:
Bala is a lake near the base of the Aran and Berwyn mountains, in north-west Wales. In
Hungary, Lake Balaton bears the same name. Both are derived from the Palóc names of
Bál or Béla, the name of their Sun god.



94
Bala is a town at the base of the Aran and Berwyn mountains, at the southern end of
Lake Bala.
Ballabeg, the 1000 ft. high Round Table (Kerek Asztal) is a backdrop to ancient
mythology. I connect the first syllable of this name with the name of the Sun god, Bál or
Béla.
Bally Namallard and Bellanaleck are locations of lakes. The name Bel and leck (luk, lok)
words are identical in form and meaning. Kesh, Lough Erne, Lisnakee are in this region
also. Kesh is related to the Hungarian kis (little) and the name of the city of Kassa.
Balmoral is a castle. The highest elevation of the region is the 3786 ft. high Locknagar
Mountain.
Belfast is the capital of Ireland.
Belas Knap is a 1000 ft. high, Neolithic stone hill with an ancient chambered burial
place.
Banna, or Magna lies north of castle Thirlwall, and completely encircles Hadrian’s
Wall. The Hungarian words tér-túr carry the same meaning; the Hungarian fal and the
English wall belong in the same category. We may translate the meaning of this word as
circular wall, or térfal (archaic use), körfal in Hungarian. Banna itself bears relationship
to the Pannonian culture sphere.
Caerleon is a city. Its first syllable is identical with the Hungarian kör (circle).
Camlough Mountain’s name is related to the Hungarian kan, kam (male, a protruding
part), the lok and kamlik (chimney).
Cornwall’s name and the symbolism of the region bring this name in connection with the
Hungarian kör (circle) with the meaning of Körfal (circular wall).
Deva is a city. The name is identical to the Hungarian city of Déva.
Hale’s name is connected with the words hely (place) and kör (circle).
Hunstanton is situated on England’s south-eastern shores. Its name contains the hun and
„ton” tanya, names. The former is the known name Hun, the latter means a holy place, a
residence, a settled habitat. The second syllable (stan) may be also a form of stone (ME,
OE stan).
Kennet district’s hills are the conical hills of Avebury, and Silbury. A place named Long
Barrow near Western Kennet is a 350x8 ft. burial place with 30 graves from the early
Stone Age. It is England’s largest burial place with chambered graves. Malmsbury is
nearby, once a residence of King Athelstan. The material of this excavation site is
important from a Hungarian point of view.
St. Machar’s church in Aberdeen was built in the sixth century A.D., but its base is an
ancient place of worship. The name Machar is without doubt connected with the name of
Magyar, or Makar, the Sun god.
The Valley of Manger is here and in it the Dragon Hill; now it is believed to be
connected with St. George, but this name leads us into greater antiquity and contains the
name of the God Mén. Manger’s name means Ménkör, the Circle of Mén and it is
identical in concept with Menhirs. The nearby Wayland Smithy’s vaulted graves are from
2500-2000 B.C.



95
Mousa’s castle was built without any mortar; its walls are five ft. wide. I don’t have the
time-frame within which it was built. The name is similar to the name of the Hungarian
county and city of Moson.
Oban is in the Grampians and contains the Magyar Pannon peoples’ name and its title of
nobility. The O particle means ancient in the Hungarian language.
Omagh Tyrone is a town near Lough Erne, Northern Ireland. Tyrone’s name is part of
the T-R word-group of the Arthurian legends. The name of Omagh means Ancient Mag
(seed) in Hungarian.
Orme Head in Wales contains the Hungarian word orom meaning the peak of a
mountain.
Rufus’ stone commemorates King William’s death during a hunting mishap in 1100; his
death was caused by an arrow. In the early centuries of Roman Catholicism such hunting
mishaps were frequent in Hungary too, in which the boar seems always to have a key
role.
Rivers:
Bann is a river near Londonderry, and the Giant’s Causeway. The several town names
within this B, P-N word-group all contain the name of our Pannonian indigenous
population, the Pannon.
Don is a river, and its affiliation with the Don-Duna-nedű (liquid) words were discussed
above.
Lagan, Leven, Lledr and, Lune are rivers and the names are connected with the
Hungarian word for liquid (lé).
Leach River’s name has not been explained as yet; it is supposed that it may mean
something wet, a wet place. Hungarian lék (leak) and the above lé is related to this.
Mersey is a frequent Hungarian last name.
Nadder and Bourne Rivers empty into the Avon and Stonehenge is nearby. At a place
called Old Sarum the remnants of prehistoric structures can be found. Nadder’s name is
related to the Hungarian nedű (liquid) the word Bourne belongs to the Avar cultic B-R
vocabulary, where the word bor reflects the name of God Bar-ata and mother goddess
Bar-anya; the latter is still the name of a county. The word Boristhenes was the name of
a river of Scythia. The word vár (castle) is also part of this word-cluster. Sarum’s
Hungarian variant is sár meaning shine and was discussed in relation to the Sarmatians.
All these names are logical parts of Stonehenge’s astronomical role.
Neb is a river with Ballbeg, the Round Table, Glen Maye, Mull, or Meayll Circle at
Cregneish on its banks, with an ancient burial place with six chambers. The word Neb is
similar to the Hungarian nap (sun) which is again a natural consequence of the fact that
ancient astronomical places are nearby.
Nevern is a river. On its banks, near Stonehenge, there is a richly engraved 12.5 ft. Celtic
cross. For this reason, it may be connected with the Hungarian word nap since the cross
has been an ancient sun-symbol since the most ancient of times.
Ugie is a river in the Grampian region. It can be connected with the Hungarian
geographic locations beginning with the syllable Ug, like the name of County Ugocsa. It



96
is also connected with the word Ük meaning ancestor, ancestral. The Hungarian river
Bug is a B-variation of these; it is also a word of a humming sound, longing and
procreation.
Nith is the river of the southern part of the uplands. It is reminiscent of the Hungarian
nyit (to open), Nyitra County and river.
Ogwen River and Lake are near Lake Bala in Snowdon. Its Welsh name is Evyri. Its first
syllable, Og is the same as the Hungarian óg meaning the highest point of a dome where
light comes in.
Ore is a river on the south-western shore, and the island of Thanet is here. Ore’s name is
related to the Hungarian word őr (guardian), which fulfills any river’s defensive position.
Thanet’s name contains the Magyar God’s and ancestor’s name Tana, its reciprocal is
also connected with the concept of water (nedű).
Ouse flows in middle England and another Ouse in Sussex. Úz is a Hungarian historical
name; ős means ancestor.
Roe flows near Londonderry. This monosyllabic word contains the Hungarian word ró,
which means to carve out something, like the river carves its own path. Mythology of the
region may give further clues.
Sark is called by the local inhabitants, who don’t speak the Hungarian language, the
jewel of the Channel Islands. Here we have to deal again with its ancient meaning, which
is related to the Hungarian words ék (wedge, jewel), sarok (corner), and sár (shine).
Seiout is a river in Wales and this name is related to the Hungarian saj, sajó (to flow).
Sid (pronounced sí) means sliding (sí, siklás) in Hungarian.
Soar means száll (to fly) in Hungarian. Linguistically the two words have the same root.
The name of the rivulet Szele in Hungary bears a similar form and meaning.
Stour Rivers are in Essex and Kent. It is a known fact that the names of Kent’s rivers
belong into the oldest linguistic strata of the region. I believe it is an S variation of the T
R word-group. The Hungarian river name Túr, a subsidiary of the river Tisza is part of
this word-group.
Taf in S. Wales, another Taff River, also in Wales, is connected with the Rivers Severn
and Rhymney. The Hungarian geographical names Tab, Fót, Fadd, Fátra belong in the
same category.
Tavy and Tawe rivers are identical with the Hungarian word tavi (from the lake).
Tay flows through central Scotland into the sea. The Hungarian té and lé (liquid) words
belong in this word-group.
Tees is a river in Northern England which empties into the North Sea. Its meaning may
be connected with the above. Its present day pronunciation seems to be connected with
the Hungarian tíz words (ten) and tűz (fire).
Teme, Thames, Temes, are identical to the Hungarian river name Temes in Erdély
(Transylvania) and all are related to the word nedű (liquid), as its reciprocal form.
Ure and Yore rivers flow in the county of Yorkshire and are related to the Hungarian Úr
(Lord) and Jár (to walk) and are part of the Jász cultic vocabulary.
Thourne, Tand, Trent river-names are part of the T-R word group. The Hungarian túr
means to dig and we already mentioned the river Túr on the great plains of Hungary.



97
Tyne flows in the region of Lothian and Northumberland. Again the Hungarian té and lé
(liquid) words come to mind. The name Humber was discussed earlier.
Usk — Caerwent, Caerleon localities are situated on the banks of this river in S. Wales.
The syllable caer is part of the Hungarian K-R word-group where the words circle and
city, any circular structure (kör) belong. Its Latin name is Isca Silurum and it was the
second legion’s territory. Usk is related to the Hungarian ős, úz (ancient and also the
name of a people; presently it is a last name). Isca in Hungarian vocabulary means
ancient stone (ka); the Sil syllable is identical to the city of Szil (pron. Sil) in Hungary; its
history highlighted by Sarmatian presence.
Whitham’s first syllable means white, the second syllable is identical with the Hungarian
ham, hon, hun (ashes, home, and the Hun) names. Its meaning is White home, White
Hun. (Fehérhon Fehérhún); the first meaning is also connected to the English hamlet
which means an enclosed settlement.
Yare River gave its name to the city of Yarmouth in south-eastern England. Its name is
connected with the Hungarian word jár (to walk) and it is a part of the Jász (Ion, Iasy)
cultic vocabulary.
Yeo is a river in south-eastern England and its name is identical to the Hungarian word jó
(good) which is also a part of the Jász cultic vocabulary and a vast word-group.
Yore is a river in north-eastern England in Yorkshire. Its name is as above in the case of
Yare river. Dale is a flatland next to the river and is part of the T-R/L word-group and the
Hungarian word tál (plate) Considering that because of its flatness it is also unshaded,
sunny, this word may also be connected with the Hungarian word dél (shiny).
Islands and other natural formations.
Barra is the largest island of the Hebrides; Kisimul castle is located here. One of its hills
is called Ben Heaval. The word ben means mountain, the bán in Hungarian is a lofty
social standing. Its reciprocal is nap, fény (sun, shine). Hungarian ancestors always
originated their own name and every important, life-giving substance on which their life
depended, from the name of the sun. The word bán originally meant man, son or a
reflection of the sun in the Pannon vocabulary, as its reciprocal form indicates.
Colonsay and Oronsay islands grow rare orchids. The first syllable of these names is
connected with the Hungarian words kör (circle) and őr (guardian), orom (elevated
location, mountain peak), the second syllable with saj (river, water). In case of an island,
the water is truly encircling the earth.
Gogmagog Hills’ name contains our origin legends and these names contain the memory
of its ancient inhabitants.
Iona Island bears the name of the Jász, Ion group. It is a burial place. Its connection with
the Jász has been discussed earlier. The word gyász (mourning) is part of the Jász cultic
vocabulary.
Islay and Jura islands have the most ancient Celtic crosses. The word Jura is a
Hungarian geographical name.



98
Kew is an island in the Thames. It is noted for its botanical garden. Considering that it is
an island in a river the kő (stone) affiliation is acceptable.
Magee Island is the birthplace of many legends and cradles many caves and megalithic
tombs. It carries Magor the Sun god’s name. The discussion of these legends would fill a
separate volume.
Man: this island has been inhabited since Mesolithic times. Its round wood-huts are
known. The Romans were never able to occupy it. Its language is called Manx and is
almost extinct, only a few names have remained. The world’s oldest known parliament is
here. The Manx cat (which has no tail) originates from here. Their fences are formed by
living fuchsia hedges. It is a pre-Celtic habitation. The name of the island and the name
of the language contain the name of the god Mén, of its pre-Celtic inhabitants. The round
huts are peculiar to the ancient Hungarian “sun-houses”.
Pen Caer is an island, which is rich in prehistoric burial sites; the graves are chambered
graves. The Pen syllable preceding place names is frequent in this region, which points to
the Pannon cultic vocabulary and the name of shine and sun (fény, nap). Considering the
meaning of the Celtic crosses this name (nap kör = sun circle) is logical. (Pen in Welsh
means head.)
Porth Oer is famous for its whistling sands. The name is related to the Hungarian words
part and őr (port and sentry, guardian). Further we find Porth Isgadan, Iche and Golmon.
The name Iche is identical to the name of the Ika township and castle in Erdély
(Transylvania).
Scilly’s islands are in Cornwall (150-200 islands) and all hold prehistoric graves. The
famous Cornish tin-mines may have been here at one time. This name through the name
of the Siculs of Hungary, and later through the name of Sicily is connected to the
Hungarian szik word meaning sprout, salt and the Szikul-Székely nation name.
Skye, south of it, the following islands can be found: Eigg, Muck, Rhum and Canna. All
these have Hungarian counterparts, such as Szik (as above), Ég (heaven), mag and makk
(seed and acorn) and kan (male). Rhum contains the M-R word element of Mármaros.
Sheathland, or Zetland is an island (Shetland Islands). The Ronas hill is its landmark,
from which a midsummer night can be beautifully observed. The town of Sumburgh’s
name seems connected with the Hungarian szem (eye, seed), szemlél (to observe) and vár
(castle) words. People who observed the midsummer night from here gave this place the
logical name of Sumburgh. This name’s Hungarian meaning is “Observation Castle”.
Thanet is an island amidst marshes. It is connected with the Hungarian name Tana and
the words for settlement and water (tanya, nedű).
A town’s name in Anglesey:
Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwll-llantysiliogogogoch.
I leave its historical identification to the future.

Our Letter of Ownership to the Carpathian Basin is the Runic Script225
I. The meaning and importance of the Magyar (Hungarian) runic script
The runic script (‘rovás’ writing, lit.: carved writing) is the ancient script of the
Magyars. Its exceptional significance lies in the fact that it verifies the ancient Hungarian
presence in the Carpathian Basin of at least eight to nine-thousand years, and the Magyar
Scythian-Hun-Avar continuity. Hungarian chroniclers and scientists, like Simon Kézai, Márk Kálti, János
Thúróczy, Antal Verancsics, István Szamosközi, János Thelegdi, János Kájoni, Mátyás Bél,
among many others, call this script Scythian-Hun writing. The expression rovásírás was
coined by the leading sculptor János Fadrusz at the beginning of the 20th century. It is
more accurate to use the term Scythian writing, even though, according to some relics, this
writing already existed 20 thousand years ago in the Paleolithic Age. We do not know by
what name the Hungarian ancestors, who carved these letters onto wooden sticks and lived
at that time in the Carpathian Basin, called themselves.
The ancestors of the Hungarians used this writing in the entire Carpathian Basin
and helped its spread to distant lands. The written words that remained among the common
people indicate that there was no illiteracy from the most ancient times on. Everyone, from
the simple shepherd boy to the king, knew how to write.
II. The place of the Magyar runic script in the universal history of writing
The writing systems of the world are organized into the following categories: hiero
glyphs, ideograms, and syllabic and phonetic writing, in which every sound (phoneme) is
marked by a separate letter (grapheme).
The internationally accepted theory, which holds that the first phonetic writing was
created by the ancient Semites of the Sinai some 3,500 years ago, can be disputed on two
grounds. One reason for opposing this view is that, in the Sinaitic writing, the vowels were
not marked, so it cannot be considered to be a phonetic writing that follows the sounds.
The consonants, which are lined up side by side – in absence of vowels – can be interpreted
in several ways. For example, the „g.m.l.” can mean both a camel and the rope of a ship,
truly different meanings.
In the ancient Magyar runic script, the vowels – A (Á), E (É), I, O, Ö, U, Ü – all
had a separate letter. The Hungarian language owes its beauty partly to the fact that it
avoids the clustering of consonants.

104
The second argument that the Sinaitic writing could not have been the first phonetic
writing comes from the fact that neither the scholars who hold this view nor the Hungarian writing experts were sufficiently familiar with the ancient Magyar system of writing. I. G.
Gelb, of Polish ancestry, was a professor at the University of Chicago and was considered
to be one of the greatest international experts in writing. He stated that the Magyar runic
alphabet consists of 12 (!) characters, even though a copy of the Gyergyószárhegy stick
calendar of the 12th century had already been known for decades, and also the 32 runic
characters of the Nicholsburg alphabet, which originated from before 1483 (the former is
owned by the Library of Bologna, the latter by the National Széchényi Library in
Budapest). Even the knowledge of the Hungarian experts is scant or inaccurate. Béla Kéki’s
book Az írás története (The history of writing) shows the alphabet of the afore-mentioned
stick-calendar with many mistakes and the direction of the Konstantinápolyi Felirat226
(Constantinople Writing) from 1515 is incorrectly portrayed in his book.
In the Magyar runic script, every sound of the Hungarian language has a letter and,
therefore, we can state that this writing developed along with the language. It was not
borrowed or adopted from someone else. When we were forced to change over to the Latin
letters in the 11th and 12th centuries, there were no letters for 13 of the sounds of the
Hungarian language (TY, GY, NY, LY, SZ, ZS, CS, K, J, Á, É, Ö, Ü). With this writing
system (i.e. Latin), which was completely inadequate for the Hungarian language, the
development of literacy was impeded for centuries and Hungarians were forced to adopt
the low level of literacy of contemporary Europe. For example, the word „gyümölcs” (fruit)
with Latin letters could be written only as „gimilc” in the absence of adequate letters, and in the Vizsoly Bible, they wrote the word „új” (new), as „WY” as late as in 1590.
Taking into consideration Hungarian language relics from the Paleolithic, the Tatárlaka227 discovery, and archaeologist Zsófia Torma’s (1840-1899) discovery of several
thousand written tablets from the banks of the Maros River in Transylvania,228 we can
justly suppose that the oldest writing on our globe developed in the Carpathian Basin. The
fact that the signs on the Tatárlaka disk are 1,000-1,500 years older than similar
Mesopotamian hieroglyphic signs reinforces the hypothesis that the cradle of writing was
the Carpathian Basin. The Hungarian people, whose ancestors created these letters, still
live there.
The Magyar runic script – considering its age – could not have adopted signs from
others, but the ancestors of Hungarians were the disseminators of writing, in many
instances. Therefore, we may recognize ancient Magyar letters, with more or less different
sound values, for example, in ancient Chinese, in the Pelasgian, Etruscan, ancient Greek,
Phoenician and Iberian languages, in the Latin capital characters and in the Türk and German runes. Ferenc Kállay wrote in his book A pogány magyarok vallása (The religion
of the pagan Magyars, 1861), that the Pelasgians imported 16 Scythian letters to Greece.
226 Vince publ. 2000 227 Tatárlaka is now Tartaria in Romania. (Editor) 228 Transylvania was part of Historic Hungary and was annexed to Romania by the Treaty of Trianon in 1920. The Wallachians received the name „Rumanian” at the Berlin Conference in 1878 on the suggestion of Count Gyula Andrássy. The name they received was „Rumanian” and not „Romanian” as they write it today. The name „Romanian” is misleading because it gives the impression that they have some connection with Rome. (Editor)



105
Based upon the testimony of the remaining runic texts, we may safely state that the
ancient Magyar runic script was the first alphabetical writing on Earth, formed in the
Carpathian Basin, and, being the source, it greatly influenced the later developing writing
systems of other peoples.
III. Some significant remains of the Magyar runic script and important milestones
The oldest writing discovered in the Carpathian Basin comes from the Jankovich
Cave of Bajót, from a 15-20,000-year-old layer. On both sides of the broken off stick,
runic-signs are lined up, among which we can also see a probable SK ligature.
Picture 1
Stick fragments from the Jankovich Cave
In 1961, in a cremation grave in Tatárlaka, archaeologists found a burnt clay disk,
measuring six inches in diameter, on which the runic signs for the letters Z, Ny and Gy can
be seen. Its age is approximately 8,000 years.
Picture 2
Tatárlaka Disk



106
Zsófia Torma, the world’s first female archaeologist, excavated 4-6,000-year-old clay disks
from the banks of the Maros River, on which writing is found. On several of her finds,
displayed in the Museum of History in Kolozsvár229, ligatures are visible.
The picture of a three-thousand-year-old bronze hatchet-case, which was found on the meadow of Campagna, near Rome, was drawn by archaeologist, John Lubbock, the
later Lord Avebury, in his book Prehistoric Times, in 1865. He came to the conclusion that
it was made in the Carpathian Basin and it is of Scythian origin. A sentence written in ligatures reads: “Segít is, üt is, ró is” (‘It helps, it hits and writes too’). It was deciphered
by Judge Miklós Debreczenyi in 1914.
Picture 3
Bronze hatchet case
On 14 of the 23 gold vessels of the Nagyszentmiklós230 Treasure, there are runic
writings. Researchers place these into the Avar age. In this writer’s opinion, this treasure
belonged to Roga, King of the Huns (390-434) and his family.
On the Szarvas needle holder of the 7th century Avar period, there are
approximately sixty runic signs. Its extraordinary importance lies in the fact that it was
found in the grave of a female of the common people and so it testifies to the literacy of
the Hungarians (Avars) in an age when not even Charlemagne, Emperor of the Franks
could read and write.
The inscription on a blow-pipe from a 9th-century foundry at Bodrog-Alsóbű, from
the time when the Magyar group of Árpád entered the Carpathian Basin, testifies to the
literacy of the common people and, at the same time, indicates the high technical level of
the foundries which superseded those of Europe.
229 Currently called Cluj in Romanian. 230 Nagyszentmiklós is now called Sinnicolau Mare in Romanian. The treasure is presently housed in Vienna.



107
L.F. Marsigli, an Italian military engineer, copied a stick calendar with runic
writing, in 1690, in the Franciscan Abbey of Gyergyószárhegy. The last word of this 200 letter inscription is Áldás (‘blessing’) which is the greeting of the Táltos.231
The Nicholsburg Alphabet was written before 1483 and it can be seen at a large
exhibition at the National Széchényi Library.
Picture 4
The Nicholsburg Alphabet
The inscription from the Csíkszentmiklós232 Church (according to other sources the
Csíkszentmárton233 Church), built in 1501, is another proof of the literacy of the common
people and it contains the names of the builders of the church. We have only copies of it.
231 The Táltos were a high priestly class. Nobody can simply become a Táltos; they are chosen by God, and fulfill their calling by His grace. 232 Csíkszentmiklós is now Nicolesti in Romanian. 233 Csíkszentmárton is now Sínmartin in Romanian.

The few afore-mentioned examples of the Magyar runic script have helped us
familiarize ourselves – without the claim of completeness – with those who preserved the
most important part of the ancient Hungarian culture, the writing. This includes the
following: István Szamosközi (1570-1612), historian of István Bocskai, recorded his visit to
the Library of the Count of Florence, where he saw a printed (!) book with Scythian letters.
We also have his notes written in runic script. In 1598, János Thelegdi (1574-1647), later Roman Catholic prelate, assembled a
sixteen page-long schoolbook about the rules of the ancient script. He uses the Pater Noster
and the Credo as text-exercises. Regrettably, we have it only in faulty copies. Thelegdi was also the writer of the book Rudimenta, Priscae hunnorum linguae... (The rudimentary
elements of the old language of the Huns). His goal was to spread again the knowledge of
the runic writing. János Kájoni (1629-1687), Franciscan friar, who was a collector of folk songs, an
organ builder and the developer of a printing press was active in preserving runic alphabets. György Muzsnai, Unitarian minister, prepared the inscription of the Énlaka234
church in 1686. Lutheran bishop Mátyás Bél (1684-1749) had a significant collection of runic texts.
234 Énlaka is now Inlaceni in Romanian.



109
Péter Bod (1712-1769) a pastor of the Protestant Church, was a writer, who also prepared
a dictionary. A runic inscription and a list of letters have remained from his work.
Károly Antal Fischer (1842-1926) is the author of the book A hun-magyar írás és annak
fennmaradt emlékei (The Hun-Magyar writing and its remaining texts).
János Fadrusz (1859-1903) was one of the greatest Hungarian sculptors and the creator of
the Tuhutum statue in Zilah235 which displays runic writing. Gyula Sebestyén (1864-1943) was an ethnographer, who has written extensively about the
runic script. He erected a memorial stone with runic writing in front of his villa at Lake
Balaton. Adorján Magyar (1887-1978) was a linguist, ethnographer, historian, artist and author of
several articles concerning the runic script.236 Anna Walter Fehér (1915 - 1992) was a historian of writing and publisher of a related
periodical; she has written a two-volume book which describes the runic writing, titled Az
ékírástól a rovásírásig (From the cuneiform to the runic script).
Sándor Forrai (1913-2007) professor and Protestant presbyter, was the author of several
books concerning the ancient Magyar runic script, and the organizer of several exhibitions
which travel around Hungary.
IV. Destroyed Magyar runic texts
As we have already seen, the Magyar runic script contained a sign for every sound
of the Hungarian language, so that it could be perfectly written down. In 1985, Sándor Forrai wrote the following: “The writing of the Hungarian language with Latin letters was
possible only with great distortion or not at all. The reader will always be a witness to the
battle which our language fought against the intruding foreign letters.”
Then why don’t the Hungarians use their ancient writing as the Chinese, Japanese,
Greeks, Arabs and Hebrews do? The answer can be found in the first sentences of this
study: because it proves the ancient origin of the Hungarians in the Carpathian Basin and
it is their letter of ownership to this region. It is for this reason that the cultural genocide
began forcefully in the 10th and 11th centuries and has since continued. The Codices with
runic writing and the carved runic sticks were burned; the Táltos were killed or
incarcerated. Beginning with King St. István, all the kings – with the exception of King
Mátyás in the 15th century – accepted the orders of the Roman Pope to destroy the so
called pagan culture.
András I, son of Vazul (also known as Vászoly),237 issued an edict in 1047, which, under penalty of loss of wealth and head, forbade the use of the „ancient Scythian national
religion” and the pagan writing. Béla, the younger brother of András I, eradicated the old
Székely (Sicul) Hungarian names expressing rank. He had the old names of families,
castles and towns changed to the names of saints and had the ancient family libraries burnt.
235 Zilah is now Zalau in Romanian. 236 His booklet published in Switzerland titled Ancient Magyar Rovás Writing can be seen at www.tomoryzsuza.weebly.com . and at www.magtudin.org 237 Vazul was killed in a most cruel manner by unknown persons, probably faithful to the court; hot lead was poured into his ears.



110
Mátyás Jenő Fehér writes in his book Középkori magyar inkvizíció (The inquisition of the
Magyars in the Middle Ages) that there were Magyar documents and books well before the
Halotti Beszéd (Funeral Sermon) and the Mária Siralom (The lament of Mary)238.
Unknown hands removed the book, printed in Scythian letters, which István
Szamosközi saw in 1592, from the library of the Duke of Florence. His report is verified by Antonius Maginus, an Italian geographer, who described this book in 1595.
We know from Anna Walter Fehér that the correspondence in runic writing of
Prince Ferenc Rákóczi II (who lived in exile in Rodosto, Turkey) with the Spanish Court,
where it was filed, was later made to disappear.
The notes of the friar and scientist János Kájoni, dated 1673, dealing with the “Hun
Magyar Runic Script” disappeared as well. The collection of the runic writing of Mátyás Bél, and Pál Király, literary historian
and director of a teacher’s training college (20th century) also mysteriously vanished. Balázs Orbán (1830-1890), the chronicler of the Székely lands, mentions in the
section dealing with the runic inscription of the Énlaka Church, which was still visible then, that “two other such Hun-Scythian inscriptions existed in Csík, in the Csíkszentmiklós and
Gyergyószentmiklós churches, but both were destroyed by ignorant priests who considered
them pagan remnants.”
Bálint Gábor Szentkatolnai (1844-1913) was a Hungarian scholar who spoke more
than thirty languages. His collection of runic writings was burnt on the orders of Pál
Hunfalvy (formerly Hunsdorfer), the chief librarian of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences,
in order to prove his thesis that the Magyars did not have their own writing prior to the adoption of Christianity. Researchers of the 20th century, János Jerney, Károly Antal
Fischer and Károly Szabó looked in vain for these writings of the Hungarian ancestors in
the manuscript department, where they were originally registered. Adorján Magyar writes that the Austrian government hired a secret agent by the
name of Stromler, whose duty was the destruction of the ancient Magyar cultural treasures.
He was later appointed to a leading position under the name of Thallóczy in the Hungarian
Academy of Sciences.
This list contains only a small portion of the runic writings which are mentioned in
authenticated sources and which cannot be found in their original material form. Many
more could have been stored in the 150 castles across historical Hungary, which were
considered masterpieces from a strategic and architectural point of view and which the
Hapsburg Emperor Leopold ordered to be destroyed at the end of the 17th century.
V. The major rules of the Magyar runic script and their mastery
Alphabet by Adorján Magyar
238 These last two have been considered by official scholarship the first Hungarian written documents.



111
Alphabet by Sándor Forrai



112
Picture 6
Alphabets of the Magyar runic script
1. The Magyar runic script has to be written from right to left, because this is how
most of the old samples were written. Writing from left to right is also possible but
it is contrary to the traditional use. In this case, the letters have to be turned around
and face from the left to the right.
2. The words have to be separated by spaces. Lower case and capital letters are not
marked separately. Punctuation marks are the same as in the Latin script.
3. In the runic writing there are two letter K-s in use. According to Adorján Magyar,
one is used word-finally, the other within the word. In Sándor Forrai’s opinion,
the use of the two different K letters depends upon the order of the vowels within the word. According to the research of Klára Friedrich, the available runic
writings do not verify these theses. It is simpler – and this shortcut is also agreed
upon by Sándor Forrai – that we use only the -sign as the letter K. In the past,
not only the (e)f, (e)l, (e)m, (e)n, (e)ny, (e)r, (e)s and (e)sz sounds were preceeded by the vowel e but all consonants. Therefore the (e)b, (e)c, (e)cs...and the..(e)k,
are represented by the runic sign .
4. It is a further important rule that we use only those letters which are attested in
ancient runic texts.
5. There are no letters Q, W, X, Y in the Magyar runic script. They are represented as
follows:
Picture 7
The representation of q, w, x, and y
The original rovás is done upon a surface by a carving or scratching technique; the
runic writing today can be conducted with a pencil, pen, or brush. The ancient letters are
beautiful, pleasing and also suitable for decoration. At the Sashalom-Rákosszentmihály Church, in the XVI district of Budapest, the National Anthem and the Szózat239 can be seen
in runic script on two large enamel tiles.
The Magyar runic script is written from right to left, according to tradition. The
ancient writings, like the Egyptian hieratic writing, the Etruscan, Pelasgian, Ancient
Greek, Phoenician and Latin capital letters usually followed a right to left path. In Gyula
239 Szózat is a patriotic poem by Mihály Vörösmarty (1800-1855) which is close in spirit to the National Anthem (Translator).



113
Sebestyén’s opinion, the direction of writing began to change when the linear, cursive
writing took over. Three old Magyar runic relics were written from left to right to increase
the difficulty of reading it in some politically dangerous situations. These are the following:
- The script in the Hungarian language, by Tamás Keteji Székely, from 1515, on the wall
of the house of the Constantinople Legation;
- A poem by István Szamosközi, written against Emperor Rudolf Habsburg in 1604, in
Latin; - The letter from Peru, from 1756, written by János Zakariás, a Jesuit priest, in the Latin
language.
Writing from right to left does not cause any difficulty even for pupils in lower
grades, and those who are left-handed mention that it is easier for them to do so. There are some runic relics which were written in a vertical form, like the Margitsziget Stone
(Margaret Island, Budapest) from the 13th century. On cemetery memorial carvings and
on Székely gates we can also find runic texts, written in this vertical manner.
The characteristic of the runic script is that it is written in capital letters; the size of
the letters is traditionally equal. Presently, the first letters of the sentences and the first
letters of personal names can be marked with capitals, which helps the reading process.
Regrettably, there are no surviving runic relics which might give us a steadfast rule
concerning punctuation. Today, we use the same punctuation that the Latin language has.
Runic writing can be abbreviated in two ways. One way is the ligature which gives many playful alternatives for writing in the runic script. The following illustrations show Ferenc
Dittler’s ligatures.
Picture 8a
Ferenc Dittler’s ligatures



114
Picture 8b
Ferenc Dittler’s ligatures
Another possibility for abbreviation comes with the omission of the letter E, although to
facilitate understanding, this letter always needs to be present word-finally. Other vowels
may be left out too, if there are several of the same vowels in a word; however, here the
first vowel has to be written because only the omission of the vowel E is unambiguous.
Additionally, in times past, the long vowels were not marked separately; we find
the first such forms only after the 16th century.
VI. Numerical signs in the Magyar runic script
Picture 9
Numerical signs in the Magyar runic script
The writing of the numbers in the Magyar runic script also proceeds from right to
left. The ancestors of the Hungarians managed their accounting in a very logical manner.



115
They carved the debtor’s name into a wooden base, or burned the identification sign of the
shepherd onto it and then carved the owed sum, or the number of the animals. After that
the wooden plank was split down the middle and each of the parties – the debtor and the
lender – kept one half. They then went on and continued their usual business. When the
time came to account for the lent sum, the two halves of the split sticks were placed side
by-side and the two had to match, thus preventing any possibility of cheating.
Picture 10
Runic sticks (from Anna Bihari - Éva Pócs: Képes magyar néprajz, 1985)
The ancestors of the Hungarians were also able to accomplish certain computations
with the runic numbers but we have no old examples of these. The majority of runic experts
believe that it is not possible to do computations with runic numbers. To prove them wrong, the graphic artist József Barta worked out a technique which makes the computation of the
four basic mathematical computations possible and which was published in my 2006 booklet Új Rovásírás Tankönyv és Szakköri Ötlettár (New Rovás textbook with suggestions
for writing groups).
The runic script is very easy to learn; children in the lower grades are able to acquire
it in only 4-5 sessions, including the writing of numbers and the ligatures. It should be
mentioned that the best age for beginning to learn this sign system is after third grade,
around age 9. This is partly so, because, in this way, no-one can claim that children’s
potential problems in learning to read and write the Latin alphabet are due to interference from the runic script.240 The learning of the runic writing has no upper age-limit. Mrs.
János Egerszegi, the mother of swimming champion, Krisztina Egerszegi, learned runic
writing as a grandmother and transcribed the entire epic poem János vitéz by poet Sándor
Petőfi into runic script.
240 On the other hand, Hungarian children have to be diligent to achieve the best results in all other subjects in order to be able to get into the schools of higher education because, regrettably, in these the number of Hungarian children is diminishing. According to statistics from April 2007, Hungarian students comprise only one third of the medical student body.



116
VII. Preservation and promotion of the runic script
Hungarians have been able to preserve the writing-system of their ancestors and its
remaining examples in spite of prohibitions and persecutions. We are grateful to those who
chiseled it into stone, carved it into wood, scratched it into clay, spindle-heads, needle
holders or who wrote it on parchment, slate, paper and the walls of churches.
The scout movement played a great part in the preservation and transmission of the
Magyar runic script and, even though this movement was banned by the Communists after
1945, it continued its efforts at preservation, in exile. Beginning in the 1970’s, Sándor
Forrai, taking on the triple task of research, education and propagation, familiarized a wide
circle of his countrymen with the writing of their ancestors, in newspaper articles and
traveling exhibitions, showing it on 125 large sized pictures. This knowledge was greatly
increased by the research, decipherments and studies of archaeologist and museum director Dezső Csallány and Anna Walter Fehér, whose two-volume book, Az ékírástól a
rovásírásig (From cuneiform to rovás script) was published in Buenos Aires in 1975. It
greatly added to the resurrection of the ancient writing that Csaba Nyers, an artist, created
a postcard, using Adorján Magyar’s runic alphabet. Following the lead of these four
researchers and authors, new contributions appeared with independent research results,
publishing excerpts from Sándor Forrai’s or Anna Walter Fehér’s works. The official
position of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences has been to ignore or deny the existence
of the Magyar runic script. Instead, imposed theories of its Phoenician, Türk, Kazár,
Aramaic, Ancient Semitic, or Ancient Slavic origin have been promoted and attempts made
to validate them as such, even though the ethnogenesis and literacy of these people
occurred thousands of years later than those of the Magyar ancestors. Gábor Szakács, writer and newspaper columnist, organized a runic writing contest
in 1997 in the XVI. district of Budapest for elementary and high-school students. As a
result of the success of this competition, the already elderly Sándor Forrai visited Szakács
and the writer of this article. After several meetings, Forrai asked them to continue his life
work, which encompasses the research, teaching and propagation of the Magyar runic
script. Gábor Szakács extended these competitions to the entire Carpathian Basin and, with
the exception of the ancient Őrvidék area which is now part of Burgenland, Austria, half
of the competitors come from all over the Carpathian Basin, even from beyond the 1920
Trianon borders. The great number of applicants (700 students) made the organization of
pre-screening exams necessary in several parts of the country. Due to these competitions,
in several schools the teaching of the Magyar runic script was added to the curriculum. In
several instances the high-school and sometimes the elementary-school students help their
schoolmates prepare for the competition. Since the accomplishments of Sándor Forrai were never acknowledged in official professional circles, our Runic Writing Association, to
honor him, adopted his name as the name of this organization; this example was followed
by other runic writing groups who owed their origin to the works of Gábor Szakács.
Further tasks and suggestions:
 The inclusion into this competition of all Hungarians who live beyond the
Trianon borders, or on other continents.
 The organization of newer runic writing circles in foreign lands where
Hungarians live.



117
 The placement of road signs with runic-writing in all Hungarian cities and
settlements. This has already begun in Székelykeresztúr241 and
Gyergyócsomafalva.242
 Preparation of name-plates in runic script for the doors of houses and
apartments.
 The teaching of the basic concepts of the runic script in schools, as part of the
curriculum.
 The preparation for re-publication of the basic works of Miklós Debreczenyi,
Dezső Csallány, Anna Walter Fehér and Sándor Forrai.
 The publication of newspapers and of classical works in runic script.
 The simplification of runic script in computer programs.
 The inclusion of runic script into the Unicode system.
 The oversight and protection of the remnants of runic writings, especially
those beyond the Trianon borders.
These tasks can begin in the present location of interested individuals who are willing to
make efforts to promote and preserve our ancient culture. After all, the rovás writing is part
of our sacred and oppressed heritage, and its mastery is the noble duty of every member of
the nation.

OBJECTION TO THE FORCEFUL FINNIZATION OF THE ANCIENT HISTORY
AND LANGUAGE OF THE HUNGARIANS
Dr. László Marácz, Professor of Linguistics, Amsterdam
and
Dr. Kornél Bakay, Professor of Archaeology and Ancient History, Budapest
Part One
Recently Károly Rédei, Professor Emeritus of the University of Vienna, published the
second edition of his book, entitled Őstörténetünk kérdései (Questions in Ancient
Hungarian History). This book is a criticism of linguistic dilettantism. It was published
by the Balassi Publishing House. It is hard to believe that the first edition, in 1998, was so
successful that it necessitated a second edition. This book is exceptionally dry and boring
and it repeatedly churns out the old Finno-Ugric theory. It is a very difficult book to read.
In many instances, it offends good taste and is full of violations of scientific ethics. Rédei
simply brands all those who oppose the Finno-Ugric theory, without regard to their position
or ability, as representatives of “the intellectual and political underworld”. (p. 110)
We also doubt that such propaganda-type material could be successful in increasing the
number of people who believe in the Finno-Ugric theory. Ágnes and Gábor Kapitány, in
their book: Magyarország szimbólumok, (Symbols of Hungary), Budapest, 1999, write, on
p. 43, that, of those questioned about the origin of the Hungarians in 1999, only 56.8%
believed in the Finno-Ugric origin, down from 67.9% in the 1980’s.
Rédei’s book can be called strange and bizarre for several reasons. In the Communist Era,
the author was appointed to the position of Chair of Finno-Ugric Linguistics at the
University of Vienna. (His colleagues were appointed to the same position at the
Universities of Göttingen and Groningen). From this position, Rédei attacked (and is still
attacking) all those who proposed a different theory of the origin of the Hungarians. At the
same time, he opposes the professional and amateur proponents of the research of
Hungarian ancient history. He does this with the goal of proving that the only scientific
theory of the origin of the Hungarians is the Finno-Ugric theory!
It is hard to imagine that, for example, Stephen Hawking, the world-famous physicist and
professor of space-research, would dispute the research of amateurs who, in recent times,
have written fantastic stories of space-research and filled the libraries with them. Hawking,
who is the representative of scientific research, would probably just smile at them. But not
Rédei, who actually embarks on a vicious campaign against those who are not willing to
accept his Finno-Ugric dogma, especially against those who are unwilling to accept the
major Finno-Ugric dogma, which is that the Hungarians are of Finno-Ugric origin. How
dare they oppose the prestigious Academy of Sciences? How dare they propose a theory
which is not the officially accepted one?



120
The serious intellectual confusion, reflected in the attitude of the Academy of Sciences,
immediately reveals that they no longer feel that they are firmly established, and even they
themselves are not convinced that they are on the right path. This is why any kind of
different opinion, whether amateur or professional, causes them to be very aggressive. With
ferocious indignation, they attack the theories of the Hungarian-Sumerian, Hungarian
Turkish or Hungarian-Celtic relationship.
Rédei’s book is also bizarre because linguistic dilettantism was created by the Finno-Ugric
theory itself. This dogmatic Finno-Ugric doctrine was established a long time ago and the
practitioners of this discipline declared that it was an irrefutable truth. This is why,
according to them, there is no need to research further the possibility of a different origin
of the Hungarian language. However, in recent times, a tremendous amount of new data
has surfaced, which have really created a linguistic explosion, caused by modern technical
advances. Above all, there is the World Wide Web where, by pressing a button, one can
call up the dictionary of any language in the world.
Obviously, for the Hungarian proponents of the Finno-Ugric theory, time has stopped.
They have become bogged down in the swamp of the peaceful era of the Kádár goulash
communism. They have not become aware of the very powerful opportunities offered by
the new era. They regard the doctrines of Hunfalvy and Budenz as unchangeable and are
unwilling to consider any other data or methods or let alone accept them, because they
might disturb the surface of the waters of the Finno-Ugric theory. Not even the sober
minded, linguistically uneducated person would find this situation acceptable, because he
knows that change is inevitable.
Although Mr. Rédei, on p.115 of his book, quotes the Greek philosophers: “Pantha rei”
(Everything flows, changes), he does not apply this to the Finno-Ugric theory. Since the
Finno-Ugric dogmas are unable to explain or resolve numerous questions, amateur
researchers are looking in new directions and are beginning to research new possibilities.
He who searches, will find! New books are appearing in large numbers. We recognize
that they often offer provocative data and unusual theories.
Among the writers of these books, there are many amateurs, but these amateurs are just as
expert as was, for example, János Sajnovits, whom the Finno-Ugric theorists glorify, who
was an absolute dilettante in the field of linguistics. He was an astronomer who, in 1770,
dared to state that the Hungarian and Lapp languages were identical. He found more than
one hundred words which appeared identical, when comparing letters and sounds. He used
the same methods that Rédei (on p. 120) accuses the amateurs of today of using. Rédei
accepted from his Jesuit colleague, Father Miksa Hell, the suggestion that the Hungarians
originate from Karjala (Karelia in Hungarian), which can be read as the state of Kar-jel. Its
meaning in Hungarian is “férfi, erős karral” (man with a strong arm). Sajnovits supports
this suggestion with the surprisingly amateurish statement that “on the crest of arms of the



121
King of Karjala, can be seen two arms, one holding a sword, the other holding an arrow.”
These are the forefathers and the great science of which the Finno-Ugric theorists are still
so proud!
We should mention Antal Reguly, whom the Finno-Ugric theorists glorify, who, as a
student of Law, went to Finland and there, without any linguistic preparation, traveled to
the land of the Voguls and Ostyaks. József Eötvös, in 1853, in the course of a lecture,
called him a restless soul, a wandering traveler who, without any interest in linguistics and
without knowing any of the Finno-Ugric languages, began to write about the Finno-Ugric
theory. (Cf. to Péter Domokos: Szkitiától Lappóniáig, 1998) (From Scythia to Lapland)
Why did they make a hero of Reguly, who, according to them, proved the relationship
between the Hungarian and Finno-Ugric languages? Reguly diligently collected Vogul
and Ostyak poems and legends and this was a nice collection but was not relevant to solving
the question of the origin of the Hungarian language.
I was also the object of Mr. Rédei’s damning criticism. In 1984, I graduated from the
University of Groningen, with a degree in General Hungarian Linguistics and, in 1989, I
defended my doctoral dissertation on the subject of Hungarian sentence structure. The title
of my dissertation was: “Asymmetry in the Hungarian Language”. I received an official
Degree in Linguistics and worked at various American universities as a guest lecturer and
researcher. Since 1992, I have been a professor at the Eastern European Institute of the
University of Amsterdam. As a professional linguist, in 1985, I was co-author of the
Nyelvtudományi Közlemények (Linguistic Publications), the Scientific Review of the
Hungarian Academy of Sciences (Volume 87). My research was conducted in the area of
Hungarian postpositional phrases. It appeared on pp. 173-187. The other co-authors were
László Honti, Tamás Janurik, János Pusztay, and Károly Rédei. The last one was the co
editor of this volume, along with Péter Hajdu. Based on all of this, it is very bizarre that,
18 years later, he places my name and my work among the “amateurs”. There could be
two explanations for this. Either Mr. Rédei suffers from amnesia which, at his advanced
age is a possibility, or simply he does not like what I wrote about the origin of the
Hungarian language in my book: “The Hungarian Revival” (Magyar megújulás,
Nieuwegein, 1995), or in my articles: “Finnugor elmélet tarthatatlansága” (The
Indefensibility of the Finno-Ugric Theory) (Turán, 28/1998/5. 11-28), and “Módszertani
elméleti irányelvek a magyar nyelv kutatásához” (Methodological Theoretical Principles
in the Research of the Hungarian Language) (Turán, 29/1999-2000/ 6;23-35.) In these
works, I took a stand against the Finno-Ugric theory. I wish to note that when my
colleagues, Kornél Bakay and István Erdélyi, resigned as editors of the Turán review, the
scientific level of this review was no longer secure and, since then, I have not submitted
any of my writings to it.
It obviously annoys Károly Rédei that I, a professional linguist, dare to challenge the
Finno-Ugric doctrine. His book, which is under discussion, is an excellent proof of how
these “scientists” work: They never debate the subject, but rather just brand the research,



122
with which they disagree, as the work of amateurs, which should not be taken seriously.
According to Mr. Rédei, not even I can advance a scientific argument. (p. 114) So, he does
not wish to have anything to do with my work. In the course of many pages, he repeats
over and over the old Finno-Ugric clichés.
Naturally, I perfectly understand Rédei’s method and why he does not wish to debate my
argument. It is because my statements clearly disprove the Finno-Ugric theory.
For example, it is very difficult to isolate the Finno-Ugric languages from the other Ural
Altaic languages, like Turkish and Sumerian and draw comparisons and vocabulary
parallels within the Finno-Ugric group. According to the Lakó-Rédei Finno-Ugric
dictionary, the Hungarian word “szem” (eye) belongs to the basic vocabulary of the Finno
Ugric people. At the same time the word “szem” has numerous identical forms in the
Sumerian and Ural-Altaic languages: In Sumerian ši/ see /, Vogul sām/ eye /, Ostyak sem/
eye /, Votyak šin/ eye, face/, Zürjén šin/ eye, face/, Cseremiss šindza/ eye, face/, literary
Mongolian sinjile/ to examine/, Kalmük šindzl/ to observe/, Kún syneta/ to observe/,
Mordvin šelme/ eye/, Finn silmä/ eye/, Estonian silm/eye/, Kalmük tšilme/ blink/,
Mongolian silibki/ suddenly glance/, Turkish sina/ face/, Osman symarla/ single out/.
This kind of basic vocabulary comparison can be expanded according to preference. (Cf.
Turán, 1998: 12-18)
It is of the utmost importance to note that there are no written documents in the original,
hypothetical Finno-Ugric language. Thus, there is no documentation of the basic
vocabulary, making it impossible to document the phonetic laws or the later hypothetical
language groups such as the Ugor, Volga-Finn etc. Therefore, it was necessary to create
dozens of theories which have never been proven. It has never been explained why the
compound-forming elements of the Finn group of languages are closer to the theoretical
ancient language than are the compound-forming elements of the Hungarian language. The
question is: Why is the theoretical ancient language not identical to Hungarian?
Even the Finno-Ugric theorists recognize that the so-called phonetic laws have no natural
scientific characteristics (cf. L. Honti – A. Gergely – L. Marácz: Magyar fordulat. Magyar
tudomány, 1997/2, 241-243.), so what kind of characteristics do those theoretical phonetic
laws have? Tendentious, accidental or conjured up? These questions have never been
answered. There may not be any answers. The Finno-Ugric theory can be disputed but
cannot be proven.
According to Rédei the voiced plosive consonants were not present in the ancient Finno
Ugric language – b, d, g. (p. 32). I ask how it is possible to conclude this, when there are
no written documents in the theoretical ancient language. If this were true, then all root
words beginning with b, d, and g would be missing from the Hungarian language and such
monosyllabic words and their derivatives as:
gör-, görbe, görcs, gördül, görnyed, görhes,



123
bel-, belül, belső, benn, bennső,
dar-, dara, darál, darab etc. would be missing. This almost unbelievable.
It is also a strange stipulation that the shorter Hungarian root-words developed from the
theoretical two-syllable Finno-Ugric root-words, and that they are surely closer to the two
syllable Finno-Ugric root-words, e.g. the Hungarian szem, the equivalent of the Finn
silmä: divided into syllables – sil-mä or silm-ä. This is also surprising because all linguists
agree that the Finno-Ugric languages are agglutinative. This means that suffixes may be
added to the root-words in order to create new words. If we find root-parallels, then the
shorter root is the earlier form and the longer root is the later form, i. e. the derivative. The
Hungarian roots are monosyllabic; the Finn equivalents are of two syllables. Then why
would the Hungarian roots be derivatives of the Finn words? All this means that the Finno
Ugric theorists did not take into consideration the agglutinative character of the Hungarian
language or that our language has monosyllabic root-words. Is it possible to base the origin
of a language on such confused omissions?
In the Finno-Ugric studies, it is often stated with certainty, that there are 500 – 1000
Hungarian words, which are derived from the ancient Finno-Ugric language. (Rédei, p.
115) This statement appears to be scientific but is nothing more than a bluff. The actual
number of these words is more like 419. The Finno-Ugric origin of the vocabulary of the
Hungarian language cannot be stated with certainty, because the so-called ancient Finno
Ugric language is a hypothetical, reconstructed laboratory model. The reality is that there
are some parallels between the vocabulary of the Hungarian language and the so-called
Finno-Ugric languages. According to László Klima: Magyar nyelv, 1991, there are 212
parallels between the Finn and the Hungarian languages which may be considered certain.
This number is just half of Rédéi’s bluff. Among these parallels, there are some which we
find doubtful. For example, the Finn - kota, Hungarian – ház, or the Finn – kunta,
Hungarian – had. We disregard these “cognates” because they have no connection, either
phonetically or logically. The meaning of the Finn – kota is “tent” which is not identical
to the Hungarian – ház, meaning “house”. If we disregard these doubtful word connections
and take into account not the words, but the root-words, then the Hungarian-Finn word
parallels remain well under 212. The Czuczor-Fogarasi Dictionary lists more than 2000
roots and 80 one-syllable affixes. According to this dictionary, the Hungarian language has
2080 basic word elements. The Finn parallels do not amount to even 10% of this number!
There is another explanation for the Hungarian-Finn word parallels, other than the
hypothetical ancient relationship between the two languages, proposed by the Finno-Ugric
theorists, but the Linguistics Department of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences has never
seriously considered it. In this question, the distorted double-standard operates because,
while the Finno-Ugric theorists are not obliged to try to disprove any alternative theory,
other researchers have to refute the Finno-Ugric theory point by point. (Rédei p. 120)
Possible explanations of the word parallels:



124
1. There was an ancient Hungarian-European language, from which those languages,
which show parallels with the Hungarian language, broke away. This explanation
indicates that Hungarians were the ancient populace of the Carpathian Basin. This
theory coincides with the view of the American professor, Grover Krantz, about the
geographical development of the European languages. According to Krantz,
Hungarians lived in the Carpathian Basin at least 10,000 years ago, and Hungarian is
the European ancient language.
2. There could have existed a large Ural-Altaic language family, which was formed
in the territory of Eurasia. This is the possibility mentioned by Sajnovits in the
foreword of his book: Demonstratio, but the Finno-Ugric theorists never mention this
possibility.
3. The Hungarian-Finno-Ugric-Turkish and Sumerian linguistic parallels were
created by territorial proximity of these peoples. The Hungarian scholar, Mátyás Bél,
already proposed this possibility in 1718, in his work: Tanulmányok a régi hun-szkita
irodalomról (Studies from Ancient Hun-Scythian literature.) According to Mátyás Bél,
there were several ethnic groups living in Scythia.
4. The Hungarian-Finn word parallels are the result of accidental consonance,
because any two languages have mutual phonetic similarities.
The Finno-Ugric theorists have never refuted these possibilities and still do not attempt to
refute them, so we can rightly use Rédei’s words as a self-characterization of the Finno
Ugric theory: “monomániás fixa ideától vezérelve s ábránd képeket, lázálmokat kergetve
gyártott elmélet” (p.7) “monomaniacal theory, driven by a fixed idea, imaginary pictures
and feverish dreams”. The Finno-Ugric theory, “a theory, which attempts to prove a
preconceived goal, is a violation of scientific ethics.” (p. 59)
After so many doctrines leading to a dead end, we consider it justified that Hungarian
Linguistic Science return to the traditions of our great Hungarian predecessors -- Ferenc
Kresznerics, József Engel, János Nagy, Pál Csató, Gergely Czuczor and János Fogarasi.
These linguists studied the roots as the central element of the Hungarian vocabulary. These
are lexical elements which, without any affixes, have a phonetic and semantic identity.
This was the true revolution of the Reform Age of Hungarian Linguistics, “the Quantum
leap”, which, after the suppression of the 1848-49 Hungarian Freedom Fight, Hunfalvy and
his colleagues successfully sabotaged. Pál Hunfalvy, already in 1851, in the Akadémia
Értesítő (Academy Report), denied that the Hungarian language even had root words. With
this statement, not only did he put the research of the Hungarian language on a side-track
but as Rédei’s book witnesses, he led it into a dead-end.
The main purpose of the linguists of the 21st century must be to bring to light the true inside
structure of the Hungarian vocabulary, whose central element is the root. Mr. Rédei’s
biased, one-sided attribute is that he regards this urgent scientific duty as a “language
game”. (p115) Until we have completed this work, we can scarcely state anything definite
about the origins of the Hungarian language.



125
What is already sure is that Hungarian ancient history and Hungarian consciousness of self
cannot be built on the less than 10% Hungarian-Finn word parallels in the Hungarian
vocabulary. Those who, by every possible means, are propagating the Finno-Ugric theory
are doing none other than forcefully finnizing the Hungarian language and culture, just as
Florián Mátyás stated in 1858.

126
AGAINST THE FORCEFUL FINNIZATION OF THE HUNGARIAN LANGUAGE
Dr. Kornél Bakay’s answer to Károly Rédei
Part Two
It is without a doubt a sad, disheartening situation for an older professor to realize that he
is aging out of the teaching field. (Mr. Rédei from 1974 to 2002, has been able to enjoy the
advantages provided by the University of Vienna.) Slowly his creative work is diminishing.
The time is ripe for him to become a critic. This profession does not require an outstanding
talent or diligence. It is enough to have a professional background in order to criticize and
brand others.
Károly Rédei was born in 1932 and his book, which appeared in 1998, was published again
in 2003. The new edition is not more detailed or more objective, not even more enjoyable
to read than the one which appeared five years earlier. In Turán 28 (1998) No. 5. (p.3
10), I wrote my opinion of the Budapest Finno-Ugric Pamphlet No. 10 (which was later
republished in the Szeged Hungarian Ancient History Library No 11. in 1999). Now the
Szeged Hungarian Ancient History Library has republished Rédei’s book, with the Balassi
Publishing House, volume 18, and it has only been expanded by a ten-page epilogue and
rewritten footnote section. Therefore, really I should only express my opinion of this new
section.
I find it very difficult to force myself to undertake this task, not only because the writer is
intent on fault-finding and with his increasingly dull brain, he lashes out at everyone and
alienates me, but more importantly because, by my standards, he is not a serious researcher.
He just quotes from uncorrected and unchecked short newspaper articles written by his
opponents and triumphantly points out all the misprints and clerical errors. (Szeremisz
instead of Cseremisz, lett instead of liv, and Mári instead of Mari.) Meanwhile, he has not
even read my book: Az Árpádok országa, (Árpád’s Country) a professional monograph
(512 pages) published in 2000 (supported by the Millennium Government Commission)
and reprinted in 2002, in which every statement or hypothesis is supported by literature
and research. He handled my other book in a similar manner: Östörténetünk régészeti
forrásai (The Archeological Sources of Hungarian Ancient History) Miskolc, 1997-98, in
2 volumes. Yet Károly Rédei constantly emphasizes the basic law of research, that firstly
one must disprove the mistaken theories. (2003: 48, 92) He diverges from the views of
most well-known researchers and, if he reads statements that he does not like, he does not
judge them on their merits (for example, the recent findings of the Finn and Estonian
researchers: K. Wiik, A. Künnap, K. Julku, Meinander) but uses inappropriate adjectives
about them, often without even reading many of them. He does this not only to my research
work, but also to his own linguist colleagues. For example, he has never mentioned
anything about the Italian, Angela Marcantonio: The Uralic Language Family. Facts and
Statistics, published by Blackwell Publishers, Oxford-Boston, 2003, Volume 35 in the
series of the Philological Society (p. 335). When he is pressed, because he has no



127
knowledge of the subject, (for example, the Sumerian language and the archeology of
Mesopotamia), then Mr. Rédei asks for help from outsiders, such as Michaela Weszeli
(2003: 140.), and that is really untypical for a linguist. In his pieced-together compilation
of the Sumerian language, (published in 2003, 84-91.) he quotes outdated small Hungarian
handbooks (like those of 1976 and 1977) and also one published in 1959 and one in 1982
(which was republished in 1994). As an archeologist, I usually use information from the
following researchers: A. L. Oppenheim: Ancient Mesopotamia: Portrait of a Dead
Civilization. Chicago, 1964.; H. W. F. Saggs: Mesopotamien: Assyrer, Babylonier,
Sumerer. Zurich, 1966.; Barthel Hrouda: Der Alte Orient. Geschichte und Kultur des Alten
Vorderasiens. Munich, 1991.; W. von Soden: Einführung in die Altorientistik. WBG
Darmstadt, 1985.; G. Rachet: Dictionnaire de l’Archéologie, Paris, Robert Laffont, 1983.;
A. Deimel: Sumerische Lexikon. I-III. Rome, 1928-1937.; A. Falkenstein: Archaische
Texte aus Uruk. Berlin, 1936.; M. I. Thomsen: The Sumerian Language. An Introduction
to its History and Grammatical Structure. Copenhagen, 1984.; A. Sjöberg: The Sumerian
Dictionary. Philadelphia, 1984; Fr. Ellermeier: Sumerisches Glossar I. Sumerische
Lautwerte 2. Nörten-Hardenberg, 1979-1980.; W. von Soden-W. Rölling: Das Akadische
Syllaber. Rome, 1976.
Károly Rédei’s style is shocking and the adjectives which he uses to describe his colleagues
would not even be used in a tavern, eg. “crazy” (2003: 132.), “uneducated, ignorant”
“stupid” (2003: 100), “maniacal” “hallucinating”, “charlatan” (2003: 103-104.),
“hallucinating charlatan” (2003: 104-105.), “extremist demagogue” (2003: 111.), “illusory
hallucination” (2003: 139) “extreme foolishness” (2003. 132) and “suffering impostor”
(2003. 120). It is not just stupidity but simply degradation to call several of us “fascist”
(2003. 17.), “criminal” historians (2003. 120.) and “members of the scientific underworld”
just because we have a different view from his and that of his comrades.
He seems to enjoy greatly degrading and mocking his colleagues who are members of the
opposite camp – as he did in the Communist era as a member of the National Postgraduate
Degree Granting Board. It did not matter whether they were amateur historians or well
qualified scientific researchers. He lumps together Zoltán Paál, Elek Plessa, László
Grespik, József Torgyán, Gyula László, Kornél Bakay, Gyula Mészáros, Ferenc Kemény,
István Kiszely, László Szabédi, László Marácz, and Géza Balázs, believing that with this
unethical action, he can, with one blow, strike down all his opponents.
Károly Rédei does not regard me as a scientific opponent because – he says – my topics
and methods are unprofessional. (2003. 61.) Even so, I will propose some professional
observations, but first I will quote János Makkay, my archeologist colleague’s words:
Károly Rédei is not in the position to judge my archeological research, either to
approve or disapprove of it, since his knowledge of archeology and ancient history
is not sufficient to do so. Whoever reads his last book can easily determine that his



128
knowledge on these subjects is very limited. In spite of this, the title of his volume
is: Questions about our Ancient History. (Magyar Nyelv 95, 1999, 254)
First of all, I would like to comment on the nature of “true science” and the idea of
“scientific scholarship”.
The methods of the research of ancient history are not really any different than those of
historical science. (2003: 18.) Moreover, we must emphasize the harmony between the
different areas of science. This does not mean that the social sciences and, within them,
historical science, can be compared to the natural sciences. It is more than stupidity to
compare the fictive, artificially created Finno-Ugric basic language with electricity. (2003:
77.) The research of ancient history is built primarily on scientific hypotheses and will
continue so in the future. Theoretically every established hypothesis is of equal value.
They are not equally substantiated. The mutual agreement of researchers and especially the
judgment of those in high positions have enormous influence on decisions about careers
and appointments. (2003: 75.) They have no influence on historical truth or on how many
researchers or which researchers actually make certain statements. Hasselblatt’s view is
that certain statements will not become more probable or more convincing if they are
continuously repeated and published in different languages. Mr. Rédei quotes Hasselblatt
(2003: 131.), but he does not apply this statement to the Finno-Ugric theorists whose
dogmas are “everlasting fundamental truths”, which they certainly are not!
Let us see some of the themes of Professor Emeritus Károly Rédei, which are supposed to
be scientific truth and which are every one of them fictitious theories – the Uralic basic
language; the Samoyed-Uralic relationship (which is strictly based on the “intuition” of
Kai Donner); the Uralic Age, 6000-4000 BC; the location of the Uralic ancient homeland;
the existence of the Finno-Ugric primitive language; the location of the Finno-Ugric
ancient homeland; the Finno-Ugric Age, 4000-3000 BC; the Ugor Age, 3000-500 BC; the
so-called Ugor ancient homeland in the Ural-Volga-Kama territory; the Magyars’
separation from this territory in A.D. 500; the so-called Magyar ancient homeland in
Baskiria; the Magyar-Turk relationship which varied from close-knit to loose-knit
depending on the era; the location of the so-called Indo-European ancient homeland; and
so on.
What unfounded statements he makes, as a linguist, about the languages of the ancient
peoples! He can make these unfounded statements because there is no definite knowledge
of these languages. There is no indisputable proof or intelligible language remains of the
language of the Scythians, Hsiungnu, Huns, Avars, Pechenegs, Kazars or Kabars! Not
even to mention that Rédéi has no basic knowledge of the elements of the archeological
research of Eurasia. The same can be said about the Carpathian Basin, Inner and Central
Asia or the ancient East.



129
According to Rédei, the Scythians surely spoke an Iranian language. The Huns, Avars,
Kazars, Kabars, Pechenegs all spoke a Turkish language. The Kushans were of unknown
origins. Although we have no knowledge of the language of the Kazars, he states that the
Magyars adopted Turkish loan-words from the Kazars, with whom they lived for 200-300
years.
Let us examine the question of the Pecheneg language. It has been stated for centuries,
that the Pechenegs had a decisive victory over the Hungarian ancestors, the Magyars, and
this resulted in the Magyars fleeing from the Pechenegs and establishing themselves in the
Carpathian Basin. The unbiased research of scholars has proved that at the end of the ninth
century, there was no Pecheneg attack against our ancestors, the Magyars. (Őstörténetünk
régészeti forrásai II. Miskolc, 1998, 316-317. – (Archeological sources of Hungarian
Ancient History II) -- Magyar Nyelv 94/ 1998/ 140-141, 149 – 97/2001/ 10-14.) Linguists
believe that the Pechenegs, (Kangars) spoke a Turkish language. (cf. A. M. Scserbak).
Linguists bring forth linguistic data to show that the Scythians, Pechenegs, Huns, Kazars,
Avars, Turks, Magyars all had writing, but it was in the runic script!
Constantine Porphyrogenitus, the Byzantine Emperor, in the middle of the tenth century in
his work: De Administrando Imperio (On Imperial Administration), in Chapter 38, names
eight territories of the country of the “Pacinakia” Pechenegs, in Greek writing: Erdim,
Csúr, Jula, Külbej, Karabaj, Tolmács, Kappan, Csaban, and the names of the princes of
these territories: Bajcsa, Küel, Kerkutaj, Ina, (Ipaosz?), Kajdum, Koszta, Jazi, and Bota.
Finally, he lists the names of the castles: Aszprom, (Fehér), Tun-kataj, Karakna-kataj,
Szalmas-kataj, Szaka-kataj, Jaju-kataj, Banamuni, Tejgua.
It cannot be denied that the Pechenegs were able to write. In the ninth century (obviously
earlier too, at Lake Aral, in the Syr-Darja territory, in the territory next to the Oguz Turks,
and in the territory near the Magyars, between the Volga and the Lower Danube) the runic
alphabet was used, but the decipherment of the runic script was very problematic. We can
read these writings in Turkish and in Hungarian, since the letters were classified as the
Pecheneg runic script. The runic scripts found on the gold vessels of the Nagyszentmiklós
Treasure, on the water-bottle of Novocserkaszk, on the Majackoje castle, on the bull’s skull
at Eliszta and the stick-runes of Acsiktas are in the opinion of Gyula Német, Sz. I. Malov
and in my opinion too, more likely to be Hungarian runic script than Turkish, but it is still
possible that they could be Turkish. The Turkish linguists, based on some remains,
consider the following words to be Pecheneg words: ertim = előkelő, fényes (illustrious,

Professor Emeritus Rédei meets with no success either in advocating the Magyar-Turkish
relationship, because almost every statement he makes is based on outdated information.
(2003: 56-67). The international linguistics still classify the Turkish, Mongolian,
Mandzsu-Tunguz, Korean and Japanese among the Altaic languages. (I note in parentheses
that it is not an empty statement to speak of the possible relationship between the Hungarian
and Japanese languages. /2003: 47, 51, 132-133/, since the late Lajos Kazár found
similarities in 600 word groups and 35 inflectional similarities between the two languages
(Cf. Magyar Nyelv, 92/1996/127). The research of Hungarian-Japanese affinities as started
by Klaproth in 1823 is certainly not useless and is definitely not unscientific!)
In regard to the formation of the Turkish language, there is a very serious point of view
that there is an obvious connection between the Sumerian and Turkish languages, but let
us return to Rédei’s contention that there is a connection between the Hungarian and
Turkish languages.
Almost all of his statements are unfounded. The ancient homeland of our ancestors was
not in Baskiria. No source mentions anything about the supposed aggression of the Sabirs,
and it is only a theory that the Kazar language was a Turkish language. Yet more and more
texts written in runic script are being discovered. The written remains which mention the
Pechenegs have been declared to be Kazar writings (Magyar Nyelv, 80/1984/13.), and most
researchers wish to classify them as Turkish writings. This is still only a theory, nothing
more. The Kiev letter, hoqurüm (oqurim) = I read it. This is very important, but not even
this proves that the Kazar language was a Turkish language. However, if it was, then was
it Chuvash or Turkic?
The origin of the Turks has not yet been able to be determined by means of linguistics
because there are no definite Turkic remains before 600 A.D. There are no sources earlier
than the seventh century which talk of the origins of the Turks. (Magyar Nyelv, 94/1999/
386 skk.) Instead of linguistic conjecture, only archeology and anthropology can give
reliable answers. Obviously not even the Turks came from nowhere.
Based on the geographical names which appear in the sources (Kem = Jenyiszej, Afu =
Abakán, Kin-san = Altaj = aranyhegy etc.) we should look for the Turkic “ancient
homeland” in the valley of the Minuszinszk and the territory of Altaj, that is, in the



131
historical Magna Scythian land, where the Ripe/Rife = Ripaeos Montes, = Imaus/
mountains are found which are identical not to the Urals but the Altai Mountains. The
Southern-Siberian and Inner-Asian archeological excavations have brought to light that the
Scythian-Hsiungnu-Hun-Turkish cultures have common origins and common roots! From
the third millennium BC, in these territories and in the territory of Northwestern China
(Russia), the majority of people were of the Europid race (the Afanaszjevó, Okunyév,
Andronovo, Karasuk, Tagár, Tastyk cultures, as well as the Scythian-Hun-Pazyrik, Bulán
Kóbi remains), who possessed a characteristic civilization.
According to recent information, the people of the Andronovo culture, from the second
millennium B.C. spoke an Iranian, Altaic and possibly an Ugric language. From 700 BC.
on, the people who used pit-grave burials, catacomb burials and mound burials
intermingled with the partly Mongoloid people, who migrated from the south, with the
knowledge of metal-smelting. (Karaszuk 1600-900 BC) This culture was called Din-lin by
the researchers. Their territory extended to the Urals territory (Szintasta, Arkaim, Galics,
Szuhanyiha). The Din-lin people were Europid people with fair-skins, black hair and blue
eyes (Bej-si), who lived in the territory of Ordos.
In the Taklimakán Desert (Zaghunluq, Lopnor, Kroren, Szubesi, Jingpen) up to now more
than 500 preserved mummies, with intact clothing and organic materials, have been found
by the Chinese archeologists. (Wang Binghua). They have been dated to between1400
400 BC. Most of them were Caucasian and Turanian type Europid people.
The populace who developed the Andronovo Culture from the beginning of the first
millennium BC., changed from agriculture and animal husbandry to nomadic stock-raising
and this change made it possible for them to work the territory where the climate had
become colder (Altaj, Tien-san, Hákászia, Minuszinszk-valley, and Fergana). The Indo
Iranian ethnic group was probably a part of this populace but the majority was supposedly
ancient Ugrians (Ardzsan, 9th and 8th centuries BC).
The pre-Scythian Tagar culture (between the 8th and 5th centuries BC.), and the Scythian
Tastyk culture (between the 5th and 2nd centuries BC) are directly connected to the
archeological findings in the Carpathian Basin.
The Scythian-Hun-Avar-Turk-Magyar peoples’ cultural, religious, economic, and partly
ethnic and genetic relationship is not a figment of the imagination and is not a castle in the
air (2003:18.), but is a hypothesis, based on hard facts from archeology and anthropology.
(This is not an empty hypothesis and there is no such thing as a full hypothesis but there
are many empty heads.) That the Turk-speaking Hun-Bulgar-Onogurs and the Ugor
Magyar-speaking Hun-Sabir-Magyars were bilingual is a realistic supposition, (Magyar
Nyelv, 83/1987/ 448-454; 94/1998/78/91.), and more likely than Károly Rédei’s naïve
statements (2003:62).



132
The remains of the Avar language in runic script, that is names of ranks, (found at Szarvas
and Nagyszentmiklós), can also be read in Hungarian. (Boila, Csabis, Csupán, Csúr, Jabgu,
Tegin, Sád, Canizauci – this word is not taken from a comic page – 2003: 142. Kagán,
Katun, Kapkán, Jugurrus, Tudun, Tarkán). Personal names (Baján, Bokolabra). None of
these has been proven because they are foreign words. (Magyar Nyelv, 82/1986/129-151.)
Among the Huns and Avars there could have been and probably were people belonging to
the Turkish and Mongol races, who spoke the Turk and Mongol languages, although some
linguists deny that the Huns spoke a Turk language. (Magyar Nyelv, 59/1963/53-66.) The
three Hun words which remained in the writings of Priscos and Jordanes, (strava, kamosz,
medosz) are surely not of Turk origin, nor are words which start with “l”, “r” or “v”. The
Asian Hsiung-nu also belonged to the great European race, although the small number of
linguistic remains, which have been found to this day, are hardly understandable because
of the distortion in the Chinese writing.
About the Sumerians, I note only that, compared to the fabricated, reconstructed Uralic
Finno-Ugric basic language, the Sumerian cuneiform remains are authentic, although we
still do not know how the cuneiform syllables and words were pronounced at that time.
There are very few linguists who believe that the Sumerian people were assimilated into
another people, but it is true that we do not yet know whence they came to settle between
the two rivers, maybe from India, maybe from the southeastern territory of the Caspian
Sea. The early Stone Age cultures in Mesopotamia, which had no ceramics, were not the
predecessors of the Kengir (Sumerians). The Sumerian writings were the most important
development of mankind. The idea of writing spread from here first to Egypt, then Elam,
later to India and toward China. What Károly Rédei wrote about the Sumerians can be
called anything but up to date. He is still reiterating the statements that were made thirty
years ago.
The most recent linguistic research explains the formation of languages and the question
of the relationship of languages very differently from the research of that time. It is more
and more probable (through DNS examination) that, already in the Upper Paleolithic Age,
there were people living in the Carpathian Basin, speaking an Ugor-Magyar language. As
the ice-cover melted, a large group of them moved north and northeast and they could have
given their language to those who were originally called Indo-Europeans, the ancient Finns.
The ancestors of the Finns obviously did not migrate to their present homeland from the
east, from the territory of the Urals. The observations of the Finn archeologists should be
taken into consideration.
Contrary to the accepted prehistoric east-west migration, it is more probable that the
migration took place from south to north. That this was the direction of migration is being
shown in recent times. Some of the groups of the Hungarian ancestors, arriving from the
south in the seventh century AD, settled in the territory of Baskiria (the Magyars of
Julianus). The majority of the Magyars lived in the more agreeable territory of Kazaria,



133
whence they moved, at the beginning of the ninth century, to the territory between the Don
and the lower Danube and from here, at the end of the ninth century, to the Carpathian
Basin.
The Hungarian language is radically different from the Vogul and Ostyak languages in
phonological, morphological, lexical and syntactical characteristics. This is now accepted
by many linguists, most recently, the Italian, Angela Marcantonio, who criticizes Péter
Hajdu “in a friendly way”. (Magyar Nyelv, 91/1995/129.) She demonstrates that the Finno
Ugric theorists raised one hypothesis to the level of scientific truth and they neglected to
prove it. (Marcantonio, 2003: 270.). This is why the Finno-Ugric theorists’ preconceived
attitude led to a circular argument. (“This can lead to a circularity of argument.”
Marcantonio. 2003:269). József Budenz’ linguistic comparisons were totally
unsatisfactory. (“We saw that his comparative corpus is unsatisfactory in modern terms.”
Marcantonio. 2003: 270) Today, linguists do not accept 81% of Budenz’ contrived
linguistic comparisons. Marcantonio states: “There was never a unified Uralic language
and not even a Uralic language family.” (Marcantonio, 2003: 271, 274.) “In this review, I
have examined the Uralic languages at all relevant levels of language. I have failed to
uncover any evidence at all to support the notion that these form a unique genetic family!”
(Marcantonio. 2003: 273-274) We can only speak of linguistic groupings and the close
connections between them, like Finn, Magyar, Obi-Ugor, Samoyed etc. “Hungarian
should be classified as an Inner Asian language. This classification would be consistent
with the testimony of the historical sources.” (Marcantonio. 2003: 275)
The methods used for linguistic comparison up to the present time are therefore outdated
and manipulated because, for example, if there are certain basic linguistic elements lacking,
the Finno-Ugric linguists say that they are lost. If they find contradictory elements, then
they state that they reflect a language which has died out. If even this still does not help,
then they speak of accidental similarities. (2003:66, 89.) Angela Marcantonio poses this
question: “Where did the process go wrong? How is it possible that a community of
scientists can base its work, for over 100 years, on a fundamental belief in the U-node,
which is simply not supported by the evidence, and indeed is contradicted by a good body
of evidence?” (Marcantonio. 2003: 277)
Marcantonio finds the explanation in the influence of Darwinism, but it is now sure that
we have to break away from the paradigm of the Ural-Finno-Ugric linguistic relationship.
“I believe that a shift in the paradigm can no longer be delayed.” (Marcantonio. 2003:
278) However, “it is in the interest of those who are sitting in the stronghold of the Finno
Ugric theory that their ‘truth’ remains unchanged.” (Péter Király: Magyar Nyelv.
96/2000/67.)

APPENDIX
New research
Amateur researchers often present new conclusions that they have formulated
independently, and therefore have no official „sources” which they can cite to support their
conclusions. They do not belong in the group of the „official” historians, who are
constrained by the limits of their positions. Therefore, they are free to introduce ideas that
contradict the accepted theories.
We would like to present here the research of István Vallus, who has spent the last eight
years researching the Celts. He offers some original explanations of the runic symbols
found on some artifacts and monoliths in Ireland and Scotland, which are similar to those
in the Carpathian Basin. This explains the lack of sources. We hope that this study will
pave the way for discussion and further research.
What do the Stones in the British Isles reveal?243
István Vallus
The objects found in the mysterious, beautiful landscapes of Britain have, for centuries,
been the focus of the research of many scholars. In addition to the official researchers,
many amateur historians have devoted their time to the study of these artifacts. With the
present study, I would like to contribute to the already expanding field of knowledge in
this area.
I base my study on the results of my eight-year research of the Celts. These results strongly
contradict the accepted views of scholars in Hungary. The Finno-Ugric theory of the origin
of the Hungarians, imposed on them by order of the Austrian Emperor, in the 19th century,
after Austria occupied Hungary, is still an open wound. Thank God that the new generation
of Hungarians considers it to be a laughable fairy-tale, although it still taught in the history
books today. In October, 2000, in the Science Magazine, there was an article by Semino et
al that stated that an unusually high percentage of Hungarian men today (70-90%) are
descended from four people, who lived in the Carpathian Basin 35,000 years ago. Another
surprising result that they found, which contradicts the theory of our Asian origin, was that
Hungarians do not possess an Asian gene-marker, and the Finns, who are considered
related to them, do possess this marker.
Seventeen scientists conducted this gene research. There was not a Hungarian in the group,
so it would be ridiculous to attribute the reported surprising results to some kind of
243 Translated by Margaret Botos



135
nationalistic tendency. Actually, in Hungary, instead of taking these results and capitalizing
on them, researchers question whether there were enough subjects in the study.
They justifiably ask: What is behind the theories of the Hungarian relationship with you,
Brits, Scots, Irish and Welsh? My answer to this question is quite simply this: The “secret”
signs on the Neolithic structures found in Scotland and Ireland, in my opinion, can only be
deciphered with the help of the Hungarian language. It must be recognized that we were
the autochthonous population of Europe 35,000 years ago,
This study explains the system of the pictographs found there. Enjoy reading about them!

István Vallus
Let us begin with GOD
During the course of my research of the Celts, I came upon so many linguistic and symbolic
similarities between the descendants of the Magyars and the Celts that it would be a crime
on my part to keep silent about them, so I ask the reader to permit me to show these
connections through the analysis of the Hungarian word ISTEN (meaning GOD).
We have very little knowledge of the origin of our word ISTEN and its exact
meaning. In general, we know only what we can learn from the Bible after the
adoption of Christianity. All that we know about the religion of the Magyars before
that time, is that they were pagan and that they had some kind of a pagan god, and
so, generally, they are counted among other pagan peoples and their pagan gods.
244(Forrai Sándor)
Today, this is still the accepted historical opinion in Hungary. Everywhere we hear, almost
as a chant, that King István (1000-1038) (Saint Stephen) was the first king, who, with fire
and sword, spread the Christian religion among the Scythian people, and led them out of
the darkness into the light.
Naturally, there is not a word of truth in this statement. The Neolithic and Bronze Age
people, living in the Carpathian Basin, had a well-formed view of God, a way of thinking
in several dimensions and a logical, systematic idea of creation.
I am not going back as far as the Neolithic Age. I shall begin my analysis of the system of
symbols in the Bronze Age. I state categorically that the signs that the Bronze Age people
used on their artifacts were not intended to be decorations. They were used to impart
knowledge and facts. Decoration is the art of “the man of leisure”. In the Bronze Age,
everyone struggled with existence every day: Can I make a fire? Can I be successful in the
244 Forrai Sándor: Az Isten szavunk eredete, jelentése és a történelmi háttér 1. oldal rovasiras.uw.hu/forrai.doc



136
hunt? etc. Forty years was the general life-span and survival was the everyday concern. For
this, they called upon God for help.
I believe that the Hungarian word for God, ISTEN, should be analyzed thus: I-S-TEN. I
shall support my statement with different symbols and word-roots, which together form a
complex idea.
Let us begin with the explanation of the runic symbol: “I”
1. Runic Alphabet according to Sándor Forrai
This symbol245 can be found in the Magyar/Székely system of runic writing, pronounced
in Hungarian as SZ, (in English S). In the very beginning, it was not a sound, but an
ideogram. Its pronunciation today can be found in the Hungarian word-roots: SZER,
SZÚR, SZÁR, SZŐR, the SZ pronounced with the English S. Each of the mentioned word
roots indicates a progression from point A to point B.
In modern Hungarian writing and speech, we use the word-root SZÁR- to express the idea
that someone originates from somewhere, comes from somewhere, or descends from
someone. In English, we need a complete sentence to express: “I come from Budapest.”
meaning: Budapest is my home. In Hungarian all we need to say or write is “Budapest-i
245 The runic symbol I appears in the word ISTEN as the Latin letter I. (Translator)



137
vagyok”, in other words: “I originate (SZÁR-mazom) from there.” The symbol for this
concept of originating is a vertical line which goes from point A to point B. This refers not
only to geographical places, but also to the line of descent from father: “apa-i” or mother:
“anya-i”. This is the Hungarian runic sign that has survived in today’s Hungarian alphabet.
2. The journey of the soul (my own illustration)
csillag = star: lélek = soul
According to the ancient belief-system, every star in the sky is the soul of a living person
who has died. The eternal movement of the soul to the sky and back to earth is a concept
that is represented by the Hungarian word-root: SZER-. From this word-root, we can create
many words. We will notice that every word that begins with SZER- is connected to the
actions of the soul. So it becomes clear that the Hungarian word “SZERelmes” (SZER-él
más) means: my soul lives in another person. It is obvious that the pious person, who
follows God’s ways, is a “SZERzetes” (a monk). In the Palóc region, not long ago, they
still asked a lively youngster: “Mi SZER vagy?” (What is your origin? Where did you come
from?)
The Hungarian language follows this ancient logic. We speak of the population of a village
as so many “souls”. We also use SZER in counting: egy-SZER, két-SZER, három-SZER
(once, twice, thrice etc.) Is the poultice made of herbs that we wrap (köt) around a wound
a „köt-SZER? Is the herbal tea that we drink to heal us (gyógyít), a „gyógy-SZER
(medicine)? There is no question. The answer is YES.
It was not by accident that, in my illustration, below the word SZER there was another
word: SER. In the Welsh language the word SER means star, thus following the connection
between the Welsh SER and the word SZER, meaning star or soul, in the Scythian
language. I am fortunate (SZER-encsés) to have been able to discover this connection.



138
We receive our souls from God and we return to him. In connection with the symbol for
SZER, I was lucky enough to capture an interesting photograph in the community of
Bodony.
3. Sunset over the Mátra Mountain (my own photograph)
If my logic is correct, then our ancestors represented people (or souls) with a vertical line.
Even today, the Hungarians refer to the „loss of souls” when a ship or a boat sinks.
SZER as an indication of rank or organization:
The Scythian [and also the Hun246] army counted the soldiers (souls) thus: egy-SZER (one
soul), két-SZER (two souls) etc., until they got to 10 (tíz). The organization of the Scythian
army was also based on the decimal system. So, the leader of 10 (tíz) soldiers was the
“tizedes” (corporal). God gave him ten souls to lead. The commander of ten “tizedes” was
the “száz-ad-os” (captain) (száz = 100), who had 100 souls in his charge. Ten “százados”
were commanded by the “ezer-ed-es” (colonel) (ezer = 1000). The highest commander of
the army was the “tábor-SZER-nagy” (general). Naturally, I can support my statements
with facts, not just in Hungary but also in Scotland, because they too were Scythians.
246 Baráthosi-Balogh, Benedek: A hunok Három Világ Birodalma, Buenos Aires, 1974. (Translator)



139
4. Russian artifacts indicating the Scythian golden badges of military ranks
Of course, the badges of rank follow my logic concerning the connections between the
concepts of SZER = “soul” = “soldier”. You are familiar with the phrase “death reaps”,
aren’t you? Well, the concept of SZER = soul, origin also applies to the sheaf of corn.
When we harvest corn, the cut stalks are gathered into a sheaf and when there are many of
them, they are bound in the middle with some sort of binding, just like those on the shield
above. Therefore, the KEVE (rank) is the sheaf. In the Scythian military ranks there is the
KEVE and his rank is indicated by the sheaves on the shield. Here is another interesting
comparison, which supports my logic. At the time of harvesting, the corn sheaves are
leaned against each other and they form a rick or stack (Hu: asztag). If several platoons or
squadrons combine to complete a manoever, this combined armed group is called an
“osztag” (detachment). This word differs from “asztag” by only one sound.



140
5. Battle symbol of a Scythian leader
Naturally, on this war-symbol, each single tassel represents a single military unit.
Therefore, the tassel, as a unit of combined souls, originates from this ancient logic.
6. Scottish kilt
In the sporran (pouch) worn on the Scottish kilt above, like the Scythians, the Scots carried
healing plants (gyógy-SZER), fire tinder (tűz-SZER-szám) and talismans for luck (SZER
encse). On the sporran the three tassels signify 30 lancers, for this number was required to
establish a clan. Since the priesthood also fought in wars, it is not surprising that, on the
Church shields, the souls belonging to the religious community were indicated by tassels.



141
7. Crest of the Benedictine Order in Pannonhalma
The representation of souls with a vertical line can also be found in Ireland. My theory is
that they drew the souls thus: I I I I I I I and then drew a circle around them, making it into
a tassel, the symbol of a leader.
In the photograph on the left, we can see a drawing of a boat, carved into a rock in
Newgrange, in Ireland. In the photo on the right, the same boat can be seen, the contours
of which I have emphasized to aid in understanding the picture.
8. Solar ship from Newgrange, Ireland
In the picture on the right, it can be seen that the carver was very careful to make sure that
the objects reached to the lower line, the outline of the boat, which can be easily
distinguished separately from them.
First of all, I state that we are not talking of a sail-boat here, but a flat-bottomed row-boat,
which was no longer than 5-6 meters. This boat is not Egyptian, but it is the river-boat, or
row-boat found in the Carpathian Basin, which is called a “punt” (Hu: ladik).
The symbols on the boat can be deciphered only by using Hungarian or Scythian logic. The
drawing of the body of the boat indicates that we are talking about a flat, shallow river
boat. The vertical lines that do not touch the outline of the boat, which I have indicated
with numbers, represent five people or souls in the language of sailors.
Even today, the Hungarians call the nave, the part of the church in front of the altar, where
the “souls” pray, “the boat” (hajó).
The genius of the carver and his method of thinking on several levels can be sensed in his
representation of the body of the boat. It can be immediately noticed that the boat has no
rudder in the back. It is not needed, because the steersman or navigator is God the Father,
the Creator himself. We can see the body in the back, bent over and holding his two arms
in front of him. His head is drawn as the Sun. In the drawing of the body, the carver has
also indicated a cabin: the two arms are the two walls of the cabin, the back is the top of
the cabin. What is the purpose of the cabin? It protects us from the inclement weather. This



142
is a flat-bottomed row-boat with a cabin and two rowers. The rowers are not drawn, just
their two supporting pillars on each side of the boat.
We can decipher the Irish carving in the following way. “Under the protection of God, our
Creator, and, with His help, five Scythian souls fortunately reached shore.” This carving
was made at the location of their landing in Ireland.
Unbelievable as it seems, the flat-bottomed row-boats on the River Tisza in Hungary, after
several thousand years, still look like the one that we see on the carving.
9. Flat-bottomed boat with cabin on the River Tisza
I suggest that the Scythians of the Carpathian Basin be included among the early boat
people.
The comb as a symbol of order (rend-SZER)
Let us continue to examine the SZER- or the “rend-SZER” (system, order). To keep order
between the threads, or the “souls”, the best tool was the comb. The Palóc woman, after
she was married, combed her hair into a topknot on top of her head, indicating that she now
had a husband, she was part of the “system” (rend-SZER) and she would never again appear
on the street with her hair down.



143
10. Sarmatian comb from Tiszagyenda
This is why it was a custom to give combs as wedding-presents. On the picture above can
be seen a Sarmatian comb from Tiszagyenda, from the fifth century B.C.
11. Scottish Menhir



144
In the above picture, a Scottish menhir can be seen. On the lower left side there is a stylized
drawing of the Sarmatian comb seen above. Weddings were held at this stone.
In the upper right corner, a letter S can be seen. The letter S is the second symbol of the
Hungarian word for God: I-S-ten and it indicates the place of origin.247
The explanation of the runic ideogram for S (an upside-down V)
There are many explanations for the origin of our word ISTEN, which have
appeared in books and in the media. These differ from each other quite a bit, but
there is one thing on which they agree: it is an ancient word. In their book: Miről
vallanak a magyar szavak, Magda Fajcsek and Aladár Szende, as well as Vilmos
Dioszegi in his book: Az ősi magyar hitvilág, but particularly the former,
concentrate on the origin of only the first syllable, IS, which also appears in the
Halotti Beszéd248, in the word “isemüket”, an ancient form of the Hungarian word
“ősünket” (our ancestors). They all attribute the word IS to the entire word ISTEN
(GOD), as a variation of the Hungarian word „ős”. They do not consider the last
syllable: TEN. 249 (Forrai Sándor)
It has not occurred to many researchers that the people of the Linear Band Keramik culture
expressed ideas in their wavy lines, and that it is a script and not a decoration. In the English
language territory, it is known as zig-zag symbols.
247 The Celts of the Roman times may have interchangeably used the runic sign for S and the Latin letter S.
(Translator) 248 The Halotti Beszéd (1192-1195) is a Funeral Sermon and Prayer, considered to be the earliest Hungarian text written in the Latin script. (Translator)

145
12. Design on a Bronze Age pot from Csólyospálos
I have outlined in color those Latin letters that could have originated from the ancient
people of the Carpathian Basin, who spoke Hungarian. It is not accidental that the word for
“one” in English is A. We shall see later that a similar runic sign is used to represent the
movement of the Sun. It is not accidental that, in the runic script, the Latin V is the M sign
and it is not accidental that the English word for woman begins with a W, and the word for
virgin begins with a V. Woman is the one who welcomes and protects. These concepts
entered the English language with the Scythians or Scythicized Celts in several waves.
13. A Scythian warrior prepares his bow for the battle
Today there is no question that a boxer or a martial artist would not wear a recipe from a
cook-book on his clothing, but symbols that represent his individual characteristics.
Similarly, the Scythian archer wears symbols on his shoulder, which can only be
deciphered with the Hungarian language; other languages would call them just zig-zag
symbols; however, they can only be deciphered with the runic script of the Carpathian
Basin. On the basis of the symbols, we can establish that this is a warrior, belonging to one
or other Scythian people, whose creator was the Sun and whose mother was the Moon. On
the lower picture, the symbol is magnified and emphasized.
If we look at the runic sign for S, then we will see a sign that appears to be two hands
joined in prayer – or an upside-down V.



146
14. Bronze Age pots and the runic sign for S
It can be seen on the pots that the runic sign for S, in a repetitive form, is a basic element
of the writing that is known as linear decoration.
I believe that the runic sign for S is a stylized representation of the Sun’s journey through
the sky.
15. Explanation of the runic sign for S. (My own illustration)
From the religion of our ancestors, we know that, for the reproduction of a third person, a
male and a female entity are necessary. In Hungarian, this female entity is called the Earth
Mother, who is considered to be a virgin and is represented in the form of the Moon. The
exchange of positions of the Sun and the Moon can be seen on the ceramics in what are
called linear decorations. This is none other than the Heavenly Way (the Milky Way) or
the Triumphal Way.



147
When a Hungarian man takes a wife in the eyes of God, in Hungarian he takes another half:
FELESÉG. According to the linguistic rules imposed on us by the Germans, this word can
be divided into syllables: fe-le-ség. This has no meaning, because the Hungarian word
FELE is an independent root-word, which means half of something. Half of the ideogram
for S represents the female concept in Heaven, and this is the Hungarian word FELESÉG.
Our word FEL-S-ÉG also indicates a heavenly origin, from the Triumphal Way.
16. Explanation of the Hungarian word: sors (fate) (My own illustration)
„S” jelek = “S” signs
Sorban az „S” jelek = SORS (“S” signs in a line = SORS = fate, destiny)
atya = father; nő = woman
Nap = sun; hold = moon
By analyzing the Hungarian word FELESÉG from right to left, (ÉG-S-FELE) we see that
it reads: “from the sky toward the S”, which means that the choice of the female partner
takes place in Heaven, in other words, it is the will of God. In my illustration, the word
SORS (fate, destiny) can be seen. This means days and nights continuously following each
other, which have previously been determined.
From the facts presented above, the meaning of our word-root I-S is “Szár (mazik, ered) a
Hadak Útjáról”, “Originates from the Triumphal Way”.
The Palóc women, even today, still follow this more than a thousand-year-old logic in their
embroidery.



148
17. Palóc embroidery
Therefore, I state that the runic S sign is a Scythian-Celtic sign for the Triumphal Way.
The reader may be familiar with the name: Vercingetorix. This name, the name of a Gallic
leader, has been preserved on coins. On the coin, which appears below, the name seems to
have been misspelled. It appears as Vercingetorixs. In my opinion, the name on the coin is
not misspelled. The S letter has an important meaning, for it is a qualifying adjective.
18. Coin with head of Vercingetorix
Has nobody yet noticed this slip? The inscriptions of the Celts are filled with such
inconsistencies. The letter „S” can also be found in the hair of Vercingetorix. Of course it



149
should be there, since the meaning of the sign is „divine leader”. This indicates the place
of origin of Vercingetorix. The S symbol is the Carpathian Basin representation of the
Triumphal Way. He was born to be a leader.
19. A stater of Vercingetorix
On this coin is the proof of what I am stating. The image of Vercingetorix is on this coin,
with the letter S on his forehead, indicating his divine origin. It is not true that the Celts
had more than 400 gods. They worshiped a god and a goddess. They named them according
to their divine manifestation. Behind the names was God, the Creator. Such manifestations
were Ogmios, the eloquent; Toranis, the avenger; Teutates etc. The Picts took this culture
with them out of the Carpathian Basin, through Gaul to the present lands of Scotland,
Ireland and Wales.250 If you can accept my explanation, then it will soon become clear why
the battle horns of the Celts are shaped like an S.
250A British historian, the Venerable Bede, states that the Picts came from Scythia and were refused permission to settle in Ireland. They went to Britain, he wrote, where they were offered wives by the Scots and then began the occupation of northern Scotland. Bede’s Ecclesiastical History of England, London, 1907, p. 20. translated by A. M. Sellar (Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum) (Translator)



150
20. Battle-horns of the Celts (carnix), in the form of an S
With these horns, the free Celtic warriors were called to battle, and together they prayed to
God, who lived in the Triumphal Way, for his mercy. Continuing my line of logic, I present the reason for the ritual bending of the swords of the Celts. Julius Caesar, in his work: De
Bello Gallica, writes disparagingly about the poor quality of the Celtic swords. He writes:
“The Celts are forced to their knees in battle, because of the inferior quality of their
swords.” I would not expect any other opinion from the man who became famous for the
Roman massacres. He writes this of the people who were called “the people of iron”. He
probably knew the real reason for the bending of the swords, but he lied, which was not for
the first time. He did not see the swords being straightened out, but being bent into the
shape of an S. The Celts took with them into battle their sacrificial swords, which had not
been heat-treated. In the village of Ludas, not far from where I live, a Celtic settlement was
excavated 7-8 years ago. The bones showed traces of a fierce battle. They fought alongside
the Scythian inhabitants against the invading enemy. Historians write about Scythicized
Celts in many places in the Carpathian Basin.



151
21. Celtic sword bent into the shape of an „S” /Ludas/
There was a reason why they bent the sword into the shape of an „S” during the battle.
After it was bent, the sword was placed onto the chest of the fallen warrior. This was
nothing more than a message. They were prepared that none of the warriors would survive
the battle. There would be nobody to report who fought valiantly. With this sword, they
gave the message to the widows who would later walk through the battlefield. The soul of
the warrior would be in the Triumphal Way, where it would live in the form of a new bright
star. In this way they gave him the appropriate final honors.
The S-shaped sign is represented on the clothes of the Hungarians, and also on their pots.
Everything that they eat, or wear is given to them by God, so they should give him thanks.
It is not only the Hungarians who wear the sign of God, but the Scots do too. I know what
the rhombus-shaped symbols on the kilt signify.



152
23a. Northern Hungarian „Palóc” embroidery designs 23b. Celtic jug
In the Hungarian designs, the wavy lines in the form of an S are interchangeably blue and
red. Just as in the Triumphal Way, or in the sky, the sun and the moon interchange their
paths eternally. (. . .)
24. Neolithic symbol from Ireland



153
25. The S symbol from the Carpathian Basin
I could list those symbols which the “unknown sailors” left behind them on the shores of
northern Scotland and also in Ireland. Those early sailors belonged to the Scythian culture,
which today we call Magyar, and the world recognizes as Hun, who spoke the language
that we Hungarians speak today. The Celts learned from us and used the ancient S runic
symbol and the Latin variation.
26. Drawing on a Celtic medallion
Hungarians, even today, if something is not certain, give it a number (KÉT = two) followed
by an S sign. This word is KÉT-S = két-es (doubtful) (TWO-S) or „ké-tes”. The latter
(modern) hyphenation is absolutely illogical, for it has no meaning.



154
27. Celtic medallions
On these Celtic medallions, my logic is very clear. On the right side of the medallion on
the left, the runic S signs can be seen one under the other, in other words the Hungarian
word SORS (fate) can be seen with the exchange of the Sun and the Moon. On the
medallion on the right this same concept is represented, using the Latin letter S. From the
belly of the horse, three lines are drawn toward the S. This is our symbol for E, with the
meaning of “the Most High”. I cannot go into detail due to space limitations. However, we
can state that Scythians and Celts used the ideogram S to indicate the Triumphal Way.
The meaning of the Hungarian word TEN
Since I am basically mostly involved with the research of the Celts – because of my own Celtic origin – I was excited to read the book by Sándor Timaru-Kast: Kelta magyarok,
magyar kelták (Celtic Magyars, Magyar Celts). I believe, as I expressed above, that the
Celts of the British Isles took the pictographic system and their language made up of
Hungarian words, or rather word-roots, from their ancient home in the Carpathian Basin.
In this language, the root-word TEN can be found, but let us not get ahead of ourselves.
They do not examine the root-word TEN. Its equivalent in Sumerian is DINGIR, in
Turkish TINGIR, in Mongol TENGRI, and its meaning is infinity, soul, spirit,
Heaven or GOD. Here I would like to note that it is interesting that the Sumerian
cuneiform sign D, which originated from a pictograph, is phonetically equivalent
to the Magyar runic sign for D, which is , whereas in other runic scripts, it can
be found but with a different pronunciation. One version for the name of GOD
(ISTEN) in the Turkish ancient religion was “tan-ri”. The refrain of a Turkish
Anatolian folk song is: “In the name of Tanri, to horse, to battle! Do not forget that
Atilla is your ancient father!” The Chinese name for God was “tien” and the
Japanese use “ten” or “tenno” which was the name for the Emperor, who was the
representation of God. In Etruscan, it was “tin” or “tinia”.251 (Forrai Sándor)
The exposé of the TAN-TEN word-root in the above mentioned languages is very logical.
None of these languages gives us a concrete explanation of the meaning of the word. Let
251 Forrai Sándor: Az Isten szavunk eredete, jelentése és a történelmi háttér p. 2. rovasiras.uw.hu/forrai.doc



155
me make up for this lack by quoting from the Scythicized Celtic language the exact
meaning of the surviving TAN-TEN word-root.
28. Univerzum Magazine, No: 78/4252
On the first page of a three-part article I noticed a very interesting sentence, which the Celts
of Cornwall wrote in their own language: Tan y’n cunys lemmyn gor uskys, meaning: Now light the cremation fire. It can be found on the right side above the picture. I know
very little of the language of the people of Cornwall but it must be similar to the Scottish
Gaelic language and to the language of the Celts of Wales. The Welsh equivalent of the
Hungarian TŰZ (fire) is the word TÂN, which is pronounced TAN in Welsh.
If we accept that the word-root TAN-TEN means fire, then the word I-S-TEN means
“originates in the fire from the Triumphal Way.” This means that we refer to the Father of
everything, who comes from the Sun to Earth, in other words the GOD of the Magyars.
Logically then, the afore-mentioned Japanese expression “tenno” takes its place here, as
the Japanese honor their Emperor as a God, and the symbol of God is the fiery sun which
they still use today on their flag.
We can form numerous words with the word-root TEN or TAN. In Hungarian, we call the
laws of God, TAN. We call a dance – single or double –TÁN-C. The teacher who teaches
us about the world is called TAN-ÁR or TAN-Í-T-Ó in Hungarian, and from the ancient
252 Universum magazine. No. 78/4. p. 3 ISSN 0502-6874. Published by the Kossuth Publishers. Hungarian Translation of an article by Merle Severy which appeared in the National Geographic.



156
word-root originates the Hungarian word TEN-G-ERI, referring to the sunny yellow color
of the corn. I could list many more words.
As we have mentioned before, the symbol I means origin (SZÁR), the symbol S indicates
the Triumphal Way, and TEN means God the Creator stepping down to Earth from the
Sun. Thus another symbol is understandable, also from Newgrange.
29. Sun Symbol in a chamber at Newgrange
I believe these symbols to be Scythian, and their meaning is “holy God”.
What I have presented so far have been similarities between symbols from Ireland and the
Carpathian Basin. I state that the early inhabitants took over all these from the Scythians,
(Magyars) and altered them according to their own taste. To crown my logic, I have saved
the fact that part of the proto-writing found in Ireland can be deciphered and understood,
following my logic.



157
30. Proto-writing in Ireland and Scotland
First of all, I call your attention to the symbols in the line marked B. Earlier, I gave my
decipherment of this symbol, the concept of the Triumphal Way. Therefore, the Sun (runic
symbol S) can be considered a male concept and the Moon (W-V-M) a female concept.
Above the female symbol is a little vertical line, indicating the genital passage.
I have already given the decipherment of the symbol, which is indicated by line C. Now let
me explain the first part of the symbol indicated by D.
This writing can be found in Northern Scotland, in a building in the region of Skara Brae,
carved above a bed.



158
So, from right to left are carved the runic symbols for SZ. M. S. T. SZ, which in Hungarian
is: SZEMET SE TESZ ... meaning: “not even close the eyes”. Therefore, the person was
not able to go to sleep. This is why the writing is above a bed. The only difference is that
the branch on the runic symbol for “t” is on the opposite side from that used today. The
decipherment of the rest of the text will be a task for experts who are more skilled than I
am.
31. Palóc embroidery
The double-points separate ideas here as they do in carving.
I believe that, when these carvings appeared on stone, they indicated numbers in a different
way than they do today. The concept of numbers was expressed with ideograms. Since five
sailors arrived on the coast of Ireland, it is not surprising that the carvings on the Brodgar
Stone contain five symbols. In the table presented above, among the symbols in the E
group, I call your attention to the sixth and seventh symbol, because Scythians, speaking
the Hungarian language, left these carvings.
32. Explanation of the word „ötös” (five-man)



159
The runic sign for S is repeated five times beneath each other between two lines. This
represents five sailors, sitting behind one another. The two vertical lines are the two sides
of the boat.
Even today, when we refer to a boat with several paddlers, we talk of a KAJAK KETTES
(two-man kayak) or KENU NÉGYES (four-man canoe) to indicate the number of paddlers.
Just as on the carving, this was the kind of boat, in which four men were paddling and one
was steering, and it was called an ÖTÖS HAJÓ (a five-man boat)
When a Hungarian wants to state that, in addition to himself, there are four other men in a
group, he says: ÖTÖD MAGAMMAL VAGYOK. (There are five men, including myself).
Following the logic of the carved boat in representing the concept of five, I would represent
the concept of ÖTÖD MAGAMMAL (five, including myself) by drawing two vertical lines
and within them five runic D symbols.
33. Explanation of the concept of „ötöd” (five including myself)
This is the last symbol in the E group on the table. Across one vertical center line, there are
five slanting lines. The Hungarian runic sign for D is a vertical line with one slanting line
across it. This sign joined with four others represents the five and the sign D in the same
pictograph. So, the meaning of the symbol is ÖTÖT AD (it gives five) following the logic
of ÖTÖD MAGARA (five including oneself). The symbol represents five sailors.
Naturally there are many symbols in Scotland that may be deciphered on the basis of my
logic, because every, and I emphasize every sailor, who spoke Hungarian, left them behind.
They were the first who, in five-person, unstable, wide, flat-bottomed boats, made maps of
the shores of Ireland and Scotland. They were the ones, who before the appearance of the
Vikings, drew the first maps. I found a symbol in Scotland, which expresses a similar name
as in Hungarian, and leaves no doubt about the meanings of the symbols that I have already
deciphered. On the basis of the comparisons that I have introduced in this study, I suggest
that the scientific standpoint on the Scythians and the Finno-Ugric origin of the Magyars



160
be re-examined. We Hungarians are the descendants of the Scythians, those Scythians, who
worshiped the Sun as their creator and the Moon as their birth-mother.

ABOUT THE AUTHORS
MARGARET BOTOS
I was born in Bridgend, South Wales on April 20, 1939. I obtained a B.A. in French and
German from the University of Wales, Cardiff, in 1961 and my M.A. in Comparative
Literature from the University of Rochester, NY in 1975. I traveled to Canada in 1964,
where I met my husband, László, who was a freedom-fighter in 1956, who had fled to
Canada. We were married in 1966 and we have two children and six grandchildren. I
worked as a teacher for many years and later as a social-worker. We now live in a small
village in New York State.
I helped my husband first with the translation of Dr. Sándor Nagy’s book, A Magyar nép
kialakulásának története, which was published as: The Forgotten Cradle of the Hungarian
Culture in 1973; then with various translations for Dr. Ferenc Badiny-Jós and Dr. Sándor
Csőke. I also translated Corvin köz, 1956 (Corvin Circle, 1956) by the leader of the freedom
fighters, Gergely Pongrátz, which was never published. In 1995, we published The
Homeland Reclaimed, and in 1996 Hazatérés. In 2000, we published The Road to the
Dictated Peace followed by Út a Trianoni Békeparancshoz. In 2005, we established the
Magyarságtudományi Intézet (Institute of Hungarian Studies) www.magtudin.org in order
to publish on the Internet works which have been ignored or unpublished, in both
Hungarian and English, and Hungarian books which are out of print, in order to further the
research of Hungarian studies. In 2008, I helped my husband with editing
Magyarságtudományi Tanulmányok and, with the help of Susan Tomory and others, I
translated it as Selected Studies in Hungarian History. These last two books were published
by the World Federation of Hungarians.
I became interested in Celtic studies after reading a book by Sándor Timaru Kast, Kelta
Magyarok, Magyar Kelták, which I translated. (The translation is as yet unpublished.)

SÁNDOR TIMARU-KAST
My field of research is the Celtic world and, within this, the question of the Celtic-Magyar
relationship. I started to work regularly in this field in 1994. I gave my first lecture on this



163
subject, in 1995, at a Conference on Ancient History in Tapolca, at the Zűrich Magyar
Historical Association’s summer-camp. I was offered membership in the fall of that year,
and I have been a member of the ZMTE (Zürichi Magyar Történelmi Egyesület) since that
time.
1995–1998: I delivered lectures on ancient history at the meetings of the ZMTE.
At the International Conference entitled „Our Eastern Roots”, October 29–31 1999, to
commemorate the 215th anniversary of the birth of Sándor Kőrösi Csoma, I first presented
my lecture entitled Celtic Magyars, Magyar Celts.
Further lectures concerning the Celtic-Magyar relationship were held between 2000 and
2007 in Budapest, Frankfurt, Szentendre, Marosvásárhely, and Győr (with several returns),
and also Szabadka, Kecskemét and Hódmezővásárhely.

LÁSZLÓ BOTOS
I was born on January 3, 1935 in Simontornya, Hungary. I grew up in Újpest but finished
my public school in Bercel, Nógrád County and Budapest. Due to a football accident I
could not continue my education for years, because of constant headaches and strong
dizziness. This is why I enrolled in the Mátyás Rákosi Technical College in Csepel, as an
industrial student.
After a long recuperative period, lasting for years, I underwent an operation, which was
second in the world, conducted by the three most famous brain surgeons of the country. I
was able to fulfill my dreams, as far as sports are concerned, in the Kayak-Canoe
Association of the Budapest Builders Association, which gave me back my self
confidence, after such a long period. In September, 1956, I was selected to be a member of
the Hungarian Kayak-Canoe Junior National Team. After the fall of the 1956 Freedom
Fight, I fled from retribution, through Yugoslavia, first to Italy and then to Canada.
During the bitter years of homelessness, I began to study the origin and history of the
Hungarian nation. I felt a need to refute the deliberate falsification of Hungarian history
and to participate and contribute – with my meager resources – in making known the true
history of the Hungarians. Our first undertaking was the translation into English of a book
by Dr. Sándor Nagy, entitled A magyar nép kialakulásának története – the history of the
development of the Magyar people. My wife, who was born in Wales, helped with the
translation. The book was published under the title: The Forgotten Cradle of the Hungarian
Culture. After this we translated Gergely Pongrátz’ book Corvinköz. (Corvin Circle ’56)
We have translated for the linguists, Dr. Ferenc Badiny-Jós and Sándor Csőke. We also
translated many petitions and information books.
In 1995-1996, I published my books: The Homeland Reclaimed, and Hazatérés. These
were followed, in 2000-2001, by the The Road to the Dictated Peace and its Hungarian
version Út a Trianoni Békeparancshoz. Both of my books received a gold medal from the
Árpád Académy in Cleveland. I collected the necessary materials for the books for ten
years, during my lunch hours, and waiting for my children at their karate, swimming and
piano classes. In 2005, I initiated the organization of the Magyarságtudományi Intézet
Institute of Hungarian Studies. On its website, www.magtudin.org we publish scholarly



165
studies in two languages from authors who are shunned by the MTA – the Hungarian
Academy of Sciences in Budapest.
In 2008, I edited the bi-lingual publication of the Magyarságtudományi tanulmányok
Selected Studies in Hungarian History, which contains articles by many scholars about the
ancient history of people speaking agglutinative languages, our connections with them and
their spread from the Carpathian Basin. This was published by the World Federation of
Hungarians in Budapest.

SUSAN TOMORY
I was born on September 11, 1930 in Budapest. I spent my early childhood in Majsa
Miklósvár in Tolna County. We moved later to Dombóvár, where I lived until my high
school graduation. During World War II, we fled to Bavaria and lived there for almost a
year as refugees. Returning home to Soviet-occupied Hungary, I struggled for livelihood
under the double burden of being a „class foreigner”, and „having been in the West” – both
were unacceptable in those years. I lived in Budapest during the 1956 Revolution and
Freedom Fight. I crossed the Hungarian border to Austria on November 27, 1956, and came
to the USA. I married and became the mother of three children. My American-born
children are bi-lingual; all speak Hungarian. I have one grandson.
The most influential person in my life was Adorján Magyar, linguist, ethnographer and
artist. It is through him I learned about the ancient European origin of our people, the
Magyars, and their culture-building role in this sphere. I strive to further these studies even
today and to share them with all, who are interested in this subject.
My studies and qualifications:
Számviteli Főiskola Budapest, chartered accountant, 1952;
Szt. László Hospital Budapest, School of Nursing, 1955;
Nursing degree in the State of Illinois in 1972, Certified Gerontological Nurse, 1989;
University of Connecticut 1957–58;
Harvard University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Sumerian/Akkadian language
studies 1963–64;
Due to political restrictions in Communist-occupied Hungary and financial restrictions
in the USA, most of my education has been informal.
Job experience: I was employed as the Director of Nursing in retirement and nursing
homes until my retirement.
I organized a weekend Hungarian School for 60 children, to teach Hungarian culture/ history/language and rovás (runic) writing.
Writings: Books, articles and lectures in the field of
religion/language/ethnography/ancient history. I was also the founder-editor of the bi
lingual Journal of Hungarian Studies. Today the Institute of Hungarian Studies continues
this work.

KLÁRA FRIEDRICH
I was born in 1948 in Budapest. My father’s ancestors were teachers in Bars County, my
mother’s were farmers in Tolna County. I was striving for a degree in Art History, but I was
declared a „clerical reactionary” and, for this reason, I was refused admission to University
three times. Therefore, I chose to become a children’s speech-therapist (logopedist). I worked
in this field for 34 years, and loved helping children with special needs. I learned the rovás
(runic) script from my father, and I started to research it as an adult. I received a lot of help
in this field from my husband, Gábor Szakács. We have written several books and pieces of
music together. We have one child who lives and works in the U.S.A. as an engineer.
My works are the following:
– Múltunk szétgurult gyöngyszemei (1994) – Roga koronája (1997) – Tanuljuk és tanítsuk rovásírást (1998) – Rovásírás gyakorlatok nem csak gyerekeknek (2000) – Attila ifj úsága (2002) – Rovásírás tankönyv és szakköri ötlettár (2004) – Roga királyfi (2004) – Rovásírás játék nem csak gyerekeknek (2005)
Works co-authored by Klára Friedrich and Gábor Szakács:
– Kárpát- medencei birtoklevelünk a rovásírás (2003) Kőbe vésték, fába rótták (2005) – Tászok-tetőtől a Bosnyák piramisokig (2007)
– Attila ifjúsága and Pogány imák (lyrics of the songs)

DR. LÁSZLÓ KÁROLY MARÁCZ
László Károly Marácz was born in 1960 in the city of Utrecht, Holland to parents who were
refugees following the Freedom Fight of 1956. The memories of the events of 1956 made a
deep impression on the family and they determined to preserve the Hungarian language and
culture. He graduated from the University of Utrecht with a Master’s degree in Philosophy,
summa cum laude. As a second-year student, he translated into Dutch a novel by Ferenc Sánta:
Az ötödik pecsét. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Groningen in 1989. His
doctoral thesis was written in English: „Asymmetries in Hungarian”. Between 1990 and



167
1992, as a recipient of the Nielsen-Stensen Scholarship, he conducted research at MIT in
Boston, USA, as a “visiting scientist”. He delivered lectures at American and Canadian uni
versities on the subject of the Hungarian language and grammar. Since 1992, he has been a
professor at Eastern European Institute of Amsterdam University, where he teaches the
Hungarian language and history and presently lectures on Central European politics.
Since 1995, he has been occupied with Hungarian-Dutch connections. He is working on
Hungarian-Dutch co-operation in the field of education. In connection with this he has
published a series of books, under the auspices of the Teleki László Central European
Institute. (For example: Magyar tükör – segédkönyv a hungarológiai oktatásához. 1995) At
the request of the Hungarian and Dutch police chiefs, he is evaluating the collaboration
between the Hungarian and Dutch police forces. (See: Dr. L. K. Marácz: Evaluative Survey,
1993–1995. Police Partnership Programme, The Netherlands – Hungary, p. 62.). In 1998, the
European Cultural Foundation asked him to edit a book about the integration of Central
Europe (see: László Marácz: Expanding European Unity, Central and Eastern Europe.
Yearbook of European Studies, Annuaire d’Études Européennes nr. 11, Amsterdam – At
lanta, GA, 1999, p. 171. )
In recent years, Dr. Marácz has been researching the structure of the vocabulary of the
Hungarian language, the system of word-roots, the origin of the Hungarian language and the
renewal of the Hungarian language. He believes that the Hungarian language was formed in
dependently and was not tied to the Finno-Ugric relationship. According to László Marácz the
renewal of the Hungarian language is basic to the renewal of the Hungarian people. In 1996,
he received the Bocskai prize for his dedication to the Hungarian people and his work on behalf
of the Transylvanian Magyars. He was honored in 2001 with the title of „Knight of the
Hungarian Culture” „for his work in the research of the Hungarian language and the European
Integration.” In 2005, he received the Gold Cross of the Hungarian Republic for his work on
behalf of Hungarian Culture. In 2007, his latest book was published: Magyar újjászületés
Politikai emelkedésekek Közép-Európáról.

ISTVÁN VALLUS
I was born on December 2, 1966, in Ózd, an industrial city in Hungary. I was trained to be
an electrician, but I have also worked as a steel-worker and driver, and unfortunately, after
the closure of the factory in Ózd, I became unemployed. Then I joined the police-force,
where I served for 16 years.
I climbed up the ranks and, from a policeman on the beat, I became a criminal investigator
and then a commanding officer. The highest level of education I achieved was the Police
Academy, where I learned investigative methods and applied them in my own life. I do not
have a background in history, but I do not consider this a disadvantage.
Eight years ago, I accidentally learned that theTreveri Gauls lived in the valley of the
Moselle River at one time, and they called their plough the „vallus”, which is my family
name. At that time, I began to research the Celts, particularly the Treveri tribe. I noticed
that there were many similarities between the Celtic culture and the Magyar culture,
although, according to official historiography, these two cultures do not have much in
common.
I retired in 2008 and was able to spend more time on research. Using my logic, I came upon
a very ancient system, on the basis of which I can offer explanations that may be accepted
or may serve as subject of debate. I offer decipherments of the symbols found on megaliths
in Ireland and Scotland, and their counterparts in the Carpathian Basin. I am deciphering
more and more symbols all the time. I have not yet published my results. God has given
me a wonderful partner in the person of my wife, Andrea, who has given me two beautiful
children, my 16-year-old son, Balázs, and my 11-year-old daughter, Emilia.
