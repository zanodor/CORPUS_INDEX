Palgrave Historical Studies in Witchcraft and Magic



The history of European witchcraft and magic continues to fascinate and challenge students and scholars. There is certainly no shortage of books on the subject. Several general surveys of the witch trials and numerous regional and micro studies have been published for an English-speaking readership. While the quality of publications on witchcraft has been high, some regions and topics have received less attention over the years. The aim of this series is to help illuminate these lesser known or little studied aspects of the history of witchcraft and magic. It will also encourage the development of a broader corpus of work in other related areas of magic and the supernatural, such as angels, devils, spirits, ghosts, folk healing and divination. To help further our understanding and interest in this wider history of beliefs and practices, the series will include research that looks beyond the usual focus on Western Europe and that also explores their relevance and influence from the medieval to the modern period. ‘A valuable series.’—Magic, Ritual and Witchcraft

This volume provides a selection of studies on witchcraft and demonology by the members of an interdisciplinary research group that was constituted thirty years ago and has been continuously functioning ever since; recently it gained new momentum thanks to an European Research Council (ERC) grant.1 The complex history of witch beliefs, witchcraft prosecutions and demonologies in Hungary2 provided the focus for the inquiries of the research group consisting of anthropologists, folklorists and historians, and this is the central domain of the presently working, enlarged new research group as well.3 The enlarged new group has a broader agenda: its anthropological and historical investigations intend to examine the phenomena and the folkloristic representations of religion by contrasting the historical documentation to insights gained from contemporary fieldwork.

the researCh agenda
Our historical inquiries are based on the analysis of the published and unpublished documentation of early modern witchcraft prosecutions, demonological treatises, sermons and other related sources of religious history. One of the most important dimensions of our work has been the discovery and editing for publication of unpublished archival documents. After complementing the two existing large source collections of witch trials in the Kingdom of Hungary (the ones by Andor Komáromy and Ferenc Schram4) by assembling minor source editions from the previous two centuries,5 we started a systematic exploration of Hungarian, Transylvanian and Slovakian archives. Over the past three decades we have published about 6000 pages of judicial protocols of witch trials of various regions of the Kingdom of Hungary6 and of the five cities Nagybánya (Baia Mare),7 Segesvár (Sighişoara, Schäßburg),8 Sopron (Ödenburg),9 Kolozsvár (Cluj-Napoca)10 and Szeged.11 Péter Tóth G. prepared an inventory of all these documents, ordering them according to local and chronological criteria.12 As for our contemporary anthropological fieldwork, it is done principally in tradition-bound, closed communities from the contact zones between Hungarians and Romanians in Transylvania.13 The two sets of data mutually complement and illuminate each other. The present volume provides a representative selection of our work for the international academic community, and at the same time offers a detailed documentation of the research results on a region which has been frequently ignored for linguistic reasons. No up-to-date overview of the history of witchcraft beliefs, prosecutions and their persistence till our times in Hungary and the neighboring countries is available to international readers. The books and studies by the two editors have offered glimpses into witchcraft in Hungary,14 but a synthetic overview is still missing—unlike in Poland and Russia, where several monographs have been published on this theme recently.15 We examined the role of witchcraft prosecutions from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, and the persisting role of witchcraft beliefs in contemporary peasant communities. This had to be compared to the ‘official’ views of church authorities and the judicial procedures of secular courts. We dedicated special attention to the universe of popular witchcraft beliefs, as an explanation of misfortune and a system of norms and sanctions, regulating behavior in the religious worldview of village and

urban communities. We researched the social background of witchcraft accusations, the waves of persecutions in Hungary, the relevant legal mechanisms and the activities of witch-finders. We investigated the broad influence of Catholic and Protestant demonology and the confrontation of elite and popular views of the powers of Satan. We tried to reconstruct the role of cunning folk, magical specialists, healers, and ‘seers’ in what could be called the ‘magical marketplace’. Our inquiries focussed mostly on the beliefs of the Hungarian population in the Carpathian Basin, the territory of one-time historical Hungary, with special attention to Transylvania. The field work we carried out in the past several years has shown that this border zone of eastern and western Christianity constitutes at the same time the eastern borderline of the western and central European type of institutional witch-hunting, so-to-say its last bastion towards the East. Large territories of Eastern Europe were devoid of such institutional witchcraft prosecutions, and we can witness here the presence and the persistence of a different type of witchcraft beliefs.

It might be useful to provide here a brief overview of the basic historical framework of the subject treated by the studies in this volume. Like in many other countries, after some sporadic data on a few medieval cases of legislating against or punishing witchcraft or sorcery, in Hungary the beginning of large-scale witchcraft prosecutions comes in the sixteenth century, somewhat later than in western Europe mostly in the last decades. This was a troubled period in Hungarian history. The Hungarians suffered a fatal defeat by the Ottoman troops in 1526 at Mohács, and subsequently a third of the country came under Turkish occupation for 150 years. The Hungarian throne was inherited by the Habsburgs; the northern and the western parts of the country were under their rule. The Eastern third of the kingdom, Transylvania, became a semiautonomous principality, under the influence of the Ottoman Empire. Wars of religion did not spare the country, where Reformation won many supporters. Transylvanian princes took part in the 30 years’ War on the Protestant side. Lutherans were especially popular in the Saxon towns of Transylvania and Zipser towns of Northern Hungary (present day Slovakia). In the capital of Transylvania, Kolozsvár (Cluj-Napoca),

all Reformation confessions were present, and for some time the most radical Unitarians had an important influence. Calvinists had a significant centre on the Great Hungarian plain, Debrecen. At the same time ‘Counter-Reformation’ was promoted in the Habsburg-dominated territories of the Hungarian Kingdom. The first series of witch trials show up in an urban environment, in Transylvanian Kolozsvár (Cluj-Napoca)16 in Debrecen17 and in west Hungarian Sopron.18 In the first half of the seventeenth century these persecutions subsequently extended to the mostly Saxon towns in Transylvania, such as Segesvár (Schäßburg, Sighişoara),19 and to most important cities and towns in the northern part of Hungary, under Habsburg rule, such as Pozsony (Bratislava), Kassa (Košice), or Nagybánya (Baia Mare).20 At the same time, witchcraft prosecutions showed up everywhere in the countryside as well, promoted by feudal courts or initiated by officials of the county administration. A special group of trials, in western Hungary, were initiated against shepherds. And the witch trials did not spare the nobility or the higher aristocracy and were related to courtly intrigues. There were also a few trials in the territories under Ottoman rule, but their inhabitants were mostly spared from this kind of persecutions. While the peak of large scale witch-hunting in Germany, England, France or Spain was at the end of the sixteenth century and during the first half of the seventeenth century, in Hungary this intensification came somewhat later, after 1686, when the entire country was reoccupied from the Ottomans. Two thirds of all witch trials in the territory of the Hungarian Kingdom occurred between 1690 and 1768, at which point Empress Maria Theresa forbade them.21 It was this period which saw the most deadly witch-panic in Hungary: the persecutions in Szeged around 1728.22 A brief statistical summary: currently we have knowledge of 2275 trials, where 4263 ‘witches’ came to be accused (among them 3673 women and 590 men), and we have data on 702 death sentencesbut in many cases the documents are incomplete.23 Historical research on Hungarian witchcraft beliefs and prosecutions has been evolving in the past decades with a combination of inquiries into legal, political and social history with a historical anthropological exploration of archaic beliefs and mythologies (fairies, ambivalent sorcerers, healers, seers, táltos).24 Hungarian data have been involved in more general controversies on the relation of shamanism and witchcraft.25 Beside the analysis of the popular theme of the demonological elements

of the witches’ Sabbath,26 the interest of some of the members of our research group turned towards the structure of bewitchment narratives, the dynamism of witchcraft accusation and healing, as well as towards the ambivalent activities of cunning folk.27
an overvieW of the voLume
The selection of the essays in the current volume provides a representative sample of these studies. Five studies are translated from a similar collection of studies that the two editors have published in Hungarian with the title “Witches, Sorcerers and Demons in East-Central Europe,”28 rewritten to suit an international audience. In addition, we have included the translation of a chapter from a monograph on Debrecen by Ildikó Kristóf,29 a translation of a study by Éva Pócs30 and an entirely new study by Ágnes Hesz.
Ildikó Sz. Kristóf: The Social Background of Witchcraft Accusations in Early Modern Debrecen and Bihar County. This study is based on a substantial chapter of the author’s book published in Hungarian.31 The book examines witch-hunting in Bihar county and in Debrecen between 1575 and 1766. During this period, altogether 217 trials were conducted against 303 accused. In this urban community and its surroundings, witchcraft accusations tended to appear in situations where the “dangerous liaisons” within the community got multiplied in the microcontext of a structured group: a family or more broadly the inhabitants of a house, neighborhood, street, or the clientele of a healer. Witchcraft charges derived most often from dense everyday conflicts and acute tensions in the communities: the institutionalization of medicine and social care in the city of Debrecen and the rearrangement of privileges among the local gentry in Bihar county. Calvinist demonology, although it regarded the worldly interventions of the devil to be of limited effect, urged the expurgation of sorcery and magic, so suspicion fell primarily on the practitioners of benevolent magic (popular healers, midwives, diviners). This article also deals with the relationship between witchcraft accusations and the narrative accounts given of them, the latter being interpretative schemes for the explanation of misfortune.
László Pakó: Witchcraft, Greed and Revenge: The Prosecutor Activity of György Igyártó and the Witch Trials of Kolozsvár in the 1580s. This study is about a corrupt and selfish procurator in Kolozsvár (Cluj) who stepped up as a defender of law and public morality and brought to court with



6 G. KLANICZAy AND É. PóCS
witchcraft accusations a woman, Anna Rengő, who became notorious as an instigator of Carnival and charivari. This detailed research on the conflicts around this procurator provide an insight into the judicial life in Kolozsvár in the late sixteenth century.
Gábor Klaniczay: Healers in Hungarian Witch Trials. This essay examines witch trial documents from Kolozsvár (Cluj), Hódmezővásárhely and Kiskunhalas, completing them with a series of representative examples from Hungary and Europe. He discusses how healers, as ‘magical experts’, provide the diagnosis of bewitchment by means of divinatory processes, shaping the suspicions of the alleged victim into an accusation against a concrete person, and subsequently they initiate a magical counter-action against the presumed witch. The inevitable consequence of the healers’ participation in these trials was that they became victims of witchcraft accusations themselves.
Judit Kis-Halas: Divinatio diabolica and Magical Medicine. Healers, Seers and Diviners in Early Modern Nagybánya. The study describes the magical and medical market of early modern Nagybánya (Baia Mare), a miners’ town in North-East Hungary, present-day Romania, as it appears in the narrative context of witchcraft accusations, during one and half centuries, based on the protocols of 55 witch trials in Nagybánya. The author discusses the practising experts and their clientele, the elite and the popular demonology which provided the ideology for witchcraft accusations and with the help of three case studies she offers insights into the processes that led to the witchcraft accusations related to certain magical specialists. She finds that public opinion on witchcraft in Nagybánya was shaped both by Protestant demonology and Catholic views reappearing with the counter-Reformation, while the local set of beliefs also had an important part.
Éva Pócs: Shamanism or Witchcraft? The Táltos Before the Tribunals. The author examines thirty-five táltos (twenty-four women, nine men, a boy and a girl) appearing in the documents of eighteenth-century Hungarian witch trials in the peculiar narrative context of legal proceedings (indictments and testimonies of the accused and the witnesses). The táltos, just like those who were accused of witchcraft, could play a negative or positive role in the local system of witchcraft conflicts according to their actual position: that of the witch or the witch-doctor. The author contrasts their communal roles with the popular beliefs that have surrounded the táltos and with their own conviction of their supernatural capacities. She also considers whether they truly experienced these



INTRODUCTION 7
visions or were merely acting, using their táltos-fame for publicity, fraud and finding money. She also re-examines motifs to which shamanistic characteristics have been attributed by Hungarian scholarship along with those strands of witchcraft research that consider the táltos to be heirs of pagan, Hungarian shamans.
Péter Tóth G.: The Decriminalization of Magic and the Fight Against Superstitions in Hungary and Transylvania 1740–1848. The chapter discusses the period marking the end of the witch-hunt era in the Hungarian Kingdom. It describes the process of decriminalization by mapping power mechanisms, capturing the nature of judicial measures, and examining the criminal activities, social roles, and undesirable behavior of those indicted. The author tries to explain why witchcraft prosecutions ended in the time of the reign of Maria Theresa and also why they continued in some places. The answer to the second question is based on a detailed presentation of the prolonged fight against superstition in Hungary, and the special features of this region, both from the point of view of cultural and judicial history.
Dániel Bárth: Demonology and Catholic Enlightenment in Eighteenthcentury Hungary. This study considers the intellectual background of the last period of witchcraft prosecutions in Hungary, exploring the multifaceted character of ecclesiastical views on diabolical possession through the examination of an exorcism scandal in Southern Hungary between 1766 and 1769. The author presents rich ecclesiastical source material relating to an exorcist active in Zombor, a charismatic Franciscan friar, Rókus Szmendrovich, whose activities attracted both Catholic and Orthodox believers. The study provides insights into inter-confessional relations in an ethnically mixed region. He also examines Catholic Enlightenment at the end of the eighteenth century, which made itself felt in every area of religious life, not leaving unaffected the practices of exorcism and the beliefs surrounding it.
Ágnes Hesz: Talking Through Witchcraft—on the Bewitchment Discourse of a Village Community. The paper explores the local discourse of witchcraft in a contemporary Hungarian village community in Transylvania (Romania). The aim of the author is to show in detail how people construct their social reality through talking about bewitchment. She argues that local witchcraft discourse works as a powerful ‘cultural idiom’ due to two factors: (1) local ideas on bewitchment offer a rather flexible interpretative framework for people to negotiate their social environment; (2) the combination of these ideas with particular ways of



8 G. KLANICZAy AND É. PóCS
communication (especially gossip) and particular narrative schemes produce messages with more communicative potential than other types of utterances. The approach of these eight essays, embracing the problem of witchcraft beliefs and prosecutions in Hungary and Transylvania from the sixteenth to the twentieth century, is a combination of historical and anthropological analysis. Witchcraft accusations are interpreted in their religious, social, judicial and medical context with a view to understanding how folk beliefs, rituals, archaic mythologies mingled with popular healing practices and everyday conflicts in village life. Special attention is given to the tensions among medical experts, and the discourses that shape witchcraft conflicts. Notwithstanding a number of special, original local features—such as the historical táltos or the present day fermekásHungarian and Transylvanian witchcraft histories (as well as the scholarship analysing them) are part of a broader, international setting, both absorbing many kinds of influences from all directions, and also communicating its particular features—as we hope this volume will succeed in doing.

The Social Background of Witchcraft
Accusations in Early Modern Debrecen
and Bihar County
Ildikó Sz. Kristóf
The present study is the translation of an abbreviated version of Chap. 5 of my book entitled “Ördögi mesterséget nem cselekedtem.” A boszorkányüldözés társadalmi és kulturális háttere a kora újkori Debrecenben és Bihar vármegyében (“I have not done any diabolic deeds.” The Social and Cultural Foundation of Witch-hunting in Early Modern Debrecen and Bihar County) published in Debrecen in 1998. The book examines the witch-hunting in Bihar county and its largest city in Eastern Hungary between 1575 and 1766. During this period altogether 217 trials were conducted against 303 accused, and my study aimed at detecting the social context of the accusations and the underlying beliefs. The working hypothesis was based on that now classical observation of social anthropology, according to which the charges of witchcraft resulted from the deteriorations of everyday human relations and so could allude to the existing conflicts of certain individuals

or groups in communities. The two central questions of the examination were as follows: how (in what legal, religious and social context) and why (among what kind of social circumstances and with what motivations) were people accused of witchcraft in 45 Hungarian Calvinist towns and villages? To answer these questions, I have made use of a variety of archival materials. Apart from the documents of witchcraft trials themselves I have surveyed the Calvinist treatises published in early modern Debrecen, and also legal and medical documents. I could identify the protagonists of the trials through archival files such as town records, criminal and civic documents, censuses, documents belonging to the guild of the barber-surgeons, and the records of the Calvinist diocese. The first three chapters of my book discuss the ways of witchcraft accusations. The witch-hunts in Bihar county were of rather small size (1–3 accused per annum) and intensity (only 32% of the trials concluded in death sentence altogether) compared with the Western European witch craze. I have found that a possible explanation for this relative mildness of the persecution could be provided by a complex consideration of legal, religious, and other local social circumstances. Next to the peculiarities of the accusatorial system of investigation (as opposed to most of Western Europe, this system still existed in parts in early modern Hungary), Hungarian Calvinist demonology remained skeptical about the concepts of diabolic witchcraft common in hysterical Sabbathmythologies. Consequently, the judges of Debrecen and Bihar county were not urged to identify the accused persons as representatives of a sect directly associating with the devil. Moreover, the early modern history of the region was burdened with almost constant wars and skirmishes (the area belonged to the frontiers with the Turkish Empire), so the Christian communities living here seem to have been preoccupied with the need for mere survival. Chapter 5 examines the concrete social circumstances of why people were nonetheless brought to witch trials in this region. Various legal, religious, social anthropological and socio-historical aspects could be brought forth to provide an explanation. As for the legal context, early modern Hungarian law obliged the secular courts to persecute witches. Calvinist demonology, although it regarded the worldly interventions of the devil as being of limited scope, urged the expurgation of various forms of sorcery and magic. Suspicion fell primarily on the practitioners of benevolent magic (e.g. popular healers, midwives, diviners, and the like) supposing that they opposed the ways of divine providence. Such

official, religious and ‘intellectual’ considerations often coincided with contemporary folk beliefs in which witchcraft played an important role. The popular explanations of misfortune that turned finally into witchcraft accusations derived most often from dense everyday conflicts (‘honest citizens’ versus ‘deviants’, landlords versus tenants, burghers versus beggars, locals versus strangers, healers and midwives versus their clients as well as guilds, gentry versus serfs). My book suggests that witchcraft accusations indicated acute tensions in the communities concerned: the institutionalization of medicine and social care in the city of Debrecen and the rearrangement of privileges among the local gentry in Bihar county. Considering that 18 years have passed since the publication of this work, it would have been useless to attempt to update the text with the scholarly literature that has come out since then. I decided to leave it as such representing an important period in Hungarian socio-cultural history, namely the late 1980s—early 1990s. Coinciding with the political changes in East-Central Europe, this period saw the emergence of historical anthropology in Hungary, mediated by, among others, English, French and German studies of witchcraft and witch-hunting. Chapter 5 of my book represents a basically socio-functional approach to the latter, but it evokes the emerging ‘postmodern’ i.e. narrational criticism as well that could be turned against it in several points.
WitChCraft Charges and their LoCaL soCiaL WorLd
Looking for social tensions within a community and for conflicts between individual people to explain the background to the accusations of witchcraft, and the consideration of witchcraft beliefs as a particular, anthropocentric explanation of unfortunate events is an approach rooted in the social anthropology of the Interwar period and after the Second World War. In the 1930s, E.E. Evans-Pritchard, in his works on the worldview of the Sudanese Azande people, interpreted witchcraft as a coherent system of concepts explaining the world which provided exhaustive answers to some very specific questions raised by the indigenous people, such as “Why did the misfortune happen to me?”, “Why here?” and “Why now?”1 However, as Mary Douglas pointed out in her 1970 overview, those British anthropologists following in the footsteps of Evans-Pritchard and claiming to adopt the functionalist approach (which lived its heyday in



16 I.S. KRISTóF
the 1940 and 1950s), merely borrowed and applied certain elements of their predecessor’s conceptual scheme in their works about the belief in witches of different African peoples. Overall, as Mary Douglas underlines in her critique, it was not sociologies of knowledge that they wrote about, but the narrow analyses of varying depth of the social function of witchcraft—in the words of Max Marwick, of its role as a social strain gauge.2 These studies were also justly criticized in the 1960s, for instance by Victor Turner, for not taking into consideration the potential transformations of a society, and for presuming that lying in the background of witchcraft accusations are societies which ‘reproduce’ themselves in an unchanged form.3 Two British historians, Keith Thomas4 and Alan Macfarlane,5 who in the 1970s were pioneers in applying anthropological methods based on the many-sided analysis of the relations and conflicts between witch and victim to the examination of history of witchcraft in England in the sixteenth and seventeenth century, tried their best to avoid these traps. Since the widespread continental ‘Sabbath myth’, which generated massive witch-hunts, was more or less absent in England, they both saw witch-hunting in England as a distinct type where local witchcraft accusations were above all maleficium; that is, bewitchment cases resulted from some kind of everyday, realistic conflict between a witch and her victim. As they have established, the most common quarrels related in witness testimonies were ones in which the victim had refused some kind of request made by the witch. Keith Thomas proposed an interpretation, according to which these cases were possibly either violations of the institution of traditional neighborly assistance, or the absence of traditional support given to social groups living off the donations of others, poor people whose situation was uncertain—and in Elizabethan England, still unregulated. Alan Macfarlane—taking Thomas’s idea one step furthercame to the conclusion that the witchcraft accusations of Essex in the sixteenth and seventeenth century had stemmed from the break-up of norms of coexistence founded upon the tradition of mutual assistance, and from the birth and gradual expansion of an individualistic, new system of values, in the line of the ‘spirit’ of capitalism. Thus, in searching for the function of witchcraft accusations, the two researchers were able to highlight changing social norms. Several researchers followed the methodology of Thomas and Macfarlane, which was to analyze the social conflicts of the witch and of the victim and the conflicts as related in the witch trials. William Monter studied witch trials from this perspective



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 17
in Switzerland, as did Erik Midelfort in Southwest Germany and John Putnam Demos in New England.6 Meanwhile, a recent psycho-anthropological study raised a significant challenge concerning the research of conflicts mentioned in witness testimonies. The French researcher Jeanne Favret-Saada discovered during her field-work conducted in the Bocage in the 1970s that the accounts of conflicts narrated by the villagers who considered themselves victims of bewitchment did not necessarily reveal the confrontation that actually took place. This grain of truth could be unrecognizably transformed and distorted into a kind of traditional model of witchcraft narrative, depending on how much the narrators altered and adjusted their stories in order to meet the expectations of their community.7 The question arises as to whether the conflicts appearing in the witness testimonies of witch trials—such as the refusal of a favor noted by Keith Thomas and Alan Macfarlane—and the other elements of maleficium narratives are rather the stereotypes of a specific type of narrative, and not the reflections of actual events. Obviously it is impossible to give an answer to this question merely by working with maleficium narratives documented two or three hundred years ago. As we will indeed see below, several essential motifs of witchcraft accusation cannot be elicited from those documents. Their analysis, nevertheless, can tell us a lot about the frameworks within which the people of that time phrased their misfortunes. Let us take a closer look at the conflicts as related both by the victims and those under the suspicion of being witches. The victims (84.84% in Debrecen, 86.36% in Bihar County) usually identified themselves as offenders—that is, they had offended the witch, and the suspected witches as the offended (95.45 and 88.25%). The rest of the cases confirm the assertion of Jeanne Favret-Saada, claiming that witchcraft accusation could have resulted from conflicts between entire households. In certain cases, for instance, the offender might be a relative of the victim (9.09% in Debrecen, 9.84% in the county), or the offended related to the witch (9.84% in the county). The typical setup of an offender victim and an offended witch was relatively rarely reversed, according to the testimonies. We only encounter three cases of an offending witch in Debrecen, and two cases (or four, if we count the relatives as well) in the county as a whole. Similar to the English witch trials studied by Keith Thomas and Alan Macfarlane, the most common conflict among the types of narratives



18 I.S. KRISTóF
from Debrecen and the villages of the county was the refusal of a request made by the witch. The most frequent requests from the victim by the person later suspected of having bewitched them were some kind of food (bread, dairy product, eggs), or meal (porridge, roast meat), or—primarily in the county—household appliances (pot, sieve, cauldron to cook brandy, weaving loom, laundry tub). Rarely money. The fact, however, that the refusal of a request only occurred in 28.78% of the cases in both Debrecen and Bihar County suggests that the maleficium narratives extended the scope of witchcraft accusation to a much wider circle of social interactions. The second most common type of conflict—22.72% in Debrecen and 14.77% in the countywas the violation of an agreement or arrangement by the victim. For instance, the victim did not require the healing services they had agreed upon with the other party, did not pay the fee due for the treatment, ousted the tenant of the house, carried out a commission (tailoring, sewing) either badly or not at all for someone, or did not pay the salary of someone working for them (ploughing, harvesting). The witchcraft narratives also mention other, physical abuses—16.01% in Debrecen and 11.36% in the county. For instance, the eventual victim physically attacked the witch, or broke her pot or her sieve, broke her window, harmed or killed a cow belonging to her, hoed up her hemp, or vandalised the witch’s land with their cart. Leaving the above mentioned question of Jeanne Favret-Saada open for now, the question about how much the accounts of quarrels tell us about the actual reasons behind the animosity between the victim and the witch, and how much of it consisted rather of secondary explanations, projections of the victim’s misfortune, let us examine closely some of the circumstances of these conflicts. Certain disputes seem to be connected to a specific time or period. Such dangerous times were the turning points of life (birth, marriage, death), and other festive and community occasions. It is apparent that both in Debrecen and in the county these maleficium narratives, put in different contexts, still essentially tell two variants of the same story with an identical structure: the breaking of a norm and the punishment that follows. In one part of the cases, the victims were trying to prove that the witch had offended certain time-related communal rituals and expectations, and that they had warned and rebuked them for it. This warning then led to a quarrel, which eventually ended with the ‘norm-breaking’ witch’s vengeance: bewitchment. In other narratives, the opposite



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 19
situation can be found: it was the victims who seem to have offended a normative expectation, and the witch’s bewitchment falls upon them as a punishment. The witch, in these cases, appears to be the guardian of these norms. Let us look at some examples. According to the narratives, in cases related to childbirth and baptism the most common cause of conflict was that the victim did not ask the eventual bewitcher to be the midwife or the godparent. Witness testimonies also report several other types of conflict. According to the account of the 1693 trial of Mrs. János Molnár, a healer in Debrecen and the daughter of a local midwife, she had scolded a woman in confinement for not keeping the magical protective rules relating to the infant: “Why don’t you breastfeed your child in a bonnet, because your child was fed during the night by the night people.” The well-intentioned warning, however, turned against Mrs. Molnár, because when the child fell ill, they suspected her bewitchment to be the cause.8 The maleficium narratives also reveal a number of conflicts resulting from the violation of instructions and rules relating to the period leading up to a wedding. According to the 1723 trial of Mrs. István Szegedi, she was considered to be the reason for the death of a groom who died on his wedding night. The witnesses say that Mrs. Szegedi was invited to the betrothal, but she was not asked to come and visit the bride from Gáborján, and they did not bring her along when the bride was brought home. Another bride told the judges that Mrs. Szegedi had appeared before her during the night, because she had not chosen her son for a husband. Mrs. Szegedi had reproached the girl that she was disparaging her son: “Why didn’t you marry my son, he has just as good clothes as the one you want to marry.”9 From the 1715 trial of Mrs. István Szabó we learn that a groom from Kismarja believed his illness to be due to telling people about the magical procedure Mrs. Szabó had advised him to carry out for his wedding.10 István Lengyel, an itinerant fiddler, was hit by one of the victims because he had started to play when the priest was still among the wedding crowd. The death of this person was considered to be the vengeance of Lengyel, according to his trial in 1716.11 The witnesses also mentioned conflicts related to funerary customs, namely to the organization and implementation of funeral feasts, which eventually led to witchcraft accusations. In the 1731 trial against Mrs. Márton Nagy and Mrs. Benedek Bálint from Hegyközpályi, one of the victims said that the reason Mrs. Nagy had bewitched her was that, when they were cooking for the funeral feast of a neighbor, she had left earlier



20 I.S. KRISTóF
than she was supposed to. At another feast, the cooks were quarrelling about who should serve the food. They did not let Mrs. Benedek Bálint, and therefore when one of the cooks became ill it was considered that Mrs. Bálint had bewitched her.12 The maleficium narratives also associated the conflicts resulting in witchcraft accusations with other feasts, holidays and social events. Returning to the proposition of Jeanne Favret-Saada questioning the authenticity of maleficium narratives, I believe that the examined narratives themselves could hardly prove or disprove whether events related two or three hundred years ago bore any relation to the accounts related of them. It is more important to understand what they represent: a variously regulated form of social cohabitation, in which any kind of violation implied retribution including sanctions associated with the sphere of beliefs. In the narratives we encountered the character of both the ‘norm-breaking witch’ and the ‘norm-breaking victim’. From the perspective of the logic of witchcraft accusations, the former testifies to the protection of norms: the person who violates certain rules of common life will be involved in witchcraft rumours, brought to trial and judged. Interestingly, however, the latter is legitimizing the transgression, and testifying to the change of norms: persons who violate certain common rules will be victims of bewitchment, but since they gain the opportunity to punish or have the bewitcher punished or sentenced, the behavior and the act of the norm-breaker is justified in the end. Although it is the latter case of maleficium narratives that are in the majority, and the offender-victim—offended-witch relation can be considered dominant, our analysis is still confined to the level of narratives. I would not go further than to assert that the victims of the period and the territory of our interest talked about certain norms regulating their social life as obligatory rules, which, nevertheless, could be modified or changed in the context of witchcraft. It is apparent, however, that according to the maleficium narratives most of the conflicts triggering witchcraft accusations and which arose in the course of common social life and cooperation are not related to a specific time period. We can also discover in the background of the conflicts frequently occurring ‘dangerous relations’ which, according to historians and anthropologists (Keith Thomas, Alan Macfarlane, Max Marwick and others) studying the anthropology and the sociology of witchcraft accusations, can reflect vulnerable social relations. If these dangerous relations can be made to correspond to the social processes



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 21
of the region, and more closely to the society of each community at the time, then—despite the narrative character of the maleficium narratives emphasized by Jeanne Favret-Saada—we can suspect existing social problems in the background of witchcraft accusations. The trial documents, unfortunately, do not provide a full picture of the nature of relationships between victims and witches. Among the 171 victims in Debrecen there were only 64 people (37.42%) who we know had some kind of familial relationship with the accused witch. This ratio is much worse in the county: among the 554 victims there were only 38 people (6.85%) of whom we know more. In the majority of the known cases, the victim and the witch were not related to one another. In Debrecen only 14.06% of the cases were between relatives. In the county this ratio is much higher, (44.89%), but it is worth noting that the parties were not so much blood relatives as ‘artificial’ kin (primarily in-laws and godparents). The rest of the cases indicate some sort of spatial relationship. Among the latter we primarily find neighborly and lodger-landlord relations and, on a different level, we can count the relationship between magical specialists and patients in this category as well. It is obvious, however, that such a small amount of uncertain data accessible from the witch trials can tell us very little about the problematic sectors of the concerned communities, and the hypotheses formulated on the basis of such data are only very frail. Those victim-witch relations of which we know seem to suggest that from the late seventeenth century until the mid-eighteenth century kinship and spatiality played an equal role in witchcraft accusations in the smaller market towns of the county, while in Debrecen in the same period the latter case prevailed. The dangerous relations I consider to be the most characteristic (and the categories of which I will discuss below) were, nonetheless, mostly based on certain spatial relations.
‘PeoPLe of iLL rePute’ and ‘honest Christians’
Percent of the 303 accused witches in Bihar County, 27.06% (82 people) were charged with committing other crimes—mostly sexual crimes (adultery, fornication, pandering, abortion, etc.) and theft. It is noteworthy that 62 of the 82 people came from a market town (75.60%), and only 20 came from villages (24.39%). 53 were from Debrecen, which means that 41.73% of all the witches brought to trial were also charged with other accusations.



22 I.S. KRISTóF
Since we have no statistical studies at our disposal that would reflect the crime ratios of the time in Debrecen, the market towns or the villages, these data can only be interpreted within significant limits. The low 27.06% incidence rate of multiple crimes suggest that witchcraft was not necessarily associated with other offenses, and witchcraft accusations did not necessarily target ‘persons of ill repute’ (cégéres személyek). At the peak of witch-hunting in Debrecen, for instance, between 1690 and 1694—according to the statistics I have assembled on the basis of judicial records—200 people were punished for theft, 68 for fornication, 7 for profanity, and none of these were accused of witchcraft. Seen from the opposite angle, of the eleven witches brought to trial during this period not one was accused of any other crime. There is agreement among several researchers that the persons accused of witchcraft cannot universally be considered as notorious criminals: this is the standpoint of the synthetic account of European witch-hunting written by Brian Patrick Levack, and some—as among them Robert Muchembled—even object to the use of the term ‘deviant’. William Monter, when discussing Swiss witches accused of other crimes, talks about “negative personality types”.13 The most common crimes associated with the accused witches in the region I have examined—sexual transgressions and theft and in Debrecen also profanity and blasphemy—were considered to be grave crimes by the Calvinist Church, thus defining the moral norms of the time, and so I believe that in this sense the 82 witches accused of multiple crimes could at the least have been regarded as ‘persons of ill repute’. It is apparent that such people were to be found in a significantly greater ratio in urban settlements (around 75%) than in villages (around 20%). Even though there are very few comparative data at disposal, it still seems that other aspects reflect a similar village-town disparity. Among the accused witches from the Essex villages, for instance, only 15% were accused of other crimes; meanwhile in the case of the urban settlements of New England this ratio is 36%, and is even higher, 45%, in the city of Lausanne, for example.14 It is possible that the difference in the crime rates between witches accused in urban and rural environments also indicates differences in urban and rural criminality, but to my knowledge this is an area yet to be studied. As regards the relation between the ratio of criminality of the accused witches to that of their community, so far only the studies of John Putnam Demos are available, according to which the ratio of criminality in the seventeenth century urban settlements of

New England was somewhere around 10–20%, while that of the accused witches, as I have previously mentioned, was much higher, around 36%.15 Taking all this into consideration, Demos warns that whatever name we use, we have to find closer ties between witchcraft and other crimes than research has so far suggested. These ties, which among the regions I have studied were especially evident in Debrecen, were probably strongly influenced by the witchcraft concepts of the Calvinist church. The Calvinist witch stereotype has a side—primarily emphasized in the treatise of the Puritan Mátyás Nógrádi16—which associated the sin of witchcraft with other crimes. Contemporary Calvinist theology usually saw a connection between the various sins. They formed a chain, as György Komáromi Csipkés explained in 1666. If someone committed a crime, they were unlikely to escape others: “Although the source of every crime a man commits in his life is Original Sin ... often ... the committed crime is the cause and the source of subsequent crimes. It is easy to commit the next crime, as David passed from fornication to murder... If someone commits a crime, it entails many others, because a crime is like a chainlink.”17 The “nature of the crime in these actions” could be manifold, as Gáspár Decsi had listed almost a century earlier in his 1582 dissertation, “Adultery, fornication ... idolatry ... poisoning ... envy, wrath ... heresy, murder, drunkenness, riotousness”.18 According to the Calvinist argument, by committing the first sin, one would forfeit the mercy of God, and in the absence of this further crimes would come easily.19 We can fairly presume that the Calvinist Church’s concept of crime affected the way witchcraft accusations were oriented. If the communities—whether in New England or in Bihar County—appropriated this concept, witchcraft accusations could easily have been directed at people who previously, in their past, had done something of ill repute. On the other hand, it is worth taking note which crimes were most often associated with witchcraft accusations. It seems that the transgressions that appeared most frequently in the accusations in Bihar County, such as sexual transgression, theft, vulgar discourse (threats), blasphemy, were also those most prevalent among the accused witches of other Calvinist regions (England, New England, Switzerland).20 It was again John Putnam Demos who drew attention to the fact that the nature of these transgressions might be somehow closely connected to the meaning of witchcraft. A bewitchment is the ‘unfair’—because supernaturally aided—appropriation of something, be it men’s potency, their ability to



24 I.S. KRISTóF
approach women, the milk of the cows, human health or even peaceful everyday communication. The same thing happened in cases of crimes most frequently associated with witchcraft: these were actions occurring in real life and considered ‘unfair’ and immoral.21 Lying in the background of opinions arguing a connection between witchcraft and other crimes (if it is not merely a reflection of the most common forms of deviancy in the given community, nor merely the influence of Calvinist theology’s concept regarding the chain of sinspossibilities which, however, should not be fully dismissed) we could discover the association of the perceived supernatural appropriation with other ones and vice versa. The judicial court of Debrecen, for instance, affirmed in two cases that witchcraft and sexual transgressions were closely related. In an indictment from 1725 it was written that “according to common parlance whoring goes together with witchcraft”, while a prosecutor’s speech in front of the court in 1717 summarized the accusations against two women as follows: “in their youth they lived in fornication, whoring and pandering; in their old age they committed themselves to witchcraft, charms, binding and unbinding”.22 Furthermore, we also have to point out that among the 82 witches subject to multiple accusations only nine were men, all residents of Debrecen. The others were married women, except for three girls. The indictment speeches and the testimonies of witnesses suggest that both the judges and the victims called the “witches” to account for rules and expectations related by contemporary society and the Calvinist Church to the role of married women and mothers. In 1725, for instance, Mrs. Márton Rácz from Debrecen was accused (also) of leading a debauched lifestyle. In her indictment one can read: “in her house, she is not vigilant like a sober, God-fearing woman, but she gets drunk and indulges herself [in earthly pleasures], to the consternation of her God-fearing Christian neighbors.”23 In her 1724 trial, “Old” Mrs. András Nagy from Kóly was brought to account for missing church. The witnesses, asserting that she did not visit the house of God, cited something she had said about herself: “I am a damned soul”.24 According to people who knew her, Mrs. Miklós Kulcsár from Helyközpályi violated the interdiction of Sunday labour. Testifying against her in her trial in 1715, one of her neighbors said, “they always churned the cream on Sundays...to make butter.”25 Several women who were thought to be witches were described by witnesses as having an ugly, quarrelsome tongue. Mrs. István Oláh from Hegyközpályi, we



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 25
find from her trial in 1731, “lifted her shirt off her buttocks, and asked the witness to lick her behind”.26 Mrs. Miklós Kulcsár threatened one of her victims, saying she would “lash him with her tongue like a Gypsy woman”.27 Again, we have to return to the question of Jeanne Favret-Saada: were these women actually as the witnesses described them in the witchcraft trial, or are these descriptions only to be interpreted in the context of maleficium narratives? Based on the few cases in which I was able to complement the documents of witchcraft trials with other sources (such as demographic censuses, judicial documents of other civil and criminal proceedings, etc.) and examine the micro-context of accusations, my answer to this question is neither a firm yes nor a no. There were indeed several women whose pasts revealed previous legal proceedings, which confirmed other accusations beside that of witchcraft; in certain cases, however, we can see that the distinction between a ‘person of ill repute’ and a ‘God-fearing pious woman’ was very much dependant on the composition of the neighborhood, their micro-community. Let us look at a few examples. When in 1701 the court sentenced Mrs. István Kis to be beheaded (the usual punishment for adultery), they referred to her “long-time inappropriate behavior”. Mrs. István Kis was a middle-aged, married woman. I do not know the occupation of her husband, but she was known as a healer, with patients visiting her from as far away as Szovát. According to the testimony of one woman, Mrs. Kis healed the injured hands and feet of her husband: “she pierced the blisters on his foot, and she also gave grease in a nutshell for his hand, which healed him.” Mrs. Kis herself spread the perception, according to which she had been haunted and tortured by witches for healing their victims. According to one of the witnesses “they asked [Mrs. Kis] why her hands were injured. She replied that Mrs. Sóder, the pagan soul, came in through the window with her company and with a knife, and she had cut her.”28 Her “long-time inappropriate behavior” is confirmed by two other legal cases prior to her witch trial. In September 1694 she initiated slander proceedings against her mother-in-law, who had spread a rumour about her that she was “caught with a lad” in Elep by some soldiers, who made her pay 12 Forints in exchange for their silence. The mother-inlaw was able to prove the truth of what she claimed and Mrs. István Kis was punished.29 Besides her licentious lifestyle she seems to have been quite a gossip, as turns out from her second trial in April 1695. This time



26 I.S. KRISTóF
she was punished with ‘tongue tying’ (emenda linguae) because she had spread a rumour about a young couple that neither the husband’s nor the wife’s past was immaculate. By the time Mrs. Kis was in front of the judges for witchcraft, she already had the reputation of being a loose and loudmouthed woman. Several witnesses confirmed this in their testimonies at her trial. They said she liked to narrate other people’s bedroom secrets, or initiate various procedures for bringing together young couples through love magic: “she said...that a woman named Pila Bán got involved with a young man who didn’t want to marry her, so she burned his belt, and thus he had to marry her.” Before the son of János Kenyeres got married “she heated up a horseshoe and dug up the footsteps of the girl with it, also cooking her underwear in wine, and had the boy drink it, so that he would fall in love with her.” It is very likely that no oneespecially not the newlyweds and their relatives—appreciated the airing of their pasts and of the stories of how they became a couple; and especially not by a woman who had already been punished for adultery and who had since continued to live in vice. The witch trial of Mrs. Kis also reveals that she had recently had as a lover a young lad named Domokos, and the woman boasted about how he was going to marry her after her husband died. He gave her a skirt and a cloak, and they were also caught together in a courtyard. All this, however, did not stop Mrs. Kis from having other young men over to her house, and “to taste the wine at the house of the judge.” It appears that her relationship with Domokos had been quite turbulent; they fought frequently and the lad occasionally beat her up. Before the trial, however, Domokos had had enough of Mrs. Kis. He wanted to leave her, but, as witnesses told, the woman went after him crying. The maleficium narratives related to Mrs. István Kis are intertwined with other accusations against her; earlier conflicts told by the victims primarily involved sexual transgressions and drunkenness. The narratives associated the witchcraft of Mrs. Kis with her ‘ill-reputed’ lifestyle. The trial did not reveal whether Mrs. Kis was indeed a friend of the judge, or if she only bragged about it. When one night, however, she appeared again at the house of her former lover Domokos, drunk and crying, the judge had her arrested. We can presume that her associate, seeing that her previous two punishments had not changed her lifestyle and that her gossiping was still endangering the good reputation of her acquaintances, and that due to her scandalous life she jeopardized the ideal of the “God-fearing pious woman”, saw no other solution



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 27
than to resort to the use of witchcraft accusation in order to get rid of her once and for all. Finally, the court sentenced her to be beheaded for her ‘witchcraft’ and “especially... for her obvious fornication and drunkenness”.30 The case of Mrs. Márton Rácz from Debrecen illustrates well how the perspective of the stereotypical witch-victim relations of the maleficium narratives changes if we get the chance to look behind the narratives. Mrs. Rácz’s witch trial was in the spring of 1725. Márton Rácz and his wife moved to Debrecen from Sámson. I was not able to determine exactly when this happened: in 1722, however, they were already living there. Rácz was a wealthy butcher; he also bred sheep. He employed his own shepherd, and also merchandized milk. They hosted four or five lodgers in their house in Péterfia street in the third district (tized31). As we can deduce on the basis of the censuses, the conflicts leading to the witch trial were limited to a very small area: from the 59 witnesses testifying against Mrs. Rácz, 36 were certainly residents of the same street, and 21 lived in the near vicinity in the third district. Mrs. Márton Rácz was described by the witnesses as a “fair-haired, fat, red woman” in her middle age or a little older (not too old to keep lovers). Her adult son had already moved out from the parents’ house to that of a neighbor, the widow of Mr. Ormányközi, also in the third district. When in January 1725 the house of Mrs. Ormányközi burst into flames a storm of animosities related to Mrs. Rácz surfaced. Mrs. Rácz and her son hurried to help put out the fire, but at the scene one of their neighbors, János Petermány from the third district, attacked them with an axe, calling Mrs. Márton Rácz a “witch whore”, and wanted to chase them from the site. Petermány was a bacon butcher, who must have had some kind of professional conflict with the family of the butcher Rácz. According to his testimony, earlier Mrs. Rácz “had gone to his house and started to curse with various insults, telling him what she would do to his mother; she cursed not only him, but his entire household.” Although Petermány did not elaborate on how he believed Mrs. Rácz had bewitched them, the 1728 census revealed that his wife was suffering of some sort of (mental?) illness; she was “harmed”. Mrs. Ormányközi probably sold her house to the Rácz family in exchange for their son’s care for her until she died—as an early modern equivalent of a care and maintenance contract. The relationship of the cohabiting ‘caregiver’ and the ‘dependent’ went sour: as the witch trial revealed: the widow attributed the death of her husband and her various



28 I.S. KRISTóF
other health problems (the sores on her face and her weight loss) to Mrs. Rácz. In the first days of February 1725 Mrs. Márton Rácz started a slander suit against János Petermány, but by February 9, the volume of incriminating testimonies gathered against her was so vast that she became the subject of accusation. It is quite revealing that most of the victims were from her street, 18 people were of her immediate neighborhood, the third district. Seven victims came from the second district, 15 from the fourth, four from the first and only two people from the fifth district. According to the witnesses the “fair-haired, fat, red” Mrs. Márton Rácz was far from the ideal of a “God-fearing honest woman”. One of the witnesses, a neighbor from the fourth district, Mrs. András Nagy, had known the Rácz family for a long time. She used to stay at their home when they lived in Sámson and she was visiting the local healer with her husband. As Mrs. Nagy told in front of the court, Mrs. Rácz had just left her husband “to run away with a man next to the Szamos river”. The county court (sedria) punished her for this crime, but her husband eventually took her back. It is not impossible that the reason for moving from Sámson was to avoid the village gossip. Mrs. András Nagy obviously did not keep the information she had acquired in Sámson to herself; when the Rácz family moved to Debrecen she shared the past of the woman with the whole street. Mrs. Rácz seems to have continued her licentious lifestyle in Debrecen: in her witch trial, 20 of her close neighbors from the third district, five from the second, and four of the first district talked about her frequent drunkenness, her recurrent adulteries and blasphemies; two residents of the fourth district accused her of theft; and one of her neighbors from the fifth district witnessed when she got into a fight with her husband. Mrs. Rácz, when her husband went off to deal with his sheep or on a merchant trip, often had wine brought to her house or went to visit neighbors. Sámuel Erdélyi, a weaver from the third district, said, “he knows about her frequent drunkenness, and the debaucheries at her house, they often had a loud rumpus at her house, one could even hear the noise across the street.” János Gömöri, a bootmaker and district official of the fifth district, also testified to her “drunkenness and cursing by calling the others roguish souls and dog spirited”; he even saw her “fighting”. Márton Rácz himself complained to their neighbors about the behavior of his wife. According to Mrs. János Szappanos, a widow and petty merchant in the third district, he explicitly said, as he



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 29
pointed at his mortar: “Oh my, dear neighbor... if this mortar could talk, it would tell stories about my wife: the other night I had to kick a young man off her belly [...] [Márton Rácz] tore his cloak off his neck with a pitchfork.” The maleficium narratives given in relation to Mrs. Rácz—just as in the case of the above mentioned Mrs. István Kis—correspond to the woman’s lifestyle ‘of ill repute’. The victims in court typically mentioned incidents relating to the context of eating and drinking and visiting neighbors: she gave a “bad” beverage (wine, brandy) to the victim, or gave “bad” food to the guests, who attributed their subsequent health troubles to the accused. Her husband had the same opinion of her; he complained to several of his neighbors about an incident in Sámson, when his wife “gave him a beverage after which he would have died, if he had not drunk water ... he vomited blood afterwards.” The waitress of the street’s tavern, Mrs. György Beke was convinced that her leg was impaired because she refused to give credit on wine to Mrs. Rácz. If we take a closer look at the people who claimed to be victims of Mrs. Rácz, we can clearly see in several cases that they had their share of troubles (poverty, misery, old age, illness) which they could ‘project onto’ and blame on the witch figure embodied by Mrs. Rácz. Using the 1730 census conducted in Péterfia street, among the neighbors testifying against Mrs. Márton Rácz we found 20 guild craftsmen, 11 tradesmen, nine farmers, and 12 landless inhabitants who mostly worked as hired labour, living in ordinary houses or earth huts or cottages. Most of them did not come from the poorest stratum, but not the wealthiest either. It seems, however, that none of them was close to the level of the Rácz family: we have thus a case of accusation from below. Furthermore, it is also noteworthy to observe that many of the victims had to overcome their own personal tragedies. The census takers often noted that the relative of the person in question was ill, old, widowed or impoverished and destitute. Let us look at a few examples. I have already mentioned the “harmed” wife of János Petermány, the bacon butcher from the third district. The third-district weaver Sámuel Erdélyi, who survived from his profession, had only a “shanty”, with only a half bowshot32 of land and vineyard, and only one cow and one pig. Mrs. György Némethi, also of the third district, whose reason for calling Mrs. Rácz a witch we ignore, was a wife of a smith who was stated as being old: they lived in a “withered” house with two bowshots of land. Mrs. János Ürmös, the wife of a button-maker (third district) lived



30 I.S. KRISTóF
in a “hut”, with a half bowshot of land, and one bowshot of vineyard and one cow. János Varga Szabó (also third district), who attributed the death of his first wife to bewitchment by Mrs. Rácz, and was an unspecified craftsman, lived in a “withered” house with a half bowshot of land. The widow of János Zagyva and her son (third district) were farmers and lived in a “hut” with one bowshot of land and a “sickly” cow. Mihály Varga, who also lived in the street (first district) “used to trade cattle” but he had become “impoverished” and was left with only one and a half bowshots of land and three “bad” horses. Mrs. András Gyarmati, the widow of a cobbler (third district) lived in a “hut” “with his poor orphans”, owning also just a half bowshot of land and two “bad” horses. Mihály Czégény was a “sickly” market tailor (fourth district) living off of one cow. Mrs. István Katona (second district) had no land, only a “bad house” and three mill horses. The widow of István Szabó (third district) the lodger of another widow, Mrs. János Szappanos, was according to the census an old woman “selling offal”. The widow of János Balogh (third district), who attributed the death of her husband to the bewitchment of Mrs. Rácz, became a lodger: “she sold her house and lived off the money”. Mrs. Mihály Szűcs (fourth district), who allegedly became sick from the wine of Mrs. Rácz, whose “body was sucked” and who also blamed Mrs. Rácz for having stolen five taler from her, also had no land and lived in a “bad hut” and had three mill horses. János Agárdi (second district), who suspected Mrs. Rácz of causing the illness of his wife, was a livestock-farmer living in a “withered” owning one bowshot of land and “30 wasted sheep”. The widow of István Harsányi (third district), who had caught Mrs. Rácz with her shepherd and then became ill, worked on her one bowshot of land and owned two “bad” horses and a “small house”. After the death of her husband, according to the census, “she provided food for her three schoolchildren herself”. Mrs. Mihály Veres (second district), who was also “poisoned” when given a bad beverage by Mrs. Rácz, was a smallholder with only a half bowshot of land, living in their “shabby house” with her husband, and they were “left with only one bad horse, the others died.” She tried to improve their living conditions by “baking fried cake (csöröge)”. Her mother, Mrs. János Darabos (fifth district) was an old merchant living in a “hut”.33 Four former lodgers of the Rácz family also claimed that she was a witch after they had been kicked out of the house; it is also noteworthy that Mrs. Rácz’s lame son also considered his handicap to be a result of his mother’s bewitchment.



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 31
Based on the image we get of the victims, we can reasonably presume that when in the maleficium narratives these men and women talk about becoming ill because of the food and drinks Mrs. Márton Rácz had given them, or after having caught her cheating on her husband, they were actually reflecting—hidden behind the stereotypes of witchcraft—a specific situation of social cohabitation of the age, overloaded with multiple tensions, which triggered a vast number of conflicts. The situation, namely, of what it meant when a wealthy, lively, foulmouthed, andaccording to the beauty standards of the age—pretty “fair-haired, fat, red woman”, arrived in a mostly modest neighborhood—among the members of which many had suffered or were heading toward bankruptcy, and several were sick, old, widowed—who led a lavish lifestyle, and who “told people what she would do to their mothers just like men do”, and who, to cap it all, was not even a local. The neighborhood, living under difficult conditions, already struck by various disasters and probably jealous in many aspects, found an appropriate scapegoat in the financially superior and morally ‘inferior’ woman who was so different from them, and simply excluded her from the community. After establishing that she was a witch, the court banished Mrs. Márton Rácz from the city and ordered the demolition of her house in May 1725.34 The witchcraft accusation in the cases of the above described witches “of ill repute” had a function similar to that of one of the groups of maleficium narratives related to the dangerous times discussed earlier: it protected the norms sanctioned by the community and the Calvinist Church: in this case the expectations related to the behavior of a “Godfearing Christian woman”, and it served the reinforcement and the transmission of these norms. However, the witchcraft narratives told about the accused persons “of ill repute” did not necessarily describe conflicts stemming from such norm-breaking behavior; witchcraft accusation also did not necessarily target the ‘deviants’ of the community. As the few detailed examples of accused witches confirm, maleficium narratives often withheld current or past conflicts and oppositions on the grounds of which some people could become witches, while others victims. The most important reason why it is necessary for researchers to make an attempt to look behind the narrated conflicts, to delineate the most features possible of the environment and of the past of the accused, is that these conflicts and oppositions were apparently far from being due



32 I.S. KRISTóF
to a single dangerous relation. Besides, the “ill-reputed”—“God-fearing, honest Christian” opposition was coupled with other oppositions: in the case of Mrs. István Kis it was healer-patient; in Mrs. István Horváth’s it was neighbor-neighbor and lodger-landlord opposition; and in the case of Mrs. Márton Rácz it was the oppositions of poor neighbor-rich neighbor, caregiver-dependent, lodger-landlord, mother-son, health-illness, etc., all of which resulted in very complex conflict situations. In terms of the targets of witchcraft accusation, we can see that the type of dangerous relationship I have referred to was only one among many others.
heaLers, midWives and their soCiaL environment
Among those accused at the witch trials I have examined, there were in total 45 healers and 13 midwives. This second type of dangerous relationship was primarily characteristic of Debrecen: 30.70% (t39 people) of the accused practiced healing and six women (4.72%) were midwives. Among the accused in Bihar County I only found six healers (3.40%) and seven midwives (3.97%). The ratio of the healing narratives (stories about the treatment of various illnesses considered to be bewitchments) reflects a similar disparity: in Debrecen accounts were given of 129 cases of healing, eight more than there were maleficium narratives, while in the county trials only six cases of healing were mentioned. There are specific social reasons for this city-county difference. The phenomenon where a considerable part of the people accused of witchcraft were representatives of benevolent magic, of popular medicine and of the profession of midwifery is not unknown in international and Hungarian research. Keith Thomas and Alan Macfarlane considered this phenomenon one of the characteristics of witch-hunting in England. According to Keith Thomas, the accusation of witchcraft seemed more credible if it was directed against people considered to be experts in some kind of magical knowledge (such as positive magic).35 Richard Horsley, meanwhile, has shown that this is far from being particular to England; in continental witch trials—from Lorraine to Austria, from Luzern to Schleswig-Holstein—the practitioners of positive magic were just as much, or even more objects of witchcraft accusations before the court.36 In addition to the fact that demonological literature considered the practices of popular healers and midwives diabolical and incited their persecution, the experts of “white” magic themselves also issued



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 33
witchcraft accusations, in many cases with the aim of eliminating a rival magical specialist.37 Ferenc Schram, an expert on Hungarian witch trials, has drawn the attention to the fact that the number of representatives of popular medicine was very high among the accused witches; most recently Ágnes R. Várkonyi has pointed out that “in the background of certain trials one can observe the rivalry between healers”. She also presumed that Hungarian witch trials came to an end due to the establishment of a centralized network of public healthcare in the eighteenth century and to the effect of the medical and healthcare education of the age.38 In the analysis of the witch trials of Bihar County I have considered these aspects as well. Dangerous relations between healers and midwives appear to have been manifold. They reflected not only the tensions between these specialists of magic and their patients (only intensified by the fact that the patients spread the evil fame by denouncing the unsuccessful healer as a witch when turning to another specialist), but also the strong competition between healer and healer, midwife and midwife (who also brought one another into disrepute by claiming that their competitors were witches), and the dichotomy between ‘legitimate’ and ‘illegitimate’ healing and midwifery. Besides the tendency in Calvinist demonology to denigrate benevolent magical activities and the fact that these activities were also customarily associated with witchcraft in popular belief, one can often discern well-perceptible social processes behind the conflicts relating to healers and midwives. The accusation according to which the suspect had been practicing some kind of unusual, improper healing activity (usually considered ‘illegitimate’), was often brought up throughout the entire period of our enquiry—primarily in the witch trials of Debrecen. A woman named Erzsébet was accused of performing “evil” healing and “male medicatio” as early as 1631.39 According to the trial of the wife of the town councillor (senator) László Szűcs in the same year: “her healing [method] was not legitimate”.40 Mrs. Bálint Kis was accused in 1694 of “applying illicit means”.41 Mrs. Mihály Kis performed healing “out of reckless ignorance, inside and outside the city, ignoring the power, as well as the origin and appropriate [healing] method for the illnesses”, according to her 1715 trial.42 The text of her 1716 indictment states that Annók Fejér practiced an “unlearned profession”.43 The judges in the 1720 trial of Mrs. István Csősz Varga accused her of “healing supra naturalem rationem”.44 Mrs. András Bartha “fraudulently took



34 I.S. KRISTóF
the money, a couple of hundred Forints in total, of the poor patients; she would rightly deserve death,” argued the prosecutor at her 1725 trial, who qualified her activities as “artificium prohibitum”.45 One of the charges against Mrs. Mihály Jóna in 1730 was that of “impostura in medicando”.46 Mrs. János Mózes also “healed by illicit means, ignorantly”, according to her 1741 trial.47 In the same year Mrs. Mihály Szakolyi was accused of “being ignorant in the matter of medicine, yet she practiced healing; the man she treated got worse under her hands.”48 In the indictment speech against János Kis in 1743, who had earlier been sued several times for his healing practices, it was said that “He practices medicine, while lacking the knowledge thereof, and he is more fit to do agricultural work.”49 The trials also reveal what the practice of an ‘ignorant profession’ consisted of, and what the condemned and illicit means were. In contemporary parlance, the ‘healer women’ and their male counterparts attempted to heal numerous exterior diseases (that is, with visible symptoms on the body surface) and interior ones, which, using the logic of witchcraft were qualified as bewitchments. Among the healers in Debrecen, for instance, Erzsébet Balázs (1693) tried to heal gastritis, delirium and fright; Mrs. Ignác Villás (1693) treated eye diseases, paralysis, maternity-related diseases, impotency, and fright; Mrs. János Nagy (1693) healed pimples, barrenness, insanity, indigestion (urinary problems). Mrs. György Kis (1702) treated epilepsy; Mrs. Mihály Szaniszlai (1711) tried to heal scall and abcesses. Mrs. András Bartha (1725) treated epilepsy, paralysis, heart-pain, colic, stomach and eye disorders, impotency and barrenness. Mrs. Mihály Jóna (1730) attempted to treat pustules, lesions, even syphilis (francú). Mrs. János Kis (1743) healed bone fracture, sore throat, asphyxia, insanity, lesions and even patients with the plague.50 The “healer women” and their associates usually used various medicinal herbs, preparing potions, baths, or fumigating the patient with them. In addition to using medicinal herbs, some trials mentioned other treatments, which also seem more or less rational. János Kis (1734) for instance used as “healing instrument none other than birch leaves, burnt alum, burdock and hops, of which he made a lye and washed the injured flesh with it, in order to protect it from rotting.” The same healer bandaged the “head of a patient which had been injured and even split by a blow, with a little butter and onionskin.”51 Mrs. Pál Marosi from Telegd (1766) treated pustules as follows: “I prepared medicine from mutton tallow, blue vitriol and a little rancid fat or grease.”52 Mrs. András



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 35
Nagy from Debrecen (1730) simply smeared grease on the patients with “side and stomach hernias.”53 Mrs. Mihály Jóna from Debrecen (1730) healed “all kinds of infirmities” with the following potion: “two types of incense, girispán,54 gunpowder, alum, blue vitriol and cherry tree resin cooked in wine vinegar covered with bread-crust”. It was only Mrs. Jóna who we know also used some kind of “black substance” in her healing, a potion she bought in the pharmacy.55 These rational, and in many cases truly useful, remedies were coupled with certain elements which might be considered irrational from a contemporary point of view: in the popular medicine of the age, however, the two aspects were inseparably intertwined. Mrs. Ignác Villás (1693), for instance, asked one of her patients for a bed-sheet, because, as she said, “they will extend it over a chain and they will cut the binding from this sheet”. On another occasion, according to a patient, “she asked for a black chicken feather, then she took a handful of soil from under her feet, put it on my foot, and then took a silver needle and ploughed the earth with the needle and the feather while uttering incantations.”56 Mrs. János Nagy (1693) gave the following advice to a patient who had complained of her cow giving bloody milk: “Pour the milk over the wood-cutting stand and over the garbage, beat it hard, and the cow won’t have problems anymore.” Another patient was “fumigated and massaged with something like a candle wick.”57 Mrs. István Kis (1715), when she was healing a patient with little success, exclaimed: “if I could only catch a toad and bind 20 nails of the woman [who has bewitched the patient] to it, you would recover.”58 Mrs. Mihály Kis (1715) treated fright and palpitation with medicinal herbs and incantations: “when she boiled and prepared the bath, she took her bag of herbs and carried it to the stove and said the Lord’s Prayer and the Nicene Creed over it. She then put the herbs in the bath and reiterated the prayers. After that the witness was seated in the bath, and, being thirsty, asked for something to drink, to which she replied, “May Christ give you his sacred soul to drink, and drink later”. She had the witness seated nine times in the bath, naked. When the patient got out of the bath for the last time she gave her a broken human skull to drink from, and she poured cold water in it from a jug, putting some kind of herb in the vessel, upon which she uttered incantations.”59 Kata Szabó (1718) gave one of her patients “the heart of a turtle for heart palpitation.”60 Mrs. Mihály Jóna (1730) gave as advice to a patient who believed that her daughter’s illness was a result of evil eye that she should ask for three drops of blood

“from the little finger” of the one who “saw her”, and drip it into her daughter’s eyes.61 As the trials occasionally reveal, some “healer women” from Debrecen had a fairly wide clientele, spreading beyond the city limits. Despite the positive role these “healer women” played in their communities, in the period of our study they were already threatened from many sides by the danger of becoming identified as witches. The Calvinist Church unequivocally considered their activities as diabolic superstition, and, their judgment of popular beliefs in the period of the witch trials has also been seen as rather ambiguous, manifesting in some sort of awe, a sense of respect mixed with fear. I cannot tell exactly when these individuals started to be seen as witches. It is nonetheless noteworthy that while from the mid-sixteenth century, that is from the period when Calvinism took root, we do encounter a few cases in Debrecen in which unsuccessful healers were brought to court, the accusation of witchcraft was not (yet?) pronounced. In March 1551, for instance, Antal Orvos (the surname means “physician”) promised “according to agreement” to Lőrinc Nagy to “pay him one Forint for not having been able to heal his wife.”62 The servant János who was sued by his master, Márton Szép, in 1551 because his horse had been treated by János but had died, had to take an oath that the cause of the horse’s death was not his medicine. The court ordered Márton Szép to estimate his damages and for János to reimburse him.63 Finally, in March 1557 a healer woman sued one of her patients for not paying her for her—presumably unsuccessful—‘healing services’.64 Apparently, these cases reflect a phase of the assumptions related to healers when “bad healing” did not mean more than being unsuccessful, and was not yet associated—either in the eye of the tribunal, or in that of the victims—with witchcraft. From the end of the sixteenth century, however, throughout the examined period—parallel to the establishment of Calvinism and of the Calvinist witch stereotype that claimed positive magic to be diabolical—the witch trials reflected an aura of suspicion surrounding healers from both sides. I have already presented the ecclesiastical side: let us take a look at the social side, that of the patients. The trials reveal that there were various ways to begin one’s career as a healer or a compassionate midwife and end up as a witch. Even though the process of ‘turning’ specialists of magic into witches had not concluded by the end of the examined period, it had manifested considerably.



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 37
This idea is confirmed by the fact that one of the most frequent reasons for falling under suspicion was actually success in healing. When the midwife from Sámson, Mrs. János Fődi was called to heal somebody, she hesitated; for, according to her trial in 1746, “if I healed him, I would bring danger upon myself, I would incriminate myself.”65 The hesitation of Mrs. Fődi, according to which healing, whether successful or not, could entail the suspicion of witchcraft, reflects a commonly accepted opinion in the age of witch-hunting: whoever could lift a spell was also capable of casting it. As one of the victims of Mrs. János Nagy (1693), a healer and midwife from Debrecen, claimed: “It is impossible for someone else to heal [a bewitchment], it can only be done by the person who caused it.”66 It is noteworthy that among the maleficium narratives related to the accused “healer women” and midwives, the incidents of successful healing were in fact in the majority. In Debrecen, the latter constituted two thirds of all cases (31.48%, that is 41 failed healing cases). Furthermore, many healing women and midwives resorted to various magical practices. Sometimes it was the unsuccessful application of these devices that placed them under suspicion. Mrs. Pál Sós from Debrecen (1693) “gave a caul to a hajdú (soldier) named Lukács SzentJóbi Török, so that bullets would not hit him.” Despite this, the soldier was shot by the Turks at Várad. “And so the other soldiers caught her and took her to the ispán [head of the county court] saying that she was clearly a witch.”67 Certain healers—in order to reinforce their prestige—used beliefs according to which people with extraordinary skills could hear and learn what others said about them, and were able to see things which happened out of their sight. Mrs. János Molnár (1693), for instance, “could tell right away whether my wife had or had not slept that night... she knew what she had dreamed better than if she had heard it... and she related everything that Mrs. János Szarka had dreamed.”68 Mrs. Mihály Jóna (1730), to the greatest surprise of her patients, reproached them for questioning her healing skills: “Mrs. Jóna told them right away, “Why don’t you take [the patient] to someone who knows how to do it, since Mr. Komáromi has said that I don’t know shit about it.” Boasting about their special skills, however, proved to be a two-edged sword: instead of raising their prestige, it often served as foundation for their reputation as a witch. It is also very interesting to encounter some maleficium narratives in which “healer women” and midwives are represented as the guardians of



38 I.S. KRISTóF
certain communal requirements, taboos and beliefs and it was precisely this fact which had led to the witchcraft accusations against them. Two “healer women” from Debrecen, Mrs. Pál Sós (1693) and Mrs. János Molnár (1693), had both warned their patients about the prohibitions on kneading and of nursing without a bonnet on Saint George’s Day, something I mentioned earlier when discussing these dangerous times. These latter truly must have felt guilty for their offenses, because they all talked about how after the infringement they were “punished” (their children became ill). But, warding off the responsibility, eventually they interpreted their troubles as the bewitchment of the specialist of magic who had reprimanded them.69 Such and similar cases, primarily appearing in the urban environment of Debrecen in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, are probably referring to the early stages of a process—represented in the framework of maleficium narratives—during which certain requirements, forming part of the social norms, were slowly eliminated. The offenders were aware of their misbehavior according to the currently prevailing norms; but by accusing the “healer women” supposedly defending these very rules with witchcraft, they were practically denying them. And thus, indirectly, they also undermined the authority of the magical specialist. I believe that the conflicts resulting from the denial of the privileges due to the “healer women”, and about the violation of their differential treatment, appearing in the maleficium narratives are also “about” this process. From the early eighteenth century we often hear of the subsequent victim not paying the fees of healing, or finding the amount too much, or not paying the healer the due respect.70 The 1730 trial of Mrs. Mihály Jóna, a healer woman from Debrecen, for instance, included several maleficium narratives resulting from this type of conflict. One of her patients, as the healer woman claimed, was responsible for her own illness; it had happened through her own ‘duplicity’, because Mrs. Jóna “had not received a 25-inch ribbon from her at the marketplace.” She warned another patient, saying: “Why hasn’t your mother sent me chickens, she will have to send more.” She asked in vain for the bonnet of a patient in which to travel to Nagysellye. The patient would not give it to her, and when she later became ill, she obviously attributed her condition to a bewitchment by Mrs. Jóna. She sent a message to a sick couple before visiting them to “prepare some food” because she was coming in the afternoon.” She also reproached her former patient, Mrs. Kállai, for not paying for her healing services. As



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 39
a witness explained: “Mrs. Sámuel Kállai came to the witness’s house and sat next to Mrs. Jóna in an armchair on the porch. Mrs. Jóna told Mrs. Kállai, “Listen, Mrs. Kállai, tomorrow you will have to send me some carp. She replied: Where should I get it? I can’t buy any myself; I’ll send you some other kind of fish. Mrs. Kállai then got up and left, and Mrs. Jóna shouted after her, “Do you hear me Mrs. Kállai! you better do what I told you, you bitch!”71 Mrs. Mihály Jóna, when asking for the ribbon, the chicken, the bonnet and the fish, was protesting about failures to provide the customary privileges due to the “healer women”. Her patients, however, when afflicted by an illness following their dispute with Mrs. Jóna, all considered it to be her bewitchment, and thus liberated themselves from the guilt felt from having violated a custom, and arguing against those expectations. Another way for placing healers and midwives in a situation where they would gain a reputation for witchcraft, one which occurred in Debrecen quite frequently from the end of the seventeenth century, was apparently a result of rivalry among magical specialists. We can reasonably assume that within the wave of newcomers resettling in the city during and after the period of Ottoman rule, there were a fair number of popular healers and midwives, who had to earn their authority in rivalry with one another and with their counterparts already practicing in Debrecen. One way to achieve this, as is confirmed by the above-mentioned case of Mrs. György Kis who moved there from Böszörmény, was to boast about their knowledge wherever they could; they tried to outbid the skills of the rival healer and in order to earn and secure the trust of their patients they openly qualified their rivals as witches. The traces of such a rivalry are to be found in the background of the trial of Mrs. András Bartha, a healer woman from Új Street, starting in 1725. Mrs. Bartha lived on the same street as the healer woman Mrs. Győző Marosi, with whom she had apparently entered conflict over healing the same patient. Mrs. Marosi told the story as follows: “About 2 years ago one of Mrs. Dóka’s children was ill and was treated by Mrs. Bartha; Mrs. Dóka called the witness to take a look. The witness was not aware of Mrs. Bartha having already treated the child, so she went to take a look. On her way home she ran into Mrs. Bartha. She said, “Where are you going? you walk like a horseman, I am mad at you.” The witness said, “Why are you angry with me? I have never done anything to hurt you.” She replied, yes you have, because you meddled with my



40 I.S. KRISTóF
work and went to see the child of Mrs. Dóka...” and she threatened the witness, saying, “Just you wait, you’ll regret it!” She scolded her, “you are no better healer than I, because I can heal anyone I want to, no matter what the patient is suffering from.” The following day, according to the testimony of Mrs. Marosi, the crows pecked her bread and cheese, and after she ate it, she became ill. She obviously attributed this to her conflict with Mrs. Bartha.72 One significant role in the rivalry and mutual accusation of healers was that the patients—as we have seen in the case of Mrs. Dóka—did not stay with one specialist, but went from one to the other, and they were easily persuaded to confirm suspicions of witchcraft concerning the less successful healer. The best example for this phenomenon is the case of the Újvárosi Szabó couple, residents of Péterfia Street who, between 1715 and 1725, were accusers in no less than four witchcraft trials, against three healer women and the already mentioned Mrs. Márton Rácz. In 1715 Mrs. János Újvárosi Szabó made an accusation against Mrs. Mihály Kis, the healer from Varga Street; in 1718 she accused Kata Szabó, also a healer from Varga Street; in 1725 it was Mrs. András Bartha from Új Street whom she accused, partly for being able to heal neither herself, nor her husband, and this also developed into a witchcraft accusation.73 According to the 1725 trial records, Mrs. Bartha identified the “fairhaired fat red woman” living in the same district, Mrs. Márton Rácz the Újvárosi couple’s neighbor in Péterfia Street, as the one who had bewitched them. She had uttered the following words when refusing to continue Mrs. Újvárosi’s treatment: “Well, Mrs. János Szabó, last year I encouraged you that I was going to heal you, but I won’t encourage you any longer, because a blond fat red woman came here in green coat, green bonnet and blue skirt, she moved in across your house in the same row as the smith, and she would not let me heal you... But beware of her, because on the third day, if she can take something from your house or from your merchandise, she will take it, but don’t give anything to her, because if she is able to take something no one will ever be able to heal you.” Mrs. Újvárosi related to the court in the most vivid terms her encounter with Mrs. Rácz: how the suspicion Mrs. Bartha had planted in her grew to fill her soul: “The witness was sat next to her few goods for sale in the market when Mrs. Márton Rácz and Mrs. Harsányi came straight up to her and stopped in front of her stand. One of them, she did not remember which, picked up a piece of linen, and Mrs. Rácz said, “My



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 41
dear neighbor, give me linen enough for a shirt.” The witness was horrified, she remembered Mrs. Bartha’s words, and suddenly replied, “I have no linen for you, you don’t need it anyway...” Mrs. Rácz stood there for a while with the merchandise, then left all of a sudden without saying a word to anyone. Mrs. Újvárosi thus saw her suspicions confirmed, and in the witch trial she claimed to be the victim of Mrs. Márton Rácz. Nonetheless, she also testified against Mrs. Bartha, who was unable to heal her, and who was offended because, while she was still her patient, she went to see the barber in Zilah (Zalău). Accusations were also laid at Mrs. Bartha by Mrs. Újvárosi’s husband, who claimed that Mrs. Bartha had become angry with him, as well, for taking his wife to Zilah. One night Újvárosi “felt an agonizing pain: around midnight he was struggling with a woman [who] twisted his male member really badly.”74 Naturally, he believed that he recognized Mrs. Bartha in the woman. The Péterfia Street censuses between 1728 and 1730 reveal much about the real problems of the often sickly Újvárosi Szabó family, who frequently resorted to witchcraft accusations. Újvárosi was registered in the 1728 census as a small trader, with only one bowshot of land and a vineyard of the same size. Even though he lived in a house qualified as “mediocre”, every sign suggests that he was gradually going broke. In 1730, for instance, the census takers no longer mention his trading activities, merely writing that he “lived off his four horses”, and that he had one cow less than before. It seemed as if his personal life had also been full of tragedies. While in 1728 he still lived with his son, according to the census in 1730 “all his household had left him”, and they also noted that “his wife was mentally disturbed”, which could be an explanation for their frequent witchcraft accusations.75 Rivalry between neighboring “healer women”, patients seeking treatment from several healers, personal tragedies of the victims, neighborly animosities and breaking the norm of the “God-fearing honest woman” all appeared in the trial conducted by the magistrate in 1730 against five accused inhabitants of Upper Debrecen. The indictment documents of the trials of the “healer women” Mrs. Mihály Jóna from Mester Street and Mrs. András Nagy from Hatvan Street, and of three other persons from Mester Street (Mrs. András Vezendi, Mrs. Péter Kovács and Mrs. János Szentesi) interpreted the events as follows: the accused “started to trade with God-fearing Christian people as part of her pact with the Devil, with the help of similar evil companions. After she bewitched somebody, she had her companion tell them to go and



42 I.S. KRISTóF
see this or that healer who would be able to solve their problems, and in exchange for payment that person healed people who were bewitched by her companions. They were able to heal with the permission of the other companions.”76 The truth behind the conflicts which reached their conclusion in the 1730 trial was actually completely different from what the indictment document reveals, and could be traced back along multiple strands to a much earlier period. The lodger of Mrs. János Nagy in Péterfia Street, the widow of András Vezendi, had been sued by her neighbor, Mrs. Péter Kovács back in 1719, because Mrs. Vezendi had falsely accused her of witchcraft.77 Mrs. Vezendi was then looking for a cause behind her child’s and her own illness, and, as it later turned out, “Péter Tátos” from Hajdúnánás and the healer woman from Gelse, Mrs. Majláth, both diverted the suspicion to Mrs. Péter Kovács: “the one who lives three houses from her place, she is the one who ate her child.”78 Mrs. Kovács probably won the trial and Mrs. Vezendi was probably sentenced to pay a fine for slander. I do not know if there was anything more to the conflict between the two women; Mrs. Vezendi, nonetheless, was still accusing Mrs. Kovács in 1730, who was sued by the court. Mrs. András Nagy lived in Hatvan Street and had a reputation as a healer. She proudly bragged that she had learned her skill from her mother. Her past, however, had been blemished several times, which might have been a factor in her reputation as a witch. Her father had been punished earlier for unknown reasons. The daughter tried in vain to prevent his conviction by magical means: “she took sand and herbs from the bellies of nine dead people and scattered them on the thresholds of the town hall.” In 1726 she was also punished for having committed adultery with a widowed man called István Mellyes. Her husband, who was not leading an exemplary life either, took her back, but the memory of this incident apparently dogged her for a long time. In the 1730 trial several of their neighbors testified to their frequent quarrels, mutually accusing each other of leading an immoral life: “Mrs. András Nagy said to her husband: you are a rogue. He replied: you are a whore. To this she said: that other time you drowned that woman with her child [i.e. András Nagy’s mistress]. The husband replied: and your daughter, it was not me who made her, I saw when you made her with someone else.”79 During these fights András Nagy often reproached his wife, saying that the their daughter was not his but that of her former lover, Mellyes; he



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 43
also accused his wife of having bewitched him in the course of her trial as a witch: he was “suffering, has no virility and desire, and could never inseminate a woman.” Mrs. András Nagy treated patients both in the street where she lived and in Mester Street. Her damaged reputation might have favored the other healer woman who had recently moved to Mester Street, Mrs. Mihály Jóna, who thus hoped to acquire Mrs. Nagy’s patients and so that she could build her own extended clientele. At least in the beginning; as we will see, she later had her own reputation problems, among other troubles. In the spring of 1727 the Jóna butcher family was still living in Csapó Street, where on 27 March their slaughterhouse was set on fire.80 I was not able to discover the background to the affair; according to documents the fire devoured the greater part of the town. Jóna’s house was probably also burnt to the ground, because in the winter of the same year they were already residents of Mester Street. There they bought the house of the debt-ridden Gergely Dömsödi, a failed tailor. In 1746, at the request of his sons, his debts were assessed, and witnesses stated that most of his wealth had been estimated on the basis of claims by the trimmers of Kassa (Košice). Besides the people from Kassa, Dömsödi was indebted to many others. According to neighbors’ testimonies “his house... and many parts of his land, his horses, his carriage and other cattle and even his wooden shaft were due to be assessed by his creditors. Gergely Dömsödi was probably left with nothing outside his debt, he could not leave anything to his offspring... he did not have enough to pay for a proper burial for his stepmother, she was buried in her under-garment.” The poor tailor “ended up in such poverty that he could barely provide bread for himself.”81 It never transpired whether the Jóna family had paid his debts in Kassa and to the other creditors in order to buy his house, or if they took on his debt with the house. It is certain, however, that they turned the Dömsödi family into their own debtors and they threw them out of the house. The bankrupted couple was probably taken in by one of their neighbors in the street. The desperate Dömsödi couple, however, did not give up their home easily to the Jóna family; or if it had to be given to them, they wanted to cause some trouble as the Jónas set up residence. In 1727 Mihály Jóna wrote a letter to the tribunal because “Mrs. Dömsödi had the hedge destroyed in front of their eyes, she cut down the plants in front of the house... she said unseemly things so that the



44 I.S. KRISTóF
whole street could hear... she cursed heavily, saying, ‘you will see, you will never have God’s blessing on this estate, and He shall never give it!’ She also told the house servant, ‘[Jóna] shall never live in peace in this house... I would rather see the house burn, than to see him stay here.’” Mrs. Dömsödi considered the fire in the spring also to be among Jóna’s sins: “No wonder that God had this town burn twice, I’m afraid we will [burn] for a third time as well.”82 By this she probably meant, as I have mentioned earlier, that the fire was God’s punishment for the Jóna family’s sins. After the Jóna family settled in Gergely, Dömsödi tried to provide for his wife and daughter and to pay his debts—among others to Jóna—as a “meadow inspector”, that is, a keeper. In the witch trial, his wife stated that they had also given axes in pawn to the Jóna family. One time, when Mrs. Jóna came to pick up the axes, the desperate Dömsödi wanted to beat her—“to axe her”, as the woman phrased it in front of the courtbut the axes, for an inexplicable supernatural reason, were nowhere to be found, and only appeared after Mrs. Jóna was gone. Mrs. Jóna’s interpretation of the incident was that the reason Dömsödi could not find the axes was not her witchcraft, but his own drunkenness. By the time of the witch trial in 1730, Gergely Dömsödi was no longer alive. He must have died at a young age, because his wife at this time was also only 30 years old. He might have ended his own miserable life: Mrs. Dömsödi, nevertheless, attributed all their troubles and the death of her husband to Mrs. Jóna; she also believed that it was Mrs. Jóna’s bewitchment that was responsible for her daughter’s having “no luck”, and being unable to find herself a husband. She complained in front of the court that “neither her, nor her daughter had peace of mind during the night” because of Mrs. Jóna, and that “she had found some things that were put inside her own pillow.” In December 1727, another note was sent to the tribunal from Mester street. It was written by the farmer József Kálmánczy, who had become the Jóna family’s immediate neighbor when they moved in. Kálmánczy gathered the testimonies of four other neighbors to list his problems with the Jóna family. The conflict stemmed apparently from the disagreement on where to set the fence between their properties. It is possible that Kálmánczy had tried to ensure a bigger piece of land for himself, assuming that the new neighbors would not know the exact size of the property they had just bought. According to the document Jóna and his wife “declared themselves judges of the matter and obstructed



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 45
[Kálmánczy] from weaving the fence”; moreover, they destroyed what he had already woven and stole his sticks. This, obviously, led to fierce quarrels between the two parties. Kálmánczy informed the court about Jóna and his wife not going to church, and that they lived a scandalous life, quarrelling frequently: “Mihály Jóna claimed that his wife was an arsonist witch whore, and told her that he would have her burnt the next day.” Kálmánczy also informed the magistrate: “Since [Jóna and his wife] have threatened me, I protest that, should any damage happen to my house, myself, my servants, my wife or my cattle, I will hold them responsible, since they were the ones who threatened me.”83 The neighbors, including Kálmánczy, were annoyed by the fact that when the Jóna family bought the house of Dömsödi, they had violated the legal custom prevailing at the time in Debrecen, namely that anyone intending to sell a house should give the neighbors first refusal. Quite the opposite: the Jóna family who, moreover, were considered strangers in the street, had moved in right away. Three years later, Kálmánczy accused Mrs. Jóna in her witch trial of her wanting to poison him and his family; he had found “poison” in one of his pots. The second wife of Kálmánczy had died before the witch trial. When they put her in the grave next to his first wife, they allegedly found a “new pierced pot with its lid” by the head of the deceased, which they interpreted as further proof of Mrs. Jóna’s witchcraft. In her witch trial, Kálmánczy held his neighbor responsible for the death of both of his wives. Another neighbor testifying in the 1727 interrogatory, the wife of Mátyás Csermák, also testified against Mrs. Jóna 3 years later in front of the court. She said that “someone bit my neck during the night in my sleep”, and she believed she recognized Mrs. Jóna in the perpetrator, who “had a dog catch all the hens in the neighborhood, and when she was reproached for it, she became angry and cursed.” The dog was eventually shot by Kálmánczy himself. Thus, the suspicions against the Jóna family were aroused from the moment of their tempestuous arrival in the neighborhood; their neighbors were very likely to attribute their misfortunes and troubles to the Jóna couple. Mihály Jóna had “only” violated custom when he bought the house in Mester Street before the neighbors had been consulted; his wife, on the other hand, who also pursued activities as a healer woman, was known to be a norm-breaker and a person “of ill repute”. Besides her avoiding church, several witnesses testified to her frequent



46 I.S. KRISTóF
drunkenness, adultery, profanity, some even accusing her of irreligiousness. One of them “heard that Jóna disparaged her wife, saying she was a witch whore, he also said that he was going to have her banished from Debrecen, because she had called her husband a son of a bitch. When the husband of the witness heard all this cursing, he told her that the Lord Almighty would punish her. [Mrs. Jóna] replied greatly annoyed: where is God? She blasphemed terribly and she has nothing godly in her; sometimes when her husband admonished her she had slapped him or tried to strangle him: it was the witness’s husband who had rescued him.” Eventually it was not the angry and suspicious neighbors who sued Mrs. Jóna, but a patient from Hatvan street, János Jenei. Jenei and his wife first sought healing from Mrs. András Nagy, but then they changed to Mrs. Jóna. Mrs. Jóna naturally accused the former healer, Mrs. András Nagy, of having bewitched the Jenei couple. Mrs. Nagy, when she heard that their new healer was Mrs. Jóna, said: “If only you [Jenei] hadn’t called that horrible woman, I would have finished it.” The third accused in the trial, Mrs. Vezendi, an old widowed lodger, appeared often at the side of Mrs. Jóna, trying to reinforce her reputation as a healer. This was visibly with the sole goal of taking a share of the privileges due to “healer women”: wine, brandy, and food. When, however, Jenei—whose illness did not get any better—started to suspect Mrs. Jóna, interestingly Mrs. Vezendi also turned away from her, and started to contribute to the suspicions laid by Jenei. She said, for instance, in their presence: “I would put my hand on her head and even swear in front of the council that she is a true witch; she is also teaching the profession to her son.” For the complete picture we should add that Mrs. Jóna had a handicapped son: he was very short and had a very big head. Allegedly his head had once split open when a neighbor’s dog had jumped on him, and Mrs. Jóna had boasted to others, saying that she had “put him back together”. János Jenei, when he finally became completely confused about the three mutually accusing women, had hidden three of his neighbors in the house and invited Mrs. Jóna and Mrs. Vezendi to come over. He diverted the conversation to Mrs. András Nagy, and reproached Mrs. Jóna: “you poisoned me together, now heal me together.” Mrs. Jóna, perhaps out of anger, confirmed this by saying: “We poisoned you together and we’ll heal you together, just pay us.” Then the hidden neighbors came out and grabbed Mrs. Jóna to take her to the judges.



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 47
The woman had sighed: “Oh, oh, I wish your good wine was lost, you have invited me to a bad dinner.”84 Eventually Mrs. Mihály Jóna was sentenced by the tribunal to be banished from town, as was Mrs. András Vezendi. The verdict on Mrs. András Nagy and the other two accused is unknown. Similar to the 1725 trial of Mrs. András Bartha, it was once again the rivalry of the “healer women” living close to one another and trying to acquire each others patients, and the resultant loss of confidence on the part of their patients that all played a significant role in escalation of events into a witchcraft trial. In the case of Mrs. Vezendi, Mrs. Nagy and especially Mrs. Jóna, the witnesses’ testimonies revealed situations of conflict exacerbated by multiple tensions such as we have observed in the case of the above-discussed group of accused witches “of ill repute”. Apparently, the dangerous relations generating suspicion of witchcraft also frequently occurred cumulatively in the case of women healers, even though the maleficium narratives told during the witch trials either keep silent about these relations, or only represent the existence of one or two such connections. Beyond the incidents I have described—at least in the case of Debrecen—there was another conflict latently influencing the adjudication of the specialists of magic and stemming from contemporary local cultural and social history, which was also rarely mentioned explicitly in the maleficium narratives: the issue of ‘legitimate’ and ‘illegitimate’ healing and midwifery. Behind the issue, phrased by a Debrecen magistrate in 1730, lies the accusation, among others, according to which the accused ‘healer women’, by ‘trading’ the illnesses of their patients among one another, were not only exploiting the gullibility of their patients but also violating the sphere of interest of the representatives of ‘legitimate healing’. This occurred, on the one hand, through their intention to meddle with the function of divine providence, and thus desecrating the mostly prioritized spiritual sphere of the legitimate healing methods of the time. On the other hand, they were (literally) intruding into the physical and material sphere of legal practitioners of these healing methods: the barbers, who were considered to be the official healers of ‘external’ illnesses, and the physicians, who had the privilege of treating ‘internal’ maladies. It is noteworthy that the gradual institutionalization of healthcare took place in the course of centuries when witch-hunting was in its prime. The example from Debrecen suggests that the two phenomena



48 I.S. KRISTóF
were not independent from one another, and that the gradual and increasingly articulate distinction between the ‘legitimate’ activities and those qualified as ‘illegitimate’, explicitly or not, became manifested in the witch trials. In Hungary, until the establishment of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Nagyszombat (Trnava) in 1769–1772, there was no university-level medical, surgical or midwifery training.85 These professions gradually created their organized structures over the course of the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries, the institutionalization of the different fields occurring with varying intensity—usually primarily in urban environments. In the market town of Debrecen the concentration into guilds of the surgical profession took place quite early—fourth after Tokaj, Nagybánya (Baia Mare) and Sárospatak. The first guild regulation was published in 1583. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, however, only nine masters, and approximately 30 people in all including apprentices, servants and the widows of masters, were allowed to practice the profession in a town of more than ten thousand inhabitants. The profession of barbers, according to guild regulations, specialized in the healing of injuries from being hit, cut, shot, etc., or some other “external” impact, and of furunculous, pustular diseases visible on the surface of the body. The new guild regulation from the beginning of the eighteenth century only reinforced the traditions: again, they maximized the number of barbers at only nine.86 Debrecen had no official physician until the beginning of the eighteenth century. In the seventeenth century, medicine was only practiced by some preachers who had acquired a diploma from foreign universities and by some college teachers.87 The first medical office was established only after Debrecen acquired the title of free royal city in 1700. The office was first occupied by István Huszti Szabó, the court physician of Prince Mihály Apafi, who had studied his profession in Germany and the Netherlands; although he only stayed in office for 4 years. Apparently the office was occupied on a regular basis only from the 1730s. From this period onward, on the other hand, there were prestigious figures practicing in the city, such as János András Segner (in 1730), who later became a professor at the University of Jena; György Buzinkai (from 1737) who graduated in Franeker and wrote an up-to-date dissertation on the prevention and the treatment of the plague; István Hatvani, who had by then acquired a many-sided scientific education



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 49
(from the end of the 1740s); István Weszprémi (from the 1760s) who graduated in Utrecht, and had correspondence with van Swieten, court physician of Maria Theresa and one of the great opponents of witchhunting; finally, the stepson of the latter, József Csapó, who published a book on medicinal herbs and a dissertation on pediatrics.88 The first pharmacy was established around 1670 and financed by the city; then, in 1714 it was placed under the supervision of the medical officer. Until the 1770s, one single pharmacy was supposed to supply several thousands of inhabitants of Debrecen with medications. This, however, as the shortage of medication during the 1739–1741 plague epidemic shows, was insufficient. The second pharmacy was established only in 1772.89 A hospice for the poor operated from the beginning of the sixteenth century in Debrecen; a newer establishment was founded in the seventeenth century, and during the 1739–1741 plague epidemic the city doctors established a temporary health centre. A permanent hospital, however, was only established in the first half of the nineteenth century.90 Considering the rather low early modern standards of institutionalized, official healthcare, popular medicine must have satisfied a wide range of social demands. These alternative healing methods were still flourishing in the eighteenth century, as the one single health officer and the nine barbers were hardly able to treat every patient in a city inhabited by thousands. The process of increasing institutionalization and of improvement, however, also had an impact on the adjudication of the activities of popular healers: the barbers, and then particularly the eighteenth century physicians declared their healing methods to be ‘illegitimate’, as were their interpretations of illnesses in the context of witchcraft. In the case of Debrecen, one can clearly recognize the process in which, during the eighteenth century, the official physicians required more and more barbers and midwives to distinguish their activities from those of the ‘illegitimate’ equivalents, whose pursuits they considered useless (being based on superstitious instruments and concepts). The city physicians in the eighteenth century not only obtained supervision of pharmacies, but abiding by certain central regulations, they tried to control the activities of barbers and midwives, and sought to improve their level of training. While, in case of a serious injury, the sixteenth and seventeenth century barbers’ guild regulations only prescribed that the barber treating a patient should inform the guild master who had to have a consultation about the patient (“call the guild on



50 I.S. KRISTóF
him”), the 1736 guild regulations approved by Charles III state that “the presence of a Doctor is required” in such cases. The new regulation also stipulated that “if patients with external wounds and injuries require internal medicine, the barbers are not allowed to prescribe any medication without the advice of a doctor, other than decoctum, purgation or sudatory”, and it strictly ordained that “without a word from the Doctor, one cannot even perform a venesection on difficult patients”.91 In the 1750s and 1760s the decrees of the Royal Council of Governors ordered that those who wished to join the barbers’ guild would have to pass a higher level exam than before (knowing how to prepare six ointments), and they have to do that in front of official physicians. Moreover, the 1761 regulation made it compulsory for barbers to pass a theoretical exam on the anatomy of the human body and on illnesses.92 We have to note the 1761 regulation issued by the city of Debrecen in which they modified the subject of examination of barbers according to the requirements of the Royal Council of Governors. The Chirurgorum Examen was compiled by the physician István Weszprémi in a ‘question and answer’ format, from which we learn that the profession of barbers was associated with the healing of “infirmities, lesions, fractures, sprains, lumps, furuncles or ulcers treatable by hand, external instruments and external medication”. Weszprémi’s exam questions were especially directed at the last of these. He demanded that barbers think rationally when treating pimples and pustules, as if he was instructing them to reject the standpoint of “healer women”, who qualified these infirmities as maleficium. For example: “Question 87. What do you think of people with wounded legs who claim that they have stepped into a ‘pouring’ (öntés = a kind of ‘liquid’ magical harm that causes illness) or that they have been bewitched? Answer: These lesions are called Ulcera Magica or fascinatio inducta, they are inventions of superstitious minds, because all these lesions have natural causes. One cannot attribute them to the Devil or to witches because God has not given them such powers.”93 The profession of midwifery was only institutionalized in Debrecen from the beginning of the eighteenth century, although we know of a council regulation from 1696 which obliged them to take an oath: “Midwives, who thus far have practiced their profession without faith and without order, should now be bound to their service by faith, for being more righteous, pure and honest in their office.”94 The guildlike institution itself, the ‘Association of Old Women of Debrecen’,



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 51
was founded only in 1738. It was directed by two ‘master women’ and supervised by the city physician. The endeavour to consciously distinguish ‘legitimate’ from ‘illegitimate’ activity also occurred in the case of midwives, on the one hand, in the establishment of the midwife guild itself and also in the fact that the ‘old women’ were required to take an exam in front of a physician before entering the guild. On the other hand, and almost significantly, it became a requirement for practicing the profession that the midwives “abstain from any superstitious act and whispering around childbirth, because if someone is caught doing so she will be punished and disbarred from the profession.”95 The institutionalization of public healthcare and the improvement of its standards in Debrecen however did not directly correlate with the dismissal of witchcraft beliefs and the end of witch trials—as Ágnes R. Várkonyi has proposed to be the case on a national scale. While in the eighteenth century, the city physicians’ fight against ‘illegitimate’ healing and midwifery by denouncing magical tools and concepts was indeed associated with an enlightening activity in the name of rationality, the barber’s guild and the midwife’s guild apparently often looked upon the struggle against ‘illegal’ healers and midwifes as mere rivalry—maybe on the basis of the traditional pattern of the competition among the specialists of magic. A most efficient instrument in this fight turned out, again, to be accusations of witchcraft. In the case of the midwives’ guild, considering that its existence as an organized structure came about rather late, it is understandable that such accusations only came at this point; by contrast, in the case of the barbers’ guild, which had existed since the sixteenth century, some explanation is required as to why the guild members only started to appear as accusers in the eighteenth century. Naturally one cannot exclude the possibility that the rivalry between guild healers and popular healers had been present in the form of witchcraft accusation in earlier periods as well; the difference being that trial documents did not record the occupation of the accusers. There is, however, another explanation, which, in my opinion, is just as plausible. After the end of Ottoman rule, however, when the town earned the rights of a free royal city and had to integrate into the new centralized state order, the barbers, similar to many other guilds, had to reinforce their guild regulations in order to maintain their privileges. This happened in 1736 with the aforementioned modification that the new guild regulation allowed a greater involvement of physicians



52 I.S. KRISTóF
in the activities of barbers. Over the course of the eighteenth century the guild was gradually placed under the supervision of the city physician practicing in the spirit of centralized health regulation. The pressure thus weighing down on them, the mistrust of the medical officer towards their professional skills could explain why, at this point, the barbers turned against popular healers with greater energy than before, and why they tried to keep their patients by every means—even if this meant resorting to witchcraft accusations. It seems, thus, that witch-hunting in Debrecen was “enriched” with a new aspect in the first half of the eighteenth century. The ‘legitimate’ representatives of healthcare contributed to the intensification of this persecution after Ottoman rule. Between 1735 and 1759 53 witchcraft accusations were made in Debrecen: in 18 cases the accusation was against popular healers and in seven cases against midwives. Thus, almost half of the witchcraft accusations targeted the representatives of ‘illegitimate’ healing and midwifery. Let us look at some examples. Mrs. János Csutó was accused of sorcery in 1745. The woman was reported by the barbers’ guild itself: “In the name of the honest Guild of Barbers the guild master proposes to punish Mrs. Csutó, who undertook the healing of a little girl who had broken her hand when she fell on the ice. She has been treating her for 16 weeks, and this has worsened her injury even more.”96 János Kis, a “shepherd doctor” from Berekböszörmény who moved to Debrecen without the knowledge of the council, was sued five times between 1743 and 1748. His first suit in 1743 stated that “He practices medicine, while he lacks the knowledge to do so and he is more fit to do agricultural work; he acts against the privileges of the honest barbers’ guild in other ways as well, and perhaps he performs his healing with charms.” Several of his patients mentioned that they had turned to him after the barbers had failed to heal them. For instance, one of them said that “The chin of a poor woman dropped, we took her to Mr. Kémeri, who wanted to call the guild, [but] János Kis put it back.” Another patient “had his arm dislocated after falling off a horse. Mr. Veszprémi and Mr. Kopácsi treated him for 3 weeks with no result; this poor man healed him in 3 days.” Such cases obviously strongly undermined the professional authority of barbers; moreover, according to the witnesses some people were even afraid to seek their help in the first place. The third patient of János Kis, for instance, said: “The bones in my hand were broken, because I fell off a tree; Mr. Veszprémi and Mr. Borbély wanted to call the guild,



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 53
but I did not dare to let them treat me, because they only healed with vinegar. It was this poor man who healed me.” In 1743, however, the barbers could not get János Kis convicted for sorcery.97 In May of the same year they also accused him of drunkenness and blasphemy, and of “cheating and seducing everything in the name of healing”. They were only able to rid Debrecen of him by December, when the court banished him from the city.98 That notwithstanding, in November 1746 a new trial was conducted against him. The tribunal asked the barbers to report on him if he had “healed someone despite the ban”.99 In vain was he banished from the city once again: 1 year later he was standing in front of the council once more. This time his wife, whom he had left in Berekböszörmény, came to get him. He was proscribed again.100 Two years later he returned to the city. This time he was accused of causing the death of one of his patients; according to the indictment “he gave such a strong beverage [to the patient] that he vomited a deal of congealed blood.” The beverage was examined by the city physician, György Buzinkay himself, according to whom “it was terrifying to look at it, let alone to taste it.” According to the testimony of János Kis it was a concoction against a cold, and it must have been effective, since “it was made of ginger, cloves and honey.” The ‘shepherd doctor’ was probably banished from the city once again; and since these are the last data on his activities in Debrecen, it seems as if the barbers’ guild had finally succeeded in getting rid of their competitor.101 The widow of Sámuel Szathmári, who practiced ‘illegitimate’ midwifery, was reported to the tribunal by the ‘Association of Old Women of Debrecen’ in 1744. She was accused of “healing with charms and magic, and having called sworn midwives, namely Mrs. Aranyi and Mrs. Garai, to be witches”, and of “telling misleading nonsense and lies...about a huge toad, which lay on her chest during the night, and who was no other than Mrs. Aranyi.” Mrs. Sámuel Szathmári moved to Debrecen, illegally, as a newcomer. She was born in Nagyenyed (Aiud), and married in Kolozsvár (Cluj-Napoca), but her husband became a major in the Pálfi regiment and left her. After that she lived in Nagybánya (Baia Mare) and Diószeg (Tuta), and earned her living from midwifery and healing. She wished to continue practicing her profession at her arrival to Debrecen, and as we have seen in the case of many other ‘healer women’, she boasted about her skills, and called her rivals witches. However, she forgot one thing: that at this point, behind the midwives Mrs. Aranyi, Mrs. Garai and Mrs. János Oláh, whom she had denounced as witches, stood



54 I.S. KRISTóF
the ‘legitimate’ institution of the midwives’ guild protecting them. It was especially unfortunate that she had been bragging about her magical skills in the presence of one of the matrons of the Association, Mrs. István Zsíros, and her daughter: “What kind of an old woman are you, Mrs. Zsíros, that you cannot do it; if you wanted you could arrange that the parents had their next child 2, 3, 4 or 6 years later.” Because according to Mrs. Szathmári the number of knots one tied in the umbilical cord was equivalent to the number of years before the mother would have another child. At her trial one of the witnesses against Mrs. Szathmári was none other than the inspector of the midwives’ guild, and swornin midwives also interrogated her on her professional knowledge (for instance, on what she knew about blood flow). Since her knowledge did not meet the then required standards of ‘legitimate’ midwifery, and she was also convicted of some kind of magical act, the magistrate sentenced her to be flogged with 24 lashes and banished from Debrecen.102 As well as the case of Mrs. Szathmári there are other trials that also confirm the protection the midwives’ guild provided to its members against witchcraft accusations. Mrs. György Aranyi, the wife of a bootmaker and a sworn midwife, who had come out unharmed from the previous trial as well, was sued several times between 1740 and 1746. In 1740 she was accused of “having charmed and bewitched a child because the parents did not call her to the childbirth, as they had done before; she tied him with nine knots... the tiny infant miraculously jumped off her mother’s lap.” Mrs. Aranyi denied the ‘superstition’, and claimed that the child “had fallen off her mother’s lap because the mother was drunk.” She most probably won the trial, and was not relieved of her office, because in 1741 and 1742 she appeared again as a sworn midwife in the new proceedings against her.103 In 1742 she initiated a slander suit against the bootmaker’s wife, Mrs. Ferenc Fónyi, for calling her a witch. Despite eventually losing the trial, because her accusers proved that “she wanted to heal [Mrs. Fónyi’s child] by binding nine knots and she had performed several magical acts as well”, once again she could stay in office, only receiving a caution.104 In 1746 she was eventually suspended from exercising the profession of midwifery because, as the trial documents put it, she rarely went to see the women after childbirth, and she exhausted them. Witchcraft was not even discussed.105 Mrs. János Oláh, a sworn midwife, launched a slander suit in 1749 against János Pesti and his kinsman, Mihály Csóka. Mrs. Oláh had assisted the wife of János Pesti after childbirth. When the newborn baby



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 55
became ill, the Pesti couple took the infant to the ‘shepherd doctor’ from Hadház, who identified the midwife as the bewitcher of the baby. After this Pesti and Csóka called Mrs. Oláh over and Mihály Csóka called her a “diabolical witch”. The trial was once again won by the sworn midwife, who enjoyed the protection of the guild, and the defendants were punished. Csóka was sentenced to eighteen strokes of the birch for having called her “diabolical”. In addition, a new investigation was started against János Pesti and Panda Sós, who suggested turning to the ‘shepherd doctor’, and for “acting against their Christian duty and seeking the help of a charming sorcerer.”106 No similar witch trials suggesting the conflicts between ‘legitimate’ and ‘illegitimate’ healing or midwifery were found in other places in Bihar County. This is presumably because neither of the two professions had reached a level of institutionalization similar to that of Debrecen, not even in the market towns. According to the research of Gyula Varga, in the market town of Kismarja there was only one barber active in the eighteenth century, and only two or three women performed the function of sworn midwives.107 In Berettyóújfalu we know of only one midwife from 1721 and one ‘physician man’.108 In Konyár in the eighteenth century there were only a few ‘bonesmiths’ (bonesetters) exercising healing.”109 There were no guilds for barbers or midwives in operation in the smaller settlements of the county, or if there were, they were not really institutionalized. The healer-midwife-patient relationship, and the circumstances of their interaction in early modern Debrecen implied some kind of uncertainty. The trials that we have examined reveal quickly dissolving and quickly reestablished relationships, as is perhaps best illustrated by the case of Mrs. János Szabó from Újváros. Going from one healer to another often resulted in the former healer being accused of witchcraft. The witchcraft accusation in this case reassured the patients and their relatives that it was not the illness that was incurable, but the specialist who had been inadequate. The competing healers, as we have seen, only confirmed these opinions when they tried to build or defend their prestige by identifying other specialists as witches. In the long run, however, this type of rivalry might in fact have entailed the decline of their prestige. We have seen that several witch trials started with the confused patient not being able to make head or tail of the mutually accusing healers, reporting both of them to the court under suspicion of witchcraft (as for example András Szabó in 1694 or János Jenei in 1730).



56 I.S. KRISTóF
Existing or future patients may have heard of the reputation as witch of many of the healers in their surroundings, as they might also have heard condemning opinions emanating from representatives of institutionalized, ‘legitimate’ healing, supported ‘from the top’ by the magistrate and the tribunal. Over the course of the eighteenth century these representatives tried to convince them with increasing vigour of the fact that traditional healers and midwives were—in the better cases‘superstitious’ people, or worse, as we have seen in the case of the barbers’ or midwives’ guild, that they were witches. Under such circumstances, I believe that the chances were pretty high that the trust of the people of Debrecen in the traditional specialists of positive magic would have wavered. The aforementioned conflicts could be related to this change in perception, which was partly due to the victims violating social norms apparently supervised by healers and midwives, and partly due to the traditional privileges and traditional requirements expected by these healers failing to be provided. The fact that the victims attributed any problems occurring after such conflicts entirely to specialists in positive magic indicates that to a certain extent the population had turned its back upon these specialists and rejected the norms relating to them. The witchcraft accusations appear as if they represented a change in the mentality of Debrecen: instead of the traditional expectations, they point towards a new kind of norm. We can say the same thing about the cases in which the ‘legitimate’ healer barbers and midwives used witchcraft accusations to get rid of their ‘illegitimate’ rivals. The accusation—paradoxically—once again favored the new, the establishment and reinforcement of the official and institutionalized framework of urban healthcare. At least this is what is revealed by the maleficium narratives, which in this perspective were created in a well-discernible sociocultural environment.
ProbLems of neighborhood, Cohabitation and Poverty
Mátyás Nógrádi describes ‘humble status’ as being one of the features of the popular witch stereotype. Poverty, as the preacher claimed, predisposes people to resort to magic. Imre Haász, an early researcher of the Debrecen witch trials, was of a similar opinion concerning the accused in the city: “the unfortunate victims of witchcraft beliefs usually came from the lower social strata.”110



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 57
Neither in Debrecen, nor in other parts of the county were the witch trials well documented enough for me to assess the role of poverty in the emergence of witchcraft accusations. I found it opportune to treat the scattered relevant data in terms of the category of cohabitation and neighborhood, since the majority of poor witches were lodgers. The relationship between the victim and the witch in the known cases, as we have seen, was mostly defined by cohabitation or neighborhood. The former occurred in 38.57% of the spatial relations in Debrecen and 37.03% in the county, while the latter can be found in 63.26% of the Debrecen cases and 33.33% in the county. The conflicts between people living in the vicinity of each otherneighbor and neighbor, lodger and landlord—and the accusations of witchcraft accusations originating from them have already been illustrated through several examples from the trials we have examined. Furthermore, a specific type of accusation, from ‘above’, where the landlord accused his lodgers of witchcraft, seems to have been somewhat common, especially in Debrecen. Being a lodger truly did entail a ‘humble status’, both in the city and in the other market towns and villages of the county. Lodgers did not own a house and, as the examples from Debrecen confirm, they did not have the same rights and privileges as the full citizens. The inhabitants of Debrecen were divided into two groups in terms of legal rights: concives (fellow citizens) and lodgers. Before the eighteenth century the only ones entitled to ‘civic rights’ were those who paid the ‘citizen tax’ (polgártaksa); then, from the beginning of the eighteenth century the condition for acquiring the right was to own a house. Civic rights were not inheritable; they were only granted to widows until the end of their lives. Since civic rights were accompanied by a piece of land, over the course of early modern times magistrates of Debrecen were very careful to issue the right only to as many inhabitants as they could provide the appropriate size of field, meadow, pasture to. Citizens (in Debrecen given the Latin term civis) had a share in the city’s forests in firewood and building timber. Only they could become guild members and participate in official elections.111 According to the estimates of István Rácz, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, out of a Debrecen population of more than ten thousand only one thousand people had civic rights, while their number at the end of the century may have been around two thousand to two thousand five hundred.



58 I.S. KRISTóF
Lodgers, who constituted the majority of the population, did not own a house but they might have had a smaller vineyard or plot of land. They only received brushwood from the forest, and they also had to pay a small amount of urban tax.112 According to Debrecen sources there were various ways of becoming a lodger. Poorer people moving to the city from another town; impoverished citizens; the widows of citizens who were not able to maintain their own home; local poor people unable to pay the citizen tax or to buy a house; people who could not be placed in the asylum for the poor (ispotály), or in the hospital, who were called ‘domestic poor’ in the eighteenth century: all these constituted the large group comprising the lodger population.113 In post-Ottoman Debrecen, which now enjoyed the rank of free royal city, the problems relating to a population lacking civic rights emerged with an unprecedented acuteness during the process of reorganizing urban life, increasing the institutionalization of social and other activities and last but not least living under the pressure of economic hardship. During Ottoman rule, it is known, the population of the city grew significantly, with people fleeing the destroyed villages obviously becoming lodgers.114 At this point, the only condition to taking them in was to inform the magistrate of their arrival. This, however, considering the chaotic times, rarely happened, and at this point the city council did not question for whom they were providing shelter. However, with the end of the Ottoman era and after earning the title of a free royal city, they tried to make the conditions of moving to the city and of becoming a lodger stricter. These efforts were actually reactions to the decline of the economy of the city at the end of Ottoman rule and at the beginning of the eighteenth century. Industrial and trade activities in Debrecen decreased significantly in this period; the city no longer had the capacity to take on and support poorer immigrants. This was especially the case since the process of pauperization and the rising number of landless peasants (zsellér) had also begun in Debrecen: bankrupted local retailers and craftsmen were already multiplying the number of the poor.115 The magistracy, in addition to its rational purposes as regards the economical sustainability of the city, had its moral reasons as well in trying to regulate poverty by issuing a series of decrees during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In January 1696, for instance, they issued the following ordinance relating to lodgers: “Landlords should only take in lodgers for whom a Juror has vouched and taken responsibility: if they



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 59
come from elsewhere, they must have a good recommendation. Truants fleeing from one street or one house to another, who avoid payment and service, must not be taken in by anybody; one has to report such persons to the Juror. If a suspicious, sinful delinquent of ill repute is found at someone’s home, those persons are violating their concivis duties, and the abetters should receive the same punishment as the culprit.” The supervisors of the street’s administrative and economic organization (tízházgazda) made it their duty to “frequently stroll the streets, at least twice a week, and to examine the kind of people who live there.” The decrees were reissued in May.116 The civic citizen’s oath recorded in the Matricula Civium (book of citizens) from 1707 also included such ordinances with relation to lodgers. The fourth point, for instance, was the following: “you may not take in as lodgers people who avoid service or payment, especially people of ill repute, sinners and delinquents; you should not hide them, and if you witness someone doing so in the city, you must report it.” The fifth point required citizens “not to take in strangers as lodgers to your house beside your own servants without reporting that you have done so at the person’s arrival and when the person leaves your house.”117 Among the lodgers there were quite a few who were domestic poor or beggars, who were accommodated by certain landlords out of Christian duty and in exchange for completing minor household tasks. It is worth mentioning that the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century saw numerous ordinances regulating the situation of the domestic poor added to regulations relating to lodgers. All this confirms the contemporary modification of the traditional care provided to poor people in the city. The first ‘inner’ hospital (situated within the city) in Debrecen was established in 1529 by a citizen who offered his own house for this purpose. After the consolidation of Calvinism the Franciscans left the convent of Csapó Street and the magistrate moved the poor people here. The hospice stood here until 1704. The ‘outer’ hospital—located outside the city—was established around 1552. In 1705 the council shut down the inner shelter and relocated the resident poor to the hospice outside the city. This, after a connecting church was built next to it, became a congregation with its own ministry, and as Gábor Herpay observed,118 henceforth it was the responsibility of this establishment to handle the problems of the poor who were supposed to move outside the city. As the report addressed to the royal Chambers in 1698 shows, the hospital



60 I.S. KRISTóF
accepted people unfit for work, those with a physical or mental disability, and poor or impoverished people unable to make a living, and primarily those who were inhabitants of Debrecen. They completed various tasks, the men, for instance did stubbling, while the women did weaving work. The maintenance costs of the establishment were covered partly from donations, and partly from specified incomes—profit from the mills, the city land tithe for the poor, incomes from beer-shops, the price of strayed cattle, and two thirds of the cattle of people deceased without a will. The hospitals, however, did not have the capacity to take in all the poor citizens of the city: in 1698–1699 there were, for instance, only 40–50 inhabitants in the shelter.119 Until the end of the seventeenth century all this did not cause such a great problem as it did later, because until then the “hungry poor from the streets”, that is, the domestic poor, had the right to beg at the church gates and at funerals.120 From the end of the seventeenth century, however, probably because the number of poor had so increased, the magistrate not only moved the hospice out of the city, but also tried to prohibit the poor from begging. An entire series of decrees was issued to this end. In 1695, for example, the following ordinances were issued about beggars: “those who are worthy of alms should go and join the others [in the shelter], and no one is allowed to knock on doors begging. If someone would like to give alms, he should take it to the public location.”121 This “public location” was the church, where the preachers had to announce the mendicants from the hospice once a month, and one could give donations only to them and only there. The ordinance was re-issued in 1696; then, in 1700, they ordered once again that “the beggars are not to dwell and cry at the church gates, but to stay at their accommodation.”122 It would seem, however, that these measures proved rather ineffective, for in 1720 they had to be repeated. This time, as the magistrate wrote, “the beggars flooded [the city]” and continued to beg from one house to another. The decree prohibited this once again, or allowed the exception of “those who are worthy and should be able to walk around without suspicion with a specific mark.” This, nevertheless, entailed a strict investigation as a condition, both of the beggars and the lodgers: “thus, every mendicant has to be sent to the district supervisors in the City Hall for investigation. The population of the city has to be investigated house by house as well, to see what kind of lodgers there are. Suspicious persons should be escorted to the jurors dealing with them. And they themselves should stay vigilant.”123



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 61
The fight against the city’s poor also included measures which ordered the demolition of “huts, sheds and other useless houses”. During the eighteenth century, the decree first issued in 1695 was repeatedly reissued, which again suggests that its implementation was not entirely efficient: “we order in relation to wanderers and huts that the huts dug in the streets be demolished; furthermore, that dilapidated housing, in which the derelicts avoiding payment and service hide, should be demolished as well. The district supervisors are also called upon to attend to those who arrive in the city and to report them. The landlords as well, to whom these people go, should report the fact; and should someone take in such a person, they should be punished.”124 We should also mention that it was around this time that the city also set out to regulate the Gypsy population. According to an ordinance of 1696, “the hiding derelict Gypsies living in huts and tents must be cleaned out of the city; from here on they are not only forbidden to live in the city, but are not even permitted to sleep here. Gypsies living in permanent housing and paying their taxes and sustaining other burdens are permitted to stay inside the city; nevertheless, they must not cheat other citizens by trading in horses. There shall be regulations which, if impinged, will result in them automatically being banished from the city.”125 The situation of the poor in Debrecen thus became very hard from the beginning of the eighteenth century. The shelter established outside the city was not able to accept the mass of humanity arriving from the city; meanwhile, the magistrate deprived these poor people of their traditionally most important instrument of livelihood, the right to go begging from house to house. It is worth noting that these regulations affected the people newly settling into the city more than the people originally from Debrecen. The former were not willingly accepted by the outside shelter, and the church donations were also only provided to the sheltered poor of Debrecen. The poor coming from elsewhere found themselves in a situation even more miserable than the locals. The administrative measures, however, were not successful; mendicancy continued in the city, only under circumstances considered ‘illegal’. We can justly presume that the campaign in Debrecen at the end of the seventeenth and at the beginning of the eighteenth centuries only intensified suspicions already existing due to the stereotype of the ‘poor witch’ against lodgers, the domestic poor, poor neighbors and against Gypsies, as we can presume by the few cases of Gypsy witches in the



62 I.S. KRISTóF
second half of the eighteenth century. Since the regulations made the landlords responsible for their lodgers and imposed a reporting obligation on them in cases where they discovered anyone leading a lifestyle violating the ordinances, the landlords, trying to avoid punishment, must have felt encouraged to report such persons. We should point out that moral considerations behind the regulations against lodgers and the poor may also have anticipated the development of witchcraft accusations. We have seen that in Debrecen the opinion of both the Calvinist religion and the magistracy associated numerous types of crime with witchcraft, and according to the witness testimonies of trials there were quite a few examples for such associations among the inhabitants. From the perspective of the victims of the accused lodger and beggar appearing in witch trials we should recall the potential explanation proposed by Keith Thomas and Alan Macfarlane, since in many regards it seems to be applicable to the development of witchcraft accusations against the poor in Debrecen in the eighteenth century. The citizens of seventeenth-century Debrecen, as well as the community of Elizabethan-era England, had accustomed themselves to give out alms, an act which was even required by their religion. Nevertheless, when in England under the influence of the establishment of a new, individualistic approach and in Debrecen as a result of the magistracy’s campaign against the poor, the neighbors rejected those poor demanding assistance or denounced their lodgers, they had to face a severe moral problem. Considering that the religiously prescribed tradition of providing help and almsgiving was still a vivid part of their mindsets, the behavior required by the magistracy must have provoked a deep remorse and guilty conscience in them. They tried to escape this feeling by accusing the begging poor of witchcraft,126 since—according to Thomas’s argument—it was not a sin to deny help to someone who had entered a pact with the Devil. As the re-issued regulations confirm, the council of Debrecen was not really successful in achieving its goal: they were unable to cleanse the city of the unwanted elements through ‘regulative measures’. Thus the witchcraft accusations against the poor served as a tool in this campaign. Let us look at a few examples. The widow of Bálint Kis from Debrecen lived variously in the homes of three landlords in Mester Street prior to her trial in 1694. She was cognisant with medicinal herbs and also with several practices belonging to the category of love magic and magic for boosting agricultural prosperity. It appears, on the basis of the trial, that she wanted to ‘pay’



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 63
for her accommodation and to reinforce her status as a lodger with her magical skills. This, however, turned out to be a very dangerous option. At the home of Gergely Marjai she tried to heal his son with herbs, but was unsuccessful. Mrs. Marjai found Mrs. Kis in the courtyard one night, and in the morning she told the judges in shock that she had found straw ashes where Mrs. Kis had been sitting. The suspicions of the landlords were also confirmed by learning that a servant and a woman neighbor had also accused Mrs. Kis of bewitching their eyes; the servant had even come to their house for treatment. Marjai and his wife kicked the old woman out of their house shortly thereafter. She told her subsequent landlady, Mrs. Mihály Gulyás, that she used to have a lover when she was young, “who came from the sky”. Mrs. Gulyás must have been informed about the bewitchments attributed to Mrs. Kis, and when she broke one of Mrs. Kis’s pots, she was afraid that she might fall victim to her as well. As she related one week after the incident, “I heard a big rushing noise”, and “a woman [Mrs. Kis] in green robes came out of the bush and squeezed me at the waist; I put my hands on her shoulder and asked, “Why are you so angry with me, dear friend...” She replied, “you know, the other day you broke my glazed pot.” Mrs. Gulyás did not mention other damages she had suffered; apparently after this incident she chased her lodger away: “As soon as the pot incident took place, I no longer kept her in my house.” Mrs. Kis tried to win over her next landlady, Mrs. István Dinnyés (who probably was already aware of her reputation in the street) by teaching her how to extract more milk from her cow and how to protect it from maleficium. She also gave advice to Mrs. Dinnyés’s son on how to conquer girls he desired. Magical knowledge, however, was a double-edged sword: when several of her kin became ill, Mrs. Dinnyés found it easy to blame the bewitchment on her: “She called that person [Mrs. Kis] a witch to her face, saying she had eaten her son, her daughter and herself as well.” The woman lodger was eventually banished from Debrecen, because, as the judges claimed, “with her advice serving fornication and her use of prohibited instruments she was provoking scandal.”127 A poor woman, Judit Sarkadi, was brought to tribunal in 1720, in the year of one of the mendicant regulations. The charges against her were that “she was begging in a fraudulent way: when they only gave her bread, she started to threaten them, give me some more, or else you’ll regret even the milk of your mother. Then in their houses one could hear a great pounding and all the pots and vessels fell out of their places.” The maleficium narrative recorded in the regrettably very short trial



64 I.S. KRISTóF
document represents the typical situation of the denial of a favor and the consequent damages, which probably had some grounding in reality if one considers the ongoing campaign against the poor and the ‘beggarwitch’ scare. The beggar woman should have been sentenced to be burnt according to the indictment, but she had not confessed anything during torture. We do not know what her verdict was.128 Kata Szabó, called “Healer Kata”, was brought to trial in 1718. According to the witnesses she was often a guest at taverns and at merriments, and “young lads” often visited her. During the time of the trial she was already living in the home of her second landlord. Her first landlord, the slaughterer Péter Fodor from Péterfia Street, had kicked her out for her scandalous lifestyle and drunkenness. As a result, her magical knowledge was no protection to her, either. According to Mrs. Fodor, Miss Kata had threatened her husband for chasing her away from the house, “saying you will feel my incantation with many tears. And 2 weeks later he fell off his feet, and he has been miserable ever since.” At her second landlord’s, the bootmaker András Pap in Új Hatvan Street, she continued her lifestyle, falling far from the ideal of a ‘God-fearing honest woman’. She tried to earn the trust of her landlady, as healers usually did, by showing her her body, which had allegedly been beaten by witches for her healing activities: “She lifted her skirt and the witness saw a blue bruise on her leg, and she said: It has been there for 3 days.” The household of András Pap was often harassed by men visiting Miss Kata, and according to witnesses she also used to go home late and was often drunk and quarreled with the Pap family’s servants. Kata Szabó incorporated exactly the type of lodger ‘of ill repute’ whom the city regulations expected to be reported. It is also noteworthy to see how many kinds of ‘dangerous relations’ appeared simultaneously in her case (as well): besides the landlord-lodger relation there were the tensions between healers and patients, and those between ‘persons of ill repute’ and ‘honest Christians’. After her witch trial she was beaten and banished from the city.129 Further research needs to be done in order to see how the situation of full citizens and their lodgers operated in other market towns of the county, and whether at the end of the Ottoman era and at the beginning of the eighteenth century there may have been similar efforts to regulate the situation of the poor similar to those of the Debrecen magistracy, charged with moral considerations. In any case it seems that the stereotype of the poor witch had its foundations in the county as well.



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 65
Accordingly, among the people accused of witchcraft Mrs. Mátyás Fazekas from Hencida (1715) lived in a mud hut130; the cripple form Örvénd (Urvind), István Lengyel (1716) earned his living with his violin131; the council of Samson investigated the case of a ‘wandering derelict’ ‘Romanian’ (oláh) woman in 1746132; Mrs. Domján had to move at least three times before she was sued in Sarkad in 1744; and according to the 1715 trial of Mrs. Ferenc Cina from Bakonszeg “she could not survive in that poor condition if she did not have her knowledge.”133 Mrs. Lippai who fled from Albis (Albiș), originally from Érsemjén (Șimian) (1708)134; Mrs. István Harcsás from Berekböszörmény (1715)135; Mrs. István Göbei from Hajdúbagos (1723)136; Ferenc Nagy from Komádi (1724)137; and Mrs. Mihály Kis from Ártánd (1726)138 all earned their bread from sheep-farming.139 Moreover, the witchcraft accusations developing from lodger-landlord conflicts also occurred here and there in the market towns and villages of the county. We know from the 1715 trial of Mrs. Miklós Kulcsár from Hegyközpályi (Paleu) that she had become poor, and “the village judges took the house in which Miklós Kulcsár lived by the order of the ispán, and gave it to someone who could better support himself.” Mrs. Kulcsár may already have been under suspicion, because earlier her mother had been burnt as a witch. She had a reputation of having been, in an earlier period, irreconcilable with others as a landlady; several witnesses have described in detail how she had chased one of her lodgers from the house, and how she had ‘bewitched’ the lodger’s cow as well. Mrs. Kulcsár did not take it lightly when they took her house away; she used to come back to quarrel with the new owners. The latter then attributed the illness of one of their cows to be the bewitchment of Mrs. Kulcsár. The Kulcsár family had to wander from one accommodation to the other, and they tried—with little success—to make a living with the help of their landlords and neighbors. Mrs. Kulcsár probably lost her good reputation when her mother was burnt; the scandal about kicking a lodger out only made things worse. When she lost her own home, and needed the help of the already suspicious neighbors, her road to a witch trial was paved. According to the maleficium narratives her lodgers prevented her from taking her wheat to the mill; her neighbors refused to give her a bushel of wheat or a laundry tub, or to help her husband plough; and when any kind of damage happened to them, they attributed it to bewitchment on the part of the angry Mrs. Kulcsár. The type of conflict resulting from denying a favor



66 I.S. KRISTóF
to someone corresponds once again with the status and lifestyle of the accused witch. We do not know the verdict of her trial.140 Behind the denial of a favor, help or cooperation in the discussed narratives, as we have seen, there often lies the conflict between the poorer and the wealthier population. In Debrecen this was integrated into the processes of regulating the settlement of newcomers to the city and of modifying the care provided for the poor. The maleficium narratives opposing lodgers and landlords (cives) represent certain forms of the problematic co-habitation and interactions between these two strata, which became increasingly tense, especially in Debrecen at the end of the Ottoman era and the beginning of the eighteenth century. Accusations of witchcraft, if my hypothesis based on the theories of Keith Thomas and Alan Macfarlane is right, helped the wealthier part of the population to rid themselves of these burdened relationships and to ease their guilty consciences for doing so. Thus it can be said that an accusation of witchcraft, itself a facilitator in executing administrative measures, helped in the establishment of a new urban order. In this process, of which the above-discussed establishment and legitimation of public healthcare was also part, we should not however overestimate the weight of witchcraft accusations against the poor. On the one hand, poverty in itself was not a catalyst of witchcraft accusation: I could refer to numerous other trials from the judicial period of Debrecen in the two examined centuries in which beggars, lodgers and newly settled-in strangers were ‘only’ accused of theft, fornication, playing music without authorization, murder, etc., and not of witchcraft. On the other hand, the city’s campaign against poverty at the beginning of the eighteenth century created circumstances which allowed it to rid itself of unwanted strangers, lodgers and beggars without accusing them of witchcraft: namely on the basis of the accusation of ‘illegality’. This might explain why in the eighteenth century trials in Debrecen the accused poor or beggar witches—even though we cannot estimate their exact ratio—did not constitute a vast majority.
WeaLthy WitChes of ‘high’ status
Extreme cases of accusations ‘from below’ against important town or village officials seemingly rarely occurred either in Debrecen, or in other parts of the county, although again I cannot give an exact percentage. I



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 67
believe that these were rather isolated cases which, if better sources were available, could be interpreted in each individual situation. There were no greater social processes in the background, such as in the case of the campaign against the poor of Debrecen. Mrs. Gergely Bagoly from Debrecen, who was considered by László Makkai to be the kin of a nobleman and a former judge, was punished for adultery rather than for witchcraft.141 The wife of Town councillor László Szűcs was accused rather for healing and divination in 1631.142 These two cases, however, seem to contradict the hypothesis of Erik Midelfort, according to which the stereotype of the ‘poor witch’ was broken down in cases of mass accusations when the witchcraft accusation could basically reach anyone, and hence wealthier people of higher positions as well.143 Neither the case of Mrs. Bagoly nor that of Mrs. Szűcs was related to a witch panic. And out of the further three cases involving wealthy, noble women of Bihar County, only one trial (the aforementioned trial of Ottomány) has surpassed the threshold regarding the number of accused, which, according to Brian Patrick Levack, is the margin for a panic-like witch-hunt. In Nagykereki in 1724, in the suit against the wife of judge György Szabó, at least six other local ‘witches’ from other villages of the county were identified. Nevertheless, it is worth noticing that Mrs. György Szabó’s primary trouble was with the ‘German Captain’ staying in Nagykereki. The reason for his discontent was probably not what the witnesses told, namely that one of his puppies had died because Mrs. Szabó had bewitched it; it was more likely that he had problems with his accommodation, and blamed the judge’s family for it. In the Ottomány trial of the same year, which was the only incident of accusation in Bihar County that can be considered as a ‘witch-craze’, the wife of the judge Tamás Kerekes was accused of witchcraft alongside nine other persons. Mrs. Kerekes was also accused by two other witches of riding cats and people. The local notary registered her in the witch association he assembled as a ‘pvt’ (köz).144 There are no records of the verdicts passed on the two women, although it would be essential to know how the sedria decided in the case of ‘witches’ from the top of the social ladder. Mrs. Mihály Panyolay (1765), the wife of the judge’s brother in Kismarja, apparently arrived at a poorer neighborhood after moving from a Bihar village to the market town. The witnesses had stated that she could not even weave properly, and that she was an indulgent



68 I.S. KRISTóF
woman. One of her victims called her “Mrs. Karaffa”, associating her with the notorious late seventeenth century imperial general, Antonio Caraffa, who ruthlessly imposed taxes: “in Bihar you had to carry the chest of poverty yourself, and you were looking for the key, opened the chest and left it empty... just go to Bihar, the people there will tell you what you have been; you acted like Caraffa, you tormented the poor.” Another victim disparaged her with the following words: “you clear witch whore, just because your brother-in-law is the judge, I am not afraid to say it, if they are kin or friend to the judge, any petty rascal is allowed to come to Marja, no matter if they come from the Devil or from hell.” The former victim considered it to have been a bewitchment by Mrs. Panyolay that the wind blew off the roof of her house, while the latter blamed her for the death of her goose. In order to display to the public that Mrs. Panyolay was a witch, they hung the goose at her window. Finally it was Mrs. Panyolay who sued the two victims for slander. It would be interesting to know how the trial ended, but, again, the sources have not preserved the verdicts.145 We cannot draw general conclusions from the few cases of women of high social status accused of witchcraft. I only wish to draw attention to the fact already indicated by the above-discussed witch-victim relations of the examined territory: the stereotype of the poor witch was hardly an exclusive reality in the accusations. I believe that the accusations of witchcraft are much more widespread on a social scale, and probably concerned primarily the middle strata who had somewhere to rise or fall down from, so that their relationship with their narrow environment (house, neighborhood, street, etc.) could become problematic, and thus, interpreting the events through the lens of witchcraft, the possibility arose that they could become witches or victims. As the previous cases show, witchcraft accusation nonetheless, did eventually reach a group with significant power, judges of considerable wealth. This did not necessarily require a panic-like witch-hunt, as supposed by Erik Midelfort, because incidental changes also occurred in their milieu, in their microenvironment—as we have seen in the case of Mrs. Panyolay, who moved into a poorer neighborhood in Kismarja, or in that of the quartered soldier and the judge’s wife in Nagykereki—situations which could have contributed to the development of suspicion of witchcraft.



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 69
hajdú Gentry (hajdúnemesek) and SerfS (jobbágyok)
The witch trials at the manor of Derecske in Bihar county are no different at first sight from any other trial of the region and of the time period. In the course of research, however, it transpired that the maleficium narratives often oppose the former hajdú gentry (hajdúnemes) and serfs (jobbágy), who alternately appeared as witches or victims. These witchcraft accusations, based on status oppositions, can be interpreted if we observe the social processes of the age that they represent. At the end of the Ottoman era (1702) the Palatine Prince Paul Esterházy received 16 settlements of the western part of Bihar County as a pledge property, which he proceeded to organize into a manor. In 1745 the princely family obtained the perpetual donation of the manor. Thirteen of the settlements had gained hajdú privileges during the seventeenth century, from István Bocskay, Gábor Báthori, Gábor Bethlen and other Transylvanian princes. They only owed military service to the princes, and they had their own municipality and the right to freely elect their judges. Their judicial cases were handled by the county court (sedria).146
At the end of Ottoman rule, however, neither the Royal Chamber nor the new seigneur Esterházy acknowledged their liberties. In 1700, in Vienna, it was declared that the hajdú towns “were bound to pay the tithe and other manorial allowances and taxes like any other subjects did.” The Chamber and Esterházy deprived those settlements of the plains annexed to their territories during Ottoman rule.147 The eighteenth century censuses registered the population of these settlementsignoring their former privileges—as serfs and taxpayers, and they also started to settle a population of serfs into the hajdú settlements, which had been closed military communities during the Ottoman times.148 The manorial administration established at the beginning of the eighteenth century increasingly interfered with the free election of judges, and besides limiting judicial authority the provisors also appointed their own delegates to lead the council of the settlements.149 The lord wished to extend the jurisdiction of the manorial court provided with jus gladii to the serfs and like wise to the former hajdú gentry. His goal was obviously to eliminate all differences regarding the legal status of the people living on his land; he wished to see serfs who uniformly paid taxes and were subject to the manorial court’s jurisdiction. The only concession he made was that he periodically redefined in contracts the obligations



70 I.S. KRISTóF
of the latter. It took, however, decades of back-and-forth negotiations until the hajdú gentry of the Derecske manor were willing to accept even this fairly advantageous contractual relationship as serfs. The period from which we have information of the witch trials of the hajdú settlements was therefore overloaded with multilateral conflicts: animosities between lords and hajdú gentry, hajdú gentry and serfs, lord and county. We should point out two important ‘alliances of interest’: on the one side between the serfs and the lord (and the manorial administration), and on the other between the hajdú gentry and the county. Over the course of the eighteenth century the former nobles refused on several occasions the payment of the seigneurial tax and obstructed the census ordered by the administrators. This is what happened, for instance, in 1726, when the hajdú settlements jointly declared “that their inhabitants are free individuals who have the right to move freely, therefore they do not want to be included in the census, because it would entail feudal burdens.” They liked to mention proudly that their first seigneur, Palatine Paul Esterházy, had addressed them as “your gracious lords”.150 In 1745, when the Esterházy family obtained the perpetual rights to the manor, they joined forces once again and contradicted the inauguration of the lord. All this, however, did not change the situation. They turned to the Chamber of Szepes 2 years later to no avail when they petitioned to redeem themselves: their request was denied. After the Urbarium agreement they took their case to trial once again, but they were not able to reclaim their liberties then, or ever again.151 Their fight for their privileges also included the repudiation of the manorial court’s jurisdiction over them referring to themselves as “noble persons”. In 1703 they requested the Prince that “our old law not be taken away from us, let us continue to live under it.”152 Since the Prince, however, did not fulfil their request either then or later, the hajdú gentry consequently concealed their legal affairs from the manorial provisors and, according to their old habit, turned to the county’s vicecomes (deputy county judge, alispán) and the sedria. At the beginning of the century they found in the person of the deputy comes György Komáromi Csipkés an influential advocate for their cause from the ranks of the county authorities, who were anyhow reluctant to acknowledge a new, rival legal authority with the right to order capital punishment, such as was the Esterházy manorial court. The fact that witch trials from hajdú settlements were tried (with one late exception) by the sedria can therefore be explained by its specific



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 71
political background. The tendency, especially under the presidency of Komáromi Csipkés, was that the sedria’s decisions apparently served the interests of the hajdú gentry. By refusing to pay taxes to their lord, the hajdú gentry were indirectly augmenting the burdens on the—usually recently settled—serfs living in their settlements, since they had to pay more as a result. The ‘poor’ of these settlements brought complaints to the manorial officials, and mentioned other instances of domination: the operating of a small tavern, denying serfs the rights of property, not acknowledging “the staff of the peasant judge” (parasztbíró bottya), wrongfully extending their properties and lands, etc. In István Szendrey’s view the serfs were far more opposed to the privileges of the nobles than was the lord. The latter, apparently, even exploited the discontentment of the serfs against the nobles: he encouraged the serfs to formulate their complaints in writing, stating how they had been domineered, so that later he could turn these letters of complaint against the hajdú gentry.153 The witch trials of Derecske manor originated in a very tense atmosphere, and even though the source material cannot be considered fully exploited, especially from the perspective of witch trials, it is still noteworthy to point out certain phenomena. The witch trials of former hajdú towns provide numerous examples of accusations from both below and above; in several cases we can suspect or prove that gentry-serf conflicts lay in the background. We can presume that the nobles defending their privileges tried to get rid of certain recently settled serfs, for which, however, they had very little means. The trials conducted at the county’s sedria—including witch trials—perhaps served as the best means to attain their goal. (The lord’s sympathies lay with the serfs; his manorial court probably would not have supported the suing hajdú gentry either in a witch trial or any other legal proceeding.) About the displacement of serfs, however, the county court, who supported the hajdú gentry could not decide unless they had compelling reasons, since the serfs belonged to the manor. The hajdú gentry must have recognized a compelling reason in witchcraft accusations. Obviously, this ‘recognition’ did not only occur when the Derecske manor was constituted. The hajdú nobles and the counter-accusing serfs built on formerly existing patterns when accusing each other of witchcraft. The organization of the manor and consequently the enforcement of the settling of serfs in the former hajdú settlements, however, created new conflicts which made it possible for witchcraft accusations to



72 I.S. KRISTóF
become an instrument of political fights. Even though the maleficium narratives do not mention this aspect, I still believe it is true. Let us look at some examples. In 1699 the magistracy of Derecske led investigations surrounding a Gypsy woman, the wife of the voivode Miklós, a weaver woman, Mrs. Nagy, and Mrs. Márton Virágos, who had all moved to the hajdú gentry market town from Balmazújváros, thus increasing the number of unwanted serfs there. Witnesses were also heard against a local inhabitant, Mrs. Máté Tavasz, who lived in poverty. The primary accusation against them was that “they have eaten the children of the judge”, who was most probably a member of the former hajdú gentry. Mrs. Máté Tavasz, when she was captured, started to make counter-accusations: accusing a member of a local noble family, Mrs. András Szabó,154 of witchcraft: “See... they capture the poor [woman], and Mrs. András Szabó, who is also a devil like us, she is not captured... she rides a black cat with slit ears.” This trial evokes a stage of animosities between hajdú gentry and serfs preceding the establishment of the manor, when being a stranger and a settler was more incriminating for the accused than their status of serfdom (not yet associated with political aspects). Nonetheless, in the little-known conflict between the judge and Mrs. Máté Tavasz, the pattern of mutual witchcraft accusation, which later led to the proliferation of accusations, was already present. We have no knowledge of the outcome of the trial: documents have remained only in fragments.155 It was in 1714, after the establishment of the manor and now in a period of political conflict, that accusations were made against two women serfs. Mrs. György Borbély was suspected of having ‘bewitched’ the daughter of the juror János Dobai who, judging from his rank, was probably a hajdú noble. According to the narrative, Mrs. Borbély had asked for some pears, but had been refused them. The other woman, Mrs. Péter Juhos Kis, had been accused of ‘torturing’ a member of the hajdú gentry Tarsoly family. The cases of the two women were tried by the sedria, and they were both sentenced to take a cleansing oath. The documents unfortunately do not mention whether the oath was successful.156 In 1723, the hajdú gentry from Hajdúbagos were able to rid themselves of two women serfs. They also sued a third one, but her verdict is unknown. The accusations all began at the house of the hajdú nobleman, István Szarvadi. Szarvadi had accepted the shepherd Mrs. István Göbei as lodger. According to the victim, Mrs. Göbei had once threatened him,



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 73
saying “your child will regret it... his two arms will lose bones.” Mrs. Göbei was looked upon as a witch by several of her landlords. Among other things, she had ‘bewitched’ a maid of the Pap family, (also from the hajdú gentry), and threatened the family when they hired her husband to draw water but would not pay for his service right away. Several witnesses, including the hajdú gentry woman Erzsébet Kodormány, stated in their testimonies that the shepherd woman was ‘aware of’ her evil doings. According to Erzsébet she once told her: “it is time for me to go, because I have done enough good and bad, my ass has licked many thresholds.” Eventually, the sedria banished her not only from Hajdúbagos, but also from the entire county.157 The mutually accusing serfs probably also saw in witchcraft accusation an opportune means to liberate them from the hajdú gentry, who were often domineering in defending their old rights. They had little chance of attaining their goal, however, since trials against accused hajdú were conducted in front of the county court, which supported them, as we shall see in the following examples. The cases of the hajdú noblewomen Mrs. János Zuh and Mrs. Pál Tóth from Szalonta (Salonta)158 and Mrs. Zuh’s mother, Mrs. Mihály László, were tried by the sedria in 1717. Mrs. Zuh, in addition to her noble rank, was probably a wealthy woman; we hear she had a servant, a miller lodger, and a hired shepherd. Despite her background, her neighbors explained her wealth by the fact that she possessed magical skills. Allegedly, “she could bewitch the cows at milking” with her special grease. One of the witnesses stated she had heard from Mrs. Zuh’s daughter that “my mother ground the [caul of the cow] and fed it to the cows mixed with bran, that is how our milk is so buttery.” Mrs. Zuh was probably denounced by the serfs Mihály Lajos and his wife. We do not know the original cause of their conflict beyond the reasons Mrs. Lajos named in her narrative of the bewitchment: she had hit one of Mrs. Zuh’s hens and one of her geese. Mrs. Lajos and her servant accused the noblewoman of maleficium. Mrs. Lajos tried to prove to the sedria that Mrs. Zuh had come to her with another person during the night, and “tramped on her heavily”. Differences between the testimonies of hajdú gentry and serf witnesses related to certain witchcraft-beliefs Mrs. Zuh was accused of are conspicuous. Those of her acquaintances who supported her—the members of other noble families such as the Tóth, Madas and Oláh families159—said, for instance, that the reason Mrs. Zuh’s finger had once



74 I.S. KRISTóF
been bandaged was because it had a boil on it. The servant of Mihály Lajos, however, said at the tribunal that Mrs. Zuh’s injury was due to the incident when one night she appeared in front of her as a witch: “As she attacked the witness, Mrs. János Zuh grabbed the witness’ throat and started to strangle her, one of her fingers got stuck in the witness’s mouth, who chewed on it”. And to confirm her assertion she referred to the testimony of Mihály Lajos: “I heard the next day from my master that Mrs. János Zuh’s finger was bandaged.”160 Mrs. Zuh’s herdsman also accused her of wanting to poison him with pogácsa (traditional Hungarian pastry), and a lodger also raised accusations claiming that, accompanied by two other persons, after their fight she had wanted to slit his child’s throat. The hajdú gentry testifying in favor of Mrs. Zuh also said that her dog had once become rabid and run out of the village. According to the people testifying against her, it was Mrs. Zuh herself who had run that time like a dog. This is what the Gypsies chasing the dog testified to. Voivode Ádám said that “I could not run faster than the dog, I have never ran as fast as that day, a hundred-Forint racehorse could not keep up with me, there was no thorny bush or meadow that I could not cross... if they hadn’t killed [the dog] I would still be running.”161 The noblewoman Mrs. Pál Tóth also got involved in a conflict with the Lajos family. She “kept” one of the Lajos’s daughters at her house, and they suspected that she would bewitch her so that she could never have children. According to Mrs. Lajos, Mrs. Tóth used to “visit her” in the night with Mrs. Zuh. In her testimony she stated: “Mrs. Pál Tóth told the witness that she had suffered a lot because of her, but that sooner or later she would die by her hands.”162 Mrs. Pál Tóth was sentenced to take an easily performable cleansing oath. The mother of Mrs. Zuh, Mrs. Mihály László, of whom the trial revealed practically nothing, was acquitted. It is hardly likely that Mrs. János Zuh was convicted as well, since she was able to find 17 witnesses testifying in her favor, including several hajdú gentry. Despite the fact that the maleficium narratives do not enter into an explicit ‘political’ discourse, I believe that lying in the background of the witchcraft accusations of the Derecske manor we find a decidedly political opposition between hajdú gentry and serfs. The witchcraft accusations raised by hajdú nobles against serfs were meant to defend an ancient order based on their privileges. They belong to a series of desperate efforts which sought until the end of the eighteenth century to



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 75
regain the privileges of the hajdú gentry. The counter-accusations by the serfs, on the other hand, had an inverse effect: they favored the manorial system supporting them; that is, the establishment of a new order. The problem surrounding the social tensions within the Derecske manor is inseparable from social historical events in hajdú gentry towns, now integrated into a ‘Hajdú district’ in 1876—Szoboszló, Böszörmény, Dorog, etc.—as well as from the events of seventeenth- and eighteenthcentury witch-hunts in these towns. However, as this topic has been but barely researched; I cannot go into a more detailed analysis here. The primary conclusion of this study is that the scapegoating efforts manifesting in the form of witchcraft accusations (subsiding during the times of war and intensifying during natural disasters) have a general pattern which is applicable everywhere. Witchcraft accusations in the region of our study cannot be described alone within the framework either of the tensions between the poor and their environment emphasized by Keith Thomas and Alan Macfarlane, or the ambiguous relations between the specialists of magic and their environment, as suggested by Richard Horsley and others. I also do not find entirely justified the hypothesis represented by Richard Horsley, and applied to Hungarian circumstances by Gábor Klaniczay, according to which “During the explosion of a witch-panic, accusations run along the lines of social or cultural tensions within the communities; but in the course of long-term, regular, but not (or rarely) excessive witch-hunting, as was the case in Hungary, the majority of the victims are the people who possess some kind of magical expertise.”163 On the basis of the overview it seems as if, in the region of our study, over the course of a long-term and systematic witch-hunting period the foundations of most accusations were actually the social and cultural tensions within the community; there was no need to have, say, 50 witches in order to formulate this issue in the form of a witchcraft accusation. As for the ‘witch types’, I also believe that we can only discuss them as far as the implications of the two groups of maleficium narratives established by Éva Pócs164 and also observed in the region of my research might suggest it: the witch prototype construed on the basis of conflicts stemming from situations of everyday cohabitation, which constituted the vast majority of the cases, and the witches fulfilling the role of a communal scapegoat and the target of everybody who represented the minority in the cases. This, however, is what makes the research of witchcraft accusation interesting. It is not the figure of the witch and the related beliefs that

deserve attention, but the dangerous relations on the foundation of which the witchcraft accusations were created. These relations, in my opinion, were always shaped by the given economical-social-cultural configurations. In Debrecen, for instance, the lodger-landlord and the beggar/poor-rich conflict was much more present than in the county. The accusations of moral and common offenses weighed a lot more in the city than in other parts of the region. The conflicts between the specialists of positive magic and their environment also represented a more serious problem in the city when compared to the county. Meanwhile, in the privileged settlements of the county the accusations stemmed more often from tensions due to status oppositions, as in Debrecen. In the background of these, as we have seen in the case of the Derecske manor, there lay social problems characteristic of the given settlement and region in a given period. All these conclusions take us to another, not particularly different second broad conclusion derived from what we have discussed above, namely to the position that we must handle stereotypes with precaution, whether they are established by preachers, witnesses of witch trials or historians and anthropologists. The image of the ‘poor old witch’, professed by all of the above, does not apply to the entirety of the witch-hunt in the examined region, as we have seen. It might apply to the case of the supernatural witch—generally an imagined belief-figure—but to the everyday or social witch, characteristic of most of the accusations, apparently it is not applicable. The latter are scattered across a much wider scale which I will discuss below. We have to be equally cautious with assertions relating to the function of witchcraft accusation. As Victor Turner has pointed out in his previously mentioned critique, the anthropologists of the 1950s argued, besides presuming in the context of functionalism that societies are static, that witchcraft accusations had an establishing, almost conserving effect on the order of society; that is, of the community. Turner himself, alongside Thomas and Macfarlane, emphasized the opposite side of social changes, claiming that, on the contrary, the accusations were preparing the ground for something new. The study of everyday dangerous relations in our region is somewhere midway; I can simultaneously support both opinions. In the typical conflict situations of the region and period of my study the orientation of witchcraft accusations can be modelled in the following way. Against women accused of moral and other offenses, and on



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 77
behalf of the hajdú gentry, against serfs, the witchcraft accusation can be considered an instrument to protect traditional values, a force of law enforcement on one hand. On the other hand, against the representatives of traditional positive magic, or against the beggars and lodgers of Debrecen, and, on behalf of the serfs of Derecske, against gentry the accusations can be interpreted as an instrument to dissolve the old order, and to prepare a new mentality. Nonetheless, taking all this into consideration I believe that it is not the witchcraft accusation itself, but its given social context which determines the function of the accusation. And why should a researcher of witch-hunting expect only one single function and one single context? If witchcraft accusation arose in problematic sectors of social and human cohabitation, or is a representation of it, we have no reason to presume that this cohabitation deteriorated in one aspect only, in one single sector, and that witchcraft accusation had an effect in only one direction. I must stress once more that in my description above I have only modelled the two functions of the witchcraft accusations. I did not intend to qualify them in terms of an idea of social ‘development’: in mentioning forces of law enforcement and of order dissolution I did not intend to formulate a judgment. The few trials, the abundant archival sources of which have allowed me to perform ‘deep drillings’, have provided a third conclusion. After discarding the generally accepted schemes and stereotypes, for the interpretation of witchcraft accusations it is not enough for the researcher to show the dangerous relations within the given community in a given period and given social context. A trial that seemingly fits into such a category still reveals a specific, individual micro-context, which constitutes the real framework of the accusations. This is where, in my opinion, the warning of the much-cited analysis by Jeanne Favret-Saada concerning the questionable authenticity of maleficium narratives is the most applicable. I believe that these narratives, and the types of conflicts and bewitchments they tell, operate as an interpretive scheme in which any realistic event can be substituted, or can be made to correspond to a social micro-context generating animosities. It is probably very likely that during the substitution process the real context and the real events—obeying the logic of maleficium narratives—were more or less modified and transformed; they did not, however lose all contact with reality. We have seen several examples in which the majority of the accused were placed under the framework of conflicts



78 I.S. KRISTóF
by the victims, which were/might have been indeed connected to the lifestyles and social interactions of the former. I find it, however, absolutely impossible to interpret and explain the micro-context of the actual witchcraft accusation only on the basis of maleficium narratives. The results of my ‘deep drillings’ have confirmed the hypothesis that the victims did not necessarily mention in front of the tribunal the true reasons why they hated this or that individual, and why they considered themselves to be their victims. My research in Debrecen provided numerous complementary data which were not even mentioned in the witch trials per se: on the past of the accused, pervious legal incidents or informal conflicts of the accused, their financial and social status, their direct home and neighborhood, etc. Accordingly, we should only ‘believe’ the maleficium narratives if we are able to compare them with other types of texts and sources. It is the result of such a comparison which has brought me to think that the maleficium narratives of Debrecen, when they represent the dissolution of certain social norms (related to specialists of magic, or the poor, beggars), refer to the same thing that was happening on a sociological level in the city’s social and cultural history, even if on a different—symbolic—level. They speak of the rearrangements after the Ottoman era: the changes in the direction of centralization and institutionalization, the new social and cultural exclusion and the differences arising from these changes. They also show us certain older norms, represented, for example, by the ‘healing women’, or the traditional support of the begging poor, norms which did not easily succumb to the new order. This is basically the situation with the maleficium narratives of the Derecske manor: the narratives place in opposition serfs and hajdú gentry as witches and victims who, as we have seen, were already opponents in another fight which had a political background. The stake of the conflict, nonetheless, was not a wounded foot or a cow giving bloody milk, but—in this case again—to work out a new order after Ottoman rule: centralization and the leveling of old group identities, or regionalism and the preservation of the latter. If I had to give a general answer to the question of what the maleficium narratives ‘are about’, my answer would be: they are about social dynamics. Besides representing certain changes within a given community, naturally according to their own, specific ‘witchcraft-related’ encoding, they also displayed what the norms were. The protection of old rules and customs clashed with their intention to introduce new forms.



THE SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS ... 79
On the basis of certain more or less discovered micro-contexts of the accusations I would like to point out that the probability of witchcraft accusations occurring was higher in situations which were overloaded with economical-social-cultural conflicts in which the tensions were multilaterally concentrated. I would like to refer to only two previous examples. In the case of Mrs. Márton Rácz from Debrecen, accused in 1725, the witch-victim relation included the following oppositions at the same time: stranger-local, neighbor-neighbor, richpoor, health-disease, ‘offense of ill repute’–‘Christian life’, while Mrs. András Bartha, a woman who specialized in recognizing healers and witches living in the vicinity, also played a big role. In a 1730 trial in Debrecen, when five accused, including two healer women (Mrs. Mihály Jóna and Mrs. András Nagy) were brought before a tribunal, all the above-mentioned oppositions were displayed, and we could add problems occurring in the relations between ‘illegitimate’ healer‘illegitimate’ healer, ‘illegitimate’ healing-‘legal’ healing, and healerpatient relations to the list. Witchcraft accusations presumably developed more often in situations in which the dangerous relations within a given community appeared cumulatively in the micro-context of certain structured groupshouse, neighborhood, district, street, clientele, guild, region, and so on. Contexts where—to quote John Putnam Demos—“life was really dense”.165 Finally, thinking with the logic of witchcraft accusations several conclusions can be drawn which, though hypothetical, yet constitute a sort of model which helped to interpret many characteristics of the witchhunting of my study. If witchcraft accusation is an act of scapegoating stemming from the deterioration of interpersonal relations, then certain forms of social interactions are needed. For this interaction a certain spatial and social proximity is necessary. Spatial proximity is well illustrated by rival healers crossing each other’s interests, the lodger-landlord, neighbor-neighbor oppositions and the general particularities of bewitchment cases, namely that the witches were not from a distant town, but lived in the direct vicinity of the victims. Social proximity means two things. On the one hand, that the social and financial situation of the victim and the witch are not so different from one another. This difference may include the disparities between the (houseless) lodger and the (house owner) landlord, or the gentry and the serfs; the differences between extreme poles, such as the wandering Gypsy/Romanian



80 I.S. KRISTóF
mountain shepherd/poor beggar versus a nobleman/noble judge/priest, however, could be included to a much lesser extent. In terms of status and financial situation, as I have previously proposed, the people involved in witchcraft come primarily from the middle strata (which cannot be better specified according to my current knowledge). The reason is simple. Only those individuals can become victims who have something to lose from their material or symbolic capital but whose status/wealth/capital is not so substantial as not to feel the ‘pain’ of the loss. The witch was always someone who ‘stood out’ from the micro-community upwards or downwards, yet was not different to the point of separating from the community, since it would have brought an end to the interaction which eventually made him or her a witch. Maybe this context also confirms my calculations concerning the age and marital status of witches and victims; as we have seen, the centre of witchcraft accusation was constituted by the most active stratum of the community: middle-aged married couples. These presumably had enough symbolic and material capital which they could lose, but not as much capital for the loss to be painless. On the other hand, as the most active people in the prime of their lives they had the greatest opportunity to stand out from others, and they were obviously the ones to compete the most with one another. Furthermore, being the most active social layer, they could potentially have constituted a group of people having a ‘dense life’, and it could have been the case that dangerous relations occurred most cumulatively with them. Meanwhile, social proximity also meant that those who lacked such proximity did not participate in the interaction and so could become neither victim nor witch. Probably this is the explanation for why there were so few Gypsies and Romanians or Catholics among the victims and accused witches of Bihar County. The witchcraft model discussed relies partly on my concrete research results, but is partly a collection of mere hypotheses and deductions. The reason I have considered it worthy of discussion is that it constituted a most consequent and coherent scheme, which with the proper modifications and after having applied it to interpret the witch-hunting of the region and period of my study, may be helpful in approaching similar issues of other regions and other periods of time.

Witchcraft, Greed and Revenge:
The Prosecutor Activity of György Igyártó
and the Witch Trials of Kolozsvár
in the 1580s
László Pakó
In order to evaluate the effect of the attorney activities of our protagonist from the perspective of the Kolozsvár (Cluj-Napoca) witch trials in the 1580s, we must start our discussion with a brief outline of the aspects relating to our topic within the historiography of witch-hunts in Kolozsvár. A volume containing the most complete body of texts of the Kolozsvár witch trials was published recently.1 Besides including the earliest document of Transylvanian witchcraft, this volume can also be considered as a work encompassing the longest time interval in the history of this research field: nearly 130 years had passed from the partial discovery of the texts to their publishing in full. From this period we have to

mention two pioneers of witchcraft research, whose works—also greatly determining our own research—were born almost a century apart. Andor Komáromy (1841–1916) was the first to be interested in the Kolozsvár witch trials. His work on the history of Kolozsvár was part of that of a generation of historians who followed in the footsteps of Elek Jakab. Like his predecessor, he continued to research urban history principally from the perspective of events, relying on the analysis of urban charters and other documents, as well as urban regulations and ordinances, but he was also one of the first to include other groups of sources in his enquiry. He noted the significance of the town’s judicial records, the wealth of whose data allowed him a deeper and more integral discovery of urban social life.2 In his 1901 work on the witch trials of Kolozsvár, he discussed the most significant witch trials of the sixteenth century and made observations of such fundamental importance that they have kept interest in the Kolozsvár trials alive to the present day.3 He was the first to identify similarities and common elements between the Klára Bóci trial and the other trials remaining from the year 1565, which later significantly contributed to the clarification of the underlying causes of the trials. He pointed out that these trials were all privately initiated suits and drew attention to the character of Péter Gruz, who often appeared as the plaintiff. In this same study he also discussed the witchcraft cases of 1584, emphasizing the significance of the fact that in these trials the role of private suitors had already been taken over by public prosecutors represented by the town procurator. Published in 1910, his masterpiece was Magyarországi boszorkányperek oklevéltára (A source-book of Hungarian witch trials), in which, among the some five hundred trial documents drawn from the source material of Transylvanian and more distant Hungarian settlements, he inserted a fair number of Kolozsvár-related examples, including most of the 1580 trial documents that concern us here.4 Although in his introduction Komáromy emphasized that the source-book was only his first step to prepare an integral monograph of the Hungarian witch-hunts, the planned opus was never finished. The extensive source publication was completed, yet in the following seventy-five years the Kolozsvár witch trials were barely mentioned.5 The topic became the centre of research again thanks to the work of András Kiss (1922–2013). His short article from 1969 and his study from 1974 presenting certain details of the stories relating to György Igyártó and Anna Rengő indicate that he had started to take interest in witch trials



WITCHCRAFT, GREED AND REVENGE: THE PROSECUTOR ACTIVITy ... 93
and in the person of Igyártó relatively early.6 He published the witch trial of Prisca Kőműves from 1565—a trial shortly preceding the trial of Klára Bóci known from the collection of Komáromy—in 1997. The novelty lay not in the fact that he had discovered a trial that predated those already known, but in several of the observations he made in the study accompanying the source publication, which gave a new impetus to witchcraft research, proposing further directions. András Kiss has stated on several occasions that in order to decipher the driving force of witch trials it is not enough to study the trials and the witches themselves, but that one has to engage in a more substantial enquiry, through which “one might discover connections, apparent social relations between the protagonists of the witch trials, or the deeper roots of a certain series of witch trials occurring at a given time or in a given space. For all this, the source publications, limited exclusively to the circumstantiality of witch trials (testimonies, procedure details), and only considering the data on a national level, are not sufficient”.7 His research basically continued to study the subjects outlined by Komáromy. Based on the town’s account books, tax registries and other administrative documents not linked directly to witchcraft, he painted a detailed picture of the urban social milieu in which these trials were launched. Focusing on the person and the urban status of the parties to the proceedings, he thoroughly examined the career path of the Saxon master tailor, Péter Gruz, whom he discovered to be the initiator of the 1565 witch trials. Besides Gruz, he had already drawn attention to György Igyártó, the key character in the witch trials taking place two decades later; he did not, however, get a chance to discuss his activities and motives in detail.8 With his efforts to approach witchcraft and the witch-hunts in Kolozsvár predominantly from a social and legal historical perspective, he continued Komáromy’s activities and enriched research with several new investigation criteria. Even though neither Komáromy nor Kiss were able to finish their planned synthesizing studies, their results provided a solid foundation for further research into the Kolozsvár witch trials. New Hungarian witch trial documents unearthed during the century that had passed since Komáromy’s source-book allowed Gábor Klaniczay to analyse the material of the sixteenth century trials of Kolozsvár in a much broader context. Parallel to examining the occurrence of demonological stereotypes (witches’ Sabbath, archaic mythological elements, devil’s pact) and the ambiguous role of popular healers in witch trials, he also studied those who usually provoked witchcraft accusations, such



94 L. PAKó
as quarrelling neighbors or insinuating healers, paying special attention to the activities of the notorious denunciators. In relation to this, he mentioned György Igyártó on several occasions; his data, however, were exclusively based on András Kiss’s results.9

Despite the fact that new results concerning witchcraft and related phenomena continue to appear, many researchers emphasise that there is still a lot to do in the field of discovering the identities, activities and motivations of the persecutors of witches who often played a key role in how the witch hunt unfolded. The activities of several witch hunters are well-known. The best-known, perhaps, is Matthew Hopkins, who, together with his partner, John Stearne, fought relentlessly against satanic threats incorporated by witchcraft in the middle of the seventeenth century.11 A similar reputation was attributed to witch hunters who have described their practical experiences in demonological handbooks: Heinrich Kramer (Institoris), the author of Malleus maleficarum, worked in the upper German regions; Henri Boguet worked in the province of Franche-Comté; Pierre de Lancre in the French Basque Country; Nicolas Rémy in Lorraine; or Friedrich Förner suffragan, the ‘spiritus rector’ of the Bamberg witch hunts.12 In the case of individuals working in a smaller territory, with less intensity, but who played a key role in the witch persecution of certain local communities, new data are required in order to obtain a comprehensive picture of the various interests that constituted the real reasons behind persecution under the guise of witch hunting.13 The completion of works discussing in detail such individual careers is significantly hindered by the fact that, beside the trial minutes (the typical source evidence of witchcraft), gathering the numerous other, scattered-source data is a time-consuming process. In the following we will discuss the activities of György Igyártó in the spirit of András Kiss: accordingly, in order to understand the correlations of witchcraft as a phenomenon, we must examine, beside the documentation of witch trials, all sources that might complete our data. This statement is especially relevant to György Igyártó and his activities, because he and his actions affected the course of witch-hunts in Kolozsvár and the transformation of the town’s judicial practices in general. In discussing the different aspects of Igyártó’s activities as prosecutor, and the possibilities, challenges and pitfalls determining the



WITCHCRAFT, GREED AND REVENGE: THE PROSECUTOR ACTIVITy ... 95
transformation of paths of the early modern procurator’s career, we essentially wish to discover potential catalysts and intentions to defend one’s interests which might have led to or even intensified the 15821585 witchcraft accusations. We have very little reliable data on his family and his background. Our sources from the end of the sixteenth century mention more than one person named Igyártó, several of whom were members of the town magistrate, but we cannot link our procurator to any of those families with any certainty. His name first appears in 1564 in the town’s juridical records,14 and the first data on his work as a town procurator is from 1576. First he appeared in front of the town’s court as the attorney of private individuals from Kolozsvár, and we have also found members of the magistracy among his clients.15 The beginning of his career looked promising, however on 16th January 1579 the royal judge reported in front of the Centumviri the “gruesome and terrible” acts of György Igyártó. In response, the Council of the Hundred arrested and sued him and his—as it later transpired, second—wife, and forbade them to meet during the time of the suit.16 Another source revealed that Igyártó was soon released from prison on probation on the intervention of certain guarantors.17 Further details of the trial, however, were only discovered in other sources. His next known appearance was in 1581–1582 when he summoned Anna Rengő in front of the first judge of the town for having organized masquerading carnival processions in the street.18 At the same time, Anna accused Igyártó of having hit her, before arresting her.19 This was not the first time the woman had had legal trouble; she had already been temporarily banned from the town on previous charges of fornication. Presumably that was when their quarrel originally had begun; the above-mentioned conflict and the resulting mutual accusations were only another episode of their conflict. After he hit her, Anna Rengő threatened Igyártó that she was going to reveal his previous illegal activities if he forced her once again to leave the town.20 She must have kept her threat, as a few weeks later György Igyártó started a procedure against Anna Rengő, in which he charged the woman for slandering his honour and reputation. Based on the witnesses’ testimonies the woman was spreading the rumour that while his first wife was still alive, he had a mistress with whom he had a child, but that fearing the law the child was raised in a distant village. She also circulated the rumour that he had poisoned his first wife so that he could marry his mistress sooner.21 These



96 L. PAKó
are presumably the “gruesome and terrible” actions that provoked the proceedings against Igyártó and his second wife in 1579.22 From 1582 to 1583 Igyártó, probably due to his wrath against Anna Rengő, not only initiated trials against her, but also against the witnesses who, in their earlier lawsuit, had given testimonies favoring Rengő. He summoned to court Borbála Kassai, who had previously revealed details about Igyártó’s pregnant mistress and her stay somewhere out of town, charging her with witchcraft, fornication, theft and pandering.23 He sued his former maid, a girl named Anna, whom he accused of testifying on the encouragement of Anna Rengő and her company, saying she had to leave Igyártó’s house because of sexual harassment.24 He accused two other women of false testimony who also gave an account of his relations with his mistress.25 He also took legal action against two other witnesses of Anna Rengő, accusing one of them of slander, and Mátyás Szigyártó’s maid of witchcraft.26 Thanks to his forceful steps and to a well-chosen line-up of witnesses,27 he most probably managed to acquit himself of the charges and to constrain his opponent to leave the town. Anna Rengő vanished from sight: nevertheless, the public appearances of György Igyártó continued, rising even higher than before. In 1584 the sources refer to him as the town’s elected prosecutor,28 and as such, he was the first to initiate public proceedings against delinquents threatening the common good and the safety of the population. He summoned to court an intentional arsonist who was sentenced to decapitation,29 then, continuing the witch-hunting activities he had started as a private individual, he initiated procedures on the charge of witchcraft against seven women—Mrs. Péter Székely, née Kató Szabó; Mrs. János Sós, Orsolya; Mrs. Miklós Szeles; Mrs. Ambrus Zöld, née Katalin Varga, Mrs. Antal Lakatos and Mrs. Mihály Kórós. Based on the results of these lawsuits we can establish that he was fighting against the ‘witches’ of Kolozsvár very efficiently as a city official, since six of the accused were burned at the stake.30 For lack of data, however, we do not know as yet how these actions were linked to his previous suits against Anna Rengő and her witnesses. Beside the ‘witches’, he summoned two other persons to court, one for adultery and the other for the birth of a child out of an illicit relationship.31 Igyártó continued his activities as the town’s elected procurator in the year 1585, and the city rewarded his services with financial compensation.32 During this year he accused two other women of witchcraft,33 summoned several people to court for charges of infanticide, adultery



WITCHCRAFT, GREED AND REVENGE: THE PROSECUTOR ACTIVITy ... 97
and pandering, and took action against two men who stole two shipments of stone extracted for the construction of a church in the periphery of the town.34 In 1586 he was re-elected as town procurator; however, his authority was limited: thereupon, any court related action was subject to the first judge’s permission.35 His work from 1586 can be reconstructed from his preserved accounting records. According to these data, he prosecuted as town procurator felons who were a threat to public morality, public safety and to the property of the inhabitants. He had a maid birched and banned from the town for fornication; he accused a woman of adultery; he summoned three other persons to court for fornication and pandering; a married couple was charged with fraud and mendicancy; a female citizen and a maid were cited in front of the judges for theft; a man was summoned for attacking a town guard; and two men were prosecuted for breaking into the house of a clerk with the intention of robbery.36 Meanwhile, Igyártó also played a role in preserving and augmenting the town’s financial assets; it was within his authority to keep an account of, and to take possession of, the goods of citizens who died without heirs.37 In addition to his duties as town procurator, he still took private cases.38
the ProCurator “Worthy of skinning” Caught uP in the
Web of vengeanCe, fraud and bribery
So far we have outlined a procurator’s rising career; nonetheless, the following series of data will shed some shadow on this promising career; and it might well serve as an explanation for why the town’s administration had to refuse little by little the services of the town procurator. In fact, from the end of the year 1585 Igyártó appeared more and more often as the accused in front of the magistrate, some calling him to account for a debt he did not repay, others summoning him to court for his acts of verbal and even physical abuse.39 Starting from April 1586 the juridical records show a series of lawsuits in which Igyártó’s serial abuses as a procurator were revealed. The whole affair started when György Igyártó summoned to court as town procurator the maid of a goldsmith, Lukács Beregszászi, called Orsolya.40 During the proceedings the girl submitted a statement to the judge in which she accused Igyártó of misconduct in his activities as a lawyer.41 As a response he tried to prove that the girl was coerced by her employer, Lukács Beregszászi, and his mother-in-law, Zsófia Teremi



98 L. PAKó
(the widow of Gergely Urberger) into accusing him. In accordance with his purpose he sued both of them.42 Searching for the motivation of their lawsuits, we can highlight again certain events from the common past of the people concerned. It turned out that Orsolya and Zsófia Teremi were both confidants of the procurator’s first wife when she was still alive, and had supported her in her quarrels with her husband. After the woman’s death the relationship between Zsófia Teremi’s family and Igyártó must have settled, because when the representatives of the council tried to arrest the procurator and his new wife on their wedding day, Gergely Urberger was one of those who stood surety for him.43 Peaceful relations, however, did not last long, the reason for which might have been the fact that Igyártó failed to keep his oath taken on the day of his release, namely that he was never going to take legal action against Urberger and his family.44 In their testimonies the witnesses of Igyártó’s adversaries all gave their accounts of the shocking legal practices of the town procurator.45 Many of them emphasized that in the town they considered him to be twofaced and “worthy of skinning” because he hadn’t acted righteously in the suits he undertook. There had been several cases where he accepted the representation of both parties in court. András Budai and István Szécsi only became aware that both of their cases were represented by Igyártó when they were all called to appear in the presence of their attorneys in front of the judges. In other cases, he sought secret deals with the opponent of his client, or with the opponent’s attorney. As the attorney of Bálint Kolozsvári he acquired written proof incriminating his client by convincing the opponent he would take his side.46 As the attorney of Ambrus Fóris he secretly approached his opponent and agreed that in exchange for a gemmed knife with a silver sheath he would help his opponent with confidential information throughout the trial: this person ended up winning the suit. Zsófia Teremi accused Igyártó of similar practices: in the inheritance suit after her husband’s death the woman settled with her opponents on the encouragement of Igyártó; then later she found out that the attorney had accepted a bribe from them. One clerk from Beszterce (Bistrița) confessed that during his lawsuit with a man from Nagyszombat (Trnava) Igyártó, as the attorney of his opponent, had offered him to show him a paragraph of the legal code for 25 Forints that could win him the suit. There is evidence of another case when Igyártó changed sides during the proceedings. This happened to István Pécsi during his lawsuit against the orphans of István Schmelczer,



WITCHCRAFT, GREED AND REVENGE: THE PROSECUTOR ACTIVITy ... 99
when Igyártó—partly for financial reasons and partly because of his friendly relations with the orphans—switched to their side. Another man claimed the same concerning his suit, in which Igyártó failed him in the very last phase of the proceedings. A prominent example of his duplicity was his behavior in the lawsuit between András Beuchel and Zsófia Teremi: at the beginning of the trial he was representing the woman, then he switched sides, while he continued to secretly help the woman in preparing her legal documents, even after the case was retried in front of the princely court (tabula, sedis iudiciaria).47 Igyártó approached the attorneys of his opponents in several cases with the intention of bribing them. This is best illustrated by the lawsuit in which he represented László Balázsfi against Balázs Nagy and his attorney, Menyhárt Német from Várad (Oradea). During the proceedings he sent a message to Német, asking him to abandon Balázs Nagy. In exchange János Balázsfi, the son of László Balázsfi, who worked as a clerk at the chancellery, offered Német his influence with the country’s notabilities.48 Since Német, in the name of decency, rejected the offer, Igyártó tried to use money and threats to make him cooperate, but seeing that he was not giving in, he eventually forcefully asked him not to say a word about all this to anyone. Besides the cases we have discussed, several others gave testimonies of his unlawful activities as a town procurator: he was willing to release the accused and drop the charges against them in exchange for financial favors. In the summer of 1585, on the orders of the magistrates of Kolozsvár, Igyártó was supposed to indict Mrs. Ferenc Szabó for fornication. The family of the accused wanted to bribe the bailiff assigned to arrest the woman; but he reassured them that everything had been arranged with Igyártó and that the woman was soon going to be released. Another similar case is related to the 1584 witch-hunt, during which, besides the six women burned at the stake, Igyártó also arrested a seventh, Orsolya, the wife of Mihály Kórós, accusing her of witchcraft. yet the accused did not suffer the same fate as the other women, because her husband bribed Igyártó, who dropped the charges and released the accused. A witness participating as intermediary in the case described the incident in detail: first he tried to make an arrangement with two town ‘directors’ (directores causarum), but since they both directed him to Igyártó, he made a deal with him establishing that the woman would be released if he gave one of the directors present 5 Forints in exchange for his silence, and 11, or maybe 12 Forints to Igyártó himself. Eventually,



100 L. PAKó
the ‘ransom’ paid to Igyártó was raised by 5 Forints; and the woman did escape from being burned at the stake. In the end Igyártó ordered all three of them not to mention the incident to anyone; moreover, Igyártó even went to see the intermediary later to remind him of his earlier promise. After some further clumsy affairs filled with bribery and blackmailing, in 1589 György Igyártó disappears from the sources: we think that meanwhile he passed away.49 Our hypothesis is also confirmed by the fact that at the end of May 1590 his wife had to hire procurators for her ongoing cases.50 Our data on the series of lawsuits end here. In 1592 Igyártó’s wife asked the auditors (exactores rationum) not to consider her as a taxable person separate from her son, since the huge debt her husband had left her with after his death made it impossible for her to sustain a living all by herself.51 Igyártó therefore passed away in the period following the conflict going on since 1586, leaving a considerable amount of debt. As to whether it was his death that caused the end of his career or whether the exposure of his illegal practices was also factor, we can only establish with certainty that according to our sources starting from 1587 there are no new records of the town administration re-electing him as procurator. However, until death he continued to pursue his activities as an attorney of private individuals, and it is worth mentioning that among his clients we find several persons who were in legal conflict with Igyártó’s enemies (Lukács Beregszászi, Zsófia Teremi and others).52
ConCLuding remarks
Even though we do not know how his career ended, the analysis of György Igyártó’s professional career has considerably enriched our knowledge about the activities of a procurator and the judicial practices of late sixteenth-century Kolozsvár, and contributed to a better understanding of witch-hunts in Kolozsvár. We have no data on his preparations to becoming a procurator. The sources do not mention how he might have acquired the necessary legal knowledge to practice the profession. His work as a procurator is documented between 1576 and 1589. He started his career as a private prosecutor, and we have certain data relating to several dozens of cases he represented. His clients were usually citizens of Kolozsvár, and most of them were members of the leading elite of the town. We have one



WITCHCRAFT, GREED AND REVENGE: THE PROSECUTOR ACTIVITy ... 101
reference mentioning him as the town’s elected procurator from 1581, and then more information from 1584. It is he who established the convention of publicly initiated suits in the juridical practices of Kolozsvár. Before that we only know of a few cases where the city council took action against someone through public initiation, and not at the initiative of a private person. With the appearance of Igyártó—who recognized the potential in proceedings from which he could gain personal benefitsthe number of such cases increased. Thus essentially the crimes which until then were overlooked by the court due to the lack of private suitors could now be handled in court more often.53 Igyártó’s character is especially significant, since he reformed the judicial practices of Kolozsvár not only with his activities as a procurator, but in his failure as well. His double-hearted acts have shown how being the city’s public prosecutor while also representing privately initiated suits entails too much power in one man’s hands, which can be exploited for personal interests. This realization might have led to the council of the hundred limiting and specifying the field of authority of the town directors: publicly initiated proceedings thenceforth became the exclusive responsibilities of the elected directors, and the attorneys and procurators also involved in representing clients in private suits were no longer allowed to be involved in these affairs. Thus the duties of the town’s judicial institutions were delineated more accurately, while the opportunities for abuse became limited. György Igyártó was one of the procurators from Kolozsvár who started his legal career as a private attorney of the citizens, later becoming the town procurator. His career proves that town officials who were experienced in legal matters and had the ability to appear as an efficient attorney were quite rare, and therefore highly appreciated, which easily opened the doors to success to them. Despite the income he acquired through his many cases of bribery he was not very successful at property acquisition; on the other hand, he developed an extensive social network around himself in the city. One might say he had connections to the entire town elite; he even made contact with some of the key players in national politics. The fact that unlike others he did not get into any of the town’s leading establishments or go beyond the frameworks of the town was probably due mostly to his personal ambition, character and behavior. With his efficiency he was able to establish a procurator career that earned renown in the urban environment of Kolozsvár, but he also used his influence and political capital to serve his personal ambitions.



102 L. PAKó
Although he was quite well-versed in the field of solving legal problems, the frequent missteps in his private and professional life—even if they were not fatal—undoubtedly hindered his professional advancement. In light of witch hunter personality types identified thus far by research54 we can establish in relation to György Igyártó that he was a known witch persecutor of sixteenth-century Kolozsvár; on a European scale, however, both the intensity and the reputation of his activities fall behind that of the ‘great’ Western and Central European witch hunters. His deeds suggest that he did not fight against witches as a determined and zealous soldier of God or as a saviour of society from diabolical forces; he did not act under forced pressure or out of fear, nor did he strive to eliminate his political or economic enemies; it seems also unlikely that he was driven by lewdness, misogyny or sadistic motivations. Witches were not the only people in his cross-fire; he also prosecuted many other individuals on various charges. He cannot be described as an ingrained serial witch hunter who felt any particular joy or vocation in bringing witches to trial. As the procurator of the town, and accordingly the one responsible in bringing in front of the justice those who endangered the safety and the public order of the town and the citizens, we could see him as a functionary eager to serve his community, a living conscience of the society, for whom these acts might have been also a way to distinguish himself from the other members of the society.55 Nevertheless, his abuses as procurator suggest that the root cause of his activities of this nature was rather vengefulness, which he aimed at those who threatened his place in the social and political hierarchy of the town by damaging his good reputation and his honour. Another motivation for his activities was his greed, seen in the management of his finances; however, in light of the deplorable financial situation of his family after his death, selfish motivations are to be suspected behind his acts, rather than the image of the behavioral norm of the providing family man in early modern male-centred society. Regarding the witch trials of the 1580s, his activities well illustrate how the witchcraft accusations concentrated around such phenomena as power, influence, personal ambition, grievances, pride, vengeance or greed; and demonstrates how the accusations stemming from complicated personal relationships and social tension could escalate into a wave of witch-hunts in early modern Transylvania.

As previous research has already marked, after the intervention of the town’s protestant preacher Ferenc Dávid for reforming the public morality of the town, and in consonance with the hostile attitude of the whole pre-modern Europe towards feasts, since 1573 Carnival had been persistently forbidden by the laws of the town.

Other sources also reveal that they wanted to arrest the couple on their wedding day, but on the surety of some of the people present, they were let go (JudRec II/7: 617). 23. She was accused of having knowledge of witchcraft, of killing certain people with herbs, of owning a diabolical book for treasure hunters, which contained images of kings, devils, the wheel of fortune and other things (Komáromy, Magyarországi boszorkányperek, 23–26; Kiss, Pakó and Tóth G., Kolozsvári boszorkányperek, trial nr. 16.) We do not know the outcome of the trial against her; we do know, however, that she appeared before the town’s court once again in 1592–1593, in a trial following a family scandal (László Pakó, ‘Bíróság elé került boszorkányvádaskodás Kolozsvárt, 1592–1593.’ [Witchcraft accusation at the court of

27. The list of witnesses shows how he tried to line up people who either were related to him or were enemies of Anna Rengő; he called them to the stand in as many suits as possible. Almost half of Igyártó’s witnesses in Anna Rengő’s trial were lined up in his other proceedings. 28.

43. It is also worth mentioning that at the end of 1582 Zsófia Teremi appeared as the procurator’s witness in his suit against Borbála Kassai (JudRec II/7: 106). 44. JudRec II/7: 617–620. 45. In the case of examples from the four above mentioned cases no further citations will be used. 46. After acquiring the documents, though, he still remained in the service of Kolozsvári. 47. The woman explained in detail in her testimony that after Igyártó had seemingly changed to Beuchel’s side he wrote the woman’s documents in secret and sent them to her; then her son-in-law, Lukács Beregszászi asked a goldsmith’s apprentice to copy them and it was only after this that they handed the documents in to the court. The original copy was sent back to Igyártó. 48. János Balázsfi was young when he became a member of the Transylvanian prince’s chancellery; he was a clerk at the ‘smaller chancellery’ in 1563. In the period in question he was presumably serving at the ‘bigger chancellery’. In 1588 he became a requisitor at the place of authentication from Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia), then in 1594 the secretary of the chancellery. See Zsolt Bogdándi, ‘A kolozsvári Balázsfiak.

On 23rd March, 1589, János Pesti was hiring lawyers for his ongoing yearly cases, despite having already done so on 11th February. In the first case we find the name of Igyártó among the names of the hired lawyers, yet in the second case his is the only name missing from the list; he is replaced by someone else. We therefore have good reason to think that it was in fact Igyártó’s death that made the second case necessary. See ProcRec 27, 38, 42. 50. ProcRec 58. 51.

One of the most important characters of the beliefs, conflicts and accusations relating to witchcraft is the healer, described in the Hungarian trial documents as wise man, wise woman, cunning folk, fortune teller, seer, physician (tudós, tudósasszony, tudományos, tudákos, javasasszony, néző, orvos), I will be referring to this “popular magical specialist” in this present study as a “healer”. A healer is a person who establishes the diagnosis of a bewitchment (maleficium) of which the patient is complaining; it is the healer who attempts to identify the bewitching witch, and eventually to lift the bewitchment. Then again, he/she can be brought into suspicion, too: we often find healers among the subjects of witchcraft accusations. In our witchcraft research group with Éva Pócs, we worked for more than a decade on the development of a database encoding thousands of maleficium cases occurring in Hungarian witch trials, in view of a structural analysis of witchcraft-related beliefs.1 We started by identifying typical characters of maleficium narratives from among the personae appearing in the witness testimonies (as Vladimir Propp did once in his “Morphology of the Folk Tale”).2 In our case this list was limited to three basic actors: the “victim”, that is the person affected by the



112 G. KLANICZAy
bewitchment, the suspected witch, and the healer who establishes the fact of bewitchment, identifies the perpetrator and makes an attempt to alleviate the damage and heal the victim. The functions often involved several people. We often find in the position of victim the head of an entire family or household, while the actual casualty of the bewitchment may be the wife, the child, or even the cattle or the crop. Finally, the identifier can be other than the healer; and the victim—in cases where initial attempts fail—can also turn to a number of other healers. To this triangle, taking shape from the functions within the maleficium narratives, and in the context of witch trials one has to add the witnesses; not only those who give the accounts in court, but also those of whom the former mention that they have personally seen, have experienced some momentum of the described bewitchment narrative and who participate in identifying the bewitchment and hunting down the healers, performing some kind of ‘helper’ function. After having determined the dramatis personae, our second—and perhaps the most important—task was to describe the ‘morphology of bewitchment’: the series of sequential elements which forms the narrative structure of these maleficium accounts. Following the preliminary examination of a significant part of the source material, we determined seven structural elements: conflict (between the witch and the victim)—threat—reappearance of the witch in reality—reappearance in a supernatural manner (for instance in a vision or in the shape of an animal)—bewitchment—identification of the bewitcher—and an attempt to heal. Of course we knew that this type of idealized series of events rarely occurs in such an order in the judicial documentation. Some elements may be absent; others might recur more than once. Our goal was indeed to categorize these variants, and we wished to develop a historical typology, the variations and transformations of the bewitchment narrative based on the groups we obtained. During the process of collective analysis of witch trials, we have encountered a hardly surmountable problem. The barrier between bewitchment and healing was often blurred: a failed healing was often interpreted retrospectively as a bewitchment, which entailed the persecution of the healer as a witch. Or, in contrast, the witches under suspicion were pressured into ‘letting loose’: to lift the bewitchment and repair the damage they had caused. Despite all their positive connotations, healing and the healing power are essentially an ambivalent interference with the unpredictable



HEALERS IN HUNGARIAN WITCH TRIALS 113
mechanisms of the natural world, or—according to the mentality of the age—of the supernatural sphere. My inquiry primarily wishes to examine this ambiguity and its role in the development of witchcraft accusations and in the course of witchcraft conflicts. After outlining the international literature on the issue, I will discuss the activities and fates of certain healers appearing in Hungarian witch trials.
the heaLer in WitChCraft historiograPhy
Attention paid to healers was enhanced through the social anthropological approach to the history of witch-hunting. While the focus of previous research was primarily on the fate of the accused witches, the demonological literature responsible for the persecution, and the functioning of the judicial courts, the two pioneers of the new approach following in the footsteps of E.E. Evans-Pritchard3 (who studied the witchcraft beliefs of the North-African Azande), Keith Thomas and Alan Macfarlane extended the historical scrutiny to the ‘sociology of accusation’. This, at the same time, added new and extensive source material to the research: the witness testimonies of the accusers, which (at least partly) shed light on the everyday conflicts lying in the background of the witchcraft accusations. These conflicts, as the new, social anthropological witchcraft research has discovered,4 stemmed from bad neighborly relations, tension between the nouveau riche villagers and those impoverished and marginalized, animosities between the locals and newly-settled strangers, and from the confrontations within extended families and cohabiting groups (mother-in-law, daughter-in-law, tenant, lodger), and led to the witchcraft accusations which, as Robert Briggs has summed it up in the title of one of his essays, had “Many reasons...”.5 Some of these causes were related to the process per se, by which the village healers tried to fend off bewitchment; moreover, to the ambiguous status of the occupation of healing: it was after having recognized this that the attention of research was drawn to the seers, cunning folk and healers, playing significant roles in witchcraft conflicts. Alan Macfarlane, in his analysis of the Essex witch trials between 1560 and 1680, was the first to dedicate an entire chapter to the issue of healers, appearing in the English trial documents under the names of cunning folk, wizard, wise man/woman or white witch. He was able to assemble the data of 41 healers from the witness testimonies (most of whom practiced other activities, such as divination and finding stolen



114 G. KLANICZAy
objects and treasures). As for healers accused and sentenced as witches, he found only four such cases among the 41 healers known by name, and if we consider that during this period in Essex there were more than four hundred witch accusations, it is a small minority, indeed.6
Keith Thomas, in his book Religion and the Decline of Magic, completed the chapter on the activities of cunning folk with a more detailed description of ‘popular magic’ and ‘magical healing’; and placed all this in a wider context by discussing ‘medieval ecclesiastical magic’ (paraliturgical ceremonies, benedictions, ecclesiastical curses, miracles relating to the cult of saints and to the cult of relics, etc..), as well as ‘learned magic’ (astrology, alchemy, conjuration, Hermetic tradition).7 (His analysis sparked fierce debate among anthropologists and historians because of ‘magic’ being a problematic category from a theoretical point of view.8) In any case, Thomas created an exhaustive classification of the early modern agents of magical healing, their incantations, medicines and the special skills of healers. He also showed which ritual actions contributed to the efficacy of healing, based on the documents of the sixteenthseventeenth century English witch trials.9 The next significant step forward in the re-evaluation of the role of healers was taken in France, with the book Deadly Words by Jeanne Favret-Saada, a psychologist who became a folklorist and anthropologist, about contemporary French rural witchcraft beliefs.10 On the basis of Evans-Pritchard’s classification system, revised with critical consideration, Favret-Saada reinterpreted the categories of witchcraft accusation and the actual conflicts, beliefs and psychological mechanisms behind them from the perspective of the relation between the wary victim and the healer. Being a psychologist, she considered this relationship as a type of therapy. As the ‘assistant’ of a healer called Madame Flora, she participated in witch persecution affairs. Her analysis of the magical protective and coercive counter-measures against the ‘witch’, identified on the basis of the victim’s suspicions shaped by divination, can help in understanding the psychological background of early modern witchcraft accusations.11 With the newly risen interest in healers came the exploration of historical documents on archaic popular sorcerers. It was at this time (after it was translated into English) that international witchcraft research took notice of Carlo Ginzburg’s book published in 1966, in which he presented the abundant documentation of the benandanti, the benevolent sorcerers of a fertility cult operating in the North Italian region of Friuli.12 The inquisition accused the benandanti of witchcraft, who



HEALERS IN HUNGARIAN WITCH TRIALS 115
argued in vain that they were in fact the enemies of witches, and that their activities consisted of falling into a trance four times a year (quattro tempora, i.e. on the Ember days), during which their spirit left their bodies and flew off to fight the witches in a ritual battle for the harvested crops. For Carlo Ginzburg these stories confirmed the possible integration of authentic popular belief-elements—however distorted and transformed—into the demonological mythology of the witches’ Sabbath. He also suggested to examine the specific trance-techniques of the benandanti and the beliefs relating to their special gifts (such as being born with a caul) in a wider context, for instance in relation to shamanism. My own studies pointed to the parallel between the benandanti and two sorcerer-figures of South Eastern Europe, the Croatian kresnik and the Serbian zduhač. I suggested that interpreting the beliefs relating to these sorcerer-figures in the context of shamanism allows the possibility of reconsidering the role of the Hungarian táltos.13 Furthermore, the data on them in the witch trial documents reveal that, beside their traditional function of protecting agricultural fertility, the benandanti, táltos and other similar ‘shamanistic’ sorcerer-figures of this period got also involved in healing bewitchment. The research of Éva Pócs brought the next significant turning point in the discussion of this issue. She recognized in the witches’ Sabbath descriptions found in the Hungarian witch trial documents the traces of another archaic belief-system, the influence of the ambiguous fairy mythology of South-East European folklore. This also meant that among the healers of bewitchment some associated their healing skill with an ability to communicate with fairies.14 Instead of the frame of reference of shamanism—considered too general—Éva Pócs proposed that the role of the táltos (especially the táltos women) appearing in the witch trials be interpreted as—frequently ambivalent—healers or treasure seers, and situate them in the context of the history of the diverse South-EastEuropean popular beliefs (which, beside fairies—vila—included other imaginary creatures, such as mora, lidérc, werewolf).15 (Tekla Dömötör has also drawn attention to the role of the táltos as ‘cunning folk’.16) We can add to the group of archaic popular sorcerer-figures the Sicilian magical specialists, the donas de fuera (‘ladies from outside’) who claimed that they joined the fairies and went on ‘soul journeys’ with them, and were accused by the early modern Spanish inquisition of witchcraft.17 Chonrad Stoekhlin, a healer living in the German Alps in the second half of the sixteenth century, spread similar stories about



116 G. KLANICZAy
himself, claiming that his spirit flew off in the night to join the ‘raging army’ (Nachtschar). He was also sentenced as a witch; his story was researched by Wolfgang Behringer.18 With all this new historical material at their disposal by the late 1970s and early 1980s, the attention of researchers was truly drawn to the healers appearing in the witch trials. Richard Horsley argued—with some exaggeration—that they constituted nearly half of the accused at witch trials.19 Robert Muchembled had an interesting hypothesis concerning a 1446 witch trial in the North of France, about the ‘magical balance’ regulating the activities of healers; that is, the positive or negative adjudication of ‘magical status’ depending on proximity or remoteness: the same cunning woman, visited by many from distant villages, was considered and accused of being a witch by her direct environment and neighborhood.20 At the end of the eighties the increasingly extended comparative study of European witch-hunting,21 the new book by Carlo Ginzburg on the archaic beliefs behind the witches’ Sabbath,22 and regional research23 revealed a series of new sources concerning healers. Willem de Blécourt screened through the existing data and hypotheses with a thorough critical analysis. He has shown, for instance, that contrary to Horsley’s exaggerated estimations there were far fewer healers among the accused in Western European witch trials; instead of half of the people brought to trial he found only a minimal percentage. He also noted that the activities of the early modern specialists of popular magic, the cunning folk, should not exclusively be studied in the context of maleficium healing. Their other services, such as finding hidden treasures and love magic, were just as important; these activities also contributed to their status within the village community, which remained after the ban on witchhunting.24 Within this same research field, and approximately at the same time, the question of midwives, who were also subject to witchcraft accusations, was attributed special attention. The ‘midwife-witch’ was a generally accepted witch-type: the American medical historian Thomas Forbes dedicated an entire book to it.25 The subject in Hungarian folklore was discussed in detail by Tekla Dömötör,26 and recently the issue has been studied by Lilla Krász.27 In 1973, Barbara Ehrenreich and Deirdre English, in Witches, Midwives and Nurses: A History of Women Healers, interpreted witchhunting primarily as an attempt to eliminate the traditionally female



HEALERS IN HUNGARIAN WITCH TRIALS 117
activity of healing, during which millions of women were put to death.28 In 1985, the Germans Gunnar Heinsohn and Otto Steiger associated the same thesis with a kind of historical demography, correlating the ‘eradication’ of healer women seen in witch trials, and thus the elimination of the ‘popular’ system of birth control, with a ‘pronatalist’ religious ideology which aimed to boost the early modern growth of population.29 These attractive hypotheses might have played a role in the midwifewitches becoming the focus of every historical study, which addressed the wide-range issue of why the victims of witch-hunting were overwhelmingly women.30 In 1990, David Harley wrote a fervent article to debate the public opinion that increasingly exaggerated the number and significance of midwives among the victims of witch trials.31 He assembled a convincing documentation on how the stereotype (or as he puts it, the ‘myth’) of the midwife-witch was put to focus primarily by fifteenth and sixteenth century demonological literature; especially by the notorious Malleus maleficarum by Henricus Institoris (1486).32 Subsequently it was Margaret Murray who continued its propagation in the twentieth century by uncritically relying on these documents.33 Harley claimed that in the second half of the twentieth century, instead of a more meticulous analysis of the judicial data, the historians of witchcraft prosecutions rather adopted the distorting optics of demonologists. The increasing amount of processed data from the witch trials of Western Europe and from New England, on the other hand, revealed little information on midwife-witches—there were some, but they were more of an exception. Lyndal Roper came to a similar conclusion, she also raised the point that in the South German region where she conducted her research, the witchcraft accusations, which often stemmed from problems occurring during childbirth, affected less the midwives and more the women assisting the childbirth.34 Following these useful debates,35 recent research has not approached the issue of healers and midwifes from the perspective of the bold statements, or with the aim of deciding between the alternatives; it has rather tried to discover the different effects of the various factors related to the activities of healers and their adjudication. Above all, we must mention the studies by Robin Briggs, who dedicated an entire chapter in his book on the Lorraine trials to the ambiguous situation of healers (devins). While the accusers did acknowledge the beneficial role of healers, and many among them were not suspected of witchcraft, here too the belief



118 G. KLANICZAy
nevertheless spread that the witches themselves were also able to lift the bewitchment they had cast; therefore if they got involved in a conflict leading to witchcraft accusation within their community, one subsequently added their healing activities as incriminating evidence against them.36 The detailed analyses of Protestant demonology by Stuart Clark have shown that the situation of healers was worsened, especially in England, by the fact that at the beginning of the seventeenth century several Puritan preachers, such as William Perkins (1558–1602),37 considered, on the basis of Protestant theological concerns, the activities of the cunning folk (the ‘good witches’) even more harmful than that of the maleficent witches, because the former give the impression that they are helping people in trouble with their magical procedures, which are also, inevitably, performed with diabolical assistance.38 The author of the first monograph on the specialists of popular magic, Owen Davies, on the other hand, has noted that the official ecclesiastical standpoint did not prevail, and despite all ‘stigmatization’ the services of the cunning folk continued to be resorted to by a wide range of people until the nineteenth century.39 Davies’s complex overview included the analysis of different procedures, ceremonies, incantations and books involved in various magical activities; he discussed in detail the issue of treasure finding (since then examined in several newer monographs)40; he was the first to attempt an exhaustive European overview of this subject.41 Finally, in terms of our review of international research we must mention the monograph of Emma Wilby,42 who was the first to examine in detail the correlations between the techniques and the fairy familiars of Anglo-Saxon and Scottish healers and the ‘shamanistic visionary traditions’.

We have already mentioned several representatives of the Hungarian folkloristic and historical research (Tekla Dömötör, Éva Pócs and our working group); these works have been in close relation with the issues raised by the international profession. It is worth recalling here some of the results of these researches, since my essay is related to these findings and relies upon their conclusions.



HEALERS IN HUNGARIAN WITCH TRIALS 119
In the past decades, the most interesting discussions concerning the ambiguous role of healers were the ones I encountered in the crowded office of Éva Pócs at the Ethnographic Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, then at her also crowded workshop conferences, and in the essays written by her,43 her colleagues and students (above all Ildikó Kristóf,44 Judit Kis-Halas45 and Péter Tóth G.46). After a decade of our collective efforts, in the mid-1990s two detailed microanalyses were published in which, by processing the system of classification we elaborated—at the time in a traditional, manual manner, since it had yet to be digitized—we pointed out, among other things, the problematic situation of healers: Ildikó Kristóf’s book on the witch trials of Debrecen and of Bihar county,47 and an analysis by Éva Pócs on the evaluation of maleficium narratives, conflicts and witch-types in Sopron county.48 Among the 147 people from Debrecen and the 174 people from Bihar accused of witchcraft in the period between 1575 and 1766, Ildikó Kristóf found altogether 45 healers and 13 midwives. Interestingly, in the city of Debrecen their ratio was disproportionately higher (30.7 and 4.72% of the accused) than in the county, where they indicted six healers and seven midwives (3.4 and 3.97% of the accused). Thus, the situation of healers, and the adjudication of maleficium-healing cases—which Ildikó Kristóf called “dangerous relations”49—were more problematic in the city than in the villages. There is an interesting and detailed picture developing from the exhaustive documentation concerning the arguments of healers defending themselves against the maleficium accusations: they healed with the help of God, and not with diabolical art (“ördögi mesterséggel”), they were the greatest enemies of witches, for which they fell victim to all kinds of harms: Mrs. Ignác Villás in her 1693 trial, for instance, said in her testimony: “... I was a protector, but they bewitched my hand, I can hardly move half of my body, that’s how much they have destroyed me...”.50 Ildikó Kristóf has also shown how the accused women healers were placed under suspicion and accused of witchcraft due to their magical practices; and how Protestantism contributed to this ‘from the top’.51 We obtain a detailed image of the conflicts leading to the witchcraft accusation of healers; conflicts between them and their patients, as well as rivalries between the healers and midwives working in the same street or same district.52 Finally, we learn how in the eighteenth century



120 G. KLANICZAy
the actions of the professional physicians and of the guild of midwives against the ‘illegitimate’ healers only fanned the flames.53 Éva Pócs found 15 healers, three of whom were midwives, among the 144 witches accused in the 73 trials preserved from the period between 1529 and 1768 in Sopron and Sopron county; her description of these cases was embedded into her typology of maleficium-narratives. I would highlight three aspects of her analysis. The first stems from the concept which George Foster called the problem of the ‘limited good’.54 Accordingly, one man’s enrichment happens at the expense of another. In this context, maleficium meant the appropriation of someone else’s household, of the wealth, the ‘well-being’ of the family; and thus the objective of the healing was to constrain the witch to give back what she had taken with bewitchment (the fertility and the yield of the land or of the cattle, the health of the people, or other goods). In such cases there was always a social conflict lying in the background of the witchcraft accusation: rivalry and jealousy among rural farm households.55 In other cases the accusation was a result of some kind of magical conflict: the assumed magical skills and practices of the accused placed him/her under suspicion; the maleficium represented the negative side of magic, while healing represented the positive side of the same thing; the accuser saw a close connection between the two sides.56 In such cases we often saw the competition between rival healers and midwives as a potential root cause of the accusation. In a 1748 trial conducted in Nemeskér and Lakompak we learn of two ‘witches’, who “got into a fight in the presence of the witness; they bad-mouthed each other, Kata Horváth said: you witch healer whore, believe me that I will have you burnt; the other said: you bewitching witch, you are the one who was caught in the stable with the cows of Mr. Bongó...”.57 Two decades after these preliminary studies, Hungarian witchcraft research can today rely on a much wider range of sources and studies. The source publications and essay collections over the course of the several decades of work accumulated such a tremendous volume of information that it makes further examination of every topic related to witchcraft necessary.58 I would like to contribute to this by reviewing the fate of healers in the witch trials in the light of two Hungarian witch trial series: in the very first, panicky witch-hunting resulting in the sixteenth century witch trials in Kolozsvár (Cluj-Napoca), and in the witch trial series in the South-East region of the Hungarian Great Plain (above all



HEALERS IN HUNGARIAN WITCH TRIALS 121
in Hódmezővásárhely and Kiskunhalas) developing under the impact of the 1728 great witch trials of Szeged.
midWives and heaLers in koLozsvár
The documents of the Kolozsvár witch trials between 1565 and 1593 were published by Andor Komáromy in 191059; their new, extended edition edited by András Kiss, László Pakó and Péter Tóth G. was issued in 2014.60 The trial of Klára Bóci (Botzi) and the other witches from Kolozsvár constitute the oldest ensemble of documents, and offers a detailed picture of the development of a ‘wave of witch-hunting’ in early modern Hungary, as well as the variety of beliefs, complicated interpersonal and social tensions that these absurd and horrible accusations consisted of. Most of the new observations in the past decades in relation to the witch trials of Kolozsvár have been associated with the name of András Kiss. It was he who published the oldest known judicial records of a witch trial in Kolozsvár from 1565 against the midwife Prisca Kőműves (Kewmies).61 His book, “Witches, Quacks and Straw-Wreathed Adulteresses”62 included other judicial sources related to the witchcraft accusations, often providing explanation to the conflicts lying in the background, most importantly the documents of the adultery trials. In the third volume of the series of publication of our working group András Kiss published some 90 further Transylvanian witch trials; he analysed the social context of witch trials in Kolozsvár in a number of essays and spent decades researching and preparing the new, extended edition of the witch trials of Kolozsvár.63 Attila Szabó T. published important archival data and interesting excerpts of judicial texts under the entries charm, witch, etc. in the Transylvanian Hungarian Historical Thesaurus.64 Tünde Komáromi discussed “The harms done by six witches” in an interesting article based on documents from the year 1584.65 Relying on the research of (and consultation with) András Kiss, László Pakó published with Péter Tóth G. the complete collection of the witch trials of Kolozsvár, including all these partial publications. Their book doubled the number of known documents, and by publishing the corrected and completed new edition of the earlier published documents, they have opened a new chapter in the study of the issue.66 Sadly, András Kiss could not live to see the publication of his last significant work.

In what follows I will analyze the documents on healers and the midwives from the first period of the abovementioned series of trials. In the half-century between 1565 and 1615 we know of 17 witches who were brought to trial in Kolozsvár, 14 of whom were burnt at the stake. We only know of two acquittals, one case ending in pillorying and in corporal punishment, and the sentences of three trials have not survived. Furthermore, in four cases we only know of witness interrogations, the accusations not being followed up with a trial. We also have documents on nine slander trials, in four of which the person decried as a witch was eventually indemnified; in one case, nonetheless, the trial turned into an actual witch trial, and the denunciator woman was burnt—thus we see that to defend one’s honour before the law was not without risk. In summary, there are documents preserved concerning the witchcraft accusations against 30 people (29 women and one man) from this period. I will not discuss the complex reasons leading to the appearance of witchcraft trials: the religious and social tensions of sixteenth-century Transylvania (the religious polemics accompanying Reformation, and especially Antitrinitarianism and the appearance of the Unitarians; the ethnic conflicts within the town walls; the difficulty of the assimilation of the plebeians moving to the town in great numbers), and the resulting neighborhood conflicts, quarrels based on the differences in mentality or confessional disagreements.67 I would solely like to direct attention towards the twofold question: who were the most active galvanizers of the witchcraft accusations, and what role did the healers play in this matter? The table below shows that out of the 30 people accused (or suspected) of witchcraft eight were healers, among whom four were midwives (I have to treat the two categories as one, since they overlap: the midwives also performed healing practices), which means that more than a quarter of the witches living at this time in Kolozsvár belonged to this category—the ratio is approximately the same as the one observed by Ildikó Kristóf in the case of Debrecen.68 We should examine the other side as well, the category of the witchaccusers. There are two main accusers who reappear in the Kolozsvár trials. From the research of András Kiss we know the tireless private suitor of the first trials in Kolozsvár, the tailor living in the neighborhood of Magyar Street, Péter Gruz.69 It was he who managed the torture of the accused of the first preserved trial, Prisca Kőmíves, making her reveal the names of the witches in town. Gruz also launched the proceedings against two of the mentioned witches—Klára Bóci and Rúsa—as a private



HEALERS IN HUNGARIAN WITCH TRIALS 123
suitor, even though he had no personal complaints against them.70 Associated with the name of this belligerent person, András Kiss assembled a remarkable series of trials, slander cases, an unsuccessful divorce procedure (in which he accused his own wife of witchcraft), his quarrels with the Saxons and his religious conflicts (Péter Gruz went against the Unitarian majority of the town, he turned to the Prince asking him to send a priest of the old faith to Kolozsvár). It was with his lengthy testimony that the adultery trial of the former first judge of Kolozsvár, Kálmán Nyírő, started in 1582.71 The other notorious witch accuser of sixteenth-century Kolozsvár was the town procurator, György Igyártó, who was also brought to the attention of historical research by András Kiss72; the documents relating to his activities were recently studied by László Pakó.73 Similar to the increasing condemnation of urban festivities, especially of Carnivals, throughout Europe,74 from 1573—after taking the advice of Ferenc Dávid to reform morals—it was forbidden in Kolozsvár to celebrate Carnival or to organize masquerades according to the old customs. When this ban was violated by some in 1582, György Igyártó took action against Anna Rengő and her company, who allegedly were dressed in men’s clothes. The witnesses defending the accused Anna Rengő, nonetheless, quickly discredited the procurator suing in the name of morality and revealed his true face, accusing him of murdering his wife, of theft, of accepting bribery and of adultery. Igyártó’s response was to accuse Anna Rengő’s witnesses of witchcraft. Two such witness testimonies have survived from 1582 to 1583, one against Borbála Kassai, and the other against a woman named Erzsébet.75 No verdict of their procedures has been preserved: we can tell, however, that the procurator visibly took a shine to witch-hunting. While the previous proceedings were initiated by private suitors, “in 1584 several witches were burnt at the stake who were arrested by György Igyártó, the elected procurator of the town”.76 This year became the most devastating in the history of the Kolozsvár ‘witch craze’: The six women (Kató Szabó, Mrs. János Sós, the mother of Mrs. Varga, Mrs. Lakatos, Mrs. Miklós Szeles and Mrs. Ambrus Zöld), accused by Igyártó as the public attorney of the town, all ended up at the stake.77 Igyártó had a significant personal role in these verdicts: in three cases the judges were inclined to acquit the accused with a cleansing oath, but the prosecution appealed to the senators for a death sentence—successfully.78 It also does not dignify Igyártó that he was willing to drop the witchcraft charges against the seventh arrested woman, Mrs. Mihály Kórós, in exchange for bribery.79



124 G. KLANICZAy
What is the connection between the two obsessive accusers and the witchcraft accusations against healers? Interestingly, the number of healers among the ‘trophies’ of both is above the average. Of the three victims of Péter Gruz, both Prisca Kőmíves and Klára Bóci were midwives and healers, and the third, Rúsa, was a simple healer.80 Péter Gruz reappeared later, in 1584, as a witness in a trial against a healer, where he said: “...I will have the mother of Mrs. Varga captured, because I suspect that she is the one who eats up my son!” and, allegedly, the healer did in fact alleviate the bewitchment after having heard these threats.81 György Igyártó, after the—to us unknown—outcome of his conflict with Anna Rengő and her company, also continued primarily to send healers to the stake: from the six death sentences resulting from his activity four of the victims (Kató Szabó, Mrs. János Sós, the mother of Mrs. Varga, Mrs. Ambrus Zöld) were healers.82 It is worth noting whom the accusers chose to denounce, they must have had an above-average sensibility toward finding the right, vulnerable targets with black clouds gathering above their heads. This is what the ‘official’ witch accusers do. Such was the “seer from Rőd”, who appears in several of the witness testimonies: in a trial from 1584 they mention him by the name of “Seer Ambrus”.83 (It is a question whether he was the same seer whom the people from Kolozsvár visited regularly in Rőd: in the trial of Klára Bóci, among the noctuae mulieres she accused there was a certain Magdalena Futa (Fwta) “de Rewd”, and the name occurred much later, in 1591 as well.)84 Why was the activity of healers surrounded by so much suspicion, animosity, anger and accusation? The witness testimonies offer various answers to this question. I will examine the judicial documents of Klára Bóci’s 1565 trial,85 and I will complete the picture obtained from the analysis with a few episodes preserved from a decade or two later, in the trials against witches and healers from Kolozsvár. Mrs. Orbán Etwes Magdolna, the first witness of the trial, said in her testimony that “Klára Bóci told her before her child was born: if she wants the infant to live, she should call her [as midwife], otherwise the baby will not make it long.” From the testimony of her husband, Orbán Etwes (7) we also know that despite her threats they did not ask Klára to be their midwife, and the infant in question died five days after birththerefore they actually believed that the curse had had its effect and the neglected midwife had avenged herself.



HEALERS IN HUNGARIAN WITCH TRIALS 125
Another witness, György Kis (5) also referred to the ambiguity resulting from the uncertainty of the healing; he said the following:
Klára served at the witness’s house as payment for healing his leg. She treated him for three weeks, from Saint Michael’s feast until after Christmas, but instead of healing, she bewitched and ruined him. At this point the witness complained to her that she had bewitched his leg, and had not made him healthier. Klára replied: “I have the power both to heal and to harm; the plants and the herbs talk to me and offer their services. They say: take me and I will tell you what you can use me for.”86
The first two cases already give us a characteristic picture. Klára Bóci, working as a midwife and a healer, tried threats and boasting to bolster her reputation and to convince her circle of acquaintance to use her services. She might have thought that if she told everyone that besides helping and healing, she was also capable of causing harm, they would see that it was better not to upset her. The accusers of the midwife, Mrs. János Sós, sued in 1584, testified to a similar series of threats: “She said: well, you didn’t call me, so just wait [...], and you will regret it...”87 The threats are also important in terms of collecting the promised payment, as the witnesses testifying against the mother of Mrs. Varga stated during the trial in 1584:
... I asked the mother of Mrs. Varga if she could heal my leg, and she replied with great anger: you know you did not give me the 12 dinars! [...] and after these words she left in a rage.88
The threats suggest that the forgotten payment may have been responsible for the resurgence of the illness. Kató Szabó, another witch burnt in 1584, said the following: “I healed the daughter of Imre Zilwassy, they didn’t pay for my hard trouble, she might be healthy today, but I couldn’t tell how she will be tomorrow.”89 During the time of witchhunts this traditional weapon could easily backfire: if the healing or the birth did not go well, it often led to an accusation that the midwife or the healer was actually a maleficent witch. In the case of Klára Bóci this suspicion was confirmed by her own previous statements, and her pretentious boasting of her supernatural talents only made things worse for her. One witness, Péter Bendig (2) described how Klára bragged to him:



126 G. KLANICZAy
If I didn’t help him, Gáspár Szewch would have never been able to get married and to lay with his wife. He can copulate with whomever I want, and with no other, that’s how far my knowledge goes.90
This motif reappears in other testimonies as well: she promised to Dorottya, the wife of Tibor Kovács (8) to “help her get pregnant, moreover, to get pregnant with twins, a boy and a girl”.91 A girl called Orsolya (9) also heard her saying: “...if she wished, she would make you fertile, if she wanted the opposite, she would make you barren”.92 When Margit, the wife of Máté Kovács (10), complained to Klára about not getting pregnant, she reassured her: “if she wanted, she would help her get pregnant”.93 She not only had power over human fertility: a farmer, Vince Adam (4) said in his account:
...Klára arrived at his place when he was coming home from planting wheat: when she saw this, she sighed, or rather moaned, “Oh, if you had told me sooner that you were about to plant, I would have taught you words so that your wheat would grow pure and stay perfect!’ She even told the words to the witness but he did not remember them.94
Influencing sexuality and agricultural activities has been the primary focus of suspicious magical practices since Antiquity (Plinius described the case of Furius Cresimus, who increased the wealth of his land with magical tools [B.C. 186], and the notorious trial against Apuleius [B.C. 156–158] commemorates accusations relating to love magic).95 The ‘expertise’ in these matters gave midwives authority in this field, and also placed them under suspicion. Causing or healing impotence and barrenness, awakening the desire of love, providing or taking away agricultural fertility, displacing it to the land or livestock of someone else, have been the essence of medieval witchcraft-beliefs; it was included in the description of fifteenth-century demonological treatises, such as the infamous Malleus maleficarum published in 1487.96 Thus, if Klára Bóci bragged about such things, it backlashed when the trial against her started. We can cite a similar boasting statement from the witch trial of the mother of Mrs. Varga from 1584: “She also said: you are lucky you came here, otherwise your leg would have broken.”97 Part of the boasting was to show how Klára acquired her supernatural skills. On this matter it is one of her first accusers, the aforementioned



HEALERS IN HUNGARIAN WITCH TRIALS 127
Orbán Etwes (7) who has a lengthy story, complemented with further details by two of his friends, Péter Asztalos (15) and György Bácsi (16), confirming that these stories must have been discussed frequently before Klára’s arrest. According to Klára she was working at a man’s house in Nagyvárad (Oradea) as a maid, and there, with the help of the landlady, she secretly stole pieces of the landlord’s food, and by consuming them mixed with the meat of a snake (or, according to others, a snail) cooked for this particular purpose, she became able to understand the language of birds, reptiles and every other animal, and to see through their intentions. When the landlord found out, he made her swear that she would only start using this skill 3 years later. He also gave her a book, which she still keeps; the herbs first started to talk to her when she was reading this book in a meadow.98 György Kis (5), whom we have mentioned above, heard from her on the other hand that she had learned her skills in Italy from an Italian man. Klára boasted to him, saying that “if she touched the clothes of the judge, he would never carry on an investigation against her, and he would never pronounce a verdict over her” (the skill of bewitching the judges is also an old belief, and is described by the demonological handbooks).99 The reputation of having supernatural skills made the midwives and the healers quite infamous and feared at the moment when witchhunting started. If people had nightmarish experiences they tended to associate these witch apparitions with them. We can read several such testimonies in Klára Bóci’s trial: Margit, the wife of Imre Raw (20), said that “on her way home from Monostor two huge dogs started to follow her, and when they arrived at the little gates of Monostor, one of the dogs turned into a pig and started to spit fire, the flames reached her and set her coat on fire, then the demons pushed her into a ditch, then her burning coat was extinguished [by the water]”.100 The witness did not add any direct interpretation to this story, but since her testimony continues with a discussion of Klára’s midwifery and the illness of her new-born child, it is obvious that the diabolic dog-pig apparition was also attributed to her. The main reason behind suing Klára might have been the fact that Prisca Kőmíves, the previously sued midwife from Kolozsvár who was burnt at the stake for witchcraft, mentioned her name in her confession.101 Prisca’s trial noticeably stirred up the public opinion of the town, as was reflected by several testimonies in Klára’s trial: Magdolna, the wife of



128 G. KLANICZAy
Bálint Zygyártó (3), said that “the burnt witch (nocticorax) unequivocally confessed in the central court of the town-hall (in atrio consistorii) during the interrogation by Péter Gruz, that the named Klára Bóci, Mrs. Zekeres and Rúsa were ‘charmers’ (fascinatrices), and there lived another one in the outskirts of the town.’102 Bálint Kiss (13) and János Barbély (17) also refer to this information; the latter even adds that Prisca said, ‘in witchcraft (in veneficio) Klára Bóci is the ‘principal’ (praecipua)”.103 The Kolozsvár trials illustrate well the active role paradoxically played by the prospective accused themselves in launching the waves of persecution: in a considerable percentage of the cases the accusations originated from midwives and healers, targeting mostly rival midwives and healers. In the trials of 1565 the biggest accuser was Klára Bóci herself. The accusation against Gertrúd from Hídelve,104 sued for witchcraft (but burnt in 1565, for a change, as the result of a neighborly conflict), was initiated by none other than Klára Bóci, who cured the wife of the accuser János Neb and according to whom the cause of her illness was the bewitchment cast by the neighbor; she even confirmed her suspicion with remarkable stories. According to one of her visions during a treatment Gertrúd “came with seven others and they tried to attack them, and they would have killed both her and her husband, János Neb, but thanks to Klára’s presence, they were unsuccessful”.105 Another—somewhat confusing—story about Klára Bóci is related to the healing of Péter Asztalos. Having arrived at the patient’s home, before beginning the ‘treatment’ Klára “sat next to the stove, yawned and stretched her limbs, moaning and saying: ‘Oh these beastly whores, how they tormented me during the night!’”. It was the same patient of whom Klára said that when she went to his place to heal him, a black cat came inside the house, visibly with the aim of obstructing the treatment: “its eyes were glowing like two candles”; “it breathed such fiery heat into the house that they almost suffocated from it”; no one was able to oust it, it jumped between the shelves and the beams of the ceiling and “knocked down a drinking bowl with such impetus that, had it fallen on the good man treated [by Klára] [...], and hit him, he might have died.”106 This story sheds light on an important catalyst of witchcraft conflicts: the most frequently established diagnosis by healer women is bewitchment (maleficium). Thus, healing is in fact a dramatic and dangerous defiance of the witch or other spirits causing the illness, forcing them to lift the bewitchment. This explains the frequent complaints of healers



HEALERS IN HUNGARIAN WITCH TRIALS 129
about the harms they suffer. “Those whores torment my daughter because I am healing the person those whores have bewitched”, said the mother of Mrs. Varga in 1584.107 The witnesses of Klára Bóci’s trial have also described such cases: János Barbély (17) said that the cause for his son’s swollen, gangrenous foot, according to Klára, was that once during soaking it in the water, “the witches (nocticoraces) grabbed it”; she started to scold the “beasts,” and promised to heal him (although she did not succeed, as the boy died 4 days later).108 István Bleum (11) and his brother, Lőrinc (12) testified that according to Klára’s diagnosis it was Rúsa who bewitched (infecisset) their mother, and she tried to teach them how to defend themselves against the attacks of witches.109 The story of Barbara, the wife of Szaniszló Bechel (21), runs: “...during the time Klára treated her she told her that she had been bewitched by a friend of hers, who would soon visit her; and as soon as she closed the door behind [Klára], a woman came to see her, who became very suspicious to her, and it was Rúsa.”110 In Rúsa’s trial it was Mrs. Mihály Kádár, Erzsébet, who said:
Klára Bóci told her about two years ago that her leg and joints were bewitched by the ‘fair women’ (szépasszonyok), but she would not say her name close to the house, she can only say that she lived in Szappan Street [...], and the reason for not daring to say their names is that they would eat her...111
It was not only Klára Bóci who took part in the accusations, but the other midwives and healers as well. Angleta, the wife of Imre Garner, said that when a young soldier’s foot was ‘bewitched’, Prisca Kőmíves (“who was recently burnt at the pole”) had also named Rúsa as responsible.112 She also entered a conflict with Klára Bóci (Bochy) when they both tried to heal the mother of Zsófia, the wife of Márton Mészáros.113 It does not take much to recognize the rivalry of competitive midwives and healers behind these accusations: the new healer labels the healing method of the other healer as harmful and maleficent. Nevertheless, when the healers call each other witches, they are spreading the belief that the two activities stem from the same root; and it is only a matter of perspective and interpretation to decide which one of them is the positive character in a certain situation. The conflict of Mrs. Ambrus Zöld, burnt in 1584, and the mother of Mrs. Varga, burnt in the same year, is a good example of this. Jeremiás Takács testifies:



130 G. KLANICZAy
The foot of one of my children was twisted; the mother of Mrs. Varga bandaged it. The same day, Mrs. Zöld came to our house, no one called her, neither me, nor my wife; on the contrary, we were quite surprised when she came in. She picked up the child from the cradle; my wife asked her not to unbind the bandage. But she shuffled the bandage off and said that it was full of poison, so she bandaged it again, and we didn’t say a word to her then. She invited herself, saying that she would come back soon. And she did come again, and she demanded a payment, she asked for two Forints, and we settled at one and a half Forints. The child was barely one-year-old, and three days after his foot was sprained, she did something so that she gave me back my child with no infirmity whatsoever. I immediately started to believe that the devil who caused the infirmity is the devil who can heal it.114
The statement claiming that “the devil who caused the infirmity is the devil who can heal it” already suggests the reverse logic according to which if someone healed with success, then that same person was responsible for the bewitchment of the patient as well. Thus the healer was in fact a witch, and healing consisted of the witch ‘lifting’ her previous bewitchment. The case of Kató Szabó, a midwife-healer burnt in 1584, is a good example for this. Márta, the wife of Bálint Érsek testifies:
When I was after childbirth, I called for Kató Szabó to be my midwife, and she treated me, but since she asked for too much payment, we couldn’t pay her. And then I got swollen so bad, that I couldn’t see with my eyes. My husband started to beg Kató Szabó to heal me, and that he would pay her anything. And she healed me, which made me suspect her.115
The confusion between the bewitching and healing techniques and roles was exacerbated by other factors as well: unsuccessful healings, suspicious medicines. The next demonstrative example is from the practice of Kató Szabó. Angalit, the wife of Pál Razman testifies:
The other day, in the time of Lent, I fell ill, and I called Kató Szabó, she massaged me and I finally felt better. And when I was about to sweep the house I found a piece of salt under the furnace, it was tied with three strings. It was a fine white piece of salt, and on the three strings thirty knots were tied. I asked around thoroughly if someone had lost anything, so that I can finally find out who had left this thing there. But no one else has been at my house. And since I picked it up, the strength in my hands and legs has been running out from day to day.116



HEALERS IN HUNGARIAN WITCH TRIALS 131
Another suspicious medicine is described at the trial of this same Kató Szabó:
...Kató Szabó treated the daughter of Mrs. István Barat, Mrs. Ferenc, the wife of the pastor. She made her a bath, too, but she prepared it at her house. Once my mistress told us, “Go, my dear girls, find out what she is concocting this bath from, because it is so stinky that I can’t stand it.” So I went with my companion, and she was not at home, but she had not closed the door of the room where she had boiled it; at other times it had been locked; she did not let us see it. So we went to see what she was boiling, and the cauldron was full of bones which she had boiled; but I could not tell what kind of bones they were.117
The mutual accusation between the midwives and healers of Kolozsvár gave us an insight into a sad process. The popular healers working with the diagnosis of maleficium had been able to ‘handle’ the internal tensions of small communities; the commotion and rivalry between them, however, made it possible to adapt flexibly to the division within the community, one or the other healer proposing an acceptable solution, usually trying to denigrate the competition. Nevertheless, in the conflicttorn period of the sixteenth and the seventeenth century, during the time of wars of religion and of the ‘transition’ to the modern world, this system was visibly unfit to continue functioning. One can see here a kind of short-circuit in the system of popular medicine. The traditional witchchasing divination techniques of the ‘specialists’ and the counter magic they used to symbolically harm were replaced by a more radical solution provided by the court of justice to the victims: to sue and burn everyone suspected of witchcraft. Thus, in this situation the mutual accusations among midwives and healers rebounded at them. By the time they realized this it was too late. This recognition can be found in the trial of Kató Szabó: “it is either the maleficent whore who will die because of me, or it will be me who dies because of her”.118
heaLers and midWives around the WitCh-Craze
of szeged
The central role played by healers and midwives in the witch trials of Kolozsvár illustrates the important role the specialists of magical healing and the rivalry between them might have played in the accusations at the



132 G. KLANICZAy
beginning of the massive waves of witch-hunting. In this section I would like to examine with a short overview the situation of healers and midwives at the peak of Hungarian witch-hunting, in the decades after the great witch-hunt of 1728 in Szeged. I will discuss two examples with an analysis of the witch trials of the two largest market towns near Szeged: Hódmezővásárhely and Kiskunhalas. First we must mention the witch-craze of Szeged, during which several dozens of accused were arrested, eight of them dying in prison, and 13 more being sentenced to death and burnt on the basis of confessions obtained through torture, including those of the former first judge of Szeged, Dániel Rózsa, and his wife, admitting a pact with the Devil.119 We can observe a number of reasons lying behind the witch-hunt in Szeged. The 1728 witch craze can be partially explained by the earlier plague epidemics (1709, 1712), the flood (1712), the fire destroying the town (1722), reappearing droughts and famines (one of the main accusation against witches being that “the witches sold the rain to the Turkish lands”120), the numerous conflicts due to immigration in the previous decades within an ethnically divided population, and finally the series of conflicts related to the 1728 town elections ending with the defeat of the ‘Hungarian party’ and the victory of György Podhradszky.121 The most significant ‘new element’ in the Szeged witch-hunt in terms of the series of Hungarian witch trials122 was the prevalence of the mechanism forcing the accused—by means of horrible torture—to admit to having a pact with the Devil and to the witches’ Sabbath123 (a scheme completely unknown to popular beliefs on witchcraft, a mythology elaborated by Catholic and Protestant demonologists). True, the motifs of the Devil’s pact and the nightly witch gatherings had been present in Hungarian trials since the sixteenth century,124 and they had archaic antecedents rooted in popular beliefs.125 Mention of or ‘admission’ to these, however, only became widespread as a result of the suggestive interrogation questionnaire of the Praxis Criminalis. This was the Lower Austrian penal code created in 1656 and based upon the works of Benedict Carpzov, the criminal lawyer from Wittenberg, and other demonologists: in 1696, after Leopold Karl von Kollonitsch had translated it into Latin, it was included in the Hungarian Corpus juris.126 The ‘thoroughness’ of the interrogators in Szeged was unique in the field. In following the questions of the Praxis criminalis verbatim they were able to retrieve a confession of almost every accused, admitting to stories of fornication with the Devil and of other blasphemous ceremonies,



HEALERS IN HUNGARIAN WITCH TRIALS 133
as well as the names of further ‘accomplices’, and this led to a wave of persecution spreading like wildfire, and, as observed in the case of Western European witch-hunting, turning into an hysterical panic. Beside all this, nonetheless, the healers and the midwives still played an important role in the accusations. In this tense situation the ignition spark was provided in 1728 by the desperate accusations and lawsuit against Mrs. Kökény, née Anna Nagy, a midwife and healer who had been sued and convicted127 for witchcraft 2 years earlier in Makó.128 Among the accused there were five other midwives beside Mrs. Kökény, née Anna Nagy: Mrs. Pál Jancsó née Katalin Szanda (also accused alongside her in Makó), Mrs. Pálfi (Mrs. Kerela), née Ilona Köre, Kata Malmos, Kata Rácz and Borbála Hisen. In the accusations of Mrs. Kökény we encounter again the midwife rivalry we have already seen in Kolozsvár: it was she who, while healing, accused Borbála Hisen of maleficium,129 and referred to those who were healing the people complaining of her (Ilona Köre, Kata Malmos and Kata Rácz) as belonging to a ‘group of witches’.130 The rumours of the witch-hunt in Szeged spread quickly. Soon the newspapers in Vienna, Germany, even in Scotland, were writing about it,131 and since, by then, such mass witchcraft accusation was provoking an outrage all over Europe, the court of Vienna requested the documents of these trials, and made significant efforts to put an end to the persecution.132 In Szeged, this did indeed stop shortly afterwards: in 1729, they burned two further witches, in 1730 another accused was sent to torture and the midwife Mária Anna Lőrik died in prison,133 but after that they issued softer verdicts. In 1730, Ilona Csipkekötő Ergelőczi and Mrs. Ludas Molnár, née Zsófia Kovács, two healers placed under suspicion during the accusations of 1728 who had withstood torture, did not confess to having a pact with the Devil and kept on denying the accusation of witchcraft, were only sentenced to exile (relegatio).134 We have no knowledge of the fate of Katalin Jámbor, sentenced to torture in the same year. It was also in 1731 that four men from a village near Szeged were accused of witchcraft and released after eight months in prison.135 In 1733 there was a new verdict of torture, beheading and burning at the stake against Mrs. Mátyás Szeri, née Katalin Csorna, who ‘confessed’ during the second round of torture to the Devil’s pact and to other demonological charges.136 Between 1734 and 1736, Ilona Károlyi, Mrs. Szibini Sánta, also known as Mrs. István Kisgörög and Mrs. Gergely Pávó, née Ilona Fúrús, who had all endured torture,



134 G. KLANICZAy
escaped execution.137 In 1736–1737 another accused, Mrs. Mihály Bordás, née Katalin Pápai was acquitted and sentenced to exile.138 Two healers accused of witchcraft in 1737, Mrs. János Búza, née Ilona Molnár and Mrs. György Hódi, née Rózsa Kovács, met similar fates, although the latter did confess during torture to having a pact with the Devil. These confessions also show that the memory of witch-burning was in 1728 still very much alive: the names of Mrs. Kökény and Mrs. Szanda came up several times during the torture interrogations.139 Meanwhile, we can also see that after the panic the witchcraft accusations in Szeged were put back on a ‘normal’ tack, with one or two trials per year—mostly on the basis of neighborly, spousal conflicts, and occasionally on the failure and rivalry of healers and midwives. The next witch trial took place only in 1744 against two midwife-healers who had mutually accused each other while treating the same patients: the widow of Gergely Fóris, Ágnes Dóka and Mrs. János Lantos, Margit (formerly Mrs. Báló). After the torture the verdict was again acquittal and exile.140 In the vicinity of Szeged, however, the witch-hunt was just starting to proliferate during these decades. It was not only the shocking news of the burning of Dániel Rózsa and ‘company’ that stirred the public opinion of the neighboring market towns, but also the fact that the witchhunting judges of Szeged sent out the names of the people from outside Szeged mentioned in the testimonies and during the interrogations, in order to encourage the neighboring courts to follow their example.141 My next two examples, the witch trial series of Hódmezővásárhely and Kiskunhalas, illustrate well this phenomenon—in the analysis, once again, I will focus primarily on the fate of the healer women. The witch trials in Hódmezővásárhely undoubtedly started under the influence of the witch-burnings in Szeged, and although it did not lead to a ‘witch-craze’ similar to that of Szeged, it can be considered serious. Between 1729 and 1759 there were altogether 45 people (43 women and two men) in the market town and its vicinity who were accused of witchcraft, six of whom were assuredly sentenced to death, beheaded and then burnt.142 The testimonies also confirm the direct influence of the persecution in Szeged. In the testimonies against Mrs. Masas (Mrs. István Vecseri, née Erzsébet Nagy), the healer-midwife burnt in 1730, we can read the following:
When they were arresting the witches in the noble town of Szeged, Mrs. Masas went to the witness’s house and, mounting on the fireplace in the



HEALERS IN HUNGARIAN WITCH TRIALS 135
kitchen, told the witness, crying: “Oh my God, where should I go, and what should I do, I don’t know what kind of death I will die, I don’t have any money, because I spent it on my son and on my house, how should I redeem myself... I’d rather kill myself than to die such a tortuous death...”143
In the trial of the healer Mrs. András Égető, née Ilona Damián, burnt in 1734, one of the witnesses ‘swearing on her head’, the 25-year-old Mrs. Márton Hesey, née Erzsébet Barta, presented a colorful story of how the accused had dragged her with an entire group of witches to the witches’ Sabbath in the night, “and the whole regiment headed towards Szeged”.144 The most detailed references to Szeged can be found in the trial of four witches accused (and—although their verdict was not preserved—probably burnt) collectively in 1739 in Mindszent, a borough next to Hódmezővásárhely. The 50-year-old miller, witnessing one night the witches’ Sabbath, testified as follows:
In the year 1728, when Dániel Rosa and company were burnt in Szeged, it was the week of Pentecost when he wanted to go out from the village before midnight to the mills [...] he saw an armed regiment on horseback [...] who were bursting out in laughter and headed towards [Hódmező] Vásárhely...145
The 120-(!)year-old man accused in this same trial, János Borsos, was threatened by “the poor peasant woman at the house” who said:
Old man, the executioner of Szeged was called to come to our village hall, and we (!) will have you tortured. – To this János Borsos replied in the presence of the witness: “Do you have a Devil’s soul? I would confess enough even if they didn’t torture me.”146
Unlike the Szeged trials, however, the accusations in Hódmezővásárhely did not become interwoven with the problem of local natural disasters and of social conflicts: we could find no trace in the trials of the 1738 epidemic that resulted in the death of some 3000 victims, or of the 17521753 kuruc rebellion led by Törő, Pető and Bujdosó.147 The accusations were rather adapted to the popular Hungarian model, and were mostly in connection with healing and familial and neighborly conflicts. We have found several poor wandering beggarwomen among the accused: one of them, Mrs. Mihály Ludverő was described even by his own son as follows:



136 G. KLANICZAy
“...my mother drank all she had, it wouldn’t be a waste to burn her!”148 The majority of the accused were old women, many of them widows. The suspicion of witchcraft often stigmatized other family members as well: the witnesses against Mrs. Mihály Balog, née Dorottya Deme, sued in 1734, mention that “both her mother and grandmother [...] were notoriously suspicious persons in the entire town, as was her aunt, Mrs. István Deme [...] who was tortured by the executioners.”149 One of the two indicted men, Mihály Horváth, was accused and then exiled during the investigation against his wife, Mária Linka. In this context, as well, we can observe how the healers continued to be the primary targets of witchcraft accusations. From the 45 accused there were 14, that is, one third of the accused (31%) associated with a healing activity in the testimonies (interestingly, while in Szeged most of the accused healers were also midwives, here we found only one midwife). Thus, the ratio of healers in Hódmezővásárhely at the peak of the Hungarian witch-hunting was very similar to what we have seen in Kolozsvár at the dawn of the persecutions, where during the 50 years we have examined eight out of the 30 accused witches were also healers or midwives (26.6%), or as in the case of Debrecen, researched by Ildikó Kristóf (34.1%).150 Apparently Hungarian witch-hunting151 differs in this regard from the model observed in Western Europe: here the witchcraft conflicts related to healing played a more significant role in the witch trials. This observation is confirmed by my other eighteenth-century example, from another town in the vicinity of Szeged: the Kiskunhalas witch trial series. Between 1733 and 1759, 15 accused were brought to trial charged with witchcraft (see table III); two verdicts of burning at the stake have been preserved, a further two death sentences seem probable and a fifth accused died in captivity. Similar to the trials in Hódmezővásárhely the witch-hunt started as a result of the witch-burnings in Szeged. The first big trial was similar to that of Szeged, a complex case in 1734 against nine accused. The primary accused individual in the trial, the 78-year-old Ferenc Bangó, was acquainted with Dániel Rózsa who had been burnt in Szeged—he refers to him in his testimony:
Why were you put in prison in [Kiskun]Halas?
Because the man named Dániel Rózsa, who was burnt in the noble royal town of Szeged, came to my house on one occasion, in the night, and I provided him with accommodation with my brother; and since I was



HEALERS IN HUNGARIAN WITCH TRIALS 137
acquainted with the said Dániel Rózsa, whenever I had something to do in Szeged, I stayed at his house, and if he had business here, he stayed at my house. This is why they arrested me; I have been in prison for thirteen weeks.
Have you known and have you been on speaking terms with Dániel Rózsa for long?
Since the battle of Buda.152
It is due to this well-known acquaintance that Albert János Balog, the Elder, accused him and complained of “Ferenc Bangó having shot him with an arrow.” With the the help of his ‘healer’, János Vékei, he [Bangó] constructed a story to support the accusation, according to which “he was a captain in the [witch] regiment [...], their banner could be seen from [Kiskun]Halas to Szeged when they extended it”.153 The other ‘primary accused,’ Anna Hős was suspected of being a witch because she was an acquaintance of Mrs. Kökény, née Anna Nagy, the midwife playing a key role in the outbreak of the Szeged trials. According to the witnesses she took her son to Mrs. Kökény to heal him but, as the accusers claimed, she told her: “Why do you take him to get healed, when it is you who bewitched the poor child?”154 The case of a third accused, István Turos gives an interesting illustration of how the accusations spread in bar discussions:
István Turos had a quarrel when he bragged about his knowledge of the judges and jurors of [Kiskun]Halas: he recognized the current judge of Szeged as soon as he saw him – he said – that he was definitely a witch, and there were others in the Council, even among the jurors and judges of Halas who were witches.
The case of Dániel Rózsa must have provided a weapon for the ‘little men’ to attack the higher officials; it often backfired, however, and the latter retaliated, stating that “They say that Turos is the standard-bearer of the witches”, and that he should have been relieved that “his much idle talk” was not followed by serious consequences.155 The influence of the witch-craze in Szeged can also be sensed in the first witch trial in Kiskunhalas: the majority of the testimonies did not describe the ‘typical’ conflicts (supposed bewitchment instead of healing, supposed vengeance for a refused favor, or some other conflictual



138 G. KLANICZAy
animosity) leading to witchcraft accusations, but were fable-like narratives of nightly witch-apparitions. Among the most frequently reappearing narratives was that of the victim being turned into a horse (lóvátétel) and then ridden (megnyargalás) and taken to a witches’ gathering. One interesting recurring motive in the testimonies is that the witches in the mill were “grinding flies” on their back.156 Moreover, we can establish that the healing activity is again a central factor: four out of the nine accused were mentioned as healers, and a fifth, Gergely Baranyi Tóth was said to be a ‘cunning man’ (tudományos), “who could command snakes”.157 The 1734 witch trial, which ended with two cases of torture (and presumably burnings) and one letter of obligation (reverzális), was followed by two decades of repeated series of accusations. The documents of the witch trial resulting in the burning in 1746 of Mrs. Gergely Simon, a healer from Kiskunhalas, have not survived—we only learn about this execution in the testimonies assembled for a second trial against Anna Hős in 1747.158 Only the protocols have remained of the witness testimonies from the second trial against Anna Hős, which took place in the neighboring town of Kecskemét, and not Kiskunhalas. The trial did not reach a verdict because, as we find out from later trial testimonies, Anna Hős “died in prison”.159 In the trial we can read a moving account of how the once already sentenced Anna Hős feared being on trial again; she even wanted to move away from Kiskunhalas: “I am surely going away because I don’t want them to torture me and burn me with fire...”160 In the trial of Anna Hős we can read about the reasons leading to the second occasion when she was accused of witchcraft, an unsuccessful healing attempt and the accusations of another healer:
They took the infant to Pataj, to Mrs. Kaffai for healing, Mrs. Kaffai made some incantations, and asked: “Do you have enemies, my daughter?” The witness replied: “Not that I know of.” “Well is that filthy-place-dweller red-blond Anna Hős still alive?” The witness replied: “She is, she is kin to us.” Mrs. Kaffai said: “It is indeed your kin who bewitched the child, for the milk, and he will never recover from it.”161
A few years after the trial and the death of Anna Hős the next accused in 1751 was again a healer woman, Mrs. Gergely Bozsér, née Katalin Csapó, the last one sentenced to be burnt at the stake.162 The witnesses’



HEALERS IN HUNGARIAN WITCH TRIALS 139
testimonies from this trial show that the one and a half decades that had passed since the first witchcraft crisis were enough for the witchcraft accusations to become a kind of routine in Kiskunhalas, and to adapt to the model well-known from all over the country. The accused had asked for wheat, milk or plums (witnesses 2, 3, and 4), and when they denied her these she cursed them, and the accusers considered subsequent illnesses to be the result of her bewitchment. In another conflict she had threatened to bewitch them if they did not call upon her to “heat their bath” (witness 9). The person who ‘diagnosed’ the maleficium is again another healer: in this trial one of the patients (witness 11) went to the healer woman in Vadkert, who ‘conjured’ the witch. Mrs. Bozsér, who had been healing in an atmosphere of accusations and suspicions, recognized the dark clouds gathering over her head, and she wanted to quit her activity as a healer. One of the witnesses said:
...she had asked her to heal her hand, because it was becoming hideous. Mrs. Bozsér said: “I am not healing it, because they will say that if I healed it, I was the one who bewitched it, I will not touch it, unless the town magistrates order me to.”163
Of course it was still impossible to break the vicious circle of the logic behind belief in witchcraft: “it was known” that one could only force a witch to ‘take back’ the bewitchment with threats and violence, which is what they did to Katalin Csapó; and whether the healing was successful or not, it confirmed the accusations. In conclusion it can be said of the healers involved in the Kiskunhalas trials that approximately one third of the accused (five or six out of 15) belonged to this category, and that it was they who received the most severe sentences. At the same time we have also heard of healers who, despite contributing to the accusations, were never themselves accused of witchcraft. For that, other conflicts and different factors would have also been necessary.
ConCLusion—further avenues of researCh
Are these three detailed case studies and the similar previous partial examinations164 sufficient to obtain a valid picture of the hundreds of healers active during the three centuries of Hungarian witch-hunting? How should we classify the few dozen healers we encountered in the



140 G. KLANICZAy
trials of Kolozsvár, Debrecen, Nagybánya (Baia Mare), Sopron, Szeged, Hódmezővásárhely and Kiskunhalas? What did we discover from the historical documents about popular medicine, its tools and related beliefs? First and foremost, we must specify what we mean by healers. Above all we have to distinguish between two groups: the ‘professional’ healers and midwives, who practice healing as a profession, and all those, who know something about the ‘popular’ techniques of healing, and occasionally, on the request of their relatives, neighbors or acquaintances, sometimes in exchange for payment, tried to heal those who turned to them. Although it is difficult to distinguish between the two groups on the basis of the written court records of the testimonies of witnesses, and other sources are rarely at our disposal, I will, nonetheless make an attempt to classify the healers appearing in the three series of trials I examined. We can establish that the formula in Kolozsvár is quite clear: of the seven healers (among them four midwives), everyone belongs to the first, ‘professional’ category. In the eighteenth-century trials of Hódmezővásárhely, however, there is greater confusion: of the 14 accused, possibly considered as healers and midwives, only 10 seem to have had some kind of ‘practice’ in this field; and the ratio in the Kiskunhalas trials is three out of six. Even in the first group we cannot be certain about what the real occupation of each case was, because in an atmosphere of general suspicion many healers were reluctant to heal, because they were afraid of being suspected of being a witch due to the circulus vitiosus in beliefs surrounding witchcraft (if someone can heal, they can bewitch, too; the reason they can heal someone is that they were the ones to bewitch them in the first place...). As we have seen, this ‘catch-22’ situation is well illustrated by the case of Katalin Csapó, who was burnt in Kiskunhalas in 1751.165 We must emphasize that beside the healers accused in the witch trials we can read of many other healers and midwives in witnesses’ testimonies who were not accused of witchcraft. Judit Kis-Halas, in her study of the Nagybánya (Baia Mare) trials, found besides the 18 people accused of running a magical practice there were 38 healers, witch-identifiers, cunning folk, seers and barbers who could identify maleficium, against whom no accusations of witchcraft were made.166 International research (from Alan Macfarlane and David Harley to Owen Davies)167 claims that the activities of the cunning folk and midwives were actually respected, that despite the (above all Protestant) religious propaganda against them, considerable crowds sought their services, and if someone was accused of



HEALERS IN HUNGARIAN WITCH TRIALS 141
witchcraft, there were always other factors in play, a series of other personal conflicts. This can undoubtedly be observed in the case of the healers sued and sentenced in Hungary: in almost every case there were other problems (family disputes, neighborly conflicts, mistrust towards an outsider wandering healer, personal vengeance, etc..)—it is enough to think of the witch trials initiated by György Igyártó,168 or the case of the midwifehealer, Mrs. Kökény, née Anna Nagy, who accused the first judge of Szeged, Dániel Rózsa, and who triggered the persecutions in Szeged.169 yet, apparently for the indicted healers the healing activities and the magical knowledge associated with them meant a grave danger; often this was the most incriminating evidence against them. Robin Briggs wrote—after establishing that in the examined trials from Lorraine a significant percentage of healers was sooner or later subject of witchcraft accusations—that “it is hard to believe that any other identifiable group [among the accused] ran similar risks.”170 The Hungarian data allow a many-sided explanation to this situation. As Robin Briggs already pointed out, besides the ‘elite’ of ecclesiastical demonologists, official witch-hunters and judges, it was most of all the healers who kept witchcraft-beliefs on the agenda. Their diagnoses and therapies were based on the paradigm of maleficium. This paradigm, however, implied that healing and the ability to bewitch stemmed from the same root. This is why it was usually them who directed the suspicion on other healers and midwives; thus eliminating the ‘professional’ competition, but also endangering their own selves. The mutual accusations of healers and midwives and their conflicts victimizing both parties, are well illustrated by the examples above: Prisca Kőmíves, Klára Bóci and Rúsa, the first victims of the witch persecutions in Kolozsvár died because of each other’s accusations171; just like Mrs. Kökény Anna Nagy and the other five midwives burnt with her in Szeged.172 The most detailed picture of the mutual accusations of rival healers in Debrecen is offered by Ildikó Kristóf about the 1693 trial of Mrs. Ignác Villás ‘healer woman’, Mrs. Pál, the midwife Mrs. János Nagy and her daughter, Mrs. János Molnár. She showed the connection between the conflict between healers and the fight for the clientele of a small district (Péterfia Street and Csapó Street); and also that all four trials resulting in the burning of the accused healer needed the accusations of a raging patient, András Szabó, who went from one healer to the other, and who was unsatisfied with all of them.173



142 G. KLANICZAy
We can see how over the years these conflicts in a certain town or village inevitably undercut the position of the healer living and working there. It cannot be a coincidence that the seers and healers who, according to our documents, were not accused of witchcraft were not residents in the named towns and villages, but lived in the distant vicinity of them. This is the case of Seer Ambrus from Rőd, who made witchcraft accusations against several healer women from Kolozsvár.174 It is also the case of Judit Borsos, appearing in the trials of Hódmezővásárhely as the “Woman from Mindszent”, who was asked for a diagnosis by the ‘noble’ István Czeglédy complaining about the bewitchment of his wife, and who accused the (“hairy dog”, fanos kuttya) healer and midwife Mrs. István Vecseri called ‘Masasni’, burnt later in 1730. Judit Borsos is mentioned as a seer in another trial a few years later.175 And the healer woman living in the neighboring Vadkert plays a similar role in the trials of Kiskunhalas.176 If some healers were able to escape trial following the local conflicts with a mere punishment and expulsion, they continued to bear the stamp of witchcraft, and the documents of their previous witchcraft affair, or even their former accusers could appear in their new residence, when a new proceeding was started against them. This can be seen in the cases of Mrs. Kökény, née Anna Nagy, chased from Makó and burnt in Szeged,177 of Kata Kántor, who was forced to leave Borsod county and was later burnt in Hódmezővásárhely,178 and of Panna Hős, chased from Kiskunhalas, who died in prison in Kecskemét.179 In the series of such healers we have to mention Annók Fejér, the “táltos woman” appearing in several counties and towns, who said about herself that “before the Tatars bewitched me, I was a complete táltos, now I am only half táltos”. Over two decades she is mentioned in 17 witch trials. Two of these were against her: she was chased from Debrecen in 1716, “even though she would have deserved death,” and in 1728 she was expelled from Ugocsa county; her healing activities were mentioned by the witnesses of the trials of Szatmár (1718, 1722, 1737), of Bereg (1724), of Ugocsa (1726, 1727, 1732), of Bihar (1731), of Máramaros (1735–1736) and of Szabolcs (1731, 1737).180 The three case studies presented in this essay did not allow me to discuss in detail two further important aspects of the history of healers. One is the ‘archaic type’ of magical specialists: the manifestations of ‘cunning folk’, ‘cunning shepherds’ and ‘táltoses’. The táltoses (mostly táltos women) involved in witch trials, also dealing with healing maleficium,



HEALERS IN HUNGARIAN WITCH TRIALS 143
the majority of whom appeared in Debrecen and the North Eastern counties of Hungary, are missing from the trials of Kolozsvár and of South Eastern Hungary,181 in which other archaic healer characters are also absent, except for one reference related to Anna Hős claiming that she twisted the foot of someone “in the form of a wolf ”—which reflects the distant influence of Hungarian beliefs related to werewolves.182 The other missing aspect is connected to the first: the occasional role of ‘archaic’ popular sorcerer-figures in witch trials shows that the ‘specialist of popular magic’ offered various ‘services’. The táltos, for instance, beside fighting for fertility (vagdalkozás) or ‘treasure seeing’183 also occasionally undertook healing tasks; the midwives, beside completing tasks related to childbirth, were also part-time healers, and were often involved—as was, for example, Klára Bóci184—in love magic. The trials examined in this study provide only little information on this important aspect of how the activity of healing was embedded in a wider array of transactions in the ‘magical market’; this issue was researched in detail by Judit Kis-Halas in relation to the witch trials of Nagybánya.185 In conclusion, I would like to go back to my last question: what did we find out about the techniques, tools and relating beliefs of popular medicine based on these historical documents? Diagnosing maleficium already deserves special attention: it is usually established merely by looking at the patient, by the seer-healer, and the identity of the bewitching witch is often confirmed by the suspicion of the patient or through a divination procedure, by conjuring—for instance, with ‘salt and iron’—the bewitcher, or by molten lead, or by gazing into a mirror.186 The healing procedure itself involves several elements of popular medicine: ‘massage’, ‘fumigation’, ‘baths’, drinking all kinds of potions (occasionally enriched with medicinal herbs and magical ingredients), bandages and compress’. All this, however, was completed with the fight against the bewitching witch, during which the healers complained of putting their own physical integrity at risk.187 Another important verbal tool of popular medicine often recurring in witch trials was the incantation—besides the basic work of Éva Pócs, Emese Ilyefalvi has recently studied this aspect.188 It would be worth mentioning the material evidence, medications, which Péter Tóth G. called “the witches’ legacy”,189 a topic amply explored recently by Edward Bever.190 Finally, it would be important to go through the list of diseases described by the accusers from a medical perspective, that is, the infirmities that were often suspected of supernatural, ‘bewitched’ origins.



144 G. KLANICZAy
This short enumeration already implies that this ‘practical’ aspect of the healing activity could only be properly discussed by a more comprehensive exploitation of the relevant data of Hungarian witch trials in a study of similar length to this one—this task is yet to be completed by further research.

From the trials conducted in Hódmezővásárhely we only know of twenty-seven cases with certainty—on the basis of the testimonies or other information related to the trial—that they refer to residents of Hódmezővásárhely; four are based on the accusations of people from nearby Mindszent, two of Szentes, and one of Csongrád; in 12 cases it has not been possible to determine the exact residence of the accusers and the accused. Thus the trials testify to the witchcraft conflicts in Hódmezővásárhely and its vicinity.

introduCtion
The present study1 describes the magical and medical market of early modern Nagybánya (Baia Mare; a miners’ town in North-East Hungary, present-day Romania) as it appears in the narrative context of witchcraft accusations. In my analysis, based on three periods of time with relatively good source material, I mapped the popular magical specialists operating in the city and its surroundings, and their relations with each other and their clientele. At this point, my goal could not have been to make an extensive comparative analysis of the set of beliefs related to the figures and activities of the popular magical specialists; nonetheless, I do also discuss certain cases of these beliefs and their particular local manifestations. I placed the specialist of popular magic within the society

of Nagybánya at the time, taking into consideration the limitations of my sources, as far as the camera obscura of the trial documents allowed insight into it. In my investigations I do not discuss the history of witchhunt in Nagybánya in detail, but I do point out the momentums that played a role in the development of witchcraft accusations linked to certain magical specialists. The term medical market (or marketplace) started to impose itself in the 1980s as a key term of social-historical research describing the health sector of the period before the formation of the modern state and the medicalization process.2 Those using the traditional approach in medical history, which based itself on the works of contemporary doctors or other educated authors—wrote about early modern medicine as the unity founded upon the strict ternary physician-surgeonapothecary hierarchy. ‘Unofficial’ doctors, including folk healers, healing living saints, itinerant physicians and charlatans fall out of the scope of this system; researchers have barely discussed them, and either only tangentially or not at all. Innovative studies in social and cultural history, on the other hand, saw the healthcare system of early modern societies completely differently; they considered it to be based on plurality, rather than hierarchy, in which the borderlines between the different areas of expertise were still malleable and traversable3; and which operated according to the rules of the market.4 At this market the customers (that is, the patients) could choose according to their needs from the most convenient offers; weighing the sellers’ (that is, the healers’) efficiency, approach, and last but not least, their prices. According to this model, I interpret the individuals who practice magical and/or healing activities in early modern Nagybánya and its surroundings, and their clientele, as components of the local market of magical services. In trying to paint a picture of the particular segment of the market known from witchcraftrelated documents, I look for an answer to the following questions:
1. What services did the different specialists offer and what expectations did the clients have? 2. How did the supply meet the demand, namely, what were the rules in local custom5 concerning the commissioning of a healer or a specialist?6 3. How did they regulate or sanction unsatisfactory services (treatment); namely, what did the patient do if he/she was discontented, and how did the healer or specialist react to it?



DIVINATIO DIABOLICA AND SUPERSTITIOUS MEDICINE ... 161
4. What other spheres of healthcare7 existed in Nagybánya besides the local barbers; was there a town physician, an urban surgeon or other trained medical staff?
Finally, somewhat returning to our starting point, I discuss some of the interactions between the witchcraft accusations and the magical and medical market in Nagybánya. How do these effects and the transformation of the market manifest in the documents of our witchhunt investigation in Nagybánya?

When Willem de Blécourt, in his study published two decades ago, reflected on the results of witchcraft and witch-hunt historiography, he established that the authors, mostly historians, had (almost) exclusively concentrated on witches, while “they considered the cunning folk as having a secondary role; as did the historical works serving as the basis of their research.”8 According to him, one of the reasons for this is the decidedly masculine character of the main thrust of research; namely that historians rather preferred ‘manly’ topics such as the establishment of the modern state, or the consolidation of the justice system, and paid less attention to the micro-level, including the social-cultural analysis of witchcraft accusations.9 Nevertheless, as scholarship on the social and cultural contexts of witchcraft reveals, the views concerning the specialists engaged in healing, soothsaying, treasure hunting, love magic and economic magic and continuously appearing in witchcraft trials, were just as integral to witchcraft beliefs as the witches themselves, and were just as necessary to the functioning of the system of the social institution of witchcraft accusations.10 De Blécourt sees the other reason for the lack of comprehensive works on magical specialists in the particular approach developed by historical anthropology. According to him, the studies meticulously describing the history of witch-hunting within a certain geographical region or community revealed such a great heterogeneity of local cultures that it made any comparative synthesis impossible.11 He acknowledged that one of the most efficient methods to present the operation mechanism of witchcraft accusations was to describe the complex network of relations between the local belief systems and social relations.12 In their pioneering works on the witch-hunt and on the relation of magic and religion in early modern England both Alan



162 J. KIS-HALAS
Macfarlane and Keith Thomas revealed these mechanisms by applying the methods of social anthropology.13 When describing the intellectual and popular registers of magic, Thomas not only considered it important to present the diverse magical methods by listing them; he also tried to highlight the social roles the magical specialist could have played within a certain community, and describe how they provided practical and psychological help to the people to solve the crisis situations of everyday life.14 Alan Macfarlane, who examined witchcraft persecutions in Essex, besides illustrating the ‘bottom-up’ anatomy of the accusations, dedicated an entire chapter to the practitioners of popular magic.15 Almost a decade after de Blécourt’s programmatic article it was Owen Davies who undertook to summarize in an impressive monograph the history of magical specialists in England in the past half millennium.16 In a subchapter on the European ‘relatives’ he briefly reviews mostly Western and Central European analogies; and discusses the particularities of the English specialists of popular magic from a comparative perspective. He makes an important statement that also concerns our research, namely that unlike the cunning folk of England—who not only appear in legal proceedings and church visitation records, but have a legendary past in contemporary literature—their continental consorts are only mentioned in the laconic accounts of the trial documents.17 The activities of the popular magical experts and the study of their role in witchcraft accusations has always been an important topic in Hungarian witchcraft research. As early as 1910, Andor Komáromy highlighted the great number of healers among the accused in the introduction to his source publication.18 From the end of the 1980s, following the activities of the interdisciplinary research group organized by Gábor Klaniczay and Éva Pócs19 new, complex approaches to witchcraft gained ground in Hungary as well. The studies conducted from the perspectives of historical anthropology, history of mentalities and microhistory placed the popular magical specialists in a new light. These analyses20 no longer consider them as uneducated practitioners of contemporary medicine relying solely upon their empirical knowledge, or as provincial, petty epigones of royal and aristocratic magicians and astrologers. In the research dealing with the “sociology of accusations”21 the healers, fortune-tellers and wise men/women of the rural and urban communities were promoted as having been important factors in the social institution of rural witchcraft, because the cunning folk occupied important positions within the relationship system developing according to the series



DIVINATIO DIABOLICA AND SUPERSTITIOUS MEDICINE ... 163
of action of bewitchment-identification-healing. They could appear as the identifiers of the witch’s bewitchment, or—even simultaneously—they could fill the role of the healer who repaired the damage allegedly caused by the witch.22 While revealing the social context of the accusations, it transpired that the acts actually committed were not necessarily identical with the alleged acts mentioned in the accusations.23 Analysing the character of the witch within the belief context of the early modern mediator systems, Éva Pócs highlighted that this structuralfunctionalist view of the witchcraft-model needed correction. The role of the supposed witch and of the identifier or the unwitcher cannot be filled by the same person, since according to the system’s logic, these opposing roles would ‘cancel out’ one another. yet there are many European examples. Based on the study of the Hungarian trials, Éva Pócs came to the conclusion that behind this apparent contradiction there is an independent witch-type, which could be best perceived in the cases of ‘the healer accused of witchcraft’. In the background of this she pointed at the positive, benign aspect of the inherently dual, ambivalent belief-character of the witch.24 Éva Pócs has named this witch-type the healing witch.25 She came to the conclusion that the presence of this type can be linked to the concepts explaining misfortune in the times before the witch-hunts and also to the other related belief systems which continued to coexist with village witchcraft beliefs in early modern villages and market towns.26 Ildikó Kristóf was the first to examine the social and cultural background of a witch-hunt in a Hungarian urban community. Studying the trials of early modern Debrecen and Bihar county she examined two typical groups of the accused: people with deviant behavior, and people practicing magic. Among the factors leading to the formulation of the suspicion and later to the accusation she found that the conflicts with the closer social environment (family, relatives, neighborhood) were of key importance. As regards the wise women and the accused having all kinds of other magical activities she emphasized that their occupation was already surrounded by ambiguity which determined their social perception, and that this ambivalence was shifted towards the negative pole by the hostile attitude of contemporary Protestant demonology.27 Furthermore, she considered it plausible that the unpopularity of the lay magical specialists might have stemmed from the fact that they were trying to fill the role of control in a transforming social milieu, where the former, normative regulatory systems and ideologies explaining misfortune represented by them were beginning to lose their validity.

ProseCutions of nagybánya
My analysis is primarily based on the witchcraft documents of Nagybánya, discovered and published by the senior archivist, Béla Balogh, in 2003.28 The volume presents the documents of 55 witchcraft related legal proceedings from the period between 1636 and 1762. The corpus contains for the most part the protocols of the criminal proceedings, some of the slander proceedings, and also a number of the regularly held patrols29 and general investigations (inquisitio generalis); as well as of the resolutions of the town council issued in this topic. In order to expand the space and time horizon of my research, for certain subtopics I took into consideration the witch trials of Szabolcs, Szatmár, Kraszna, Ugocsa and Máramaros counties, and also the trials of Felsőbánya (Baia Sprie), Máramarossziget (Sighetu Marmației), Szatmárnémeti (Satu Mare), Kolozsvár (Cluj) and Debrecen.30 Since the city archives of Nagybánya were unavailable, I used secondary source publications, as well as historical works discussing original documents.31 The Calvinist college founded in 1547, the Schola Rivulina, played a key role in shaping the intellectual milieu of contemporary Nagybánya.32 Many of the rectors, who often filled the position of the first or second pastor of the city, and of the teachers teaching here, belonged to the Calvinist intellectual elite of the broader region; moreover, some of them were the primary Hungarian advocates of puritanism.33 In the introductory study co-written with Péter Tóth G. for the 2003 source publication, we outline the history of witchcraft prosecutions in Nagybánya.34 The chronology and intensity of the persecutions in Nagybánya follows the dynamics of the seventeenth- and eighteenthcentury witch-hunts in the Kingdom of Hungary, in the territories occupied by the Ottoman Empire and in Transylvania.35 In the case of Nagybánya, the periods of the intensification and relaxation of witchcraft accusations are easiest to interpret with regards to the local history of events.36 During the almost one and a half centuries of witchcraft prosecutions there were only 18 cases in the court of justice of Nagybánya where the accused also had a magical practice. Besides these there were a further seven individuals who were accused of witchcraft in a judicial context and who also had some kind of magical occupation. Furthermore, there were 38 healers, witch identifiers, wise men, seers and barbers also practicing bewitchment identification or healing who were mentioned



DIVINATIO DIABOLICA AND SUPERSTITIOUS MEDICINE ... 165
by the witnesses and the accused, but against whom there were no accusations of witchcraft. Thus, from the period between 1636 and 1762 there were all in all 63 people who provided magical and/or medical services for the inhabitants of Nagybánya and its surroundings; and who probably thus fell under the scope of the local witchcraft prosecutions. Since our present investigation was unable to exploit other contemporary sources, our analysis only reveals the fraction of the local market of medical and magical services as known from the perspective of the history of witchcraft prosecutions.37 Consequently, to say that the service providers of Nagybánya and its narrow surroundings consisted of these 63 people would be misleading. The 63 magical specialists are seen as a coherent group only in this specific constellation, based on their occupational field, on their role in the persecution and on the location of their activities (Nagybánya and its surroundings). We must not forget that their operation documented in the persecution sometimes fell into time intervals distant from one another. We also have to keep in mind that their healing and other activities are known exclusively in the spotlight directed upon them by the witchcraft accusation; any of their other actions are completely unknown. If we want to get a clearer picture of the social relations of the specialists working at the same time, and of their geographical movements, we rather have to pursue our exploration in horizontal directions, as if with the help of a synchronized investigation projected back in time. Therefore, it serves our purpose better if we take the time segments that have a more advantageous source background and a richer documentation, such as, for instance, the periods showing more intensive persecution, or the trials giving voice to a great number of witnesses. In this way we obtain a more credible picture of the social background of the clientele, of the relations connecting the magical specialists to one another and to their clients and patients, while this also allows us to thoroughly acquaint ourselves with the organization of the magical and medical market of Nagybánya. For this purpose, we selected three periods: (1) the decade between 1660 and 1670, which is the first stage of the intensification of trials; (2) the second, intensive period of persecution between 1697 and 1706 and finally (3) the general criminal investigation of 1753 and the following year of 1754, which constituted the last powerful wave of witchcraft prosecutions in Nagybánya. The dates of the witch trials in the three highlighted periods, as well as the number of accused, and especially those of them who had a magical practice, are shown in Table 1.

In Table 2, I summarize from the perspective of the witchcraft accusation all the people performing magical activities figuring in the trial documents of the above mentioned periods. I believe that a sketchy overview of the local events of these three outstanding periods is indispensable for understanding the historical context of our investigation, and more closely the history of the witchcraft prosecutions in Nagybánya. In the description of each period I discuss both the accused magical specialists and all other individuals with a magical occupation who appear in the court documents.
1660–1670
Contrary to the decreasing tendency of witch-hunts due to the Turkish wars, the first intensive phase of the persecution in Nagybánya occurred in the decade of 1660, which coincided with the ‘change of ownership’

of the town during the chaotic period of transition from the Principality of Transylvania to the sovereignty of the Habsburg Empire. We know that during the Ottoman offensive on Transylvania Seidi Ahmed Pasha of Bosnia, who occupied Várad (Oradea), only relinquished the occupation of the city in exchange for a 10,000 Thaler tribute.38 After the Ottoman army coming to conquer Transylvania had retreated, in 1661 Nagybánya was temporarily invaded by Austrian troops. Meanwhile, the attacks of the Kuruc troops moving around the town put its inhabitants in constant danger. In order to ensure the safety of urban life, to economize and to maintain the autonomy of the town, the council handled every disturbance, violation and crime with increasing austerity. The urban community prepared for the counterattack against the enemy’s invading offensive not only by strengthening the town walls and wall towers, but also by starting to drive out the inner enemies who endangered the town’s unity. During the decade of 1660, six trials were initiated with witchcraft accusation and one with witchcraft slander. We also know of other criminal procedures where the charges were thievery, bigamy, fornication and fraud. In the eight trials mentioned there were altogether nine people accused of witchcraft. This period is important regarding our topic for two reasons: (1) we have significantly more sources than from the previous, nearly 25 years; (2) four of the accused were prosecuted for their magical practice, and a further seven healers and specialists providing magical services also figure in the documents. The investigation discussing the actions of the local healer woman, Mrs. Miklós Nagy alias Siket (‘deaf’), testifying to her devilishness (ördöghség)39 was between 1662 and 1665.40 In August 1664 they prosecuted László, a travelling gypsy who enticed the citizens of Nagybánya with treasures hidden in the ground.41 Mrs. István Zilahi, née Ilona Forintverő, convicted in 1668, allegedly sought magical help when she attempted to kill her husband ‘with diabolical deeds, with the assistance of a sorcerer’.42 Finally, in 1670, they charged the widowed Mrs. Gergely Nagy, a healer and midwife presumably from Kolozsvár, as well as her daughter-in-law, Mrs. István Nagy, on suspicion of witchcraft.43 The midwife was sentenced to be burnt at the stake, while the daughter-in-law was banished from Nagybánya. Until the beginning of the 1690s we know of relatively few trials; nevertheless, the case of Mrs. Csóti, a ‘commuting’ wise woman from Szaszar (Săsar) who was burnt in 1684 for her magical practices is absolutely significant regarding our topic, and therefore is included in our investigation.44



168 J. KIS-HALAS
1697–1706
The second period of intensification started at the end of the 1690s and culminated in the monumental trial of 1704, which can be associated with the strengthening of the persecution in the Partium.45 The legal and territorial integrity of the town was endangered by the growing intensity of the imperial centralizing efforts since 1670, and, parallel to this, by the increasingly evident re-Catholicization process, which also had a serious effect on Szatmár county. The Jesuit order established in the city of Szatmár (Satu Mare) in 163646 with the support of the representatives of the Kassa-based Chamber of Szepes,47 thereby ensuring the legitimation of the state, from the 1670s attempted on several occasions to found a mission in Nagybánya. In this effort, from time to time they drove the Calvinist and Lutheran pastors out of Nagybánya and sealed off the churches of their congregations, which resulted in the services being temporarily carried out in private homes.48 The Jesuits, having neither a church, nor a monastery,49 announced their claim in 1674 to town properties which had been in the Church’s possession before the expansion of the Reformation in Nagybánya (1547), including the Omechin Hospital that had belonged to the former Saint Nicholas’s Church, which by then had been attached to the residence of the Lutheran pastor.50 The hospital was established at the beginning of the fifteenth century from the donation of János Omechin, who at his death in 1408 bequeathed his estate in Giródtótfalu the hospital so that it would cover all respective maintenance costs.51 After the Reformation the free royal town of Nagybánya became the new owner of the village and they continued to maintain the hospital: indeed, they might even have paid for the nursing staff. The increasingly aggressive efforts at Counter-Reformation inspired similarly vehement responsive actions from the exclusively Protestant urban and ecclesiastic leadership and from the entire population of the town. On November 2, 1677 the people of Nagybánya, with the help of Pál Wesselényi and his Kuruc soldiers, broke the seals on the ecclesiastic buildings, and chased the Jesuit priests and their supporter, the tricesima officer Márton Prinyi, out of the town. The complete installation of Saint Martin’s Church, temporarily occupied and refurbished with new ecclesiastic accoutrements by the Jesuits, was destroyed, as were the new paintings and altars of Saint Nicholas’s Church and the library of the mission.52 In 1687 it was the Catholic side which prevailed once again: the chamber council sealed off the churches of the Protestant



DIVINATIO DIABOLICA AND SUPERSTITIOUS MEDICINE ... 169
congregations along with the buildings belonging to them and moved the Calvinist college to the suburban Híd street. Meanwhile, the Order of Friars Minor Conventual also presented their claim to Saint Nicholas’s church, the hospital and Giródtótfalu as well, of which they became registered proprietors in 1689 despite the protests of the village notabilities. We have only few local sources on this period related to changes of ownership. This is why the letter found among the documents of the 1704–1705 trial is of exceptional value, for it not only suggests that the new owners had ideas on how to prove suspicion of witchcraft suspicions that differed from earlier ones, but it also clearly establishes that even if the new ruler of the village was the Order of the Friars Minor Conventual, the town still possessed jurisdiction over the settlement. On December 9, 1704 István Angyalosi, the judge of Giródtótfalu, wrote in his answer to the request of the Nagybánya council that Mrs. György Szilágyi, Anna, a healer currently detained in the town, had previously been accused of witchcraft several times, and thus the notabilities of the village decided to put her through a water ordeal several times.53 The guilt of the woman, however, was impossible to prove through this method, because the owners of the village, the Friars Minor prevented the execution of the ordeal each time. Barely 2 weeks after receiving the letter, the council simply sentenced Mrs. Szilágyi, who was handed to the court of justice of the city of Nagybánya, to be burned at the stake.54 We can be certain that this long-lasting religious hostility gradually infiltrated the complete life of the urban community. The truly crucial question of religious affiliation preoccupied public opinion so intensively that the topic of conversion even filtered through to witchcraft accusations. In the previously mentioned trial in progress between 1704 and 1705, for instance, one of the witnesses, István Tordai Kerekes, told that a healer woman would only have given medicine to his sick wife, if he “became a Papist”.55 It is during this same trial that the witch develops into a figure that haunts and endangers the entire Calvinist ecclesia. In a testimony recorded after she was tortured, the previously mentioned healer confessed that she “only went to church to make the Christians fall asleep”.56 Between 1697 and 1706 there were altogether six criminal proceedings in Nagybánya for witchcraft, and one other for witchcraft slander. Furthermore, they carried out general criminal investigations on the town’s estates (1701: Alsóújfalu and Felsőújfalu, Lénárdfalu; 1703: Alsóújfalu, Felsőfernezely, Lénárdfalu), and then also in the



170 J. KIS-HALAS
suburbs, in Híd street (1706). All in all, 56 individuals were accused in front of the town tribunal by witnesses and the accused themselves; and we know that legal action was also taken against 21 of them. Among the 21 accused we found four midwives, one ‘money seer’ who also identified witches, two healers, and two more wise women who occupied themselves in healing, divination and love magic. Many others were accused of witchcraft in front of the court; in the testimonies of the witnesses as well as in the benignum examen and the torture interrogation of the accused; we have no knowledge, however, of official proceedings resulting from these accusations. Among them there were two further midwives57 and a healer woman. Finally, without the accusation of witchcraft, the witnesses mentioned two healers, three midwives,58 five wise men/women, three barbers, and one billeted German soldier. The series of trials against magical specialists started in 1697 with the potter boy from Felsőbánya, Marci Milkó, who identified witches with his familiars (namely cats), and who was also tried himself as a ‘money finder’.59 Even though charges were brought against the boastful apprentice he was eventually granted pardon, because after the benevolent interrogation “although reluctantly, and after a long while, he started to name by name”60 the witches in the vicinity. It might have been following his accusations that in 1698 the daughter of the former judge of Giródtótfalu,61 Mrs. István Mészáros Boldizsár, Judit Beregi was captured, and was hanged for the crimes of selling stolen goods and witchcraft.62 Mrs. Boldizsár, who was known as Mrs. Bódi63 in the city, provided her clients not only with stolen leather, felt, linen and Turkish slippers, but also with services such as healing, identifying bewitchment, fortune-telling and love magic. It is possible that it was also Marci Milkó’s accusations that led to the new midwife trial which also affected some of the wealthy burghers; and apparently reflected on conflicts because of a redistribution of the clientele. In 1700 one elderly, self-confessed midwife and healing woman, the widow Mrs. Szaszari, decided to bring before the town council the hostility between herself and a younger midwife, Mrs. János Nagy, Ilona Csiszár.64 The case, however, ended badly for both of them: the quarrelling midwives were banned for perpetuity from the city and its vicinity. There must have been thorough preliminary investigations before the beginning of the almost 10-month long procedure in 1704, which was a unique trial in the history of the town, regarding the great number of both the indicted



DIVINATIO DIABOLICA AND SUPERSTITIOUS MEDICINE ... 171
and the sentenced individuals.65 Following the lengthy questionings and interrogations, seven people were burnt and a further two were exiled. Among the sentenced there were several who had an extended magical practice. The widow Mrs. Szaszari, banned from the town 4 years earlier, but nonetheless practicing in Nagybánya again, was sentenced to be burnt at the stake, as was another midwife from Nagybánya, Mrs. András Pap. Mrs. György Szilágyi, the healer from Giródtótfalu, was burnt at the stake, as was the notorious travelling wise woman from Tomán, ‘old’ Mrs. Szakács, who had numerous clients in Máramaros county and Nagybánya.
1753–1754
We see an unusual growth in the number both of the trials and of the accused after the generalis inquisitio66 carried out in the spring of the year 1753, which included the suburbs, too. For now we can only guess if this procedure fitted into the line of criminal investigations organized at regular intervals; or if there was a special reason in the background such as, for instance, the vampire hysteria of neighboring Kapnikbánya (Cavnic) in the winter of 1752–1753.67 The coincidence is noteworthy: exactly 2 days before the Nagybánya inquisition started (on February 17), in the presence of Kasimir Wallendorfer,68 surgeon of the Imperial and Royal Chamber of Mining and Mint of Nagybánya, and the surgeons of the chambers of Kapnikbánya and Felsőbánya, an official exhumation took place of the corpse of the 26-year-old miner, Johann Jablonovski, who had suddenly died in his prime in Kapnikbánya. The exhumation was ordered so that the medical specialists would be able to establish if the reason behind the death in question and many other recent fatalities was an epidemic or something other. In the surgical certificate issued of the incident the specialists present unanimously established that there were no external signs of violent acts on the body that would suggest a sudden death. The three surgeons noticed, however, that they had not found a drop of blood in the body or in the heart; instead they found a large quantity of water. Finally, they firmly established the cause of death to be bewitchment (Hexenwerk) or blood sucking (Blutsaugung). Based on the medical opinion there were new exhumations in Kapnikbánya on the 20th February: they dug up in the local cemetery the corpses of two women accused of bewitchment and blood sucking. After the three surgeons found the hands and

feet of one of the women, namely Dorothea Pihsin, to be intact, they discovered fresh blood on her shroud, which confirmed the suspicion of bewitchment and blood sucking. The corpse was sentenced to be burnt at the stake in a criminal proceeding, and the sentence was carried out by the executioner the same day. The town guards (Wächter) present at the execution reported of a massive amount of blood flowing out of the burning corpse.69 Among the questions of the investigation in Nagybánya aiming to identify the guilty party there were two which can be linked to the activities of cunning folk.70 The result was that many of the witnesses mentioned in their testimonies Mrs. Horsa from Tőkésbánya, who was apparently frequented by the town-dwellers, especially by women as a healer, fortune-teller and specialist of love magic. Following the investigation the Vlach71 wise woman was brought to trial. First she was banned from the city and its vicinity; then in 1757 on her own request and after issuing her a letter of obligation, she was allowed to return.72 Among the witnesses testifying against Mrs. Horsa was one of the midwives of the town, Mrs. Pál Forrai, née Erzsébet Török who, in 1745, was slandered with witchcraft by Mrs. Jakab Toót, née Erzsébet Kosárkötő.73 The testimonies also give account of a healer woman from Katalinfalu (Cătălina), Mrs. Pál; furthermore, they mention without name a Vlach néző (‘seer’) woman from Lacfalu (Șișești); however, as far as we know, none of them were brought to trial. One year later, in the trial of two suburban Romanian peasant women74 we hear presumably of the same seer woman from Lacfalu; this time the witnesses revealed her name: Popa Nyikorásza. Several asserted that she lived in the attic of one of the accused, Mrs. Mocsirán, in the Felsőbánya suburb (hóstát). In 1753 Istók Balázs from Várad, who called himself a seer, was captured, publicly flogged for fraud and magic, then on account of his physical and mental disability they let him go with a letter of obligation. Of his actual activities as a seer, however, we know nothing, because only the text of his verdict has survived. In terms of popular magical specialists, what are the consequences to be drawn from the interrelatedness of the events of these three periods and the local witch-hunt? It seems to be certain, even though it is only vaguely outlined by our sources, that all three periods of more intensive persecution have multiple links to general, reorganizing, innovative intentions affecting the entire urban society that could be related to various reasons. One of them could be the transformation of power



DIVINATIO DIABOLICA AND SUPERSTITIOUS MEDICINE ... 173
relations within the town at the higher levels; a partial exchange in the rows of the town magistrate, and even the broader local elite; the coercive intentions of the upper levels of the power structure (chamber, county and imperial administration) as manifested in the investigations in Bánát and Máramaros following the vampire hysteria; the heterogeneity, mobility, and then the gradual expansion in the town administration of the growing suburban population in the second half of the seventeenth century; the new confessional constellation frequently transforming under the influence of the Counter-Reformation efforts, and taking up a new shape by the second and third decade of the eighteenth century. In general, we can say that, similar to early modern Debrecen, the different social tensions, the continuous struggle between religious convictions unsettling even the micro-world of the individuals, and the frequent wars, all contributed to the erosion of the urban community of Nagybánya, which was a priori far from being homogenous. Thus the constant dissolution of the local society’s tissue provided a fertile ground for the spawn of witchcraft accusations. The periodic strengthening of the ‘witch-hunting atmosphere’ and the proliferation of the accusations, inevitably caused a surge in the number of the popular magical specialists among the accused; nonetheless, we cannot establish that the accusations targeted them exclusively in any of the periods. Meanwhile, it is also quite clear that the proceedings in front of the court of justice were only the final phase in the settling of the conflict. The quarrelling parties had recourse both to the local customary law and the magical resources of rural witchcraft, should they wish to settle their conflict outside the official fora of the judicial system.75 In any case, the enlightened reform of healthcare, which was meant to put an end, by central will, to the coexistence of legitimate and illegitimate forms of medicine (barbers versus popular healers), was still far away in time, though it existed in germ form. The documents in Nagybánya do not mention any physicians with a university degree, or any certified surgeon (chirurgus), and we only suspect the existence of a midwife employed by the town. It is possible that Mrs. Szaszari, who was exiled in 1700 and executed in 1704, was somehow officially employed by the town. This is what the following excerpt of a witness testimony suggests:
She heard it from Mrs. János Király that Mrs. Szaszari said: – I could heal Mrs. Paczák, but it wouldn’t help the children of the people of Nagybánya, even if my sworn fingers could do it.76



174 J. KIS-HALAS
We can be fairly certain that the Mine Chamber located in Nagybánya had already employed a surgeon before 1753, and that he was responsible for the healthcare of the miners working in the mines owned by the Chamber. Based on our knowledge, however, we have not as yet been able to assess his activities. It is also very likely that due to his official position the treatment of the burghers of Nagybánya was not his primary duty, and thus maybe he was never associated with healing activities related to the witchcraft accusations, unlike the local barbers.77 About one decade after the persecution was ended, in 1773 they appointed Sámuel Rácz, freshly graduated from the Medical University of Vienna, as head physician of the Royal Chamber and of the town. Later he became the founding father of Hungarian medical terminology with his university textbooks written in Hungarian.78 The witch trial documents do not speak of any patient care activities in the previously mentioned hospital. We can only presume that the “old woman from the hospital” testifying in 1670, and who treated a certain Mrs. Deák, possibly worked as a midwife as well.79
the maze of terminoLogy
In our study so far we have identified as popular specialists of magic those individuals whose occupation involved activities belonged to the domain of magic according to contemporary ideas. Among these can be included treasure hunting, finding property or people believed to be lost, identifying thieves, fortune-telling (concerning individual fate or future events), love magic, economic magic (mostly for boosting milk and butter supply), and identifying and remedying bewitchment. Besides all this, or even apart from these fields of operation, the popular specialists of magic could also heal people and (in our cases only rarely) animals. Mapping the terminology appearing in our sources allows us to examine the interpretations of these terms at the time. It helps us to draw a picture of the vocabulary used by the different narrators to describe the activities of those individuals practicing magic, as well as to establish the different meanings they attributed to these words at the time. From the changes in the vocabulary we can deduct how the expressions of witnesses or suspects (the accused) and of the educated notaries recording and editing the testimonies, i.e. producing the legal documents, affected each other in the communication area of the witch trial.



DIVINATIO DIABOLICA AND SUPERSTITIOUS MEDICINE ... 175
If we review the three periods we have chosen, we can establish that the vocabulary used in relation to the individuals practicing magic and that used about their activities seem identical in both the court documents (i.e. the questions used in interrogating witnesses, the texts of verdicts, letters of indictment, petitions, council resolutions) and the testimonies of witnesses, although the latter group of texts is somewhat more diverse. We can draw further conclusions from the independent and comparative study of each period. Since for now the primary aim of this chapter is not to define the exact position of the popular specialists of magic within witchcraft accusations, but rather to present the contemporary vocabulary referring to them, the explicitly witchcraft-related terminology (e.g. witch, bewitchment, and synonyms) is not included. Similarly, I do not discuss the vocabulary of remedies and healing methods in detail here: they will be explained in the following subchapter. It is conspicuous that in all three periods, the vocabulary is the richest regarding the topics of midwifery and healing, which obviously is a consequence of the close links between the witchcraft accusations and these activities. It is also worth noting that the expression midwife (bába) does not occur in the 1670 trial, which was initiated precisely against a midwife, even though the term has already been documented in a slander case from 1640.80 On the contrary, the term old woman (öreg asszony), which was a common early modern synonym for midwife, appears frequently in both types of documents from the year 1670.81 Moreover, we can assume that the ‘old woman’ (öreg asszony) expression was incorporated into the official judicial context from the popular vocabulary; since its only occurrence is in the letter of indictment written on the request of the accuser. In the subsequent period, the term ‘midwife’ (bába) is unequivocal in its prevalence, and in some cases we also find its Latin equivalent, although only in the official register. We have not found any explanation for the reason behind this shift of terminology in our texts. The words healing and curing occur in both groups of texts; while the expressions ‘errancy in healing’ (gyógyításbeli tévelygés)82 and ‘superstitious medicine’ (babonás orvoslás)83 were only used by the court of justice. These variants demonstrate the negative attitude toward the healing activities of the accused, detectable from the first period on. Parallel to this, the conceptual register of witness testimonies also shows a similar polarization of the notions related to healing: the duality of divine (=obeying God’s will, therefore good) and non-divine



176 J. KIS-HALAS
(=going against God’s will, therefore bad) healing as it is marked by the expressions “she healed me after God”, “Heal me in a godly manner!”.84 We can also perceive the concept of the earnest, properly done job by a good specialist, as we can read from the phrasing “she healed righteously”.85 Among the expressions used to describe people with healing activities, besides those mentioned above, we find the expressions orvos (physician), orvos asszony (woman healer), doctor (physician) and gyógyító asszony (healing woman); however, the frequency of the occurrence of these terms does not correlate with the large number of such cases. This is most probably because the known healers and physicians were either mentioned by name (Mrs. Láposi, György Kádas, Mrs. Tebes),86 or referred to by their residence, as in “the physician from Zilah”, or the “midwife from Matolcs”.87 From the vocabulary we can decipher a further duality in the interpretation of healing: the distinction between the supernatural or magical and the secular aspects. This later led to the dichotomy of legitimate and illegitimate healing. The term borbély (barber) rarely appears in our texts. During the first period, in 1670, there was only one witness testimony that mentioned a barber in connection with the treatment of a postpartum breast disease.88 In the subsequent period barbers are mentioned only four times, on two of which this was also the family name of the person (both were also barbers by occupation).89 Compared with the exuberant vocabulary surrounding healing activities, the terminology relating to other domains of popular magic might seem somewhat meagre. The term ‘seeing money’ (pénzt néz) was first documented in 1664, in the expression “making him look for or find money”90 found in the judicial documents. The oft-mentioned money finding and treasure hunting actions frequently appearing in the accounts of the witnesses convince us, however, of the exact opposite: finding lost treasure or money might have been one of the most popular magical activities in this period, exercised by many, and not exclusively by seer specialists.91 The procedures against the treasure hunting travelling gypsy and—a 100 years later—against the ‘Seer’ Istók Balázs reflects the contemporary legal attitude, that seeing money in itself, if it was not an illicit swindle, did not lead to a witchcraft accusation.92 The main profile of the other specialist of the first period with seer abilities and who practiced money finding might have been healing, bringing home absent individuals, and remedying bewitchment. Since treasure hunting was only one of their many services, the witnesses did not even



DIVINATIO DIABOLICA AND SUPERSTITIOUS MEDICINE ... 177
call them seers.93 Similarly, treasure finding was also part of the magical repertoire of the previously mentioned Marci Milkó; however, he owed his reputation to his witch-identifying services. The term seer (néző) reappears in this form in the last period; however, in those two cases we do not discover any further information about the actual occupations of the specialists accused of witchcraft.94 Finally, in all three periods the umbrella term used for specialists of popular magic was ‘cunning folk’ (tudományos), both in the colloquial and the judicial system: it identified a person with supernatural knowledge.95 Following this overview of the terminology relating to people with magical occupations, and to magical activities, we can make two observations.
1. The texts of the judicial documents—presumably in the phrasing of educated individuals—and that of the witness testimonies—in most cases the unofficial narratives of uneducated narrators—have basically an identical vocabulary in this regard. This might stem from the fact that the town notaries making the documents of the procedures were members of the same, small urban community96 as the witnesses and the accused; therefore the language used by the narrators and the people recording their statements was not dissimilar. In the absence of an extensive investigation, for now I can only base my conclusion on a few examples. One of these figures is György Diószegi, a second clerk of local birth and former student of the Schola Rivulina. He contributed as a notary to the recording of the witnesses’ testimonies in the 1670 trial, as well as in a slander trial in 1674. The next example is that of István, brother of the aforementioned György Diószegi, who was the deputy chief justice of the town; he signed the interrogation protocols of the 1670 trial in this capacity. Similar to the Diószegi brothers, several senators and external council members who were either witnesses in witchcraft trials or executed torture interrogations, had local education, i.e., were former students of the Schola Rivulina. 2. The vocabulary is meagre, but it can be considered relatively stable over nearly one and a half centuries. This might show that the expressions associated with healing and magical activities in the given linguistic milieu had already been consolidated for a long time: in most cases the narrators use the well-known and continuously used terms with great confidence.

sPeCiaLists, CLients and sCoPes of aCtivities
In this subchapter, I would like to discuss three of the topics outlined in the introduction. (1) What social tasks did the popular specialists of magic and of healing perform in Nagybánya and its surroundings? (2) How did the demand side (clients/patients) and the supply or serviceproviding side meet: how was the magical or healthcare ‘service providing contract’ made? (3) What options and methods did the ‘service provider specialist’ and the client have to settle their conflicts; i.e. what happened if the contract was broken?
Diseases, Infirmities, Miseries
The narrators quoted in the trial documents could have expressed the entire spectrum of physical or mental disorders with any of these three terms. This, nonetheless, does not mean that the people of early modern Nagybánya and its surroundings imagined different disorders as parts of a homogeneous, undefined cluster and did not give specific names to these conditions. Even though in the files of the witch trials the witnesses and the accused mostly discuss the physical and mental symptoms related to bewitchment, it is worth reviewing the names of the different diseases,

DIVINATIO DIABOLICA AND SUPERSTITIOUS MEDICINE ... 179
as well as the most common syndromes. In the vast majority of cases (102 out of 131) the narrators use one of the general expressions in the subtitle of the chapter to refer to the changes in health. In the remaining 29 cases, however, they use more specific denotations. I have assembled these in Table 3, indicating the frequency of their occurrence per period. Although we cannot draw far-reaching conclusions based on this list, it is still conspicuous that the vast majority of these conditions manifested with suddenly appearing, very noticeable skin symptoms (cf. pox/variola, erysipelas, plague, anthrax), or as some kind of a prominent skin lesion (boil, pimple, goiter, syphilis/scurvy) or acute injury (lesion). We can observe very similar tendencies if we examine the narratives conveying the experiences of the patients and their relatives from the perspective of the body part affected by the disease. The symptoms appear mostly on the hands and feet (24 times of the 67 occurrences), and usually very suddenly and rather noticeably. The narrators described the symptoms with a variety of expressions: for instance, the body part in question got swollen, had papular eruptions, broke out in blisters (felcsattog), burst open, got paralyzed (felzsugorodik), dried out, turned blue or deep purple. Sometimes the accounts talk about a suddenly occurring, sharp pain: “the other day I was massaging a woman, and suddenly a pain struck my hand”.97 In the cases related to childbirth, puerperium and the diseases of the newborn the most common complaint is the drying up of the mother’s breast milk (in 9 cases out of 67), which is sometimes accompanied by the painful swelling and bursting open of the breast of the mother. I have assembled the vocabulary relating to the therapeutic methods of midwives, healers and barbers in Table 4. As yet I do not have at my disposal sufficient knowledge to place the above mentioned remedies within the considerably larger context of early modern medicine, and neither was the goal of my study to do so. Instead, I would like to highlight a few specific tendencies. In the texts of the testimonies the witnesses sometimes talk about using some kind of herbs when bandaging or compressing. In the sparse data we have, they mention betony (seblapu) for bandaging swollen feet.98 In another case, they prepare a lye from the ashes of a certain “thorny weed”.99 It seems to be a general tendency that the narrators only seldom name the specific plants. It is the same situation with the baths prepared with herbal admixtures.100 The reason for this might have been that in the eyes of the tribunal using herbs for healing was sufficient cause to



180 J. KIS-HALAS
qualify the healing activity of the accused as “superstitious healing”.101 The people leading the witness interrogations apparently did not care to know precisely what any plant was, and therefore the witnesses did not attribute too much importance to the issue either. The narrator associated various beliefs with the use of medicinal herbs: for instance, when the plant leans away from the person wanting to pluck it, or calls out if an unauthorized person tries to touch it.102 It also occurred sometimes that, in order to save their reputation, an unsuccessful healer recommended a special plant only growing in distant, unattainable places that was very hard to acquire:
Once a righteous woman gave my wife a piece of a root to pestle in fat and smear it on the foot of our child. I swear to God, she said, that the child would get back on his feet! My wife mashed it, and smeared it on the child’s foot, and on the third day the child walked up to me. And my wife said, “We should tell Mrs. István Nagy, because who knows, otherwise she might be angry or do something else about it!” So we invited Mrs. István Nagy, and showed her the child, and the root as well. She looked at the root, and asked with a frown, “Where did you get this?” My wife told

her, “A righteous woman gave it to me.” Mrs. István Nagy replied, “Oh, ma’am, it grows far, far away, up in the hills!” So my wife asked her, “So let’s go, dear Mrs. István Nagy, and get some more!” Mrs. István Nagy replied, “How could we go, God knows one can only get there through great troubles, by shedding tears, on bended knees, so that the weed won’t notice!”103
The medical domains pertaining to the competence of midwives, like pregnancy, childbirth, mother and infant care, treating gynaecological diseases and barrenness played an accentuated role within the context of witchcraft accusations. This fact is confirmed by the great number of narratives relating to the care of mothers after childbirth. The childbirth itself, and the midwife’s role in it were only discussed if the death of the infant or the mother was associated with bewitchment; as in the case of Gáspár Szabó:
[...] my first wife was treated by the midwife Mrs. András Pap, and she treated her really badly. She bandaged her on the second day, her condition then got worse, and then she died overnight, around 11 o’clock. In the morning Mrs. András Pap came and put the infant on the dead mother, twice. The next day the infant died, too. After that I didn’t pay for this evil midwifery. Mrs. András Pap said to me, “I was good to you, and yet you are angry at me!” 104
Referring to the help provided during childbirth one of the midwives, Mrs. Pál Forrai, née Ersók Török used a unique expression, “infant catching”.105 Another important post-natal task of the midwife was to tend the mother and the infant for one or two weeks. She “smeared” (megkeneget, felkeneget) the mother, i.e. massaged and bandaged her, while she bathed and bandaged the infant as well. Swaddling was among the tasks of the midwife during the period after childbirth, as was changing the infant’s swaddling bands. In one of the trials against midwives Mrs. János Nagy, née Ilona Csiszár was condemned by her wealthy patients, the Házi family, for her negligence in infant care:
I know for certain that Mrs. János Nagy intentionally missed two of the infant’s morning baths; about two hours later the witness’s sister picked up the infant, and a number of maggots fell out of the baby’s clothes, moreover, there were innumerable maggots stuck in the infant’s behind covering it and blood was dripping from the infant’s body as they swept



182 J. KIS-HALAS
off the maggots; maggots were even coming out from the baby’s genitals! They putrefied the infant’s hands and feet, and scarred its back [...]106
Although it only occurs rarely in our documents, the witness accounts also reveal that the midwife gave advice in case of, or provided treatment for gynaecological complaints. In the majority of cases the patient and his/her family looked on the barber’s treatment as the final and undoubtedly successful solution; contrary to the lengthy and for the most part unsuccessful attempts of folk healers. Barbers were considered masters in their profession in Nagybánya as elsewhere who, licensed by the local authorities, exercised their activities according to the respective guild regulations. Their knowledge was regarded both by themselves and their patients as a profession gained from education. Accordingly, it was verifiable, legitimate, and in no regards relating to the supernatural. Thus, it was never associated with supernatural causes, for example with symptoms of bewitchment; on the contrary, in many cases they rejected such interpretations. Nevertheless, the secular medical competence of the barbers did somewhat overlap with the universe of the supernatural, as they were also thought of to be able to diagnose diseases of supernatural origin, and therefore to identify bewitchment.
Divination, Treasure Seeing, Bewitchment
Numerous healers, midwives and seers provided other services besides treating diseases. The money finders not only sought out hidden treasures; they also informed their clients of the whereabouts of stolen money or other valuable objects if that was their wish. Not only could they identify a thief: they could force that fleeing thief to return. They used similar methods to report on people who were absent or in an unknown location (craftsman on market trips, students studying in distant collegiums, husbands who were absent for too long) and they tried to apply magical methods to make them return home. Regarding the field of divination, the witness testimonies discuss in detail only the extreme cases; for example, when Mrs. Szakács predicted the outcome of one of Mihály Teleki’s affairs with the help of a complicated and confusing procedure:



DIVINATIO DIABOLICA AND SUPERSTITIOUS MEDICINE ... 183
I know, I saw it once, long ago, when the old Mihály Teleki went to Ungvár, where Mrs. Szakács, with a woman from Tótfalu, sent a child with two pots to go to the well, and they ordered him to bring back one of the pots filled with water, and the other empty, from which they would try to tell lord Mihály Teleki’s fortune or misfortune. As they replied to my question, they said the full pot represented good fortune and the empty pot meant misfortune.107
Mrs. Szakács also attempted to make political prognostics, as this was at the time of the Rákóczi war of independence, and Nagybánya was held by Kuruc soldiers.108 The witnesses also discuss her forecast, and a few years earlier that of Márton Milkó regarding the well-being of the community, or more precisely concerning the subsequent year’s crops. In this regard, these specialists resemble greatly the type of táltos who protected the community and its wealth, as described by Éva Pócs on the basis of the witch trials in the market towns of the Great Hungarian Plain.109 On the other hand, they fit very well in line with the peasant prophets who show up in the courts of the Transylvanian princes and around the

Kuruc movements in the seventeenth century.110 The prognostics probably served the purpose of portraying their skills and their qualities as specialists in a favorable light or, in modern terms, becoming competitive; in a way similar to that of certain táltos.111 I have assembled their divination methods in the table below (Table 5). In crisis situations such as the case of marriage-related problems or dubious legal affairs, the people of Nagybánya turned to the popular specialists of magic, and especially to women. Mrs. János Nagy, née Ilona Csiszár for instance gave the following advice to a young husband who wanted to tame his reluctant wife:
[...] she taught the lad: he can do something to his wife on the first night, he just has to do it; he can copulate with her, or even beat her, and he did indeed six times that night. After that, the wife hated him very much, and she hasn’t been with him ever since; what’s more, on that night, when she left his side, he dragged her around by her hair.112
They gave advice to their clients concerning other areas of marital life; for example, they proposed efficient methods to keep a drunken or aggressive husband in check. Besides solving relationship problems, they also provided means for their clients from the tool set of love magic when it came to partner selection. Here we can mention a few cases where widowed women tried to find new husbands, or of landladies who desired the students they accommodated in the outskirts of the city. They provided help for wives with unfaithful husbands, worrying parents or men who got tired of their lovers in case they wanted to end a relationship clearly maintained through magical means with an unwanted individual; as in the case of János Némethi Mészáros:
I know that at my daughter’s wedding, Mrs. Szakács cut a chicken egg in half and sprinkled it with something from a piece of paper and gave it to my son to eat, and she ate the other half. My son said: “What terrible food!” And Mrs. Szakács replied: “Don’t think about it, just eat it!” Since then my son has been very ill, and has only wanted to go to her. Whenever he left, she was the one who brought him back. We took him to several sorcerers and witches, and they said: “We would heal him, but Mrs. Szakács wouldn’t let us!”113



DIVINATIO DIABOLICA AND SUPERSTITIOUS MEDICINE ... 185
Few, however, sought their help specifically because they were considered specialists in bewitchment. Mrs. Csóti from Szaszar, when she offered her services to a servant maid wanting to avenge an enemy, described in detail the witchcraft she also used for her own purposes:
[...] She takes the intestines of a toad, dries them and then grinds them in a pestle with pepper. As the toad inflates, so will the man inflate with it. She mixes mandrake, henbane, thorn apple114 with wild ginger115 root. She dries and pestles the thorn apple as well. She crushes it, so that people will wonder at him/her [i.e. the person who takes it].116 She pulverises henbane, with its roots and fruits, in the pestle, so that the person who swallows it becomes as crazed true to the name of the plant,117 causing him to go around the market like a lunatic. She digs up the root of the mandrake so that the person who swallows it is unable to sleep; and even if he does sleep at night, so that it doesn’t last more than a half an hour; and if he doesn’t, so that he suffers in this world. She dries the leaves and then grinds them together with the other ingredients, like the toad.118
The procedures with the intention of manipulating the tribunal formed a separate group within these practices. The tribunal attributed a great importance to these, because obviously they considered it to be interfering with the jurisdiction of divine and human authority as represented by themselves.119 The witnesses, therefore, were questioned thoroughly about the details of the procedures, thanks to which we have found a relatively large number of cases (nine altogether), mostly in the trials of the second period. These magical methods operate exclusively with soil brought from the cemetery. We cite a prime example from Mrs. Szakács’s practice, which also includes a typical malediction formula:
I heard it clearly from the mouth of Mrs. Szakács as she said, “If someone is on trial, they should take some earth from the grave of a dead man, and scatter it where the council [members] pass, so that they step on it, and one should say, ‘Let the judges be as mute as the dead man whose grave I took this earth from, and let them judge me, and I’ll be free’. She also said that when she freed her son, she poured the earth into the judges’ beds and mixed it with their food.”120
Finally, we have to mention the competencies related especially to the self-defence against demonic and supernatural forces, and to regulating the relation to these forces. One witness talks about how the wise



186 J. KIS-HALAS
woman from Tomán, Mrs. Szakács, warned the careless people of Nagybánya how to properly behave with ‘fair women’ (szépasszonyok)121: “She heard that Mrs. Szakács had taught others not to pour the (face-) washing water in the wood-chopping area, and not to urinate under the drip because it annoys the fair women.”122 The next example is related to the poltergeist known from the 17041705 trial. The incident took place in the house of Senator Suhó,123 who played an important role in the trial. One night the young Mrs. Suhó offered wine to the midwife Mrs. András Pap, who had come to borrow some lentils. She only realized she had forgotten about her offer when the midwife had already left, and she discovered two bumble bees flying around the candle light. Soon invisible hands were flinging a glass at the young woman, who saw in astonishment that the glass was still wet, and thus concluded that it must have been recently used.124 The notorious ‘flinging’ incident raised the suspicions of the court, the result being that they investigated the case with extra thoroughness and interrogated many people about the incident.125 One of the witnesses remembered that it was in fact Mrs. András Pap, the midwife, who had suggested toasting Saint John (János-pohár) in order to bring the haunting to an end126:
If two men named John went to their house, sat down at the table, and they put four candles on the table, and then with a cup of wine in each of their hands they greeted each other saying: God bless you John! – God bless you, too, John! – Are you afraid, John? – I’m not afraid, John! Then let’s drink! And all they had to do was to drink for the whole thing to stop.127
Bewitchment and Identification of Witches
Our data show that identifying witchcraft was part of the practice of almost every magical specialist.128 Although the local supply of experts seemed to be sufficient in most of the cases, the people from Nagybánya occasionally consulted well-known witch-finders. For instance Annók Fejér, a healer who lived some 30 miles away, and carried on a more than 20 year long practice of witch-finding.129 Healers usually applied some identifying procedure if the patient’s surfacing suspicion of bewitchment needed orientation. A typical example of this is the incident



DIVINATIO DIABOLICA AND SUPERSTITIOUS MEDICINE ... 187
which launched an open conflict between two midwives, Mrs. Szaszari and Mrs. János Nagy, and it served as the starting point for the witness interrogations. The clerk Lőrinc and his wife suspected that the leg of their pregnant daughter (Mrs. András Debreceni) would not heal because she had been bewitched. One of the midwives, Mrs. János Nagy, suggested to the clerk that he “put a nail in the bottom of the chair, and if Mrs. Szaszari won’t sit on it, you’ll know it was her doing”. Her efforts to prove that Mrs. Szaszari was the witch were, however, in vain, as Mrs. András Debreceni chose Mrs. Szaszari instead of her. The witness accounts also tell us that most of the identifying methods suggested by the specialists were not different from the magical methods of the ‘non-professionals’. We can divide these into two large groups: (1) they forced the witch to present himself/herself at the scene of the bewitchment, either by the method of calling for a salt ordeal, or by damaging something belonging to the alleged witch, because through the logic of sympathetic magic they believed that the bewitcher felt the insult in his/her body; (2) they wounded the animal thought to be the alter-ego of the witch (in our cases exclusively cats), so that they could unmistakably identify the bewitcher, who appeared to have a similar injury on his/her human body.130 Let us look at a typical example for these types:
He had heard it from Mrs. János Toot, who was told by the daughter-inlaw of Mrs. András Kovács that she was crippled by someone in the shape of Mrs. Szaszari, and she said, “Come here, you whore, I’ll give you some salt to lick!” And she went there in the morning and she was chewing on a piece of salt by the stove. And she asked her, “Why are you chewing salt this early in the morning?” Mrs. Szaszari replied, “I have to do so every morning, otherwise my stomach would burn all day if I didn’t chew”.131
He heard from Mrs. István órás that Mr. Czeglédi had told her the following: he slept beside his child at night with his hands on him. In the shape of Mrs. András Pap [the witches] wanted to carry away the child, but he woke up. Then he started to beat the sleeping place of the child on the floor. He also found a piece of red cloth there and he punched it even harder on the floor. The day after, Mrs. András Pap came to their house, and she was crawling on the floor. And she was suffering, and when she was called to attend a woman in labour, her daughter found her on the floor, she had to be taken from there.132

Thoughts About Illness
In the texts of the proceedings reviewed so far we could read what symptoms and illnesses one used to attribute to the witch’s mischief. In the witch trials of Nagybánya we can discover two opposing, religiousmagical disease interpretations, where the physical/mental misery is inflicted on someone either by the will of the Christian God,134 or is the result of human malevolence. From the two arguments the former, which obviously developed under the influence of Protestant demonology, is the more recent. In his earlier analyses Stuart Clark pointed out that Protestantism—and especially the Calvinist conviction—strongly condemned the materialist (profane?) explanations of misfortune prevailing thus far, of which witchcraft was a prominent one. This was because the malevolent acts of witches became manifest in the physical, material, sensible aspects of the world, either in the form of an illness, or as property-related or other financial damage. In providing help as ‘counter-witches’, the magical specialists applied similarly palpable, material methods in order to repair the damage. According to the new, Calvinist enthusiasm based on the Law of Moses135 this logic was no longer applicable: people were not to look for a malevolent human agent behind the crimes of witches, against whom they could retaliate in an ‘eye for an eye’ manner. Because if someone did so, by mingling with fortune-tellers or seers (i.e. the allies of the Devil) from a desire to acquire divine knowledge, these people were proven to be guilty themselves since they did not have faith in Divine Providence and wanted to discover God’s intention through their own efforts. According to Calvinist demonology the witches were in fact serving Divine Will as pathetic, deluded allies of the subordinate Devil, ordered by God to attack sinners who had run astray from the flock of true Christians in order to urge them to examine themselves and return to the true path. Those people who not only identified the bewitchment, but also tried to handle it in a ‘human manner’, were in fact acting contrary to God’s purpose; and thus doing favor to the Devil. The intellectual process, which “spiritualized the experiences associated with witchcraft”,136



DIVINATIO DIABOLICA AND SUPERSTITIOUS MEDICINE ... 189
and at the same time diabolized the practitioners of benevolent magic, started in the second half of the sixteenth century; and by the first third of the seventeenth century had demonstrably reached the Calvinist community of Nagybánya.137 The texts of the proceedings suggest that the two types of explanation of misfortune (human malevolence versus divine intention) were coexisting in parallel. In the trials of Nagybánya we can consider the merging in witness testimonies of the Devil and the character of the allied witch as the incursion of the ‘Calvinist model’ (i.e. the idea of a witch who acts as the Devil’s agent). With the term ‘Devil’ occurring every now and then in the testimonies, the witnesses usually refer to the bewitching witch.138 Let us look at an example, when the alleged witch demonstrates how she torments her victims during the night:
Once the women were talking while shopping and they asked each other, and the witness said, “How does the devil shake a person’s head?” Hearing this, Mrs. Szaszari shook the witness’s head, so that she was dizzy all day. Then they asked, “And how does he grab someone so that it leaves a blue mark under his fingers?” And Mrs. Szaszari showed how with her own hands, she said, “Like this”; and squeezed the hand of one of the women twice.139
Patients, CLients and the suPPLy seLeCtion of sPeCiaLists
If we want to know more about how the market of magical and health services operates, our sources appear to be quite laconic. Nevertheless, in what follows I will try to summarize the road map of how demand and supply met. In the witch trials the description of how the healer and the patient found each other was almost a mandatory element of the witness accounts, since the narrators considered it to be essential. In one part of the cases they called the healer, or sent someone to call the healer to the patient’s home. The people of higher social status sent a servant or a maid, but it might sometimes have been the neighbor or the lodger of the incapacitated ailing patient who carried the message. This, for instance, is what Mrs. András Szabó did: “Since my child was very infirm, I called for Mrs. Gergely Nagy and asked her to heal him.”140 Sometimes, however, it was the patient who went to see the healer with the complaint.



190 J. KIS-HALAS
I know and I saw with my eyes that they brought all kinds of sick people, from here and there, to Mrs. Szilágyi to heal them, and she did treat them, although we don’t know if for the better or for the worse.141
If the healer did not live in the city, but was often on the road, like Mrs. Csóti, it might happen that the patient was brought to her when she was visiting one of her patients in the city for some other reason:
When her grandchild was sick, they hoped that Mrs. Csóti would help them if she could. Once Mrs. Szőke said, “Come here, because Mrs. Csóti is still here!” I took the child and brought him there.142
The treatment usually took place in the home of the patient: we find, nonetheless, cases when the patient was temporarily accommodated at the healer’s home.143 It could also happen that someone carried the sick person to the healer, who performed the treatment there and then:
When I was a maid at my master András Szilágyi’s, his infant fell very ill, and my mistress told me to bring the child to Mrs. Gergely Nagy. She gave me a piece of bacon, and I took the child. Mrs. Gergely Nagy made several incantations, but I don’t know what she said, I couldn’t hear, she was whispering. After the incantations, she licked the infant, and then spat beside me, from both sides. Then she licked the child for the third time, and then spat saliva in my eyes. I took the infant home, and the child recovered. But three days later I fell so ill that they thought I would die; I used to be a pretty rosy-cheeked girl, but since then I have never been healthy.144
We have no certain knowledge on how the agreement between the patient and the healer was made; but at this point they presumably agreed upon the price of the treatment, regardless of the result of the cure. This is what follows from the few witness testimonies according to which the healer stipulated the price of the treatment, almost imperatively, to the future patient:
The servant boy of Szoboszlai was also at my house, trying to buy a treatment. She examined his leg, and then [...] the boy got worse, to whom she said, “If you want to be healed give me some brandy and this and that. Have a poltura (coin)145 worth of brandy for me each day.”146



DIVINATIO DIABOLICA AND SUPERSTITIOUS MEDICINE ... 191
In the majority of the cases the healer’s fee was paid in money; but it could also be a remuneration in kind, like food (sausage, bacon) or clothes (cambric, sandals). Based on the narratives, we can also presume that the healer’s fee was paid after the treatment ended. So far we have been trying to reconstruct the system of relationships between healers and patients that hadn’t been transformed by witchcraft accusations. Our narratives, however, mostly reveal the cases where this relationship underwent a transformation. It would go far beyond the framework of our study if we discussed in detail the conflicts between healer and patient as captured in the witness testimonies. I would only underline two aspects, both relevant to our argument.
1. The narrators occasionally talk about the healer refusing to provide treatment, or to use contemporary expressions: the healer did not accept or take the patient. This evidently could happen for several reasons, but in our cases the reason behind these decisions was most probably the fear of a witchcraft accusation. Some healers did not undertake the treatment because they feared that eventual success would confirm an unknown suspicion of witchcraft against them. We also find the opposite of this, when healers treat patients despite being aware that they would be accused of witchcraft for it. This version is well demonstrated by the story below:
About four years earlier the witness’s wife had had a quarrel with Mrs. Szaszari (who was her neighbor in Nagybánya) over a chicken; the same day her bosom got swollen, with maybe a hundred holes in it. Then the swelling spread under her shoulder blades. “That’s when I called for Mrs. Szaszari”. The wife also went to see her, hoping that Mrs. Szaszari would talk to her. But at first she didn’t even look at her; so they kept calling on her, and went to her until one day she made a suggestion: “Find in the waste a torn stocking and some bones and make a bandage with it!” They did so, and then Mrs. Szaszari examined her herself and said, “Since you say that this is my deed, all right, I will massage her, if you desire: if it’s my deed, she shall recover!” And she did recover!147
2. Similar to the previous phenomenon, we can find in certain cases the influence of the witchcraft accusations, when the healer’s methods and procedures are not only questioned by the patient or the patient’s relatives, but are rejected out of hand, because they



192 J. KIS-HALAS
consider it to be suspicious, and so they unilaterally terminate the agreement. Let us look at two examples from the practice of Mrs. Gergely Nagy. When she treated Mrs. István Mihály for a disease of the mádra (womb) the following happened:
[She said:] “If I wanted to, I’d put butter on a plate, which will summon your womb, it would eat the butter, and I would send it back to its place.” She told me this three times during the three days she came to heal me. I got scared, my husband paid her, and we let her go.148
Mrs. Mihály does not mention how the experienced midwife reacted to this obviously unexpected decision; and the further consequences of this case are also unknown to us. Unlike the other story, narrated by Mrs. István Szentgyörgyi Csizmadia, another mother after childbirth narrated:
The said Mrs. Gergely Nagy was treating my breasts; she rubbed me with tortoiseshell, about which she said, “See, my child, this has been baptized twice, blessed twice. The person I touch with this shell will never burst; that’s how blessed this shell is! My daughter-in-law has one, too, but it hasn’t been baptized yet.” After that my husband ordered me strictly not to invite the old woman over again; since we did not dare to be treated by her, he sent me to a barber; but the woman from Dobravica149 bandaged me as well. And she said about her that she was the one who made me sick, Mrs. Gergely Nagy, because she was angry at me for seeking the barber’s treatment.150
Since we have no basis of comparison, we cannot judge how unusual this therapy seemed among the women of Nagybánya and their families.151 From the narrative above we can sense that it did not upset the mother as much as it outraged the husband. This story demonstrated well that the craftsmen of Nagybánya felt competent to make decisions concerning the health of their wives and the entire household: István Szatmári Csizmadia not only sent the former midwife away, but also arranged for the new medical personnel himself. It is very likely that at the time of the recording of these testimonies, the witnesses projected on the past events the reputation of Mrs. Gergely Nagy as a witch, which was by then widespread.

Case studies
Although the primary aim of this study is to outline the market of magical and healthcare services of Nagybánya, the case studies below help to provide a closer look at how the witchcraft accusations have transformed the former set of relations within this market. Nevertheless, we have to be aware that we can only create a retrospective image on conditions prior to the apparition of the witchcraft trials, due to the distorting light of the accusations. With the help of individual cases, however, we might be able to see the movement and the activities of the popular specialists of magic within the playground of the complex healing and magical affairs in Nagybánya.
Family Dispute and Competing Healers: Mrs. Gergely Nagy and Mrs. István Nagy (1670)
We have access to several narratives related to the initial conflict that led to witchcraft accusations. They all agree that the conflict started with the hostilities between the parents of a sick child, Mihály Rácz and his household, Mrs. and Gergely Nagy, the midwife treating the child and earlier also the mother after the childbirth. In the indictment letter Mihály Rácz states that Mrs. Gergely Nagy had treated his wife after childbirth. They had a disagreement, however, concerning the payment: according to Mihály Rácz, his wife was not sure how much she had to pay the woman for ‘bandaging’ her, and she might have underestimated the value of her services. According to the Rácz family, Mrs. Gergely Nagy was so offended by this that she would not come to heal their sick infant. In this tight situation they called the daughter-inlaw of the elderly midwife, Mrs. István Nagy, to treat the infant, born most probably with a dislocated hip; but she failed completely. She undertook to heal the baby, but – blaming her failure on the bewitchers who had already agreed upon the patient’s fate among one anothershe eventually abandoned the treatment. Mihály Rácz and his family interpreted the infant’s diseases as the obvious result of Mrs. Gergely Nagy’s vengeance, that is, bewitchment. After this, they tried once again to call Mrs. Gergely Nagy, but she refused to treat the infant on several counts; the helpless Mihály Rácz turned to the official platform of the town court of justice. Mrs. Gergely Nagy was in a trap: if she accepted the second invitation of the Rácz family, she would confirm the suspicion



194 J. KIS-HALAS
of bewitchment, which was planted in the hopeless parents’ heads by her concurrent rival who happened to be her own daughter-in-law. It was also common belief in Nagybánya that bewitchment could be fully remedied only by the bewitcher. With successful treatment the alleged witch would only be ‘identifying’ herself, and thus unwillingly exposing herself in the eyes of those who suspected her. Meanwhile, if she did not ‘take on’ these cases, she would be risking her own livelihood. Not only did this entail missing income, but also harmed her reputation based on successful healings, which could lead to the loss of further patients. Mrs. Gergely Nagy rather took the odium of being accused of heartless indifference, risked her good reputation as a healer and midwife and resisted. Nonetheless, Mrs. István Nagy had already begun to spread the word, especially among her own patients, their relatives and neighbors, that her mother-in-law envied her healing talent, and she had repeatedly stood in the way of recovery out of vengeance. Moreover, she made the direct accusation that her mother-in-law had even attacked her solely to prevent her good intentions to heal. She had paralyzed her main working tool: her massaging, bandaging hands. We cite Gáspár Varga:
Her daughter-in-law also talked about the mother-in-law, saying that when the mother-in-law was treating Mihály Asztalos, she also went to their house in secret; no one knew, except Mihály Asztalos and his wife. She also bandaged him after the mother-in-law; and once the mother-in-law said to her: “I do mind that there are two doctors at one house, and you’ll regret it!” That night her hand got so crippled that she couldn’t even sleep because of it. She said to the mother-in-law: “Oh, what has happened to my hand; go on, undo it!” And the mother-in-law finally grabbed her hand, blew on it; and by morning her hand was healed.152
I believe that these texts about the quarrel of the two healers reveal well the change of the attitudes related to healing, and especially to folk healers. It is undeniable that the patients were an important source of income for the healers, sometimes providing their entire livelihood. In Nagybánya, however, it is only in the case of Mrs. Gergely Nagy that we can suspect that she exclusively earned her living as a midwife, at least in the period of the few years mentioned in the witness testimonies. (The testimonies do not even confirm that she actually moved to Nagybánya from Kolozsvár, as some witnesses asserted.) On the other hand, we



DIVINATIO DIABOLICA AND SUPERSTITIOUS MEDICINE ... 195
know that Mrs. István Nagy’s husband did cartage, which actually led to a conflict ending in a witchcraft accusation. It was probably she who wanted to stabilize their financial background by working as a healer. Interestingly, the division of labour and the shared family ‘business’ worked out well in the beginning: midwifery was the responsibility of Mrs. Gergely Nagy, while Mrs. István Nagy did the healing. Mrs. István Nagy’s legitimacy as a healer was both intentionally and unintentionally established by Mrs. Gergely Nagy: on the one hand, she recommended her daughter-in-law as “a good masseuse”, while on the other hand it was believed in the city that Mrs. István Nagy had learned her healing skills from Mrs. Gergely Nagy.
... I’d have preferred it if it had been your mother-in-law who healed me, because she has greater knowledge; “you have learned from her, too, as I heard.” She replied he didn’t learn; it was the mother-in-law who learned from her; she had her knowledge from the mother of her first husband.153
We cannot tell exactly where and why the first fracture in the relationship between the mother-in-law and the daughter-in-law (the midwife and the healer) occurred; nonetheless, we would not be wrong to suspect not only the growing ambition and unscrupulousness of Mrs. István Nagy, but also her abject failure as a healer, to lie in the background of events. The cases related to her healings are mostly about reasons why she could/would not undertake to treat the patient. Or about the bewitchers (devils) who would harm her because of the healing, as in the case of Mrs. Dániel Váczi:
Once my son came to complain to me about how sick he was, and he also said: “But, dear mother, Mrs. Dániel Váczi is suffering even more; she even wanted to jump into the well!” Since Mrs. István Nagy was also at my house, I said to her: “Dear Mrs. István Nagy, would you please take a look at her; and help her if you can!” She replied: “I could go to her, and if I gave her a bath and massaged her, I’m sure she wouldn’t have any more trouble! But I won’t do it, because they took the twenty nails of a person broken on the wheel, they burned it and gave her the ashes to drink! I wouldn’t dare to interfere for my own sake; because if I touched her, the devils would mishandle me to a degree that I would never be a healthy human being again!”154



196 J. KIS-HALAS
She tried to rid herself of her mother-in-law with the witchcraft accusation, but she did not take into consideration the fact that others were also angling for her prestigious position as a healer. The patients of the two women sought the services of other specialists simultaneously or subsequently, because it was the patient’s current condition that determined whom they turned to: if the patient got better, they kept the healer; if not, they exchanged the healer for another. Based on the witness testimonies, often in the background of the disagreement was the ‘promiscuous’ choice of doctor by the patients, or even more by the patient’s relatives—i.e. the makers of the health-related decisions of the household. As for the reasons behind this phenomenon, we can only make assumptions: was it oversupply on the medical market; or was this attitude natural and common in those times? The healer known as “the woman from Dobravica” wanted to expand her clientele at the expense of Mrs. Gergely Nagy just as much as did Mrs. István Nagy. First she identified her as a bewitcher; then, taking it a step further, she directly called her a witch; and associated the—perhaps already stereotypical?common belief that the midwife could not fit through the gates of the church in Nagybánya because of her horns. The healer from Dobravica later added further elements to the already unflattering image, and during a discussion with one of her patients she called Mrs. Gergely Nagy a night-goer155:
I heard from the woman from Dobravica as she said about Mrs. Gergely Nagy that she had horns, not in the front, and neither in the back, but in the middle. And I added, “Oh, but she can’t even see!” The woman from Dobravica replied, “She can’t see? Well she can’t in the daylight, but she can in the night, and when she passes by, with thunders.”156
Feeling cornered, Mrs. Gergely Nagy eventually made use of the same offensive tactic against Mrs. Láposi when they were simultaneously treating the hand of Gáspár Varga: she identified her rival as a bewitcher, thus trying to regain her own good reputation. One of her rivals was herself bewitched: the old woman working at the hospital (perhaps a midwife herself?) who had treated the wife of István Tétsi together with Mrs. Gergely Nagy. In the rivalry between the two healers, the more experienced Mrs. Gergely Nagy, who had a better reputation with a larger clientele, could not make the grade against the less experienced Mrs. István Nagy, who



DIVINATIO DIABOLICA AND SUPERSTITIOUS MEDICINE ... 197
on the other hand tried to profit from the prosperity in the healing sector. In the end, both healers ended up as losers in the fight for the favors of the paying clientele of Nagybánya, because they lost the race against those competing healers who operated with more efficient propaganda tools, like ‘the woman from Dobravica’, for example.
Mrs. Csóti, the Commuting Cunning Woman
Our documents reveal that the specialists who mainly practiced treasure finding and love magic, and occasionally also performed healing and bewitchment identification, were often non-permanent residents of Nagybánya, only staying there temporarily in the city. The witnesses generally mentioned three cunning women who came from the village, or were commuting between the city and the village: Mrs. Csóti from Szaszar, Mrs. Szakács from Tomán (Tămaia) and Mrs. Horsa from Tőkésbánya (Groși). We will discuss in detail the case of Mrs. Csóti. Mrs. Csóti—who was brought to trial and convicted in 1684—came to the town from Szaszar, while she also had patients in Misztótfalu (Tăuţii de Jos) and Hagymáslápos (Lăpușel). The settlement of Szaszar lying beside the river of the same name was established in the sixteenth century by the mine owners of Nagybánya: the mostly Romanian and Hungarian miners working in the tunnels were deployed here. Mrs. Csóti in her clemency appeal claimed to be 50 years old. She was married, and her husband, though ailing, was alive during the time of the trial, as one of the witnesses seemed to know. Other witnesses also mention that she had an adult child who already had a family of his own. The couple had at least one child, Mrs. Csóti’s grandchild. This family presumably lived on the outskirts of Nagybánya, where Mrs. Csóti visited them regularly. Her clients probably came from this neighborhood. The witness testimonies are about both the healing activities and magical practice of Mrs. Csóti. The witnesses mentioned altogether thirteen healing cases altogether, of which she treated illness caused by bewitchment four times; twice healing a bewitchment actually attributed to her. The witnesses described in greater detail these cases of ambiguous healing, since it could have had a value of proof in terms of the accusation. Thus we learn that one of her enemies, Ferenc Polgár, suspected Mrs. Csóti of the sudden swelling and cyanosis of his wife’s foot, because beforehand he had refused to give her the keys to the house of their neighbor, Mrs. Fodor (who temporarily or regularly



198 J. KIS-HALAS
accommodated Mrs. Csóti). Mrs. Csóti left for Máramaros soon after, and she sent the healing herbs for Mrs. Ferenc Polgár to treat her foot from there. In another case “bones were coming out from” the finger of Mrs. István Ladányi’s child, for which they blamed Mrs. Csóti. Responding to the threats of the family (“we sent her a message with her grandchild, that if she doesn’t heal her, I will make sure she’s burnt”), Mrs. Csóti simply terminated the illness, thus confirming the suspicion of bewitchment. According to the testimonies, Mrs. Csóti’s clientele consisted mostly of infants: of the thirteen cases she treated, eight were small children. The remaining cases comprised healing an artisan apprentice, a mineralpicking craftsman and a married or widowed woman. Concerning the therapies Mrs. Csóti applied, the witnesses talked about herbal baths and massages using (in two cases) unction. In four cases the witnesses considered it important to mention that during the healing procedure (when treating children) she also used incantations. For instance, she “started to chant” incantations at the son of Mrs. Miklós Szoboszlai; and she “murmured spells” around the daughter of Jutka Berta. The incantations were certainly part of more complex healing rituals; as we can assume from the fragmentary witness accounts. During the successful treatment of György Kassai Csizmadia’s child Mrs. Csóti “stuck the knife in the ground, spat on it, and shed some tears over it”; Mrs. Dudás described the treatment of her grandchild, saying: “she said incantations for the child, and held a broom in her hand”. Beside her healing practice, the various other magical services of Mrs. Csóti were just as significant, and soon her reputation for these services was widely known in Nagybánya to such an extent that the citizens turned to her for her skills even within the town walls. She identified thieves; she found stolen money for Mrs. György Kolozsvári Varga. The money in question disappeared from a chest that a Romanian woman had left with her, and Mrs. Kolozsvári wanted to clear herself from suspicion. Mrs. Csóti offered her services to István Csetri himself to find the treasures hidden under his house. Csetri concluded the presence of the hidden treasure from a curious phenomenon: one of his tenants had told him about a shining brightness he had seen one night next to the wall of the house. Although soon after this a man from Felsőbánya also offered his services for the task, István Csetri accepted Mrs. Csóti’s offer: while the man asked for the one third of the treasure, Mrs. Csóti only asked for food and beverages. She also revealed some of her methods of



DIVINATIO DIABOLICA AND SUPERSTITIOUS MEDICINE ... 199
divination for finding money and treasure to the clients, for example to Mrs. Zakariás:
... once I asked her about it, and she asked for some of that earth, and a bowl of flour and eight coins. She said she’d ‘try it at home; one has to bake savoury scones (pogácsa) and put a coin on each one of them and she’d give them to the guardians [sic!].
The treasure-guarding devil (because this could be a possible interpretation of the word ‘guardian’) and the motif of giving him a coin appears in two other narratives. When Mrs. Csóti’s clients were reluctant to pay an advance she tried to convince them that they were actually paying the devil, and that the ‘wage’ was an essential pre-condition of success: “Mrs. Csóti said: ‘you have to give it to the devil, because it is them get the money!’”157 Moreover, in Hagymáslápos they knew that Mrs. Csóti also deployed devils in cases where someone had forgotten about settling the fee for the service:
Priest János, when he couldn’t find the money of the preacher from Miszt, promised the two and a half Forints if she gave directions to it. She told him where to look for it, and he found it. When he didn’t give her the two and a half Forints, she threatened him, saying he’d be torn to pieces by the devils. When he gave her the money, she said: “See, father János, if you hadn’t brought me the money today the devils would have torn you apart!”158
The money-finding business of Mrs. Csóti was eventually jeopardized by this alleged diabolic assistance she talked about so frequently. Most probably she was aware of her dealings becoming more and more risky: she therefore continued her supposed or actually implemented magical activities at home, in Szaszar. Her other services related to her seeing skills, which included liberating prisoners and successfully bringing home students studying in distant schools. She also provided services for solving problems related to relationships and private life: she suggested a ‘salt’ (a powdery substance) against a violent husband; and another substance, which mixed with gingerbread and fed to someone would awaken an unquenchable love in the consumer:



200 J. KIS-HALAS
We were staying at Suska’s, and since they were not getting along, I asked her, “What can you do to make them divorce instead of staying together?” She said: “I can’t help with that, but I can give you some salt to bake cookies with and if you were to give it to someone, he would love you so much that he would be (excuses for the wording) almost up in your ass.”159
Her clientele in Nagybánya consisted on the one hand of suburban women and men (maybe from the suburbs of Híd street?) who had recently moved to the city, such as the above-mentioned Zakariás family. On the other hand, she tried to offer her services to the wealthier sort, such as urban craftsmen and burghers especially in the field of treasure finding: however, as we have seen, she was not so successful at this. Furthermore, it seems that she had a fair number of clients in the villages close to her residence: the authorities of Hagymáslápos and Misztótfalu both interrogated witnesses in her case.
Marci Milkó, Lord of the Cats
Marci Milkó probably moved to Nagybánya from neighboring Felsőbánya in 1696, to work for a potter. In this he was presumably unsuccessful—perhaps he was not skilful enough? Or were there too many candidates? János Szalánki said Marci even offered to pay for his healing if he hired him: “[...] I know a Vlach woman in Kovács Kápolnok (Făureşti), and I will pay her myself if you hire me in your pottery workshop.”160 He tried to live off occasional work; for instance, he went hoeing the municipal vineyard. Financial uncertainty and insolvency may have been the reason why Marci had a quarrel with his landlord, János Némethi Mészáros, who physically assaulted him on one occasion, repeatedly kicking him with his metal toecap boots. The news of the quarrel went around, since Némethi Mészáros was a prestigious and respected member of the society of Nagybánya. (Later he was elected member of the town council in 1704 and 1705.) Marci was left homeless and had to look for a new place to stay; so he moved in with a widow, Mrs. György Kádár, who according to the customs of the time, also provided food with the room. Marci always knew the menu of the day, even if he was not at home; which unequivocally proved his abilities as a seer, according to Mrs. Kádár: “I know that whenever I had



DIVINATIO DIABOLICA AND SUPERSTITIOUS MEDICINE ... 201
put something away, some food, when Marci came home he could tell right away where I had put it.”161 Still having trouble finding a job as a potter; Marci began a new venture: he started advertising his money-finding abilities. He boasted to the gravedigger, “I know where the money is, if only you could keep up digging”.162 István Jancsi Lakatos also observed that Marci was “looking at his nails and said that he knows where the money is”163 He offered his money-finding services to several people, for instance to one of the midwives in the city, Mrs. János Nagy, née Ilona Csiszár, and to another woman called Mrs. István Ladányi. Both refused his offer; the midwife even threatened him: if he was just deluding her than she would dig Marci into the ground up to the neck and keep him there until the promised money and jewellery were found. Marci started a dangerous game, since in Nagybánya bragging about one’s money- and treasurefinding has been associated with the suspicion of witchcraft and trickery; we only have to think of the case of László the ‘sorcerer gypsy’, or of the witchcraft trial against Mrs. Csóti from 1684. Perhaps it was because of the failed treasure-finding attempts that Marci started to spread the word that he not only saw hidden things, but was also an undeceivable witch identifier. In the background of his new talent we suspect the influence of the witchcraft trial in Felsőbánya in June 1696. Being a local, the unemployed apprentice potter provided saucy details for the rumour-hungry audience of Nagybánya consisting of young lads, maids and middle-aged women, when he was describing the deeds of the witches in Felsőbánya. For instance, the 16-yearold Mihály Váradi listened to Marci in amazement as he gave professional advice on how to ‘capture witches’: “when they want to tie up a witch, they give her pig’s milk to drink.”164 To his landlady he told that “the reason the witches in Felsőbánya didn’t confess was that they had eaten an unskinned black cat.”165 He further elaborated his witch-identifier image, making the cats the protagonists. He told János Sztorián: “he traveled through three countries a night on a black cat”.166 The daughter of János Erszénygyártó, Sára, directly claimed that Marci “could identify all the witches with his kittens”.167 Many have noticed that Marci has a suspiciously close relationship with cats: he called them by mewing, fed them bread and comforted them.168 The result of all this self-promotion and boasting was that those who believed him turned to him with their health problems attributed to bewitchment. Marci however declined to



202 J. KIS-HALAS
provide help; he was only willing to propose techniques to identify the bewitcher; for example to Péter Báti:
... when my leg was hurting, I called him to ask if he could help me; but he said he could not, but he had heard from the children, as he said, that if I were to steal three splitting nails from three courtyards and I cooked them, then the one who bewitched me would come forward.169
Maybe he refused to try healing because on the one hand he was aware of his abilities, while on the other he had in mind that successful healing could be viewed as being equivalent with admitting to being responsible for the bewitchment. Or he simply realized that in the eyes of the authorities cunning folk who recognized witches could easily become witches themselves. Partly influenced by the rumours he himself generated, the wife of his former enemy, Mrs. Némethi Mészáros started to spread the word that Marci, out of vengeance, was sending ‘evil ones’ (gonoszok) upon him every night, who were beating him up and tormenting him. Marci, who by this time had already become known as a challenger of witches and as a wise man with great powers, openly rejected the accusations of Mrs. Némethi: “He’s no more a witch than Mrs. Mészáros.”170 He tried to divert suspicion from himself to a seasonal woman labourer whom Mrs. Némethi had allegedly denied something, or to other women, among others the other midwife of the town, the elderly Mrs. Szaszari. He offered Mrs. Némethi that he would protect her from the attack of the evil: he would spend the night at her place. For protection, he advised her to smear the manure of a black cow on her head. Finally, he did not succeed in appeasing his former landlady, and this undermined his selfmade reputation as a witch identifier. After this, Marci tried even harder to be recognized as a benevolent and powerful magical specialist in the urban community. He acted as the defender of the entire city; he referred to himself as the ‘city’s bull’ in public. He even boasted to the young Mihály Váradi that he would retrieve the fruit harvest and the profit from the milk stolen by the witches: “After this they won’t ever take it, and the trees will bear so much fruit that the branches will break; and the milk of the cows will be fatty as well.” Due to his bragging and also to his conflict with the Némethi family, Marci eventually ended up in front of the town’s court of justice in 1697, and he was only pardoned on the condition that he would name the witches of the town. Thus the town



DIVINATIO DIABOLICA AND SUPERSTITIOUS MEDICINE ... 203
council did recognize the potter’s boy as someone who could potentially identify witches; so in this regard his efforts can be considered successful. Marci Milkó’s later fate is unknown; nonetheless, some of the witches he named did end up in court in 1698, 1700 and 1704. In 1715, in a witchcraft trial in Felsőbánya, there is a certain potter’s boy called Marci Markó [sic!] (it might be either an administrative mistake, or that of Lajos Abafi who copied the text), who swore that one of the accused, Mrs. Pál Soós, had ridden on the back of Mrs. Szeremi’s wretched cat.
ConCLusion
At the end of our lengthy review let us return to the aims we set out in the introduction. We formulated our general perception of the magical and medical market of Nagybánya on the basis of three time periods. We have established that the healers and the magical specialists fulfilled more or less the same role in the community in all three periods. We described their linguistic environment (terminology and the connotations associated with the vocabulary) relating to them and to their activities as relatively stable; however, due to the subtle differences we cannot speak of a static use of language. The typology of the health conditions treated by the healers was established empirically, based on the experiences and accounts of the patients; we also highlighted the characteristics of the symptoms associated with bewitchment. We have shown in certain aspects the relations between witchcraft as an ideology and also as a principle to explain misfortune, and local (Nagybánya) interpretations of illness. In the cases of specialists of magic, we have discussed their body of knowledge in terms of whether it actually was special, and how they applied it in the everyday crisis situations. We have outlined the demand and supply conditions that create the dynamics of the local magical and medical market. Nevertheless, lacking broader comparative data, we have not been able to define the market value of the services. Finally, with the help of three case studies we have gained insight into the processes that led to the witchcraft accusations related to certain magical specialists. We consider our current study as a starting point and as a suggestion of the issue for future research based on more thorough and wider source material.

As for the trial see Tóth G., ‘Boszorkányos hagyaték’, 226.

The precious metals gained from the mines were processed in the mint of Nagybánya, which also fell under the supervision of the Royal Chambers or that of the Principality of Transylvania. The respective owner named the local officials of the mine chamber and also the surgeons (chirurgus). 48. A considerable number of tricesima officers played a large part in it, both in Szatmár and in Nagybánya, see Cf. Béla Vilmos Mihalik, ‘A Szepesi Kamara szerepe az 1670–1676 közötti felső-magyarországi rekatolizációban’ [The role of the chamber of Szepes in the recatholicisation of Upper-Hungary, 1670–1676], FONS 18 (2010), 281; id., ‘“Ihon most”’, 63–64. 49.

50. This confessional insecurity is well illustrated in the story of the 1687 “feast of tabernacles”. That year a committee, led by the imperial commissioner Count László Károlyi, arrived in the city, and commanded both the Calvinist and the Lutheran communities to leave their churches. After few weeks of futile negotiations, the Lutherans were forced to move outside the walls of the city, where they held the Pentecost sermon in the courtyard of the mint master, Mihály Protzner under an actual tent: Révész, A mi osztályrészünk, 18–19. 51. Szirmay, Szatmár vármegye, II. 354. 52. Mihalik, “Ihon most”, 69. 53. The water ordeal was applied in Nagybánya as well in the framework of the same procedure. The contemporary practice in Hungary is discussed in detail by Péter Tóth G., ‘Folyampróba – liturgikus vízpróba boszorkányfürösztés. Istenítéleti eljárások a boszorkányperekben’ [River ordeal—trial by water—swimming of witches: procedures of ordeal in witch-trials], in Éva Pócs (ed.), Demonológia és boszorkányság Európában (Budapest: L’Harmattan and PTE Néprajz Tanszék, 2001), 271–275, 282.
54. Balogh, Nagybányai boszorkányperek, 186,192. 55. Ibid., 173. 56. Ibid., 189. A similar motif appears in a later trial from 1722: the suspect, a beggar woman called Judit Gyarató Lakatos was “tempted by the witches” in church, and so she had to leave the service (ibid., 235). In 1731, in neighboring Felsőbánya, Mrs. Bagaméri denied the accusations against her, saying that it was not her abuse, but because of the “tempting devils” that one of the local women could not go to church (Abafi, ‘Felsőbányai boszorkánypörök’, 364). 57. The midwife from Felsőbánya called Ersók might be identical with Ersébet Matzi, who was sentenced to the stake in Felsőbánya in 1696 (Abafi, ‘Felsőbányai boszorkánypörök’, 366–372). Mrs. Szathmári, the midwife reputedly from Kolozsvár, who was no longer alive at the time of the accusation, was accused by both the midwife Mrs. András Pap as well as by the above mentioned healer, Mrs. Szilágyi, after being tortured. (Balogh, Nagybányai boszorkányperek, 188–201).
58. The notes of the edited trial documents mention two more midwives among the witnesses. The publisher of the trial documents, however, left out their names and testimonies because—in his opinion—they did not include essential information in terms of the witchcraft accusation, cf. Balogh, Nagybányai boszorkányperek, 213. 59. Ibid., 116–120. 60. Ibid., 119. 61. Ibid., 127.

The name Wallendorfer (in the form of Vallendorfer) appears in two witness’s testimonies recorded during the 1753 inquisition. One of the witnesses mentioned the house of Ignác Vallendorfer in Vár Street (Balogh, Nagybányai boszorkányperek, 289). In Felsőbányai Street lived the 27-year-old János Vallendorfer who testified (Ibid., 297). We do not know if or how they were related to the chamber surgeon Kazimir. 69. The complete report is published by Claus Hamberger, Mortuus non mordet. Dokumente zum Vampirismus 1689–1791 (Wien: Turia und Kant, 1992), 88–92. Hamberger’s work and the surgical certificate (including its transcripts) were made available to me by Ádám Mézes, for which I thank him. 70. It is worth noting that in the investigation protocol, on which we have data from 1702, the stereotypical questions concerning witchcraft and magic usually appear in a similar form (Balogh, Nagybányai boszorkányperek, 150, 151, 217, 222, 228, 229, 250). 71. “...the witness heard that Mrs. Horsa, the Vlach woman from Tőkés[bánya] might know that profession” (ibid., 296). 72. Ibid., 308–309. 73. The slanderer was fined (ibid., 286). 74. Mrs. Mocsirán also known as Mrs. György Béres and Mrs. János Erdélyi might have come under suspicion during the general criminal investigation of 1753. Although concerning them the witnesses mentioned—among others—milk magic, keeping a devil familiar (moreover, an incubus), performing love magic; none of them seem to be considered as magical specialist, (ibid., 310–318). 75. The Nagybánya cases confirm Ildikó Kristóf’s earlier observations regarding the healer women of contemporary Debrecen, see Kristóf, “Ördögi mesterséget”, 444.

100. The witnesses mention herbal baths—with no specific details—five more times. 101. Ibid., 87. 102. The motif of the “herbs speaking to the healer” appears in several Transylvanian trials. For instance, in Kolozsvár (1584): Kiss, Pakó and Tóth G., Kolozsvári boszorkányperek, 87. In the proceedings for the infamous case of the bewitchment of Anna Bornemisza, wife of Prince Mihály Apafi I, it was closely related to the witchcraft accusation. It also figured among the questions in the witness interrogation against the seer woman from Törpen (or Pörpen), Ilona Lénárd (25th of June 1680): “Do you know, have you seen, or have you heard that the seer woman Ilona Pörpeni [...] bragged about hearing the herbs speak to her.” Cf.

Fair women appear several times in the Nagybánya trial documents, even in this same trial. For instance, one of her patients accused the midwife Mrs. András Pap of having stolen the plant which the patient stored at home to keep away the fair women (Balogh, Nagybányai boszorkányperek, 176).

126. Although this topic goes beyond the framework of our study, I consider it important to mention the sixteenth century cases of diabolic possession and exorcism in Transylvania. The educated elite—either the leaders of the investigation in Nagybánya, or the Calvinist preacher, István Nánási, who was directly concerned in this case—could have been informed about these cases from the Hungarian literature on demonology. The views concerning the effectiveness of exorcism must have been discussed in the religious disputes at the end of the seventeenth century; and this trial might have provided a platform for this. Péter Tóth G. has pointed out this tendency in relation to sixteenth century examples: Péter Tóth G., ‘Boszorkányok, kísértetek, ördögi megszállottak. Politikai látomások és boszorkányüldözés Erdélyben’ [Witches, ghosts, diabolically possessed. Political visions and witch trials in Transylvania], in Éva Pócs (ed.), Démonok, látók, szentek (Budapest: Balassi, 2008), 88. 127. The ritual recalls the popular miracle story related to St John the Evangelist from the Legenda Aurea. It recounts that he made the sign of blessing and then drunk a cup of poison without being harmed, to prove his faith. Cf. Jacobus de Voragine, The Golden Legend. Readings on the Saints (trans.

131. The aim of summoning the suspect to the house is to force the witch to repair the damage (Pócs, Between the Living, 116). 132. Balogh, Nagybányai boszorkányperek, 138. 133. Ibid., 178. 134. Ibid., 189.
135. According to Stuart Clark, Thinking with Demons. The Idea of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe (Oxford: Clarendon, 2001, [New york: Oxford UP, 1977]), 459–465, in the Protestant interpretation of witchcraft the role of divine providence became more and more emphatic. 136. Deut, 18: 10–11 and Exod, 22: 18–20. 137. Clark, Thinking with Demons, 464.
138. The first Helvetic Confession, the Confession of Debrecen-Egervölgy of 1562, discusses the issue of witchcraft more than once, and condemns the specialist of popular magic in this mentality, cf. Kristóf ‘“Bűvös-bájos varázslók”’, 109–113. The Confessio Debrecina was obviously known in Nagybánya as well. István Milotai Nyilas, the bishop of the Diocese of the Trans-Tisza region (including Nagybánya) from 1614 put it on his Agenda (Gyulafehérvár, 1621), cf. Áron Kiss, A Szatmár megyében tartott négy első protestáns zsinat végzései [The rulings of the first four synods in Szatmár County] (Budapest: Franklin Társulat, 1877), 3–5, http://leporollak.hu/egyhtori/magyar/KA_ZSIN.HTM (accessed: 21/01/2012); id., A XVI. században tartott protestáns zsinatok végzései (Budapest: Franklin Társulat, 1882), http://leporollak.hu/egyhtori/ magyar/KISS2A.HTM#059 (accessed: 21/01/2012). 139. This tendency was rather on the rise in the seventeenth century, especially in the witness testimonies of the 1670 trial (17 of the total of 25 cases are from this trial). After the early eighteenth century monumental trial it only occurred once again in a slander case (17241725: “pure devil”). Although we do not have direct data on it, I think it is possible that the tremendous examples for the identification of witches with the devil was part of conflicting the two interpretations in public, and that one of the platforms for this was the 1670 trial against the midwives and healers. The similar ‘Calvinistic’ interpretation of popular magic is emphasised by Davies in terms of the Scottish witch trials: Owen Davies, ‘A Comparative Perspective on Scottish CunningFolk and Charmers’, in Julian Goodare, Lauren Martin and Joyce Miller (eds), Witchcraft and Belief in Early Modern Scotland (Basingstoke: Palgrave-Macmillan, 2008), 186.

144. Ibid., 167. 145. Ibid., 81. It is also a typical case of remedying an illness attributed to bewitchment by placing it upon another human being or an animal, cf. Briggs, Witches and neighbors, 182–183; Davies, ‘A Comparative Perspective’, 192–193. 146. The name originates from the Polish poltorak, which means ‘half’. 147.

148. Ibid., 132. Hippocrates, and in his footsteps Galen as well, believed that the womb migrated inside a woman’s body. It was attracted by pleasant scents, and was repelled by unpleasant smells: thus its position could be influenced with the proper stimulus. The midwife’s treatment reflects this approach. A further analogy might be the method to lure the serpent that is supposed to be hiding inside a person’s body with milk: the snake comes out through the person’s mouth at the sweet smell of the milk. On early modern interpretations of the ‘snake entering the human body’ topos see Davide Ermacora, ‘Pre-modern Bosom Serpents and Hippocrates’ Epidemiae 5: 86.

150. She might be identical with another healer, who popped up in a later trial, too, and who was generally referred to as ‘the woman from Dobravica’ (ibid., 74, 77, 79, 193–194). 151.

Cats were often associated with witches in early modern Hungary, especially in the eastern part of the kingdom, where Nagybánya lies. Cats are mentioned in different roles in altogether seven trials. For example, in 1704 Mrs. Szaszari, a healer was accused of sending a horde of frantic cats at a patient of hers (ibid., 179). A year earlier a shoemaker cut off the legs of a cat appearing next to his wife’s sickbed, as he was convinced that not an animal but the summoned witch visited them in animal disguise. He was suspended by the guild until he clarified the situation and explained that he acted only upon suspicion (ibid., 150). 170. Ibid., 118. 171. Ibid., 119.

Shamanism or Witchcraft?
The Táltos Before the Tribunals

introduCtion: the subjeCt of the investigation
and reLated Questions
My investigation is centred on the 35 táltos1 (24 women, nine men, one boy and two girls) appearing in the documents of eighteenth-century Hungarian witch trials, the judicial records of whom have survived in trial minutes and in the peculiar narrative context of legal proceedings (indictments and testimonies of the accused and the witnesses). (The list is completed with two individuals from other sources: a warlord mentions a woman referring to herself as táltos in his letter written on warfare to the Prince; and there is another case from an unknown judicial context.) Most of them were healers, or multifunctional wise men/women involved in divination and “seeing” buried treasures, and there were a few—some younger, some older—girls who were occasionally attributed

treasure-seeing roles. Some among them were considered primarily as witches by their communities; the same individuals and other táltos persons could also identify witches and heal bewitchment in the role of the ‘anti-witch’. All these táltos appeared as accused before the judicial court. Regardless of what role they had fulfilled in their communities of origin, in court they, too, referred to themselves as táltos or tátos; and their witnesses, when relating pre-trial events, always mentioned incidents when the accused bragged about being a táltos, or used their reputation as defence in their own rural or urban communities. I included in my examination the táltos who were only mentioned over the course of the trial but not indicted. Meanwhile, in light of the available data, there are only four or five individuals of whom we can presume—and it remains a presumption—that they (also) pursued special táltos activities.
Táltos
The Hungarian táltos is a mediator who can contact the supernatural world and as such belongs to the category of wise men/women, seers, and sorcerers with occult skills. There are certain ‘táltos features’, which have provided grounds for Hungarian researchers to invest the táltos with the role of the pre-Christian shaman of the ‘ancient religion’. In this study, I intend to confront witchcraft with shamanism as constructed by researchers2 of Hungarian ‘ancient religion’, built around the figure of the táltos. I do not have the space to go into the details of the topic of the táltos abundantly detailed in this field of research; I will only refer to the research of Vilmos Diószegi who described in detail the features of contemporary Hungarian táltos in several of his works.3 Besides the data drawn from nineteenth- and twentieth-century ethnographic collections, lacking other medieval and early modern sources, he used the then available, scanty data on táltos appearing in witch trials to reconstruct their one-time activities, in a way similar to that of his predecessors and followers who wished to reconstruct the ‘ancient religion’. I must note that in light of my related researches I only consider certain details of this reconstruction acceptable. I conditionally accept the opinion that in the age of the conquest of the Carpathian Basin there existed a communal specialist called táltos who carried out shamanistic activities; and in the present study, by ‘táltos activity’ and ‘táltos beliefs’ I refer to the same attributes that these researchers associated with the táltos as preserving shamanistic



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 223
traditions. Of these táltos characteristics we find the following examples in the context of witch trial protocols (although only sparsely): the role of weather magician; beliefs related to being born with teeth or being predestined by God in the womb to be born as a táltos; falling into a trance; turning into animals; ‘battling’ in the image of an animal against the hostile spirit world; and the ‘táltos horse’ as the means of transportation to the other world and as a helping spirit of the táltos. In this study, and in the context of witch trials, I consider the existence of these attributes to be the criteria for being a par excellence, ‘real’ táltos. It is also an important feature, in my opinion, in order to have some sort of táltos identity, for the táltos to have faith in their own capabilities, in the effectiveness of their activities, if it is possible at all to capture this last aspect in the fragmented trial documents. These motifs are also outlined in the texts about various beliefs collected in the twentieth century,4 but these are primarily defunct textual motifs, while in the seventeenth and eighteenth century it also referred to a living practice. Contrary to the táltos in twentieth-century legends, usually in the role of ‘weather sorcerer’ or ‘battling’ for the weather and—less often—as ‘treasure seer’ or fortune-teller, the táltos in witch trials primarily carry out treasure-seeing and healing activities. They usually appeared in front of the witch tribunal as ‘anti-witches’: as healers who remedy bewitchment, and, in some cases, who diagnose it, or as witch identifiers who recognize the identity of the bewitcher. Besides the general charge of magic, they were often also accused of bewitchment (maleficium) due to their double faceted activities, and apparently not always without reason. We can see that in the documentation of witch trials the táltos often appeared as an individual in the personal context of a specific witchcraft accusation, which is why one of the subtopics of the present study, the question of ‘witchcraft or shamanism’, could arise.
Witches and Anti-Witches
I apply the concept of witchcraft as it was adapted in European research from the works of E.E. Evans-Pritchard5 who studied African Azande witchcraft, and in its generally used sense within the realm of anthropology of witchcraft since Alan Macfarlane’s book6 describing witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart Essex in its social network of micro-communal accusations: the witch is an ad hoc scapegoat accused of bewitchment to whom maleficium is attributed in the given specific cases. Even though there



224 É. PóCS
is a wider sense to the notion of witchcraft applied in research describing the witch as a person with occult powers practicing maleficent magic, regarding the present context, it is more fruitful to classify the latter in the category of malevolent (‘black’) sorcerers (that is, to apply EvansPritchard’s distinction between sorcerer and witch), albeit we have to admit that the two categories often overlap in other regards. In this investigation the witch is not only examined as a ‘belief figure’ but also as a social figure: a member of the social network of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century village and small town communities. They played a crucial role within the group of people mutually in relation that was formed in connection with a specific witchcraft accusation. The said group actively or passively participated in creating, enduring and conducting witchcraft accusations. The three permanent figures of this network are the maleficent witch, the victim of the bewitchment, and the anti-witch healing the bewitchment or the bewitched person. The last figure is usually a specialist in magic, a healer or a ‘wise’ specialist associated with beliefs of occult knowledge; in the context of Hungarian witchcraft this person is occasionally a táltos.7 As the trial documents show, however, the táltos appeared not only in this role, but at any point in the network of relationships. In the known systems of European witchcraft, the suspicion of bewitchment could be directed basically at anyone. As regards Hungarian past practices, which we know from the sixteenth- to the eighteenth-century witch trials, I distinguish among the various witch types based on the inner tension, accusations, conflicts and feuds within the local society that led to the accusation of bewitchment.8 One type consisted of the magical specialists in communities whose ambivalent expertise and dubious activities related to healing, divination and magic (one only has to think of the unsuccessful cases of healing interpreted as maleficium) virtually acted as a magnet to bewitchment accusations. Every detailed analysis examining the social background to the emergence of witchcraft accusation—such as Ildikó Kristóf’s research in Debrecen and Bihar County, or my own investigation in Sopron County, Gábor Klaniczay’s analysis of Kolozsvár and the southern part of the Great Plain, or Judit Kis-Halas’s research in Nagybánya—underlines both the frequency of magical specialists and healers being accused of witchcraft and the ambivalent nature of their characters.9 Thus, we can only talk about the malefactor witch or the healer restoring the bewitchment as opposing positive and negative poles in a



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 225
given situation or procedure related to accusation. In general, we can also conclude from the above that besides or alongside the maleficent witch and healing ‘anti-witch’, sometimes incorporated in the same person, there are healing witches and maleficent ‘healers’ as well. Besides the permanent functions, we could also witness the switching of roles. Every type of cunning folk is an ambiguous character: the knowledge and the supernatural skills attributed to them, as well as the myths associated with them, make them capable of bewitching and healing, of negative and positive magic, occult or magical activities. It is based on subjective traits, the given situation, the personality and character of the given individual, and on the specific needs of the community that they decide whether the given case is bewitchment, identification of maleficium, or healing. In many cases the opposing individuals (witch and healer) appear in reversed roles in another case (or trial). It is in this context that in Hungary the general view was that the witch’s bewitchment could only be healed by the witch herself, as well as the concrete fact that a significant percentage of the people accused of witchcraft in Hungary were healers, midwives, cunning folk or táltos (In other parts of Europe there were seer and sorcerer specialists similar to the táltos, such as the Sami shamans or Spanish saludadors, who were often placed before witchcraft tribunals.10). In the majority of cases within the local systems of witchcraft in the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century documents examined in this present study, the diagnosis of the bewitchment and the identification of the bewitcher were carried out by the healers themselves, if such was needed at all (often the victims and their relatives knew who to blame, or applied home-made divination procedures in order to lure the bewitcher to the house11). However, in a very low percentage of the known cases there might be a third person in addition to the bewitcher and the healer: usually a non-local specialist from another settlement or someone only appearing occasionally, who applies some sort of divination technique, or determines ‘at first sight’ or ‘by intuition’ if the illness was due to a bewitchment, or gives the identity of the bewitcher. This role could have been filled by healers who lived elsewhere and who were not involved in local witchcraft matters; or specialists with a general occult knowledge; or by seers, wise men/women, cunning folk, or táltos who fulfilled complex healing, divination and mediation functions.12 The trial documentation does not suggest that professional witch identifiers, or ‘witchfinders’, described by several researchers of European witchcraft,13 and



226 É. PóCS
hired in many parts of Europe by witchcraft tribunals, would have played a significant role in Hungary.
Shamanism or Witchcraft?
This question emerged in European and, immediately after that, in Hungarian research inquiring into the relationship and the overlap between two institutions, two ritual and belief systems, and the relationship of successive systems.14 We have data from all over Europe on ‘shamanistic’ sorcerers playing a role similar to that of the táltos, who are mediators maintaining contact with the otherworld through their assumed occult abilities. The types described as fertility sorcerers have gained a prominent place in research15; by analysing one of these types in his book published in 1966 Carlo Ginzburg founded his controversial view on “the shamanistic soul journeys providing the foundation of the witches’ Sabbath”. Some twenty years later, in his second book16 on the subject, Ginzburg made an attempt to outline the totality of the systems of European shamanism (which also embrace the Hungarian táltos) and, using archaeological and historical sources, to mark out the place of European witchcraft in the development of shamanism over time. Gábor Klaniczay, with the data from research on the southern Slavs, expanded the circle of sorcerers and, even before Ginzburg, linked the Hungarian táltos with these systems.17 By doing so, Klaniczay introduced the paradigm of shamanism versus witchcraft into Hungarian research.18 The aforementioned researchers, as well as others investigating Italian, southern Slav and Baltic sorcerers19 have examined the social roles of these mediators, and thereby their roles as the adversaries of witches. One of the reasons behind the wideranging inquiry about the relationship between shamanism and witchcraft is that the belief systems of European witchcraft include numerous phenomena that might qualify as shamanism. What the concerned European researchers consider to be ‘shamanism’ or ‘shamanistic’ varies; usually we can establish that they refer to magicians communicating with the otherworld and their techniques, who and which correspond to the generally accepted criteria of shamanism in their fundamental traits (such as trance technique, ‘free soul’ detached from the body, helping spirit) in terms of a wider concept of shamanism20; and both the otherworldly adventures and the ‘soul journeys’ experienced in the state of trance or in dreams, and the



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 227
helping spirits and ‘otherworldly’ battles against demons indeed appear now and then in European belief systems of witchcraft. These manifestations, considered ‘shamanistic’, are however fundamental characteristics of supernatural communication, and therefore qualifying their presence in a belief or ritual system as shamanism would be possible, yet not too effective; since in this way the category of shamanism would become too general and, as such, inefficient for characterisation and distinction. (We must at least take into consideration the ritual performance nature of shamanism and/or certain functions and/or the techniques applied to achieve such factors as a state of trance in order to distinguish a specific shamanistic belief system.) Let us take a closer look at the question of táltos or witch versus shamanism as regards our specific topic, the early modern Hungarian táltos. Following in the footsteps of researchers of ancient Hungarian religion, the researchers mentioned above in relation to shamanism and witchcraft believed that they recognized the vestiges of pre-Christian shamanism in the activities and beliefs associated with both the táltos and with European ‘fertility magicians’ exposed with them. Having accepted the above-cited theses of ancient Hungarian religion research I used to follow this direction as well.21 Today I diverge from my former views in that I would not refer to the mediatory activities of either the witch, or the táltos as shamanism; I would include them now among certain European seer-sorcerer systems. The discovered European parallels indicate that the phenomena evaluated as Hungarian shamanism are not necessarily and not exclusively vestiges of pre-Conquest, ‘ancient religion’ shamanism. In this study I will not discuss the special problem of ancient Hungarian religion; that is, the question of the táltos being the ‘successor’ of the pre-Christian Hungarian shaman. My only question in relation to the paradigm of shamanism or witchcraft is whether the early modern táltos known from witch trials is a mediator between the human world and the otherworld; whether we can talk about a ‘real’ táltos in the above-mentioned sense or whether it is integrated entirely into the system of witchcraft. And as such, whether we can still identify specific ‘Hungarian táltos’ characteristics, and if yes, how they are manifested, and what their role is (and in the same context: was it justified to have referred to certain Hungarian witch characteristics as táltos attributes or as Hungarian shamanism)? In short: táltos or witch? Or both?



228 É. PóCS
Táltos and Witch
I have already discussed certain aspects of the ‘shamanism or witchcraft’ paradigm in my book22 which dealt with the establishment of contact with the otherworld: mediatory techniques and belief systems of mediators in early modern village and market town communities on the basis of source material from sixteenth- to eighteenth-century Hungarian witch trials. My investigation was primarily an assessment: what systems of communication were known to early modern Hungarians? What role did these systems play in everyday life, and which contemporary European systems did they fit into? On the basis of the social and belief context of witches and mediators in witch trials, we have been able to establish that witches themselves were in some regards mediators communicating with the otherworld. The witch as ambivalent social being can bewitch and heal, take the role of both the ‘evil’ witch and the ‘good’ anti-witch. As a belief figure it has a peculiar duality: it belongs to the dual creatures of European belief systems that exist in human-demonic, living-dead forms (similar to the dual nature of eastern European—Romanian, Serbian, Ukrainian, etc.—witch figures). In this European region there were similar dual creatures such as the fairies or the territorial variants of werewolves and vampires, and the mora/Mahr type of incubi.23 These creatures enriched the belief figures of Central and Eastern European witches; as belief systems ‘preceding’ that of the witches, as parts of more archaic systems, they can be regarded in some respect as the ancestors of witches.24 The cunning folk and the healers appearing in the role of the anti-witch are also dual creatures, or manifest such characteristics. The adversaries appearing in the context of witchcraft, wise men/women, seers, or táltos, are also associated with the mythology of dual creatures: demonic, night forms and helping spirits. As we could see from the context of Hungarian witch trials25 the wise men/ women, seers and táltos appearing as the adversaries of witches often had the dual-creature characteristics of the mora, werewolves or fairies.26 The witch and the anti-witch are identical creatures on a mythical level: both figures are associated with beliefs about having the ambivalent supernatural skill of bewitchment/healing. The common features of the belief systems related to dual creatures are specific concepts of the soul; beliefs about spirits leaving the body and taking demon (or animal) form or appearing as the incorporation of another person (by ‘possessing’ it), about shadow-souls, living, dead,



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 229
physical and spiritual alter egos.27 The witch (or the werewolf, the fairy, the vampire and the others) can simultaneously be a person and the person’s spirit, which might equally appear as a demon attacking others and a good spirit fending off attacks. These creatures are also familiar in the ‘other’ world due to their second identity, their night-time alter ego. This is the nocturnal aspect of the human world, in which they turn into animals or night demons; a relevant name given to witches in Hungarian is ‘nightwalker’ (éjjeljáró) or ‘the woman of the night’ (éjasszony). The witch is also a human clad in witch beliefs; a social being and belief figure at one and the same time. Different social types can be associated with different beliefs in various constellations (except for the suspicion of bewitchment, which is the definitive characteristic of a witch), and sometimes no beliefs are associated at all. However, somewhere in the background, as part of the necessary ideology of social witchcraft there is always the belief system of the ‘night witch’. There has always been a supernatural, ‘nightly’ dimension to witchcraft in terms of both bewitchment and healing, as systems coordinating the reaction to calamities that affected village communities. Similar to the case of witch, the belief context and practical function of the anti-witch is also inseparable: both contribute to the dual role (real and supernatural) they fulfil within the system of witchcraft. The witch and the antiwitch are creatures with similar attributes, belonging to the same system; bewitchment, identification and healing take place in the same alternative sphere as parts of the same mediatory system. The most remarkable textual representations of this fact are the accounts of the night battles of witches with their enemies. These usually appear in the dreams and visions of the healing witch who fends off the bewitchment28:
...the witches nearly killed me and my daughter during the night, for healing you...29
The healers take up the fight against the combative spirit with the help of their supernatural skills. Recurring motifs of the battles are the injuries brought from the other world and shown in this world, as a proof of the battle having taken place. As we are about to see, our táltos also often participated in similar spirit battles: this is the most important motif that relates them to early modern witches. All this does indeed make the systems of Central and Eastern European witchcraft similar to some traits of shamanism, but we must



230 É. PóCS
not forget certain important differences related to the function, aim and means of this communication. The otherworldly communication of the par excellence witch, suspected of bewitchment, is an activity only attributed to the witch by others; since there were no witches who consciously and deliberately flew off on bewitching journeys.30 Even if in the accounts it said, for instance, that upon leaving her body a witch’s soul turned into a chicken, entered the enemy neighbor’s house through the keyhole and lay on the neighbor’s chest, ‘pressing it’ during the night, nobody ever admitted to doing so. It is usually the victims who give witness accounts of their dream or vision experiences endured as subjects of such bewitchments by the night witch31; or, as in the above case, antiwitches who describe the battles for souls with the combative witches. In contrast, shamans can have real, experienced, and ‘seen’ otherworldly adventures over the course of the voluntary, conscious communication established in an induced trance. Similar to anti-witches, they give the account of their otherworldly battles fought against evil spirits as selfaware mediators. We can discover ‘shamanistic’ traits in the activities of the anti-witches who enter spirit battles, but, again, we must underline the differential characteristics: the complete lack of the public, ritual performance aspect of shamanism, the lack of any method inducing a state of trance, and the complete absence of shamanistic cosmogony. On the other hand, there is a symbolic otherworld appearing as an alternative earthly existence, arranged with hills and brooks surrounding the village, with fruit trees and livestock. It would be most appropriate to consider all this as the supernatural aspect of witchcraft, and as witches and anti-witches communicating with the otherworld; but under no circumstances should it be treated as shamanism or its perpetrators as shamans.
The Studies on Magical Specialists
Towards the end of the past century, in the stream of increasingly expanding research of witchcraft, a complaint was raised: why are witches always placed in the centre of the witch trial investigations; why is not the role of the cunning folk and the witchdoctors, those who repair the bewitchment, examined?32 The person who raised the complaint, Willem de Blécourt has since then (and before) made up for a lot of these deficits,33 although even then, in 1994, the objection was not entirely justified because, to say the least, both of Carlo Ginzburg’s books based on witch trials were not about the witches, but about their



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 231
adversaries, the benandanti, and various European sorcerers who appear in the role of the adversaries of witches who repair bewitchment. Or we can also refer to the previously mentioned study by Gábor Klaniczay or my book in which I discuss witchcraft including the anti-witches, the cunning folk and the táltos in a common mediatory system. And the figures of magicians and the cunning folk who healed bewitchment also appeared in every work—even before the ‘complaint’—that used the source material of witch trials to describe witchcraft as the communal system used to explain calamity and to resolve conflict.34 A series of studies were published on the cunning folk, wise men and women,35 and about healers, mostly in the web of relationships of village witchcraft and in the local systems of accusations. The authors of the publications usually underline the numerous variants of the healer/anti-witch systems and the haphazard nature of these systems.36 From our perspective the most significant pieces of research carried out are those which examine, beyond the role of cunning folk and witchdoctors in witchcraft, the wider ‘supernatural’ context of the maladies caused by bewitchment and their remedies; for instance the works of Emma Wilby, Willem de Blécourt, and Owen Davies.37 Works examining contemporary witchcraft in such a wide context might also be helpful in interpreting our fragmented early modern data.38 This wider context might help us decide our core question: witchcraft or shamanism?
táltoS Within the system of WitChCraft—Presentation
The Nature of Sources
A significant part of the táltos mentioned in Hungarian witch trials between 1626 and 1789 appear as witches and/or anti-witches integrated in the local communal system of witchcraft. Using witch trials as sources can have both advantages and disadvantages. In this period of one and a half centuries the only data about the táltos are those that appear randomly in the witch trials; because the táltos, and in general the sorcerers, were not persecuted and not penalised, only the táltos accused of witchcraft were brought in front of a tribunal. What we get to know about them is adjusted to the context of the witch trial, and we only learn about them in the distorting reflection of judicial discourse. An advantage of early modern judicial narratives, as opposed to the equally distorting twentieth- and twenty-first-century belief narratives, is that



232 É. PóCS
they present witchcraft and the táltos activities both as functioning institutions and as living ritual and belief systems. The accounts of the witnesses and the accused themselves reflect the activities of the táltos in many cases; sometimes even their individual visionary adventures were experienced in a state of trance. We cannot shed light on the general activities of the táltos of this time period purely on the basis of the study of judicial narratives. The exact number of táltos (since there must have been a great many more of them beyond the ones known from the context of witch trials) and their general role in the everyday life of the contemporary communities is unknown; it is also impossible to tell how general this picture of táltos roles outlined from trial texts and that of the anti-witches within the systems of contemporary witchcraft truly was. What can certainly be established from the texts, however, are the strategies used by the actors of the trial: the accused representing their own interests and traditions of their community, the witnesses testifying for or against the accused, and the judicial court representing both contemporary criminal law and the demonological doctrines regarding the witchcraft of the persecutors and Satan. The accounts provided by the táltos and their witnesses are narrative constructions, collective creations established in the dialogue between the actors of interrogation. The nature of these, their changes and variants, are less defined by the faith and religious experiences of the accused and by the events that happened to them and the rituals they practiced; they are primarily influenced by the narrative traditions of their ‘pre-trial’ community, by the stereotypical judicial narrative and the relevant speech context, as well as by various intentions, expectations, interests and objectives, in short the diverse narrative strategies of the opposing parties. In the context of the trials it is especially important to take into consideration the Christianising and demonologising attitude of the court (in other words, the crime of witchcraft was less evaluated by its ‘natural’ criterion used in communal accusations: causing damage by occult means, and bewitchment, but more by the diabolical aspect of the witch created by Christian theologians: Satan’s inspiration and assistance in bewitchment). The greatest sin lay not in having inflicted damage upon one’s neighbors through bewitchment, but in denial of Christian faith, entering a ‘pact’ with the Devil and the worship of Satan (supposedly on the witches’ Sabbath). These views, coming from above, pronounced by the judges during these trials, had an impact on the actors of the



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 233
trial, including the accused. Furthermore we must take into account the changes in the judicial evaluation of magic and sorcerers, and also that of the táltos, and finally we also have to consider the identity-transforming effect of interrogation under torture.39 There is a discrepancy between the texts pronounced in a non-habitual trial situation and reality, and between judicial narratives and texts pronounced in the pre-trial communities. We have to keep in mind that the accounts about personal experiences were already stereotyped texts at the ‘first’ account; they were distorted reflections of present reality because they were interwoven with the past and with local narrative traditions. Our investigation must find out which elements of the narrative constructions surrounding the belief figure of the táltos were used in the judicial dialogue by the táltos and their witnesses; for instance, in order to legitimise or to condemn the role of the táltos, and so forth. To sum up, we have to discover the inducing elements of the constructed dialogue and of the narrative strategies; we must find out what motivated the actors of the judicial dialogue.
Questions
It follows from the trial context that we have to distinguish the real functions of the táltos outside the trial, their ‘permanent occupation’ and the role for which they were accused, because in most cases they were brought to court for witchcraft and not for being táltos, and this could imply various kinds of magical activities, as I have mentioned earlier. It would be good to know whether these táltos accusations were about actual men and women working as táltos, or if they were only called or rumoured to be that, a fame diffused by them or by others, with a hidden agenda to profit from the reputation of the táltos. It has to be examined if the witchcraft accusations inflicted upon the táltos had any ‘extra-trial’ foundation or if they were fictional charges created by the witch hunter authorities: were the táltos really (also) witches? Another important question to find the answer to is how the accused themselves related to the role of táltos or witch to which they admitted in court. Were the supernatural aspects of these the subjects of religious faith and religious experiences? Was the faith in their activity of protecting and helping their community, in the effectiveness of their ritual part of their táltos identity? Or was the belief in the diabolical origin of their skills and in their diabolical helpers part of their witch identity and their



234 É. PóCS
ability to bewitch? Was the faith in the beliefs associated with them (specific characteristics at birth, knowledge of supernatural origin, heavenly or diabolical callings, their initiation, their helping spirits, their own spirit alter-ego, their metamorphoses, etc.) part of their identity; did they have religious experiences (such as otherworldly battles fought in a state of trance, the spirit world assisting and attacking them)? In other words: were their táltos and witch identities and activities a reality or merely a narrative construction? In what follows, we will briefly summarise the data of 37 individuals named as táltos or tátos in the judicial files of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century witch trials or other trials, and in one case an individual mentioned outside the said context. Our classification was established by the roles, activities of the táltos according to the tribunal, revolving around our main question: are the accused (really) táltos or witches?40
‘Real’ Táltos in Unknown Táltos-Roles
In our first group we find people who consider themselves or are considered by others to be táltos for having one or more characteristics regarded as táltos attributes by researchers; including the táltos mentioned by these táltos (belonging to their community or known from elsewhere). The accused of the first three trials in this category might have been practicing táltos who claimed that they fought battles in the sky; the aim of these battles, however, was not discovered, and neither were the related communal tasks (if there were any) of the accused.
1. Mrs. István Fejes, née Erzsébet Ormos (Tátos Erzsébet/Tátos Erzse) was brought to court in 1626 in Debrecen with her brother, for the murder of her husband. The woman was also accused of witchcraft. The verdict was that Mrs. Fejes should be tortured and “burnt at the stake, whether she confesses or not”; however, she was pardoned because of her pregnancy.41 From the trial documents we know only the verdict, which tells us that “Erzsébet, who is called Tátos” claimed insistently during torture that she would not do witchcraft; she also promised “that she would never again practice that kind of tátos devilry, she would not deceive with lies about being a tátos and about dragons being her companions” (this probably referred to dragons as spirits who aided her). Erzsébet did admit to some traits of the táltos; but the tribunal qualified these as



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 235
either devilry or a lie. In early seventeenth-century Debrecen, being a táltos was apparently not a serious crime. We can presume that Erzsébet Ormos was a woman fully conscious of her táltos identity; this is confirmed by her nickname, Tátos.
2–4. The trial of the táltos Zsuzsanna/Zsuzska Kőműves (Kővágó), Judit Szőcs and György Tapodi took place in 1740 in front of the council of Miskolc.42 The minutes of ten witness testimonies, of György Tapodi’s testimony and of the verdict of two women have survived, but the testimonies of the other two táltos and the verdict of Tapodi are missing. We know of one of the accused that she was also a professional healer, but the judicial dialogue did not connect this to her being a táltos. This is the only táltos trial in which two women and a man were obviously brought to trial exclusively for their táltos activities; all the extant questions and testimonies of the tribunal referred only to the táltos role; so these texts could, in principle, throw light on certain aspects of the lives of eighteenth-century táltos in Miskolc. The members of the town’s community (at least many of them) were aware of who the táltos were within the community; the delinquents themselves talked openly about themselves as such and never concealed the fact. People conversed about and with the táltos on trial: they asked them about their activities and they always answered willingly, volunteering that their primary activity was battling (vagdalkozás, which means slashing) “in the sky”. Clearly, this was in the centre of their táltos activities:
The witness heard it from the mouth of Suska Kőmíves that the daughter of János Szőcs, Judith [was a] tátos, and that on Saint John’s Day they have to do battle...43
Other witnesses, and even György Tapodi, confirmed that if the time came they had to go into battle, and on a regular basis, at Pentecost and on Saint John’s Day. They presumably “travelled” to the otherworld in a trance, because the trial minutes give the account of how the táltos entered a ritual trance; at least, Judit Szőcs practiced the technique of ‘looking into water’, during which she fell into a trance and turned into an animal.
On the third day of Pentecost at dawn she went to the courtyard and took a bowl in her hand and gazed into it; her neighbor saw this and asked her: “What are you looking at?” The girl replied: “Nothing at all”. Shortly after that she shook herself and turned into a fish and disappeared for three days.44



236 É. PóCS
There is also another witness testimony mentioning the animal metamorphosis of a táltos:
... then György Tapodi [...] told Zsuzska Kőmíves: “If you want you can turn into a dove, if you want you can turn into a fish, if you want you can turn into a fox.” And Zsuzska Kőmíves replied to all: “True”.45
The witnesses often quoted the words of the táltos and described the order of the battling troops:
The witness heard it directly from Zsuzska Kőműves when she called herself a táltos; when the witness asked about their battles she replied that the women battle separately from the men, and she also said that they had to leave because they battled in the sky as well.46
Another witness mentioned a troop banner: “Zsuzska Kőmives [...] also said that they had a banner, the light of which shines over the whole world”.47 György Tapodi also describes the troops, adding “that there are seven hundred táltos in this county”.48 In most cases, the battles are described as “slashing”, that is, a hand-to-hand combat with swords. The injuries are felt and seen in their earthly existence as well.
...she heard directly from Suska Kőmives that she called herself a tátos, she even showed her on her body how they slashed each other in battle; and the witness saw that her body was full of blue marks, similar to when one spanks a child with a stick, she even saw her blouse, that was cut in several places...49
In these battle accounts, it is apparent how the combats are always in groups; it is always the gathering of hundreds of táltos, and there is always a battle group of women táltos. It does not say whom they fight against or to what end. There is another motif, difficult to interpret in the witness testimonies, which alludes to some sort of competition or challenge among táltos (training or ‘initiation’ into the profession?):
The witness heard these words from the mouth of György Tapodi that both he, that is, György Tapodi, and Suska Kőmives were táltos, but none of them was as strong as the daughter of János Szőcs, as Suska Kőmíves, because she will no longer be that strong because she fell off a beam, and I also fell off two beams and I will fall off a third one, too, if I go again.50

As regards the táltos profession they also mention in relation to Judit Szőcs that “she is looking for the horse beneath her”51—perhaps looking for a helping spirit in the shape of a horse? These texts present the táltos as parts and actors of a real, coherent ritual and belief complex. It is very likely that this is the case of táltos who practice their profession seriously and admit to being táltos without scruples. Although the first person accounts of the otherworldly experiences, the subjective voice of the táltos, is missing, I believe that, at least in the case of Zsuzsanna Kőműves, we are dealing here with someone who truly believed herself to be a táltos and who did experience her otherworldly journeys. The unique, ad hoc nature of these events and the non-stereotypical accounts of the experiences confirm this suggestion. The cliché-like motif of showing around otherworldly injuries can be considered an attempt to prove that they are ‘real táltos’; the wounds obtained in a battle fought defending the town presumably tried to enforce legitimacy and positive perception in both the pre-trial community and the tribunal. Unfortunately, aside from the application of trance techniques, very little was revealed about the profession of these táltos. Why did these three táltos battle “in the sky”, and against whom? What were the communal objectives they had to fight for, and how many táltos were actually active specialists in these small towns? An apparent characteristic of these táltos is that, contrary to the general order of the age, they seem not to participate in the witchcraft accusations of the small-town community: they neither played a role as a witch, nor as an anti-witch, although in the trial Zsuzska Kőműves was mentioned as a healer. Being a táltos did not even qualify as a practitioner of witchcraft before the court, it was only considered an “outrage” from which the accused had to desist.
5–9. Mrs. András Szabó, née Ilona Borsi was a woman from Cegléd who is also an example of a ‘believing’ táltos. Her trial was conducted between 1730 and 1736 in Kisdobrony, Bereg County. Meanwhile in 1735 the manorial court of Munkács started investigating the case of a “vagabond woman living divorced from her husband”.52 We do not have the entire text of the trial minutes in which we find the names of three further individuals considered to be táltos. We read in Lehoczky’s overview that Ilona Borsi
...said in her voluntary testimony that she lived from quackery, that is, from healing with herbs; she confessed that the reason she was not living with her husband was that she must stay away from men so that her skill



238 É. PóCS
does not become ineffective; she said that she got her ‘knowledge’ in her mother’s womb, and that she was a semi-táltos, because she was born with a molar tooth on her left side.53
We also find out from Ilona Borsi’s testimony that:
...the difference between being a táltos or semi-táltos is that the táltos above all do battle for their respective regions of the country, and the semi-táltos practice only healing, but they do not bewitch anybody, though they recognise witches and know about their deeds...54
The most important (and almost sensational) element in Ilona Borsi’s trial documents is a detailed account of a single combat between a female and a male táltos (6–7) to which she was taken at the age of seven; they took her flying on their horses so that she could watch the battle. Ilona Borsi sees them fighting in the sky—as a vision inside a vision:
Moreover, out of pretension, fear, or rather foolishness she alleged that when she was seven years old a male and a female táltos, i.e. Pál Nagy and the wife of Máté Szabó took her from Pápa, their horses flew up to the sky when they left the city and thus they arrived at a hill two miles outside the city of Székesfehérvár where the táltos gather three times a year, in the months of Pentecost, Saint James and Saint Michael. Here they tied the horses to a thick tree and she was placed on the ground; then the two táltos undressed completely and went down to the valley where they turned into bulls and were engaged in combat for hours. Meanwhile the female bull saw that Ilona wanted to watch them so she ran to her and encouraged her not to be afraid; then she ran back and locked horns again, and then they flew up in the air and continued the unavailing battle and butting55 for about an hour and a half. In the meantime one of the tethered táltos horses said to Ilona: “Don’t be afraid, you bastard, of what you see in the sky; just go to sleep, no one will hurt you”. Then they descended from the sky and regained their human form, and asked her: “Did you see something in the sky?” She replied that she had seen lightning but she was not afraid because “she was also encouraged by the horse. She also saw that the male táltos injured the woman on the left side of her chest, and the woman said that this had happened on several occasions before, and that she would heal herself. Then they ate from the bread and drank from the water that they had brought along with them, then put Ilona on a horse to see if she could ride a táltos horse alone, but since she was weak she cried and they let her off the horse and took her with them flying towards Vác.56



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 239
In our historical sources this is the only occurrence of the leitmotif of twentieth-century táltos legends: the single combat in the shape of animals. Only this combat had no stakes; it was not between adversary táltos, but rather a presentation for the little girl taken to learn about being a táltos. (She, however, never became a táltos, only a semi-táltos.)57 This narrative is ‘sensational’ because the meagre early modern text documents and the faded late modern documents full of narrative stereotypes about táltos barely contain subjective, life-like descriptions of real battles experienced in trance or dream. This one is fascinating in that it is the description of an “exhibition” combat presentation which suggests, with its unique detail (a male and a female táltos, Máté Szabó and the wife of another man jousting and locking horns), that it is in fact a recollection of real events. Another unique element in the narrative, aside from the táltos butting as bulls, are the (flying) táltos horses, which are mentioned several times, and which make room for the possibility of a double interpretation: the horse as an alter ego of the táltos and the horse as a helping spirit. In another paragraph of the trial document one of the horses recognized Ilona Borsi as a táltos, and addressed her as such:
She confessed that in Győr County, in a village called Nyúl, Miska Pap had a chestnut táltos horse, and Imre Magocsi, the vice-comes, as well, had a steel-grey táltos that was sent to his son by the postmaster of Aszód as a gift from the village of Aranyos. The latter horse was once in the stable when Ilona looked at it, and the horse recognised her immediately that she was a táltos as well, and therefore the steed called out to her trustfully: “Why are you looking at me so sadly, come to me.” In Parád there is a legless beggar who has a one-eyed white táltos horse.58
These narratives are very lifelike. Contrary to many eighteenth-century witches who refer to themselves as táltos, even bragging about their táltos abilities, this might be a case of professional táltos who actually practiced their profession, had animal alter egos and helping spirits, and had visions of battles. The initiation nature of the ‘presentation’ (possibly experienced in a trance or dream) is supported by the fact that, according to her recollections, the woman standing before the tribunal was taken by the táltos at the age of seven, which is the mythical age of initiation. One of the tests of the ‘initiation’, if we interpret the text correctly, was to see if the 7-year-old girl could ride the táltos horse (or, if



240 É. PóCS
we phrase it more boldly, if she could acquire a helping spirit in the form of a horse). In her testimony Ilona Borsi confessed that eventually she did not become a battling táltos, but merely a semi-táltos who learned a knowledge of herbs from a woman whom she served for this exact purpose. To continue the above description, it is stated that after flying towards Vác,
...they dropped her off and told her to go to a physician acquaintance, István Borbély, whom she served over the following three and a half years; she went to collect herbs with several other women and learned how to heal; moreover, she soon gained a reputation and people were sending for her from as far away as Szeged.59
Even though Ilona Borsi did not fight battles, the professional battling táltos are mentioned in this same testimony: they have to get together on top of the hill at Pentecost and “in the months of Saint James and Saint Michael”.60 Once again we have táltos participating in group battles associated with certain dates in the calendar that we have seen in the Miskolc trial, and again, we find out nothing about the goal of the battle or about the communal roles of these battling táltos. There is further information gained from the documents of this trial regarding the profession of táltos. Some of this represents what are surely beliefs local to the eighteenth-century North Eastern Hungarian region. Nevertheless, there are recurring motifs that have a more general character, such as táltos knowledge gained in the mother’s womb (the reference to chastity is a unique element, however), being born with a tooth, the semi-táltos versus the ‘whole’ táltos, and the opposition or the sharp distinction between healing and battling táltos. Among all the trials it,is in this one that the accused emphasises the most strongly that identifying witches was part of the táltos profession, and that táltos were opposed to witches. It is unclear whether the two táltos mentioned by Ilona Borsi, Mrs. Samu Lucza and Mrs. Márton Német, who had all “learned their profession four years earlier” from a woman who died since, and who “never caused any harm to anybody”, were also purely positive táltos. It can be presumed that their primary communal function was also healing. There is even less data on the two other táltos who only appear in the battle vision, beyond the fact that theirs is the only Hungarian case of a malefemale combat in the form of bulls.



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 241
In the following cases, the accused do speak in their confessions about heavenly battles, but their practical roles known in the context of the trial do not confirm their being professional táltos, even though they can at least describe these spirit battles in the sky. Besides all this, however, they all have a real or pretended táltos consciousness. 10–12. The trial of the táltos woman from Debrecen, Mrs. András Bartha, née Erzsébet Balási was conducted between 1725 and 1726 in Debrecen.61 Her primary profession was that of healer; her trial also contains charges of treasure seeing, divination and identifying bewitchment. The tribunal considered the healings of Mrs. Bartha acts of a diabolical profession, that is, witchcraft; her fortune-telling was declared “diabolical divination”; Mrs. Bartha was sentenced to be exiled from the city. According to what transpires from the trial, the main activity of Mrs. Bartha was healing. She is also mentioned as a fortune-teller in the documents: for instance, she predicted a fire that came upon the city,62 and she could also tell the outcome of an illness, or the possible death of a patient to their family. A few cases of unsuccessful treasure seeing are also known, in which case the witnesses and the tribunal described her as a fraud. The legal charges also included that “she wanted [to give] the money she took for digging to her táltos companions”.63 Mrs. Bartha seems to be the most familiar with the healing profession: she conducted complex healing-bewitching and witch-identifying activities within the relationship network of the institution of witchcraft. As a renowned expert on bewitchment, she diagnosed every illness as maleficium; she often extracted “bindings” from the patient’s wound; she found the bewitching substances laid in the path of the patient. One part of her healing was always to suspect the bewitcher, to be cautious with suspicious individuals and to warn patients to avoid further bewitchment. The proceedings of the healer/bewitchment identifier are very similar in the long series of witness testimonies. Mrs. Bartha must have talked a lot about her healings to the witnesses, who then embellished these narratives in which she herself was always the protagonist predicting events and diagnosing bewitchment. The witness Pál Sári, for instance, related that Mrs. Bartha had stated the following:
Don’t mourn your wife because she will get better, you just have to go home to Kaba, but you must get there while the sun is still in the sky, I know, you must not get off your carriage until you arrive, and the woman dressed in black who bewitched you will go to you and ask: “Sir notary, is



242 É. PóCS
poor Ersók getting any better or not?” If my prediction is right, your wife will recover...64
Several witness testimonies describe how she was interrupted by adversary spirits while healing. For instance, when she was greasing György Dömsödi “suddenly a rattle and clatter was heard in that room and the door was kicked so hard that the bolt of the lock fell off”, then Mrs. Bartha started to sweat heavily and collapsed, and then she regained consciousness and carried on with her work.65 When she healed the daughter of another witness, “in the inside room everything was smashed onto the floor with a great clatter and rattle”.66 Certain witnesses even qualified similar events as the attack of the maleficent witch. In one case sparrows where chirping during the night while she was healing, and “a multitude of dogs” were barking67; or black bumble bees were flying around during a massage68; during another incident of “greasing”, cats were defecating in the house in the night.69 In the night the spirits often attacked the patients she was treating:
...that night the witness felt an agonizing pain: around midnight he was struggling with a woman [who] twisted his male member really badly and that night his genitals and entire groin started itching.70
The witch adversaries sometimes attacked during the night as spirits, or in the reality of daylight; the two dimensions could be present in parallel in the same narrative. Mrs. Bartha could display in the morning her injuries obtained in the spirit battle; as often occurs in other judicial narratives of contemporary witchcraft, there is a permanent transit between the night-time dream- and vision-world and the daytime reality:
After the dirty thing that had happened to Mrs. Rácz she came the following day to heal the witness and said: “I had great trouble because of you last night.” She showed her body, her skin was badly scratched, sliced and cut. The witness said: “Did you get all this last night?” Mrs. Bartha replied: “yes indeed, all of this happened last night because of you; had I known this would happen, I wouldn’t have stepped a foot in your house even if you paid me one hundred Forints.”71
Mrs. Bartha was fully familiar with the everyday bewitchment-healing cases of the village, mostly in the role of the healer, but she often wavered on



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 243
the border between the two; she occasionally took the role of bewitcher, especially when it came to competition with other rival healers, at least so say the accounts.
...that night, as they say, the husband, son and daughter-in-law of the witness were in great pain, her husband and son had both got in the hands of Mrs. Bartha.
Often her bewitchments were due to an unpaid compensation or prepayments with no service in return; for instance, she threatened her clients with night-time spirit attacks in order to make them pay for further treatment fees. Her bewitchments could be accompanied by spirit battles; she occasionally sent bewitching spirits to her victims.72 She threatened a rival healer woman:
Just wait, and you will regret it, [...] you will never be a better healer than I am, because if I want to heal someone, I will succeed, regardless of the malady they suffer from.
Later crows pecked the woman who “was bewitched right after the threat and alone she suspected Mrs. Bartha”.73 Mrs. Bartha was a healer with an extended practice and she protected her reputation and broke rival doctors with ruthless business tricks; she insured herself in case of failure with the stereotypical phrases that we know from the narratives of healers even today, such as: “you see, you did not follow my instructions, if you had come in, God knows this would not have happened to you”.74 She cleverly advertised herself:
...it’s fortunate you know me because you have been bewitched so that on one side all your tendons are in contraction so that one side would rot away, [...] but now that I understand, this will not happen.75
The detailed documentation surrounding Mrs. Bartha supplies us with insight into the rich spirit world typically inherent in early modern village witchcraft. We often read in the minutes of eighteenth-century witch trials of night-time spirit attacks and battles between patient and witch, healer and bewitcher, or between rival healers, but the richest source in this regard is the trial documentation of Mrs. Bartha.



244 É. PóCS
Mrs. Bartha is a standard bewitchment-healing anti-witch; her spirit battles are also ordinary witch battles. However, certain characters appear—the táltos relatives of Mrs. Bartha as participants in the battle—who do not fit into this environment. A battle was fought by Mrs. Bartha for the sake of her patient, during which her helper was her own, 12-year-old daughter, whom she had described as being a táltos prior to the tribunal, and who was mentioned by several witnesses. One testimony stated:
The witness had a lodger named Sára [...]. This Sára said: “Oh, my lady, they fought a battle with Mrs. Bartha last night, there were many here, but the most powerful of them all was the young daughter of Mrs. Bartha, who took the sword in her mouth and fought terribly. I was lying in my bed and watching. Mrs. Bartha said, “Don’t be afraid, Sára, no one will hurt you.” She heard this from her lodger, named Sára. The witness also heard Mrs. Bartha say that when they came to fight her, if it hadn’t been for her daughter, they would have killed her.76
Mrs. Bartha remembers her deceased brother, Pál Balási, as having been a “great tátos” who, if he were alive, would protect her from the nighttime attacks. One of her witnesses described how she complained to her patient because of whom she had been attacked by a witch adversary:
...she sighed and mentioned her brother: “Oh, my sweet brother, if he hadn’t died I would not suffer so much pain right now, because there was no greater táltos in this country.” The witness asked, “And are you a táltos, too?” Mrs. Bartha replied, “I am indeed.” The witness asked, “Where did you learn it?” Mrs. Bartha said that God had created her that way.77
In her confession under torture she admits, as a kind of legitimising factor, that her táltos knowledge had been “taught by God” and that God had formed her into a táltos “in the womb of my mother”. While denying the accusation of having a pact with the Devil, she consciously talks about being a táltos, mentioning the táltos nature of her brother and daughter as a positive feature. The question arises: how much of a táltos was Mrs. Bartha? Were her activities connected in any way to her táltos profession as asserted before the court? Does the apparition of táltos helpers in the spirit battles related to witches mean that these fights are to be considered as ‘táltos



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 245
battles’, as research has suggested on several occasions? The answer, in my opinion, is no; this only suggests that Mrs. Bartha was familiar with both belief systems. As a healer of bewitchment she lived and functioned within the personal network of village/neighborhood witchcraft; she experienced her táltos profession as a ‘healer-or-maleficent witch’ seasoned with local táltos beliefs that were common knowledge there at that time; reaping the fruits of her supposed táltos talents in her healing or bewitching activities. In spite of this, it seems as if she considered her táltos talents to be the opposite of witchcraft, at least during the trial. She emphasised that witches were the enemies of the táltos, which was also the recurring stereotypical statement of the táltos appearing before the courts of Debrecen and its vicinity. The attitude of the tribunal seemed to be slowly changing, Mrs. Bartha’s tribunal was already uncovering Mrs. Bartha’s attempt to emphasise the witch-táltos opposition as a marketing trick: “The witness only pretended that the witches were her enemies”, so that her patients “sought her help believing that she was a woman taught by God”.78 It remains a question, which cannot be answered at this point, whether Mrs. Bartha’s conscious táltos identity only drew upon the táltos beliefs still well alive in her surroundings, or whether she practiced any special táltos activities besides healing. Probably there were no such deeds, her táltos identity only playing a role on an ideological level. That notwithstanding, a confession was extracted from her under torture that she and her troops had fought a battle against Turks and Germans “in the sky” and “for the empire”. Mrs. Bartha’s answers to the interrogator’s questions were put to writing by the notary (in 3rd person singular) as follows:
If she is a táltos, what kind of powers and ranks do the táltos have?
They battle in the sky for the empire.
Did she battle as well?
yes.
Why?
Because God assigned them leaders.
Who are her tátos companions?
János Ujfalusi Nagy, who was there with her in the battle.



246 É. PóCS
Where did the battle take place?
In the Hortobágy, at the hill of Szendelik.
Did she go by foot or by other means?
She was taken by God under His wings, and she was given wings like a bird.
When were they at the hill of Szendelik?
Last year at harvest.
In the night or in the day?
They left during the day at eleven o’clock and arrived in the evening.
Who was their leader?
János Nagy.79
Her narrative lacks any sign of subjectivity; we therefore suspect that it is only a narrative stereotype of táltos battles. The notion of táltos battles must have been known in Debrecen and the fight “for the Empire” was very relevant at the time; Mrs. Bartha adjusted the stereotypical images of the táltos battles in the sky, as did many other contemporary táltos. The motif of battles fought in the sky (and not in heavens!) was wellknown in eighteenth-century Debrecen, it was a narrative stereotype associated with the táltos character and it could be attributed to the different táltos denominations and roles in various ways, even as a marketing trick. 13. The trial of Erzsébet/Örzse Tóth80 took place in 1728 in Jászberény.81 She was accused of magic and witchcraft, and of bewitching people and animals. As with most of the táltos documented in the eighteenth century, she was a woman; besides fulfilling the typically female role of healer, she was also a weather magician, or at least she described her weather magician activities along with the heavenly battles as the determining feature of being a táltos. The documentation is incomplete; the verdict of the court is unknown. The witness testimonies shed light on certain sorcerer techniques of Örzse Tóth: how to tie the hands of the judges, how to cause or heal barrenness. She had given advice and magical substances to several people. This was all mentioned incidentally and apparently the court was rather indifferent. Her fortune-telling skill was also mentioned only



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 247
briefly in relation to her healing/bewitching activities: she predicted the death or the outcome of the illness of her patients, and she predicted fire or death as a threat to those of her enemies she wanted to bewitch. Her treasure seeing activity—if there was any—must have been unsuccessful. She bragged, saying:
...she knows everything in the world that is buried in the soil, but she does not want it for herself. The witness asked her to tell him where to look, where he could dig up some money because he was a poor boy. Örse Tott replied: “I wouldn’t dare telling you because my companions would be angry at me, I am not telling anybody and I am not touching it either.”82
Her boasting regarding this issue was mentioned by other witnesses as well. The reference to her treasure-seeing companions must have become a narrative cliché; we encounter in several other trials references to groups of treasure diggers that are supposed to enhance the prestige of the accused. Örzse Tóth’s role as a healer, however, was unequivocal, and it must have been significant, although the witnesses relate very few successful healing incidents; by contrast, the number of failed healing attempts or incidents interpreted as bewitchment is relatively higher. Her cases of healing were almost always integrated into a context of bewitchment, of which she either played the role of the healer, or that of the one who identified the bewitchment and recognized the maleficent witch. Besides fighting for the recovery of her patients she also had to face in battle the supposed bewitcher of her patient, the patients she had failed to heal, rival healers, and in general all the people who interpreted her healing efforts as bewitchment, who could have ‘bewitched her in return’; in other words, she had to function in all these roles amidst the various role changes resulting from the specific situations. All of her roles are amply illustrated by the testimonies of the witnesses. For instance, she diagnosed a bewitchment in the process of healing when she suspected that there were neighborly animosities that might have induced the malady:
Örsébet Tott was bathing her, and while doing so she said to her: “The person who borrowed 10 Forints from you looked deep into your heart and then bewitched you.”83



248 É. PóCS
As in the case of many other contemporary witches, her fights against anti-witches also manifested in the battles against the spirits sent to attack her. The spirits of the bewitching witch appear almost inevitably and hinder her in healing, either as “buzzing ants”, or as a flock of birds that, according to the witness accounts, only she could see around the patient she was treating. It is also no coincidence that Örzse Tóth’s bewitchments usually stemmed from seemingly simple ‘cases of healing’ or failed healings, and were induced under the surface as a natural consequence of the conflicts between neighbors and rival healers. An example of this is a testimony in which the witness describes how her child died after Örzse Tóth had treated him. She asked Örzse:
...why she caused this great evil to her son. She replied: “It is better if you keep quiet before you regret it!” Right after that the witness went deaf in both ears, she has been ill ever since.84
It would appear that fear of a maleficium accusation (bewitchment by an anti-witch?) was greater in Örzse than the healing intention one would expect from a healer: there are several examples showing that she did not take on hopeless cases, giving various excuses for not doing so. For instance, she refused to heal an incurable patient, referring to the prospective torture by adversary spirits: “I could heal her, but I am afraid to do so because the evil ones would torment me.”85 She was a clever manager of those of her cases related to healing or identifying maleficium; she was not even deterred from self-promotion: “Just take me to Allatyán and I will show you who bewitched your sister.”86 She was not shy to openly disparage rival healers and to threaten with bewitchment, indeed to actually bewitch those who would seek the help of another healer: “Otherwise you’ll die in six days! As Mrs. Joseph Molnar also passed away before.”87 Her threats of bewitchment did not spare people of higher rank than hers. The magistrate of the city, a man named Bartal from the town council was a personal enemy of Örzse for some reason. She told one of the witnesses the following:
...His daughter-in-law was killed by devils, his older daughter will be killed, too, and the old Bartal will not die a pleasant death either, but tell him to take care of himself because his death will not be pretty.88



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 249
The majority of the bewitchment cases of which Örzse Tóth was convicted were obviously imputed, since in the eighteenth century even the wisest village healer had only meagre effectiveness in healing the serious maladies occurring among their clientele, making it fertile ground for bewitchment accusations. A typical opinion associated with every healer woman was that “she healed him just as much as she bewitched him”.89 She considered her vindictive threats and harming intentions as “successful” bewitchments, and her motivation was usually personal vengeance for a real or presumed offence. She admitted to all this quite openly and, if her witnesses can be trusted, even boasted about her successful bewitchments:
you dishonoured me, you did not invite me to the wedding, but I also did my part, you can thank me for the death of your daughter!90
Taking the everyday realities outlined in witness testimonies into consideration, the image of Örzse Tóth is that of a mischievous, vindictive and menacing healer woman showing very little compassion towards her patients and perhaps engaged in actual malefactor activities. Nonetheless, Örzse Tóth admits to being a táltos before the tribunal, and her in-court behavior, the content of her confession and her locution all seem to confirm the truthfulness of this. Witnesses relate her countless comments about being a táltos, as well as her exhibitionist boasting in this matter. She mentioned to several witnesses that she was a táltos, or semi-táltos, and also that she was born with a tooth, or that she had “double teeth”91:
The witness heard Örsik Tóth say: “I have three double teeth, I have already given one to Christ, but I still have two.”
She valued her teeth very much (one of which she offered one to Christ perhaps as an act of initiation?); she showed them to one witness along with her alleged injuries from the heavenly battle. Apparently the witness did not take Örzse as seriously as she would have liked, for she
...asked the witness to put his finger into her mouth to see her táltos teeth. The witness said: “I will not,... [I’m afraid] I will get bitten.” She then showed her arm, saying: “you see the shots and cuts; I am, at all times, to



250 É. PóCS
go out as soon as they call me out and summon me.” [...] The witness did not see any sign of injury...92
Örzse also commented on her being a táltos by saying that “she is a táltos and the daughter of God”.93 Moreover:
...she was a second person for God and Jesus Christ covered her with his mantle.94
She also claimed that the “most Blessed Virgin came to her every Wednesday and talked to her”.95 She also originated one of her effective medicines from Christ:
Jesus Christ gave me a medicine without which no barber (may the Devil plough their souls) can heal him, unless he buys it from me for money.96
She claimed she had power and influence over the entire town by being a táltos. She makes mention of the witchcraft belief known in much of Europe whereby by placing a broom in her stead in the bed, her husband would think that she was lying next to him during the night when in fact she was abroad, “even farther than Turkey”. She adds that during her night-time spirit journey “she goes around the city and knows how everybody lives”.97 She was accused of performing her practices by confederating with the Devil; however, she stated in her defence and even bragged in her testimony that as a weather magician she took a great responsibility in protecting the town’s crops and vineyards from the catastrophe of a hailstorm:
They would gladly send me away from the city, but they don’t know how much good I have done to this town, I didn’t mind people being envious of me, I kept the seedling crops and grapes around the town safe, I protected, I fought when the evils wanted to bewitch.98
As she put it, in the weather battles fought “in the sky” she protected the crops and the vines from hail and from bewitchment by evil ones (witches?). Such battles took place under the patronage of Christian summoning- and guardian-spirits; moreover, she was even given the key to the sky by her heavenly protectors. She talked about this to one witness:



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 251
“...as the skies lighten I have to go immediately, and the holy cross will be placed on my shoulder”, [...] and the accused had a small key on a silk thread around her neck, with which “the skies opened”.99
In her confession given before the tribunal it is recorded that
...As the lightning began and many táltos were locked in struggle, she was present, too. She went there through the air with the help of God and fought.100
In one of the partial, fragmented paragraphs of the trial minutes there is even mention of a helping spirit in the form of a dragon; in light of known Central and Eastern European data the dragon is typically the helping spirit or animal alter ego of weather magicians.101 The testimonies of Erzsébet Tóth and her witnesses outline a very coherent táltos mythology and various elements of a weather magician’s practice. Nonetheless, there is a great contradiction between the táltos and the above-discussed personalities of the malefactor witch that is difficult to resolve. The question arises: did Erzsébet Tóth truly practice as a weather magician and táltos? Can we consider her spirit battles to fight hail and her being born with teeth as suggested in her statement before the court to be sufficient criteria for being a táltos? Or should she be considered as a simple ambivalent malefactor/healer witch who used her ingeniously constructed táltos identity to support both her fight within the system of witchcraft and her defence against the witchhunting authorities? Her táltos image, especially the idea of her being the daughter of God or Christ, might also have been mere role-play for the tribunal, and in her pre-trial everyday life they could have been figures of speech used to raise her prestige. The above-mentioned comment about her being enraptured (having fallen into trance) gives the impression of subjectivity representing a realistic fact. yet, in comparison with the vivid visions of the night-time witch battles experienced as reality, the heavenly táltos battles seem rather to be narrative stereotypes of popular belief. Since there is no hard evidence, either for or against, the only conclusion to be drawn is that the more likely scenario is that, similar to Mrs. Bartha, the declaration by the táltos from Debrecen Örzse Tóth regarding her táltos attributes and Christian guardian spirits is rather a performance played for the town public sphere in order to raise her prestige and as a threat to her adversaries in the town.

On the other hand, whichever is the case regarding her weather magician activities, she and her surroundings must have been quite familiar with the beliefs and narratives surrounding weather magician táltos, probably spread through word of mouth. If Örzse Tóth did function as a weather magician it is still unclear how important a role this represented within the community besides her healing activities; it is certain, however, that this type of weather magic (with a dragon helping spirit) must have existed in the region of Jászberény during the time of the trial or not long before. As regards the táltos-witch opposition, several instances of which we can witness, Örzse Tóth deploys her táltos identity by threatening the magistrate of the town with bewitchment. This example sheds light on a special aspect of the táltos versus witch opposition:
The scribe Mihály, who is a witch to the core, as is half of the council, though I am not, they would gladly send me away from the town, but they know not how much good I do to the town...102
I am not afraid of being caught, because I am the daughter of God; if somebody threatens me, I look into the eyes103 of the person, and they have to die, if they sent me away [exiled me] from the town, this town would be lost.104
Her main defence is to emphasise her táltos nature while at the same time bragging about her ability to bewitch; she shows off her witch powers, the foundation of which is apparently her táltos identity. One manifestation of this is in emphasising her role as the protector of the town, upon which she built an entire strategy consisting of threats against her adversaries and the town magistrate, and underlining her powers over the entire city. According to one witness she had boasted that she had saved Jászberény, or the entire country, from a catastrophic earthquake:
The witness heard from the mouth of Örsik Tóth: “[...] had I not gone round this town, it would have sunk [...]; and do you know that when the earthquake occurred, the third of Hungary would have been lost, were it not for me”.105
She is responsible for the entire community, but she also has power over it, which makes it more than the reputation of a famous and successful communal healer: this is an inevitable, destined (táltos) responsibility with



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 253
which she had been invested since her birth. The answer to the previously raised question is that it is more likely that she was not a táltos. Or in more correct terms: she lived her táltos identity as a healer/malefactor witch.
Táltos as the Specialists of Divination and Magic
The individuals described as táltos that belong to this group were mentioned in various witch trials as specializing in magic and fortune-telling. 14–15. János Herner published the judicial files of those accused of a ‘conspiracy’ to kill the wife of Prince Michael Apafi, a Transylvanian show trial that took place between 1678 and 1688. In this political show trial, which, according to the ideology of the age, bore the mark of a witch trial, the charges of belief in magic and practice of black magic were a possible reality. While unravelling the alleged conspiracy accusations were made against all kinds of individuals pursuing magical professions one after the other as suspects, not only people accused of maleficent magic, but also healing and divining magicians described as táltos. Among them stands out Zsuzsanna Lorántffy, the former Princess consort who is referred to as a great táltos,106 and a child táltos who practiced magic in order to free prisoners.107 16. In a 1717 witch trial in Gyula there is mention of a mendicant old táltos who also gave advice on how to use magic to free prisoners.108 17. During the 1708 anti-Austrian fight for freedom led by Rákóczi, in an environment in which the occurrence of all kinds of wise men, seers, prophets and fortune-tellers was not unfamiliar, there was a woman calling herself a táltos who travelled with her children from her village to the battlefield on a cart.109 As a táltos she offered her enemy-bewitching services to Prince Rákóczi through General Bercsényi:
Sir I am a táltos; I ask from you: what are your plans with Heister, and what should I do with the German? [...] If I wanted, not one German gun could go off! He would go blind, even Pálffy would go insane”.110
The woman turned out to be a crook who had travelled to Bercsényi’s camp in hope of financial gain. It appears as if in this region the táltos had a positive reputation and that this woman had tried to use it as a ‘letter of recommendation’ at the Prince’s court.

Táltos as Healers and Wise Women
In this group we find practicing wise men and women (javasok) whose main táltos activity was healing. They were not accused in a trial of their own, but were mentioned in the witch trials of others; nonetheless, unlike the group of healers in the role of anti-witches (mentioned below) they have nothing to do with the witchcraft discussed in the given trial, at least in light of the available data. They were referred to as táltos, which is indicative of the reputation táltos had during this time period. One example from among the three cases (18, 19, 20) we have of this usage is that of Zsuzsánna Kovács, who was brought to trial in 1742 in Miskolc, probably for her healing and money-divining activities. Her files do not reveal if, by being a healer, she also really considered herself a táltos, or only used her táltos reputation to get more patients. She was sentenced to 25 lashes
...for having the audacity to call herself a tátos and as such, hoping to earn money for healing and cheating others...111
Healers and wise táltos in the roles of witches and anti-witches The largest group of táltos appearing in seventeenth- and eighteenthcentury trials consists of individuals integrated into the local, communal network of witchcraft matters who function as healers, bewitchers and identifiers of witches. 21. The magistrate from Hajdúszoboszló opened the trial of Mrs. István Szathmári, née Anna Belényesi in 1715.112 Among the charges brought against her, the most important were the failed healing attempts considered as bewitchment and “seeing” things hidden in the ground, or distant objects, through occult means. These things included recovering lost animals, lost and stolen objects by reading the stars, that is, astrological divination. As it transpires from the trial minutes, this was considered to be witchcraft.113 Her being a táltos did not figure among the witchcraft charges, it only came up during her trial as a side issue when the accused and her advocate talk about her táltos abilities as part of the defence. The court could not agree on the verdict. The debate was about whether to sentence someone to torture or even to death on the basis of one single witness testimony regarding a case of bewitchment; some of



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 255
the judges wished to look for further evidence. The outcome of the trial is unknown; it is only known that the accused made an appeal. Anna Belényesi is the typical representative of the ambivalence of the healing profession; her failed healings interpreted as bewitchment, and especially her ability to recognize bewitchment, became suspicious. Witness testimonies relate in detail several cases where she identified bewitchment; they all occurred in the course of healing where she determined the identity of the patient’s bewitcher. Interestingly, she not only disclosed to her clients the identity of the bewitcher and the whereabouts of the bewitching substance, but also the family or neighborly conflict that had led to the bewitchment. For instance:
She said that young Gáspár Gellért was bewitched by a woman from Debrecen who had asked him to make a pair of boots, but he refused, and so she bewitched him on that Sunday as he passed by the cemetery, the malefic binding was in a pot, and he took a step over it.114
Apparently the accused was a practicing specialist in healing who lived integrated into the network of relationships of witchcraft and who was very familiar with the mechanism of neighborhood witchcraft and probably also the narrative stereotypes of bewitchment cases. The incidents of failed treatment, some of them even ending in death for which she was taken to be responsible, attracted the accusation of witchcraft. There is only one witness who stated that Anna Belényesi attacked her during the night as a bewitcher, and then would have admitted at her daytime visit the previous nightly ‘spirit visit’ to her; she described it with the stereotypical images of the nightly spirit battles between healer and bewitcher:
After she bathed herself and her child, during the night the evil ones almost dragged her off her bed. The morning after, Mrs. István Szathmári came to her house and the witness told her: “I assure you, I had it going this night, they almost dragged me off the bed.” The woman replied: “I went to visit you three times this night.”115
The tribunal charged Anna Belényesi with money-divining as well, although, as confirmed by several witnesses and by her own testimony, she claimed that she did not take on money-seeing, because she was a married woman, that is, no longer a virgin, and therefore no longer had the ability. (Virginity as a criterion for money-seeing occurs on several



256 É. PóCS
occasions in the examined cases of money-seeing.) People used her powers to find lost animals and stolen objects which, as several witnesses concurrently asserted, she located by reading the stars. She probably contributed to the spread of the accusations with some cases of unsuccessful seeing; according to the witnesses she often refused to ‘see’, referring to some excuse, such as bad weather, or did not specify the exact location of the animals. Although some of the witnesses complain about her failed ‘seeings’, contrary to the court they clearly do not consider this activity as witchcraft; they even underline its Christian aspect. A witness described star reading as follows:
The witness saw during the night as this woman was looking at the moon, the stars and the sky and said the Lord’s Prayer; he heard her say: “Lord, show me your will to my prayer!”116
The lawyer of Anna Belényesi also defended star divination, claiming that even the wise astrologers predict from the position of the stars, and that they do not cause any harm. However, in terms of the judicial practices dictated by the Zeitgeist which started to treat money-seeing as a synonym of witchcraft, the activity of the seer (néző) was suspicious even if it did not include money-seeing. Those abilities of Anna Belényesi related to being a táltos were not brought up as witchcraft charges in her trial. She made mention of them in defence of her healing skills, which had become suspicious in the eye of the court, connecting it with the knowledge acquired when she was in Turkish captivity in Nándorfehérvár,117 as the maid of a Turkish (!) táltos woman (the wife of a Turkish officer) who violently forced her to learn. A relative of a 50-year-old woman testified as a witness of the conversation she had with Anna Belényesi:
“Where did you learn your knowledge, that you can heal so well?” She replied that for eleven years she had lived in Nándorfehérvár at the home of a pasha among the Turks, and his wife was a Turkish tátos, she learned it from her. She was reluctant to learn but she said: “Learn because it is not devilry, the táltos is chosen for this by God in the mother’s womb.” When she did not obey the woman slapped her hard...118



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 257
The violent teacher and the slaps smacking the face of the reluctant disciple were mentioned by several witnesses: “She was captive in Turkey, the woman who taught her was a tátos, and, as she said, she taught her by force.” Or: “She learned her knowledge in Turkey when she was a servant, her landlady slapped her if she didn’t want to learn.” The witnesses even mention a case of star reading during which she prayed to Allah in Turkish:
...the witness saw as she put her hands together and held them up to the sky, looking up, and speaking in Turkish, it was a genuine prayer since she mentioned God in Turkish, as Allah.119
The realistic account of the Turkish prayer suggests that the woman did learn something from her Turkish “táltos landlady”. The question remains why Anna Belényesi identified the activity of this Turkish woman with the Hungarian notion of ‘táltos’, or with motifs of her healing and fortune-telling identity or of táltos beliefs she was aware of. Could it be that she did learn healing and “seeing” from her landlady, who might have been the magical or religious specialist of her own community? The truth will never be revealed. The defensive argument of the advocate of the accused was that Anna Belényesi “did not perform any diabolical charming, accusing or seeing” and that he expected the court to “prove her performing diabolical knowledge and witchcraft”. He also mentions the involuntary learning from the Turkish woman, as well as the táltos abilities, which he considers godly and not diabolical as an excuse: “because the táltos are just as angry at the Devil as we are”. Anna Belényesi’s abilities as a táltos were only mentioned incidentally in court. The laconic trial documents do not reveal whether this woman had any kind of táltos identity, or whether she pursued her healing and divination career as a táltos; it is also unclear what the briefly mentioned Turkish relationship represents in terms of the Hungarian táltos. It seems certain, however, that the táltos abilities had to have a positive reputation in both her own eyes and those of some of the witnesses, even some of the judges; and implicitly the táltos versus witch opposition is also formulated. In the context of this trial, being a táltos was not relevant to the witchcraft accusation per se. Being a táltos was however associated at this time with the complex figure of magical or religious specialists usually called ‘wise men/women’ or ‘cunning folk’ who had abilities in and



258 É. PóCS
pursued a profession of healing, seeing, fortune telling and bewitchment identification, and who were considered or called witches in certain situations in village witchcraft accusations. 22. András Suppony (Suppuny), also called “Bellfounder”, was brought to trial in 1721 in Szentandrás, Békés County. György Oláh only published a part of the available and incomplete documents.120 From these it turns out that the accused was already an old man and a famous healer and fortune-teller by the time of his trial. “People came from far-off lands to hear his predictions. His healing remedies were also used by many.”121 He travelled around many places in several counties, while numerous complaints were raised against him; the County ordered the investigation of his case, of his bewitchments cast as a healer and his “obviously evil táltos” activities. The witnesses also related incidents of healing, as well as other bewitchments, including maleficia, inspired by vengeance burdened with neighborly conflicts. Certain witness testimonies are accounts of how he healed his own bewitchments, a characteristic of healers seen as being ambivalent. It is obvious that by then a change had taken place: in the eye of the court, the status of táltos had degraded to that of perpetrator of diabolical witchcraft. In Szentandrás in 1721 the táltos did not have a positive reputation; moreover, according to public opinion, a view probably shared by Suppony, no such thing existed as a positive táltos role or activity. The notion of táltos only occurs in the trial documents as a general accusation or, by the witnesses, as a pejorative epithet. On the basis of both the judicial accusations and the witness testimonies András Suppony can be counted among the ambivalent wise men with the power to heal or bewitch, healers and witches. 23. The healer woman, Anók (Annok) Fejér showed up in several settlements in Northern Hungary in the one and a half decades between 1716 and 1732. According to the earliest data we have on her she appeared as the accused before the Debrecen court of law for her failed attempts at healing and on the death of her patients on December 7, 1716.122 As we find out from the overview by Ildikó Kristóf, after being exiled from Debrecen she was involved in the trials in Borsova (Bereg County) in 1724, in Tiszaújlak (Ugocsa County) in 1726, in Hegyközpályi (Szatmár County) and Apagy (Szabolcs County) in 1731, and finally in Feketeardó (Ugocsa County).123 The minutes of the Ugocsa and Bereg County trials feature several witness testimonies in relation to her activities as a bewitchment identifier and healer; for instance, the witnesses of the 1724 Borsova trial stated that she



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 259
intervened successfully against the ‘great witch’ Mrs. András Molnár, née Krisztina/Kriska Mészáros by diagnosing bewitchment and healing Kirska’s patients.124 One of the witnesses, who was Kriska’s patient
...amidst her many miseries, went to Anók Fejér, and as soon as she saw her she said: you have a great malady, I have many patients but none of them is like you. As she gave her to drink she was better, [...] but she never recovered until her death, she kept on suffering and then she died. She always suspected Kriska for it...125
It can be established from the detailed account of her incidents that those of her activities identified as healing and bewitchment stemmed from the same root: she was a self-aware, active and efficient adversary of ‘the great witch’, whose bewitchment diagnoses and healing of maleficia were both trusted. She is mentioned once again as a bewitchment-identifying healer in the testimonies of the witch trial against Mrs. Mátyás Orosz in Kisvárda. Some of the incidents described in these accounts also portrayed her as a practiced and respectable healer and bewitchment identifier who consciously acted against malefactor witches.126 In Hegyközpályi (Bihar County) in 1731 (in the trial of Mrs. Márton Nagy, Mrs. Bálint Benedek and several other women) she takes a similar role in that she accuses a malefactor witch of having placed a ‘binding’ (bewitchment), and who is successfully identified with the method suggested by Anók.127 In the network of witch-identifier-healer she is also often attributed the role of bewitcher. After having been exiled from Debrecen for her failed healing incidents, she was also sentenced to leave Ugocsa County for good, because, as Andor Komáromy, who published parts of the trial, summarised: “she was mostly held responsible for the death incidents resulting from her quackeries”.128 She was probably blamed not only for her failed attempts at healing, but for effective bewitchments as well. This self-proclaimed healer called herself a táltos, or semi-táltos. This was the main charge against her in the Ugocsa County trial as was already mentioned in the letter in which the council of Nagykálló reported her to the vice-comes of Ugocsa County:
...Sofia Horváth, a woman detained here [...] said that she heard from the mouth of Anók Fejér as she said: “before the Tatar bewitched me I had been a full táltos, but now I am only a semi-táltos”.129



260 É. PóCS
No other aspects of being a táltos is mentioned. Neither is the healing and bewitchment identifying activity connected to her táltos abilities by her or the court. Did she exclusively use her táltos reputation as an argument of defence? We have no way of knowing. The scanty data also fail to reveal what she considered to be her principal táltos features and motivations; was it healing or the struggle against witches, or other, special táltos attributes? 24. In the 1743 witch trial of Mrs. István Kelemen and Mrs. István Vámos conducted in Túrkeve several witnesses mention a woman claiming to be a táltos called Mrs. János Tóth of whom the documents reveal the following: she could read the stars, but Mrs. Vámos the witch bewitched her with the hemp she had hidden in her boots, and “she has been unable to see the shiny stars ever since”.130 The data tell little about Mrs. Tóth: no information is included about her possible real táltos activities, unless reading from the stars qualifies as such. One thing is certain: she was integrated into the everyday relationship network of witchcraft matters in the village; depending on the situation she either emphasised her táltos abilities, or delighted in taking the role of the witch. A common trait with Örzse Tóth is that she faced the authorities with a proud self-awareness and considered the possible destruction of the entire town a potential manifestation of her táltos powers with which she could blackmail the opposing authorities.
Táltos as Healers and Wise Men and Women in the Role of External Witch Identifiers
The two táltos belonging to this group show up in the witch trials of others in the role of ‘external’ witch identifier. (25, 26.) They probably owe their sobriquet and táltos reputation to their successful healing activities. 25. In the 1743 trial of the healer woman Mrs. János Tótika/Thotika, née Katalin Nagy (and two others)131 Mrs. Tótika, who greased and bathed her patients in Decs, spoke of a táltos man who had been called to a sick child from a nearby settlement, Pataj, and who later called Mrs. Tótika a “witchy person, claiming that the child of the witness had been bewitched by her”.132 26. In the 1749 trial against Mrs. István Szabados, née Katalin Németh alias Csonka Puskás and company taking place in Hódmezővásárhely, a witness bewitched by Csonka Puskás explained that



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 261
they had asked for medicine for an illness, but that it had not helped, only making things worse for the patient. They then travelled to Szeged, a nearby city to see a táltos woman who told them that the witness had been bewitched at midnight by the person who gave them herbs. “Nevertheless, the person who cast the bewitchment can heal it, too.”133 These ‘external’ witch identifiers were not individuals specialised in identifying; similar to local anti-witches, they diagnosed bewitchment while they carried out their healing treatment. The only difference was that they were not involved in local witchcraft matters.
Táltos as Money Seers
The common trait in the táltos belonging to this group is that their only or most important táltos activity was seeing money (applying occult means to “see” things buried in the soil), or organising and delegating such activities to others. Three of them were from Debrecen. 27. During the 1702 witch trial of Péter Késcsináló (Kíscsináló) in Debrecen, in which he was held accountable for digging for treasure and confederating with a “charm-ful person”, a person is mentioned who claimed to be “the prince of the táltos” who lured Késcsináló to join the company of treasure diggers.134 The verdict condemning Péter Késcsináló and his six companions is as follows: “all the holes there are around the city that were dug for the purpose of finding money should be filled up by them in three days”. This was probably not a case of authentic táltos activity, but merely a swindler who spread his táltos fame for self-promotion, because, in this age, táltos abilities were associated with money-seeing and at the beginning of the eighteenth century the táltos might still enjoy a positive reputation; although the trial minutes addressed this táltos as a “charmful sorcerer”, that is, practically a witch. 28. Mrs. Mihály Szaniszlai was brought to trial in 1711 in Debrecen;135 the main accusation against her being treasure digging and associated fraud, and “claiming she was a táltos; she also lured many with money-seeing and digging”; she abused her táltos reputation in order to get money for treasure digging: “she made the diggers swear that from the money they dug up they would give some to the táltos as well”. The verdict also reproached her divination methods: “she cast birch [this must be the dowsing rod used for treasure seeing], she predicted fire attacks, wars and bloodshed from the stars; she took the name of God in



262 É. PóCS
vain.” The sentence was relatively light: like the majority of money seers she was only (branded and) exiled from the city.136 Ildikó Kristóf has discussed in detail the case of Mrs. Szaniszlai in her book, as one of the táltos sued in Debrecen. She describes the activities of this poor woman, who mostly spent her days around swine-herds. She showed great interest in public life: during the time of the anti-Austrian fights of Prince Rákóczi she supported, in opposition to the town magistrate, the anti-Austrian Rákóczi case. This was reflected in her prophecies as well,137 which reflected a person responsible for the entire community. For example, from a heavenly sign she predicted the burning down of the Collegium; “she also said: Hatvan Street will burn to the ground, [...] there will be such a great bloodshed in Debrecen that the horses will push the blood with their chests”.138 Her compassion with the poor is also manifested in relation with her profession: “I do not care if you are swine-herds”, she asserted when she was looking for money for them.139 In the judicial context her fame as a táltos was associated with her money-seeing activity. Every witness summoned mentions that she claimed to have táltos powers, and almost all of them referred to various cases of money-seeing in relation to this; for instance, “I have heard that she called herself a táltos, she learned money-seeing in Turkey”.140 It can be suspected that Mrs. Szaniszlai’s sense of responsibility for the fate of her community, and her power over the city, is in connection with or part of her táltos identity. As a witness heard her say:
...God created her to be wise, she is a semi-táltos: should she so wish she had the power to give away money, and if she wanted, no one in Debrecen could pick up that money.141
Mrs. Szaniszlai apparently carried out the search for locations to find money in a versatile manner and at a high level; she gave advice and had other people do the digging. Her witnesses relate numerous cases of digging for treasure; as her usual method most of them mention reading from fingernails that had been spat upon. For many she told where the treasure was buried without being asked, going door to door, stepping into homes unexpectedly to offer her services. There was a rumour spread among the witnesses of Mrs. Szaniszlai that she was often interrupted in her money-seeing by ghosts.142 This belief was part of the folklore of treasure digging until the twentieth century; it must have been known among eighteenth-century money seers



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 263
as well, however, this does not necessarily suggest here “real” spirit battles similar to witch visions. This might also be the case of the motif of “heavenly battles”, which are also mentioned during the trial: the accused asserted, and her witnesses mentioned it as well, that she battled for the “empire”, and that “she has participated in battles three times against German táltos and triumphed”.143 The texts of the trial minutes do not infer that the woman would have participated in real, spiritually experienced táltos battles; there is no reference made to any such táltos activities by her. It does seem, however, and the recurring assumption of several táltos accused confirm this too, that the well-known motif of heavenly battles was known in eighteenth-century Debrecen as a narrative stereotype associated with táltos figures, and this could be combined with various táltos definitions and roles, even as an instrument of publicity. Mrs. Szaniszlai apparently used this motif to boost her role as a táltos “defending the empire” and having public interest in mind. 29. Erzsébet Barna was brought before the Debrecen tribunal in 1745: her táltos abilities, however, seem strongly dubious. Erzsébet Barna was accused of witchcraft as a result of fraud related to moneyseeing and for bewitching a child. Her incidents of healing and bewitchments are also mentioned during her interrogation, but apparently her most important communal role was that of a money seer. Several witnesses knew about her method of working with a steel mirror; she lent her mirror to others, and even taught people seeking her help the tricks and circumstances of money-seeing. She also gave advice on other magical practices, such as catching malefactor witches. Regarding her money-seeing activity, one of the witnesses stated that “it was a common rumour that she was a tátos”,144 a rumour presumably spread solely by her employer, Mrs. István Szatmári (who was at trial for money-seeing during this same time): apparently she had hired the girl as well, as a virgin capable of money-seeing, and advertised her as a táltos. The above incidents suggest that there were quite a few money seers in Debrecen claiming to be táltos; however, by this time their glory had faded completely in the eye of the tribunals. In the case of Erzsébet Barna the court had a negative judgment about both the money-seeing and the táltos aspects (which they identified with money-seeing); in the verdict against her, basically both charges were identified exclusively with witchcraft. In this context her táltos abilities did not interest any of the judges; Erzsébet Barna was exiled from the city for witchcraft and her clients also received three days of incarceration as an “instructive” punishment.



264 É. PóCS
30. The 1748 trial of Demeter Farkas and the related Tiszaszalók investigation discovered that he had hired a 12-year-old girl for moneyseeing whom he referred to as the tátos girl. Farkas traded with wine and horses in the towns and villages on the Hungarian Plane; the trial minutes relate the circumstances of his alleged visions, his participation in treasure digging gangs and especially his lavish lifestyle.145 Farkas, not being a treasure-digging expert, asked the advice of a Moravian seer woman while assembling a group of treasure diggers. The woman gave advice on treasure digging prayers, and on what to.wear during the act (the man has to wear women’s clothing, and the dress has to come from a woman who has only made love with her husband); she also told him to
...get a child who was born from a maiden girl, having no father; he should then smear the child’s thumb nails with white poppy oil (of which she gave a vial to the inquisitor) on a Tuesday or a Friday at around eleven o’clock in the evening, and he will see the hidden treasure.146
He looked for the right child in Kunhegyes and in Kunmadaras, finally “he took the twelve-year-old daughter of István Végh to Abád” and several witnesses saw him caressing and kissing the girl (he denied having slept with her, since the treasure seer child had to be a virgin). One of the witnesses “warned him not to hurt her, because she was a tátos girl”. It is obvious from the context of the trial texts that the girl the swindler horse thief hired was in no regard a táltos. Money-seeing was far from being a practice associated only with the táltos; nonetheless, rumours about táltos money seers and, in general, rumours and beliefs related to the practice of money-seeing such as virginity as a condition must have circulated in the neighborhood of the accused, which then were ‘inherited’ by any táltos who took on money-seeing. 31. Katalin Csala from Tiszaroff was summoned to trial in Tiszaroff, in 1754. She “saw” money, as did táltos women in general; she was sentenced for fraud connected to seeing money and for her táltos activities.147
32. In her 1764 trial in Kalocsa, Mrs. János Jámbor, née Jutka Virág, who according to her files, “claimed to be a táltos to mislead others with treasure digging”, appears as a rather self-conscious fraudulent money seer148: she even admits to her fraud, describing in detail how she tricked her clients. She also admits that she was never once able to find money:



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 265
“I have no special knowledge, I simply deceived them”.149 Finally she was sentenced to death for having tricked money, clothes and bed linen from poor people with her untruthful promises.150 She deceived her clients with colorful lies: for instance in one of her tales there was a táltos who was a soldier injured in battle: “In Buda there is a wounded táltos officer who has to be bathed and put to a good bed”; she asked for “bed pillows” for him, then
...I sent them to a certain place in the mountains, where they could find the wounded táltos soldier, and during the time they were away I took the bed linen and the other clothes. 151
Her own táltos abilities, presumably only invented, are mentioned by a witness who claims to have wanted Mrs. Jámbor to dig up money for her, and who was tricked into paying twenty-five Forints as a prepayment. When after demanding a reimbursement for a long time the witness was only able to get back part of this prepayment, Jutka Virág tried to convince the witness that the money “was in fact given to her by some tátos in a battle”.152 It seems that the concept of the táltos battles was also part of the eighteenth-century public discourse in Kalocsa, and in a similar context that some of the táltos from Debrecen had referred to and adjusted to the contemporary military situation in the country. It was possible to make the godly but gullible believe, as an advertising ploy, that a money-seeing woman had participated in a táltos battle of military magnitude and that one could obtain real injuries in such battles.
Thieves and Swindlers Who Fake Táltos Qualities
In addition to mountebank money seers there are three other kinds of swindlers impersonating as táltos that can be encountered in the trial documents. The three men belonging to this group (33. János Csillám alias János Csanádi or János Tátos,153 34. Mihály Szvetics154 and 35. Aloysius Diós155) and bearing the title of táltos all boasted about their táltos abilities. They called themselves money seers or weather magicians, and through seeing money they tried to profit from their alleged táltos abilities and the general reputation attached to a táltos.

ConCLusion: ansWers to the Questions
What Did Being Táltos Mean for the Táltos and Their Communities?
Some of the táltos of these trials were individuals with a conscious táltos identity who appropriated certain elements of the táltos belief (being born with teeth, fate decided in utero, initiation beliefs, battling adversary spirits, enjoying the patronage of helping spirits). However, there were many more who used the táltos distinction in various other contexts. Apparently there are various motivations in labelling someone a táltos in the communities concerned. When taking into account the local categories independent of the judicial denominations, most of the cases, including when táltos is used as a nickname, apparently have a positive context, which suggests a certain táltos reputation in the regions where the data come from. Negative connotations are only seen in the case of the 1721 trial of András Suppony (22) and in the last case (35), in the words both of the tribunal and the witnesses. The positive reputation of the táltos was used and abused by the accused táltos in their defence before the court; and not only by them, but by some of the fake táltos who tried to cover up the fraud related to treasure digging, or to trick poor people into giving them money, clothes or food, or simply to raise their prestige in the eye of village public opinion, or—as in the case of Erzsébet Tóth (13)—to blackmail adversaries in the city. As regards the judicial use of the táltos denomination, there was a large spectrum of meanings from neutral to ‘diabolical’, ‘witchy’ and ‘untruthful’, according to the judgment of the táltos activity in question. This judgment, however, did not refer to táltos abilities par excellence, that is, that of the ‘shamanistic’ mediator. Their real táltos functions (the heavenly battles with the spirit world, if they did experience such events at all) did not interest the judges. The exception to this seemingly general tendency is the trial of the three táltos from Miskolc (2, 3, 4), ending in 1742, where being a táltos was the actual charge. This, however, appears to be a unique case in a wider historical-geographical context, as is the Miskolc tribunal, which in 1742 qualified táltos abilities not as a diabolical sin, but a “dishonourable” deed. It also has to be considered that when the delinquents or their advocates used táltos abilities as a positive element of defence, in contrast with witchcraft, it did not prove to



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 267
be an effective argument in exonerating the accused. Therefore it can be established that seventeenth- and eighteenth-century táltos were brought to witchcraft tribunals not so much for being táltos, but rather accidentally, for some other act. In other words, as has already been suggested in the introduction, the trial minutes as sources of táltos beliefs and practices are to be interpreted very carefully. What the data clearly outline is that the importance of the táltos was once much greater; nevertheless, it is impossible to determine when exactly before the time of the trials the communal role of the táltos was more significant than the period discussed here. Táltos abilities apparently did enjoy some prestige at this time, at least in the regions from whence the source material originates. Former prestige is most apparent in the cases of Örzse Tóth (13) and Mrs. Tóth (24), who both confidently and arrogantly asserted their powers of bewitchment over the town or village on the basis of their táltos abilities.
What Was the Main Occupation of the Seventeenth- and EighteenthCentury Táltos?
The táltos presented in the trial documents were mostly healers or people contributing in the finding of buried money during wartime, as well as fortune-tellers. There were also among them, however, true táltos, even if only in smaller number. Although in the most various contexts, data can be found concerning special táltos practices, ‘real’ táltos roles and par excellence táltos acts. The scarce data reveal that the essence of the real táltos role (presumed through research and deduced from twentiethcentury data) is engagement in otherworldly battle with adversaries from the spirit world; the existence of the táltos as belief figure is nourished by the association of some of the above-mentioned táltos attributes with the person of the táltos, created either by themselves or their communities. From the perspective of the táltos, the essence was to admit to this táltos role and practice the belief effectively. According to their own statements and their witnesses’ testimonies the ‘real’ táltos of the first group battled in the sky. There is no doubt as regards the táltos mentioned in the 1740–1742 Miskolc trial (2, 3, 4) and Ilona Borsi (5) actually ‘joining battle’; that is, having visions or dreams about such a battle. It is interesting, however, that the real objective of the battle is not revealed. This suggests that even if the spirit battle was a reality it did not involve any significant communal function of public



268 É. PóCS
interest! Erzsébet Tóth (13) was the only one whose alleged battling was in order to ward off the hail brought on by ‘the evil ones’, but she primarily fulfilled the positions of a witch and anti-witch, and protection of the town from hail and earthquake was rather the subject of her boasts and threats than an actual táltos role. Allusion to battling for the empire or against German táltos in two further trials mostly involved táltos as practicing treasure seeing: the cases of Mrs. Bartha, née Erzsébet Balási and Mrs. Mihály Szaniszlai (10, 28) lack any subjective element. It can only be explained by the well-known narrative stereotype in Debrecen actualised to the current political and military situation; it is not very likely that there existed Hungarian táltos practices with such objectives. The battle injuries brought to earth from an alternative existence also comprise a narrative stereotype. In a few cases, however, some of the data do suggest a real subjective táltos experience, namely the exceptional data on falling into trances, especially in the case of the Miskolc trial (2–4), with the motif of water gazing and subsequent transformation into an animal. Without known parallels it is difficult to qualify the transformation into a fox, dove or fish, unique to Hungarian popular beliefs; the state of trance induced by water gazing, however, can be considered as akin to Eastern European procedures of ritual magic related to Christian holidays.156 Based on their external specificities the data about the battles can be linked to twentieth-century narratives and the sorcerer types known from nineteenth- and twentieth-century Balkan folklore. The táltos appearing in the image of bulls in the vision of Ilona Borsi (6, 7) are the closest to the Hungarian táltos known from twentieth-century narratives; that is, battling as light or dark colored bulls, or less often horses, sometimes dogs or boars.157 The unique episodes of helping horses, however, in the context of data suggesting ‘initiation’ associate it with the characteristic data of Hungarian táltos, or possibly the ancient religion. The account of Ilona Borsi’s vision of when she was ‘enraptured’ at the age of seven and her adult companions were “looking for a horse” for her, imply a credible and subjective experience, while being determined to the táltos fate at birth and the motif of being born with teeth seem rather as the persistent survival of narrative stereotypes as opposed to the fading practice. These outline the fragments of various different táltos mythologies in relation to some of the ‘real’ táltos of this study. The unique nature of these mythologies is remarkable. The context of the accounts, because of their realistic aspect, seems to be far from the stereotypical



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 269
twentieth-century narratives of weather battles, or from the nineteenthand twentieth-century folkloristic image of the táltos and the types constructed from the narratives. Although we have spoken of battle types, on the whole it is impossible to establish a táltos type similar to the one known from twentieth-century táltos belief narratives.158 In the texts recalling the activities of the táltos and their confessions about their own táltos identities, one may notice a simultaneous presence of narrative stereotypes and realistic elements recalling an active practice. Evidently, it would be pointless to expect these texts, after having been told, heard and handled by numerous people, to make the exact distinctions of scholarship’s etic categories. These documents do not uncover what the táltos ‘originally’ were like, since a general, abstract and universal category for the táltos does not exist. Certainly, the reason for this is not only that the final, abbreviated versions of the texts are very far from what actually was said in the courtroom more than two hundred and fifty years ago: the discrepancies of the text stem from the unique and loose nature and natural inconsistencies of contemporary emic categories. What can be deduced from all this in terms of the communal role of táltos? Clearly, certain táltos did have vision experience of heavenly battles from time to time, but the fact of the battles, associated beliefs and narrative motifs were more important parts of their role than of the actual communal functions they might have had. While the narratives of táltos battling for better weather conditions might have been well-known in certain communities, it is probable that the trial documents reflected a disappearing practice and roles that had faded due to the spread of ecclesiastical benediction practices. Besides and despite having a European context the totality of these roles and beliefs did have typically Hungarian traits that might be associated with the pre-Christian religious life of the Hungarians. The memory and survival of táltos prestige in this age have been referred to above; however, the available data do not provide answers to the question of the extent to which there has been any active táltos practice in the examined period. Were there ‘real’, active táltos fulfilling the role of public functionaries, and if yes, what were they doing? Or, perhaps, the right answer to this question is the one offered by the trial texts: healing, treasure digging, and fortune telling. The motif of the táltos battling for weather (almost exclusive in twentiethcentury narratives) is included or at least mentioned in the testimonies of six táltos, but the number of actually active weather magician táltos of the age is unknown. The doubts about the alleged weather magician role



270 É. PóCS
of Erzsébet Tóth (13) have already been raised and the weather magician practice of Mihály Szvetics (34) is clearly mere fiction. They do not imply the existence of a significant weather magician táltos practice. If there were any weather magician táltos at all their importance must have been dwarfed next to the ecclesiastical benedictions seeking rain or warding off hailstorms. Certainly, the two said trials preserve the memory of a once more intensive practice, but when this ‘once’ was is unknown. The majority of the accused in the examined trials were healers or seers. The healers were usually women, and so most of the accused witches were women as well. It does not follow, however, that more than 68% of these táltos were female (and that the majority of the remaining 32% male accused were mountebank treasure diggers), although this is what the trials reflect. The statistics are under no circumstance conclusive: the reason for the small number of male witches is that there were barely any male roles that would induce a witchcraft accusation, thus the number of male táltos appearing before a witchcraft tribunal was also very low; they were, nonetheless, able to pursue undisturbed their profession unrelated to witchcraft in the background, in the world outside the courtrooms.
Practical Roles: Healing, Magic and Divination
The healing táltos differ from any other magical specialist with supernatural knowledge (wise men/women, cunning folk, seers, healing-seers, physicians, etc.) active in this period only in name. The attributes universal to wise persons are identical to theirs; these characteristics (related to their birth, initiation, communication with other worlds) are associated with various other cunning folk as belief motifs. Nonetheless, in some of the trials, healing is also considered as a par excellence táltos profession; and other healing women claimed to be táltos without having any special táltos attributes. Ilona Borsi’s healing knowledge, for instance, is closely connected to her táltos abilities, to her vocation predetermined in utero and, according to her trial documents, to her being born with teeth. The question remains: to what extent can these healers be considered ‘real’ táltos?
In light of the trials it seems that the roles of fortune teller, healer, treasure seer, as well as that of witch and anti-witch could have been fulfilled simultaneously and in one person by a táltos: they all required identical supernatural knowledge and presumed or real seeing abilities.



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 271
The significance of star divination among popular specialists is a lesserknown fact. Research regarded it as part of the elite magical practice; yet the star-reading táltos of these trials—with the exception of the Princess consort, Zsuzsanna Lorántffy (14)—were rural specialists offering their services to the village public, nobility and burghers alike.159 The reputation of the Princess consort as star reader could not have been accidental; in Kálmán Thaly’s publication of wartime life-scenes described on the basis of contemporary documents, correspondence and diaries confirm that star divination, this branch of elite magic, must have been an oft-practiced and important divination method in wartime to help make military decisions.160 This fashionable ‘trend’ of the age reached the peasantry and the táltos as well. As seen above, the sole or most important táltos activity of a significant number of táltos was money-seeing (applying occult means to ‘see’ things buried in the soil, or seeing with the help of slobbered fingernails, mirrors or magic twigs), or organising and delegating activities to such end. The treasure diggers of this period usually worked in gangs, or employed hired ‘seers’ to locate the treasure. This is how the treasure diggers appearing in the trials as táltos proceeded. It has to be added that in those times it was not exclusively the táltos who dug for treasure; all kinds of magical specialists practiced this activity regardless of the function they fulfilled within their communities. It was quite common to encounter money seers in the witch trial centuries throughout the entirety of the Hungarian-speaking regions.161 The realistic ratios are, again, unknown: the seeing activities of the táltos and other specialists (besides money-seeing, such as divination and finding lost animals) usually did not become subject to witchcraft accusation; money-seeing also only became a legal matter if it involved fraud or wrongful extortion of money from clients. Despite the ratios being unclear, it seems that treasure digging was the other most frequent táltos activity besides, or often alongside, healing. The táltos identity of several of those who saw themselves as táltos was founded upon their ability to see money. It can be concluded from the data recorded in the eighteenth-century Great Plain region, for instance in Debrecen, that both the alleged or real money-seeing táltos could have enjoyed some sort of public prestige. In several settlements, táltos abilities were identified with money-seeing; even the tribunal identified the two according to certain data. Among the treasure diggers mentioned as táltos in these trials there are many swindlers who pretended



272 É. PóCS
to have treasure seeing or treasure digging abilities with the single aim of defrauding the client. On the other hand, these swindlers were not táltos, but chisellers who tried to create a táltos reputation in order to cover their cheating, which they either did by alluding to popular stereotypes of táltos attributes (such as being born with teeth, fighting heavenly battles against the Turks or the Germans), or by inventing colorful ‘táltos tales’. Specialists finding buried money and treasures were commissioned by members of the nobility or by burghers; apparently in this age everyone believed in the abilities and divination methods of money seers. They worked independently or by hiring diggers or employing seer girls based on the belief that virginity was a prerequisite for carrying out certain divination methods effectively (this belief was known throughout Europe in connection with treasure digging; modern age sources confirm that ‘virgin’ children were primarily employed for the divination rituals of water gazing162). As mentioned above, there are data confirming cases of women already well of age who did not take on money-seeing because they were wives. In addition there are the beliefs about the ‘seventh child’, also known around Europe, namely that such seventhborn children see, it was said, treasure in the oil or saliva smeared on their fingernails. The ‘real’ treasure seer táltos on the Hungarian Great Plain, according to data, worked with steel mirrors (one source mentions a magic stick), but they also applied the technique of fingernail gazing or of smearing poppy oil on their eyelids. Some of the trial data refer to money-seeing táltos dynasties where the magic mirror is inherited within the family; in other cases girls learn techniques from experienced seer women. The Western and Central European picture (equally taking the protocols and documents of witch hunts as the primary sources of description163) is similar: money-seeing was an important activity in the public life of contemporary cunning folk, seers and healing specialists usually carrying it out in groups led by a specialist claiming to be a creditable seer, or in other cases, similar to the swindler gangs in Hungary, as ventures of adventurers and swindlers. Besides the decrease in the importance of weather magic, the increase in the number of money seers seems probable in Hungary as well. In the absence of knowledge of contemporary documents, it is unclear what the situation in the Balkan region was, where rural weather magic was still an active practice in many places at the beginning of the twentieth century. The question is whether the magicians akin to the Hungarian táltos also or primarily



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 273
pursued this activity. From a Hungarian perspective the task is to know how long and to what extent treasure digging was a ‘genuine’ táltos activity, does it qualify as an attribute shared by the seers, healers and diviners of half of Europe in this age that also constitutes the basic component of Hungarian táltos characteristics. Clearly, in the seventeenth century the táltos term was extended as an umbrella term to describe various sorcerers having occult abilities; there were indeed ‘European’type seers in Hungary as well who were called táltos and who dug for treasure in accordance with general European trends. The ‘former’ Hungarian táltos (presumably carrying out weather magic) grew into the European tradition of money-seeing (with virgin children, and techniques such as mirror gazing, fingernail gazing, and water gazing). However, a specifically Hungarian táltos could also have fulfilled the role of treasure digger as an alternative implementation of a similar spirited practice. Twentieth-century belief data preserve the memory of certain specialists functioning as ‘dual táltos’ who, as battling táltos, equally performed treasure seeing over the course of which they battled dragons or other animal spirits from the underworld for treasure.164
Bewitchment, Identifying the Witch
The táltos and any other specialists possessing psychic abilities, such as wise men, seers, fortune-tellers, and so forth, inevitably pursued activities of identifying bewitchment or the witches responsible for it, which supposedly required similar occult abilities as their other activities. In the trial documents a number of such táltos can be found. For instance, Ilona Borsi (5) who “recognized witches”, or Annók Fejér (21) who was a conscious and effective adversary of witches. However, these persons, along with the individuals qualified as ‘external’ witch identifiers (25, 26) were, as a matter of fact, healers; and as such, they were part of the social network of witchcraft. In other words, there were no specialised witch identifiers in Hungary, not even at the level of the village community. If there was any need at all to identify the bewitcher or the bewitchment, it either happened with ‘home-made’ witch identifying techniques not discussed in this paper,165 or during the healing process. Thus, the logical assumption of the táltos, due to their occult abilities, inevitably finding themselves in the role of witch identifiers166 is seen from a somewhat different perspective in light of the comprehensive knowledge of all the relevant táltos data: the táltos could inevitably find themselves in any



274 É. PóCS
position within the system of witchcraft: in that of healer, bewitcher and also witch identifier. It must however be acknowledged that in their case it was the role of the witch identifier that was the most accentuated.
Witches and Anti-Witches
It transpired that many among the táltos presented here, being healers easily accused of bewitchment, were also witches or at least anti-witches, a role not merely assigned to them on the basis of judicial charges. The magical or religious specialists possessing and practicing healing, seeing, fortune-telling and maleficium-identifying abilities, namely the wise men and women or healing-seers, were inevitably viewed or regarded as witches in certain local situations of village witchcraft accusations. If Mrs. András Bartha (10), Anna Belényesi (16), Erzsébet Tóth (13), András Suppony (22) and others carried out complex healing-bewitching and bewitchment identifying activities within the network of the institution of witchcraft, then besides perhaps being equally táltos, they are typical representatives of the ambivalent healing profession seen as witchcraft, possessing every feature of this role: they heal, they identify the bewitcher, their treatments are considered as bewitchment by others within a neighborly or family conflict, and, as part of this same system, they can be accused of bewitchment, even be the person who actually casts the maleficium. The target of bewitchment could be a neighbor, relative, rival healer or midwife who had become an enemy in a local conflict, or anyone else with whom the accused had quarrelled. As seen in the above examples, sometimes an active and tenacious healer such as Erzsébet Tóth, the táltos from Jászberény, could have entered conflict with the entire township. There might be several reasons for which the Hungarian táltos were integrated in such a seemingly natural manner into the local social networks and scope of activities related to witchcraft. The táltos, like any profession involving magic, plays an equally ambivalent role as that of a healer and malefactor witch, in which power might equally be wielded to do both good and bad. Several of the women mentioned here can be suspected of having lived their táltos identity in the dual role of healing and malefactor witch. The files of Erzsébet Tóth’s (13) trial give the most reason to conclude that the táltos and witchcraft were closely related in this region at this time, given the ambivalence and the



SHAMANISM OR WITCHCRAFT? THE TÁLTOS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS 275
simultaneously positive and negative aspects of both conceptual and ritual systems. Although no supportive data exist, it can be presumed that this ambivalence is the inherent feature of the Hungarian táltos in terms of the characteristic own-alien opposition: every táltos myth recorded in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is about own-alien battles! Fighting against alien spirits is a negative manifestation (or in the context of witchcraft, bewitchment) that can easily shift towards an internal enemy at the change of a social situation.
Shamanism or Witchcraft?
The táltos, with their belief attributes, mythical features, and as social beings with the assigned or real powers of an ambivalent sorcerer or seer, were able to integrate well and to take the role either of witch or antiwitch. A closer look at the issue shows that the ambivalence of the two conceptual frameworks is not the only aspect common to the táltos and witchcraft. There is also a belief compound that the two systems share: the spirit battles. For Mrs. András Bartha, Erzsébet Tóth and Mrs. István Szatmári, for instance, participation in spirit battles was an explicit representation of ‘their witchcraft’. Since the concept of spirit battles was an equally indispensable element of táltos ideology, the táltos were able to cope both with ‘daytime’ real conflicts and ‘night-time’ spirit battles—if the chronological interpretation is relevant at all. Hungarian research has interpreted the data on these battles as specific manifestations of the battling táltos; however, these are clearly to be treated rather as manifestations of demonic, ‘night witchcraft’: both the malefactor witches and the healers step onto the shared spirit battlefield of a night-time ‘otherworld’ through their demonic doubles. They ‘know about’ one another’s bewitchments and healings, and they are able to assist or encumber one another in this dimension. There have even been examples of helpers participating in these battles, often the (spirits of) relatives alluded to as táltos. However, these are not táltos: in this context they are the helping spirits of the night witch. Data from witch trials and sources of contemporary folklore include incidents of similar battles in dreams, trance experience, the imaginings or narratives of other healers, seers, and cunning folk; apparently, these dream-world battles often took place parallel to real-life rivalries between witches and



276 É. PóCS
healers, or two sorcerers or healers, simultaneously with the ‘earthly’ battle for the life or death of the patient. The forms of supernatural communication attributed to witches or, supposedly, to táltos share at least one common motif: the battles against adversary spirits imagined or experienced in trance or dream, ensuing from their ambivalent profession, even when the aim and means of the communication and the ‘otherworlds’ of the witches and the táltos are completely different. Systems of seers/sorcerers similar to that of the táltos could enter contact with witchcraft everywhere where witches were believed to be belief figures having a night-time spirit double. It remains an unanswered question, yet one worth asking, when all this evolved in a Hungarian perspective. Were the táltos originally part of the witchcraft framework, or were they included later on when their ‘original’ táltos character had lost its relevance? The common traits that have been outlined here might have provided a transition between the two systems, however, whenever and wherever the eventual integration took place: possibly it signalled it the táltos ridding themselves of their supposed ‘genuine’ attributes, maybe, by keeping them, resulting in the parallel existence of táltos and witches. To conclude, if the belief and ritual system of the táltos must be defined as shamanism, and the mediatory practice associated with their figure qualified conditionally as ‘shamanistic’, I can only confirm what I have already outlined in a previous book of mine written 20 years ago: in eighteenth-century Hungarian beliefs and ritual practices witchcraft and shamanism did not appear as each other’s antitheses, but as components of the same system. And what happened ‘before that’? As I wrote then: “We cannot be sure, but we presume that there were shamanistic kinds of magicians who originally had nothing to do with witchcraft. Perhaps the Hungarian táltos of the middle ages was one such, and the “holy” seers and healers, along with fairy magicians, may also belong here ...”167 There is not much more that can be said about this, not even in light of a much more comprehensive amount of available data; nonetheless, the extended demonstrative material and more detailed analysis of this present study has, perhaps, made my line of arguments more nuanced and more convincing.

I have discussed this issue in detail in connection with the relationship between fairies and witches; in my study I presented the fairies as parts of a system explaining calamity that is more archaic than witchcraft, or has more ancient roots, I also mentioned the fairy-witch paradigm shift and the related ‘humanisation’ of demonic fairy witches: Éva Pócs, Fairies and Witches at the Boundary of South-Eastern and Central Europe (Helsinki: Academia Scientiarum Fennica, 1989).

29. From the 1693 Debrecen trial of Mrs. Ignác Villás, Komáromy, Magyarországi boszorkányperek, 166. This and any further citation of trial documents were originally written in an archaic Hungarian from which it is impossible to give an authentic translation; the main objective therefore was to transmit the content of these excerpts. (The translator). 30. The relevant data presumably came about as a result of interrogation under torture, or other instruments of the tribunal used to extort or modify confessions. There are only a few such cases in the Hungarian trial documents that we know of: Pócs, Between the Living, 121–162. 31. On such communication of the victims with the night witch see: Gábor Klaniczay, ‘Le sabbat raconté par les témoins des procès de sorcellerie en Hongrie’, in Nicole Jacques-Chaquin and Maxime Préaud (eds), Le sabbat des sorciers XVe-XVIIIe siècles (Grenoble: Jérôme Millon, 1993), 227–346; Pócs, Between the Living, Chap. 3; ead., ‘Álommedicina’. 32.

There is a myriad of studies on the topic of the impact of judicial demonology with Hungarian reference; since the introduction by Andor Komáromy (Magyarországi boszorkányperek) basically every researcher processing the minutes and using the data of witch trials could be mentioned. From these, here I refer solely to the famous example of the benandanti (Ginzburg, The Night Battles) and the studies written by Gábor Klaniczay and myself about the witches’ Sabbath: Klaniczay, ‘Le sabbat raconté’; id., ‘The Process of Trance, Heavenly and Diabolic Apparitions in Johannes Nider’s Formicarius’, in Nancy van Deusen (ed.), Procession, Performance, Liturgy, and Ritual (Ottawa: Claremont Cultural Studies, 2007), 203–258; Pócs, Between the Living, Chap. 5. 40.

the deCriminaLization of magiCaL aCtivities
There are two—seemingly paradoxical—questions one should ask with relation to the late witch trials. One is why they ended, while the other is why people continued to be accused of witchcraft in courts during and after the reign of Maria Theresa.1 The question of why the trials ended has been explored by Gábor Klaniczay in several of his studies reviewing the intellectual history of the issue. Here we only refer briefly to his results, where he extensively outlines the changes in perception concerning the Viennese Court’s attitude towards magic, witch-hunting and vampire beliefs, together with the presentation of Eastern European parallels.2 We will discuss the question of why the trials continued at the end of the chapter dealing with decriminalization. Gábor Klaniczay’s work describes several aspects of the change in attitude of the Viennese Court in terms of intellectual history. Among the

reasons he mentions is the international reception of Serbian, Moravian, Polish and Romanian vampire stories, inciting an all-European scandal, which shed an unfavorable light on the Habsburg Empire. (Klaniczay introduced the Hungarian and Transylvanian medical literature related to the data on Serbian and Romanian vampire and witchcraft beliefs and the reception of vampire belief-related discussions in Hungary and Transylvania.) Gábor Klaniczay was looking for, and found, connections between the North Italian Illuminati’s discussions about the reality of the Witches’ Sabbath and the paradigm shift of the Viennese Court. His work highlights the novelty of the ideas of Lodovico Antonio Muratori, who—instead of using the occult, mystic and spiritist explanations of the ‘power of human imagination’—placed the issue on a rational-psychological level. It also outlines the effect on the public sphere of the works in historiography and in philosophy of religion, which aimed to unveil and rationally describe the ‘magic cults’. The greatest influence on the Court, according to him, was Gerard van Swieten, whose two memoranda concerning the Moravian vampire beliefs and the Croatian witches caused Maria Theresa to moderate witch-hunts. In the framework of this present study we are going to add to this background several comments from the perspective of legal history, while essentially agreeing with Gábor Klaniczay’s assumptions, namely that the Court was influenced, if not by humanitarian goals, at least by a piety—motivated by economic factors—towards its subjects; moreover, that the restrictive influences came to Hungary and Transylvania from ‘above’ and from ‘the West’.3 There are several ways to examine the decriminalization of witchcraft and sorcery accusations and the exclusion of these accusations from court on the territories of the Kingdom of Hungary, depending upon the method we choose for the purpose of following the course of this process. On the one hand, we can choose the perspective of the history of events to map the power mechanisms, while on the other hand, we can use statistical analyses to capture the nature of judicial measures. Thirdly, we could choose the method of content analysis, through which we can examine the ‘criminal’ activities, social roles, and undesirable behavior of those indicted in the texts of the verdicts. In what follows I will discuss the period marking the end of the witchhunt era, choosing the above mentioned three methods and dividing the years into groups: 1740–1755, the active witch-hunting period; the years 1756–1768 when the hunt was sanctioned and regulated; and the decade at the end of Maria Theresa’s reign from 1769 to 1780. There

is furthermore, the 1780–1790 decade of Joseph II’s controversial legal reform, and the period between 1790 and 1848, which continued to enforce feudal law. This latter period is of special interest to us because of the rupture with Joseph II’s ideas and the reestablishment of the former state of criminal law. Basically what we are examining is the change of perception related to witch-hunting within two larger administrative units, separating the legal practices of the Kingdom of Hungary and those of the Transylvanian Principality.4
the LegaL environment and the venues of
CriminaL justiCe
In Hungary and in Transylvania criminal law—especially concerning the judgment of magical activities—was not a uniform system: its organization was based on customary law. Customary law was evidently adapted to norms and normative texts. One such normative text in Hungary was the Praxis Criminalis,5 associated with the name of Benedikt Carpzov, but introduced by the archbishop of Esztergom, Leopold Kollonitsch. The Tripartitum6 was a Transylvanian text, compiled by István Werbőczi. In Hungary we find references to the use of the Praxis Criminalis in the witchcraft and sorcery trials up until 1765. That was approximately until the Constitutio Criminalis Theresiana, which was completed in 1768 and came into force in 1770. Nonetheless, the principles of the Praxis Criminalis continued to be the cornerstone of domestic legal practice for some time. In the middle of the eighteenth century none of the Hungarian legal authors was capable of progressing further in their work when discussing criminal law than the need to surpass both earlier and more recent systems of customary law. Neither István Huszty, the author of the first significant summary of criminal law in the ‘third book’ of his Jurisprudentia practica (there were several editions between 1745 and 1795); nor Mátyás Bodó, who in 1751 published Jurisprudentia criminalis, the most extensive and detailed textbook of his age, accomplished the modernization of customary law. They were satisfied with the practical systemization of the principles of the Praxis Criminalis. As a result, until 1848 even the legal authors of the nineteenth century referred to the works of Huszty and Bodó—and hence indirectly the Praxis Criminalis—when discussing the criteria for crime, forms of magic and divination, and we have examples of the use of the Tripartitum in criminal cases and other legal proceedings up until that date.



294 P. TóTH G.
The framework of criminal law and related procedural law—in Transylvania and Hungary alike—were determined by the royal decrees still in effect in the eighteenth century (the laws of Saint Stephen, Saint Ladislaus and King Coloman)7; in Transylvania it was the regulations of the Transylvanian princes approved by Maria Theresa (Approbatae)8 and the sections of law of the general assemblies of the Estates.9 This was complemented by the statutes of the local administration. However, the categories of criminal law applied in customary law were not precisely defined in any of the legal regulations, and their codified legal basis was also quite ambiguous. The Praxis Criminalis and the Tripartitum were not a ‘recognized’ collection of legal code. As far as categorization went, the magical activities were considered by the laws of the general assembly and the local legislation as ‘murder’ or public malfeasance. The punishment of these manifest felons, including blasphemers and perpetrators of the crimes of witchcraft and sorcery, just like the punishment of those who sinned against God was in every case death; and this applied to all privileged legal instances (holding a blood court). In juridical practice it was a commonly accepted view that the judges had wide discretion; and they were entitled to apply punishments other than those defined by the law; moreover, based on customary law, they had the right to establish as crimes activities ambiguously defined by the law. This is what happened to the judicial evaluation of magical activities, which could only be defined by the individual and casual decrees issued by the monarchs. This legal vagueness was a determining element of criminal justice until 1787. It was not only at the normative level that criminal law was uneven: the system of legal authorities was just as diverse. In Hungary and in Transylvania several courts were licensed to judge magical activities. These authorities were divided both vertically and horizontally. Jurisdiction was in the hands of the Estates. The system of jurisdiction defined by the forums of the Estates was developed by the administrative measures (1723) of Charles III (Charles VI, the Roman Emperor), and was operational until the reforms of Joseph II (1787). The legal uncertainty of feudal criminal law and the wide judicial discretion were irreconcilable with the ideas of the absolute monarchs, or with enlightened thought, which is why Joseph II saw the need to confine judicial arbitrariness.10 It was an Italian lawyer, Cesare Beccaria, who in 1764 in his work on crimes and punishments (Dei delitti e delle pene) first made mention that a judge could only assign punishments that are determined by law (nulla poena sine lege).11 In addition, the principle appeared stating



THE DECRIMINALIZATION OF MAGIC ... 295
that only crimes defined by the law can be punished (nullum crimen sine lege). The last witch trial in Transylvania was annulled with reference to this principle in 1791.12 As a matter of fact, the modern principles of criminal law were developed based on Beccaria’s book; first codified in Austria (1787), France (1791), and in Bavaria (1813). The Josephinist system applied in Hungary and in Transylvania, however, was in force for only 4 years, until 1790. With the reign of Leopold II the legal institutions were once again seized by the Estates; although they did not return to the earlier ‘hard’ principles of criminal law.13 At the lower end of the judicial system’s hierarchy under feudal authorities were the disciplinary courts of (1) privileged market towns and (2) Church authorities. At mid-level there were the (3) manorial courts exercising seigneurial jurisdiction,14 the (4) noble counties (Comitatsgericht/Hungary—Kreisgericht/Transylvania), the (5) privileged territories, and the courts of (6) free royal cities and mining towns.15 In every one of these courts there had been criminal proceedings related to magical activities; practically all criminal proceedings were handled in these courts. The jurisdictions of the forums of the Estates were equivalent, but their supervisory systems were fundamentally different. The counties were supervised by the nobility (nobiles), the cities by the community of citizens (cives), and the districts were supervised by the community of freemen with collective and territorial privileges (the Jazygians, Cumans, Székelys, Hajdus). The manorial court, however, was under the sole supervision of the lord. Naturally, judicial authority was represented by an establishment of officials at every forum. In some cases the prosecution of magical activities took place in other, lower level courts, although in these cases instead of ‘criminal proceedings’ the proper term would be ‘disciplinary proceedings’. As these lower level courts did not have the authority of a blood court like the other legal forums of the Estates, they were not licensed to give death sentences. All authorities of the Estates were controlled by the monarch, although not in the same way. In Transylvania it was through the Government (Gubernium), while in Hungary it was through the Royal Council of Governors (Consilium Regium Locumtenentiale Hungaricum) that all the counties, cities and districts had to send the abstracts of the cases tried at their courts to the said authorities. With this measure the state authority not only supervised the jurisdiction of the legal authorities, but also unified the legal proceedings; they obligated the courts to abide by the law, and terminated



296 P. TóTH G.
arbitrariness—over-harsh judgments and too easy-going demeanours alike. The activities of the manorial courts were still not controlled by this; at most they could oblige the counties concerned to report on the cases in the manorial courts.16 In criminal proceedings the accusations were made by the prosecution, hence making it a public prosecution. Less frequently it occurred that criminal proceedings were initiated through private prosecution or acted on the accusations of the local church (Calvinist, Lutheran, Roman Catholic, Eastern Catholic‘Uniate’—Church). In the beginning these privately initiated prosecutions were tried in lower level courts; they were only brought to a higher forum if it was considered in the course of the criminal proceedings that there was sufficient foundation for a motion for public prosecution. In the period examined (1740–1848) we know of 891 criminal proceedings of people accused of magical activity and witchcraft. Besides the criminal proceedings we also find ordinary civil procedures where witchcraft accusations were resorted to, usually because of the violation of the norms of cohabitation and the unresolved conflicts within the families involved. Such civil proceedings included on the one hand the Calvinist and Lutheran divorce cases, and in case of the Catholics the annulment pronounced for ‘objective’ obstacles to a marriage, which could have recourse to witchcraft accusations in the ecclesiastical courts. On the other hand, there were the slander and libel cases tried in the courts of the market towns and in county courts. In the period we studied we found 114 civil suits involving witchcraft accusations; among which five divorce cases are from the period 1745–1765, while 87 slander and libel cases are from the period 1740–1818. In what follows—for the purpose of following through the process of decriminalization—we exclusively deal with the criminal proceedings (Tables 1 and 2). The measures to put an end to indictments for witchcraft and sorcery (also known as ‘magical activities’)—that is decriminalization; the regulation of social communication concerning the mechanisms stimulating persecution, the accounts of bewitchment, and the visions of the witches’ Sabbath—in short the fight against ‘superstitions’; and finally the state administration’s condemnation of the magical practices and healing as quackery—that is medicalization, occurred in parallel. In what follows we will examine these measures and their social reception (initial rejection, compromise solutions, efforts to build consensus, supportive attitude towards the measures).

On the advice of Gerard van Swieten (1700–1772), Maria Theresa started to issue royal decrees to eliminate the witch-hunt in a trickledown manner in the 1750s. First she took steps to moderate the witchhunt in Croatia in 1751–175217; then she put a handle on the vampire

panic in Moravia in 1755.18 In Hungary it was on 26th January 1756 that in a rescript to the Royal Council of Governors the queen ordered all counties and cities with jurisdictional authority to actuate and conduct sorcery and witch trials according to existing laws and customsthey could even adjudicate—but if the verdict was death or torture, they could not execute the judgment before having submitted all the related documents to the Royal Council of Governors for approval.19 The Hungarian Royal Council of Governors20—and also the Croatian Sabor21— forwarded the rescripts to the counties and the cities on 26th March, 1756. From this date on, even if witch-hunting did not stop immediately, and if sporadically death sentences were given out, the situation in this matter fundamentally changed. In Transylvania—due to the different criminal justice system and partly different administration—the decree was never delivered. The Queen’s decree had no effect whatsoever on the judicial practices in the period between January and December 1756. Until May 1756 we have evidence of ten people being executed, and a further fourteen were tortured in different courts. Until the beginning of December 1756 nobody was acquitted; moreover, in January, besides the ongoing cases, twenty new proceedings were initiated. In 1756 the only person acquitted as a result of the queen’s decree was the widow of Mihály Bombi, Katalin Benyei, who was finally released from the court of Zemplén county after having been incarcerated for 18 months. Meanwhile the legal authorities started to write letters of protest to Vienna, because certain counties felt their jurisdictional rights diminished with this decree.22 The queen learned about the concerns of the legal authorities from a letter of the Royal Council of Governors dated 19th October, 1756.23 Thus, the impact of the back-and-forth of rescripts between the queen and the Royal Council only manifested from the beginning of 1757. The grim and merciless statistics of the previous years started to brighten from the years 1757/1758. In 1757 there were thirteen, and between 1758 and 1768 another 26 people acquitted with pardons. And not only did the ongoing trials end in acquittal; the number of new proceedings decreased as well. Torture and ordeal by water—which was a necessary proof—were still imposed on some victims, and even burning at stake was envisaged: the execution of all this, however, was—apparently in every case—delayed. After the appeal to the Royal Council of Governors, most cases ended with a lighter corporal punishment (6, 12, 24, 30 lashes of the whip), expulsion, administering a warrant or a letter



THE DECRIMINALIZATION OF MAGIC ... 299
of surety, converting to Catholicism or all charges simply being dropped and the accused released. The ongoing cases of 1757/1758 demonstrate that the experts within the Royal Council of Governors dealt with many of the accused individually. This process was helped by further rescripts by the Queen to the legal authorities (June 9 and July 12 of 1758).24 In these she ordered the following measures: if accusations of magical activities occurred, no one should be subjected to torture; besides transporting the accused to Vienna, all the documents of the case should be submitted for appeal, so that there they could ‘correct’ the errors of the local authorities and of the common people. In connection with these proceedings, this time not only the noble officials of the counties, but also ‘all the judges of the country’ protested against the ‘offensive and degrading’ passages of the decree.25 In Transylvania—differently from Hungary—it was only the Queen’s decree in 1768 that initiated the termination of witch-hunts. Lex caesaro-regia ad extirpandam superstitionem ac rationalem judicationem criminalem Magie, Sortilegii was issued on 5th November 1766,26 and codified in the Constitutio Criminalis Theresiana at the beginning of 1768. In Transylvania, as an antecedent of the events, we can mention an edict from the Gubernium from 26th August 1766 dealing with criminal proceedings for the practice of magic (witchcraft, sorcery); the rescript of the edict made in the Viennese Court had arrived at Nagyszeben (Sibiu, Hermannstadt) by 7th August.27 In this it was ordained that there be an appeal with all documents before executing a judgment or applying any form of torture, and only for assessment. Shortly after this, the Gubernium sent in a new edict dated 6th November 1766 as an annex, the Latin translation of the proceedings concerning the judgment of magical activities already being in effect in the German hereditary provinces with the legal authorities. The Gubernium emphasized the importance of adapting the practices of the legal authorities in the named proceedings to the laws and the decrees of the Principality. This ‘adaptation’ had already begun by 13th November, 1766, as the establishment of the Gubernium meeting in Marosvásárhely (Târgu Mureș) treated the issue individually.28 The last decree restricting witch-hunts in Transylvania dates from 28th March, 1768, concurrently with the Hungarian decree. In this decree, the Gubernium—as did the Royal Council of Governors in Hungary—ordered the legal authorities to appeal for supervision (i.e.: not assessment) with every lawsuit involving



300 P. TóTH G.
witchcraft accusations. The Constitutio Ciminalis Theresiana codifying these laws was issued at the beginning of 1768, and came into force in January 1770.29
the diverse forms and the Changing nature
of judgments
Despite the principles of ‘good intentions’ and humanitarian values, it was the routine based on customary law that prevailed in practice. In the examined period—despite the regulations restricting persecution—we encounter a wide spectrum of punishments inflicted on magical activities (as well) by the legal authorities. This is partly due to the vague definition of magical activities in terms of criminal law. In Hungary, before 1768—primarily according to the Praxis Criminalis (section LX)—there were three categories of magical activities.30
1. If the delinquent gave himself/herself to the Devil, if he/she corporally united with him, intentionally forming an alliance with him, then he/she deserved death by fire. This legal category was covered by witchcraft accusations; the ability to do harmful magic; damaging crops, livestock or other people in public; confessing to an alliance with the Devil. 2. If ‘only’ sorcery—that is divination, superstitious healing and sorcery—could be proved, then the sentence could be beheading. The severity of the crime could be mitigated by ‘compelling circumstances’, such as if the accused showed sincere remorse or if the damage was not significant. 3. If the social weight of the actions of the fortune-teller or sorcerer, looked upon as a ‘mistaken visionary’, was meagre, then the court could settle for hard or severe corporal punishment, or exile from the province.
In Hungary as well as in Transylvania, after 1768 the categories of magical activities changed according to the regulations established by Maria Theresa between 1753 and 1768; in Transylvania they became even more concrete. The new legal categories divided magic-related cases into four categories31:



THE DECRIMINALIZATION OF MAGIC ... 301
1. They distinguished between those witchcraft conflicts resulting from ‘deluded’ imagination and those from fraud. The term ‘deluded’ used in this category alludes to the improper procedure of earlier trials, and aimed to restrain the proliferation of witchcraft accusations as a chain reaction. In these cases they ordered the compensation of financial damages resulting from accusations or from the fraud. 2. A new category assembled the cases derived from ‘melancholy’, ‘confusion of mind’ and ‘insanity’—in short: ‘disease’. This category already existed in legal practice as the criteria for sanity; in this context, however, in that it insinuated that witchcraft was nothing but madness, it has to be considered as a new element. The solution was hospital treatment.
3. Another category still considered it a criminal offence if the offender intentionally and consciously sought an alliance with the devil, even if he/she did not take it seriously, or if the intentions of conjuration did not succeed. The punishment for the blasphemous crimes of this category was severe; either corporal punishment or even burning at the stake was to be expected. 4. Furthermore, the regulations recognized that some magical activities and sorceries had ‘unimpeachable evidence’ of having been committed. In these cases the right to judge was taken by the monarch; the court was no longer entitled to proceed in the cases. In practice this meant that on a ‘maybe, but not certain’ basis it may have been possible to continue holding trials for witchcraft and sorcery.
Even after 1784, one could find magical activities categorized as criminal acts. During the reign of Joseph II, the Hungarian legal authorities were obligated to list all those who practiced healing, but ‘did not fit into’ the institutional system of public healthcare. It was in 1784 that they pronounced in a decree the rooting out and punishment of crooks, vagabond apothecaries, old women, wandering magicians, and quack doctors who endangered the health of others. Most of them were either fined or banned from practice.32 Let us, however, return to the study of legal practices, and see how people prosecuted for magical activities before 1768 were treated, and how on the part of the legal authorities this treatment changed after 1768.



302 P. TóTH G.
The most important phase in the criminal proceedings was to obtain proof, which was often achieved by using excruciating interrogation methods: torture (tortura). Torture was used as a routine interrogation method in cases of magical activity throughout Hungary and Transylvania during the period 1740–1768. In Transylvania on average 7 people were tortured each year between 1740 and 1755. In the period 1756–1768 this number shrank to one person. In Hungary this number was 9–10 people per year between 1740 and 1755; in the period 1756–1768 it was 3–4 people, although torture was also used to prove the magical activities of Mrs. András Kovács in Zala county in 1773,33 and of Mrs. Mihály Dúl at the manorial court of the chapter of Eger in 1781.34 The last time the legal authorities used torture in Transylvania was in 1766 in Udvarhelyszék, on Mrs. Mihály Kádár from Zetelaka; her case was overridden at the Gubernium.35 Torture was not an exclusive specificity of witch trials, since it was used as an interrogation method in other criminal proceedings as well (hiding treasure, counterfeiting, theft, robbery, banditry, murder, infanticide). In terms of quality, the torture was not unified; they used it in different legal contexts in Hungary than in Transylvania. In Hungary it was the Praxis Criminalis, in Transylvania it was the Tripartitum and the decrees by the Principality (Approbatae 3/47) that regulated the use of torture. The Praxis Criminalis distinguished six grades of torture if there were no grounds for refusal (underage, pregnant) or other mitigating factors (old age, physical weakness). The practice, however, was somewhat different. In the cases where we know the grade of torture assigned, they inflicted grades 3–4–5–6–7, or an intermediary sentence including additional grades. The examiners frequently assigned three grades (one less than the four grades of the Praxis Criminalis); but they also often gave seven grades of torture (one grade more than the usual six grades of the Praxis Criminalis); in some cases they even inflicted an aggravating eighth or higher grade. These most atrocious intermediary sentences were given out at the manorial court of Hódmezővásárhely and Csongrád by the Károlyi family, and in Szabolcs county, but only until 1758. After 1758 we can only encounter light torture in witch trials. One of the ‘peculiar’ forms of torture and of evidentiary proceedings was the ordeal by water, which was only linked to witch trials. Ordeal by water was most common in the legal practices of the Transylvanian Principality, although we know about cases from Hungary as well. In the Kingdom of Hungary we only find river ordeals in the city of Nagybánya

(Baia Mare, Frauenbach), and in the privileged ‘jászkun’ (As-Cumanian) market towns, in Kecskemét and Kiskunhalas, and only in Calvinistic communities and only in the period 1740–1746. In Transylvania, on the other hand, we found 29 people between 1740 and 1755, and 11 in the period 1756–1768 who were put through this ordeal; we even encountered a case from as late as 1791/1792 in Aranyosszék, where use of this method was being contemplated.36 In Transylvania the procedure was usually applied in the privileged territories, especially in Marosszék, and in the free royal cities inhabited by Hungarian Calvinists, such as Marosvásárhely and Dés (Dej, Deesch).37 In the Lutheran majority Saxon cities and in the cities of mixed religion torture was no longer used at this time.38 The disappearance of the method from customary law and criminal proceedings is related to the decriminalization of witchcraft and sorcery. After 1768 practically none of the legal authorities applied this method. The disappearance of the procedure might be also due to the fact that since the water ordeal was mainly applied by those legal authorities enjoying collective privileges (Székely seats, Lutheran cities), rather than by counties, when the central authorities regulated the judicial licenses it was the special procedures like the water ordeal that they cancelled first, thus limiting the self-governance of these privileged communities. Before 1768, both in Transylvania and in Hungary, the punishment for the most severe form of magical activities was usually death. The last mass burning at the stake resulted from a complex witch trial that started in July 1755 and ended in February 1756 at the country home of Count Königsegg in Borosjenő, Arad county. The accusations were unleashed when Kata Pásztori, after having endured a Grade 5 torture in the summer of 1755, accused several dozens of other women. Proceedings started against 13 persons and the officials of the manorial court and of the county gathered incriminating information about a further eighteen women. The charges were witchcraft, sorcery, devilry and ‘sodomite heresy’. This last referred to the homoerotic orgy of the Witches’ Sabbath where the women had supposedly copulated with Satan on several occasions. All of the accused women were Calvinists, just like the community of the accusers.39 This trial—considering the severity and size of the sentences—must have contributed to the issuing of the Queen’s 1756 decree. In Hungary, the last person executed was the widow of Mihály Deák, Sára Berkeszi, who was sentenced, beheaded and publicly incinerated at the stake by the city of Nagybánya in February 1762.40 In Transylvania, the last fatal victim of the hunt was Mária Toma from Gerendkeresztúr

(Grindeni), who was sentenced by the county of Torda to severe torture, the water ordeal, and then eventually burned at the stake in June 1765.41 Nevertheless, this was not the last time that—for breaking the law of God, which is ideologically related to magical activities—someone was sentenced to perish at the stake. Even during the reign of Joseph II the stakes were lit from time to time to punish the blasphemous. In 1782, Antal Csányi from Kenese was sentenced at the court of Veszprém to have his tongue ripped out, to be beheaded and his body burnt for the crime of severe blasphemy.42 After 1784 the penal code of Joseph II moderated the cruel heritage of the Theresian era. The sin of blasphemy was no longer considered a criminal offence, only a civil infraction. It was an ‘ill manner’ indicative of mental disorder.43 The crime of blasphemy ran the same course under Joseph II as had magical activities under Maria Theresa. The criminal offence became equal to insanity; the treatment, instead of burning at the stake and corporal punishment, was changed to hospitalization (Tables 3 and 4). The regulations coming into force between 1756 and 1768 meant a significant change compared to the Praxis Criminalis, although at first sight the categories of magical activities appeared in them just the same. A fundamental change was that the new regulations encouraged the courts to apply a more prudent and humane treatment of the accused. The recently introduced fourth category raised the question of criminality; witchcraft was looked upon as a medical case, as insanity, requiring hospital treatment and psychiatric evaluation. The regulation enforced the previously applied and never-failing practice of mercy: the insane cannot be convicted in a criminal proceeding. In April 1756, at the manorial court of the Zichy family in Nagyvázsony, their maid Éva Kiss—who claimed to be a victim of witches, and allegedly committed arson only because the witches advised and coerced her into doing so—was released due to her diminished mental capacities; and the women she accused of witchcraft were acquitted.44 After 1768 we encounter several proceedings against insane people; although their number did not increase, when considering all proceedings, their ratio had risen within the criminal proceedings of magical activities. In 1778, the Somogy county court prosecuted István Salamon of Szőlősgyörk who, after leaving his village, spent most of his time in a vineyard where he made a wooden statue with a string and a chain as protection against haunting by evil spirits. Apparently the statue was not very effective, as the spirits continued to torment him in the night; the authorities thought the statue was more apt for summoning

the Devil, so they prosecuted him.45 In 1779, a daughter of a Gypsy man called Ádám from Magyarlapád, Transylvania was summoned to the court of Alsó-Fehér county as the inhabitants considered her to be diabolically possessed, both in the criminal and medical sense of the word.46 The qualification of magical activities as insanity was not only practiced by the authorities: the magic market also adapted quickly to the new perception of the phenomena. From the 1740s on, many people in Hungary tried to exploit the vogue of these new ‘scientific’ ideas, while still relying upon the old beliefs. ‘Sir’ Johannes Teüffel was one such: in 1759 in Eger he offered his services to the authorities as a specialist in the treatment of ‘magical diseases’, restoring the health of those suffering from disillusions. According to Teüffel’s passport he had successfully treated patients in the South of Hungary, in Temesvár (Timişoara), in Pétervárad (Petrovaradin) and in Verőce (Virovitica); it is on the basis of these that upon his arrival in Eger he asked for a license to pursue his skills in that county.47 This was also the period when—in much greater numbers than before—treasure diggers, ‘money finders’ (pénznéző), sorcerers like the táltos or the garabonciás, and black magicians emerged as

criminal law of the principle of caring for the subjects of the realm; the mercantilist philosophy (it is better if the guilty restores the damages with communal work, than to make them a deterrent for the people by executing them); furthermore, the acceleration of the process of medicalization in general. Medicalization influenced criminal law as well. From 1758 the number of aggravated torture sentences decreased. From 1768—even though they would have had the chance—the courts practically stopped giving out torture sentences. In 1775/1776 they introduced regulations, then they initiated complete dismissal, and finally in 1791 the method of torture interrogations disappeared once and for all from judicial practice. From 1768 the length of detention shortened and the state of prisons improved. From 1758 the number of corporal punishments for magical activities decreased significantly, and within that also the number of those which were equal to a death sentence. The legal category for magical activities was transformed, as were the connotations of the definition and the assigned punishments. After 1768, magical activities—similar to the case of blasphemy from 1784—were no longer considered as criminal acts; they became much more moderate categories, such as insanity, delusion and fraud. The punishment for fraud was the financial indemnification of the victim and corporal punishment; diabolical possession and superstition were treated with hospitalization; blasphemy related to alliance with the Devil with corporal punishment; and quackery with the payment of a fine. But the general practice of judgment was also transformed. First, a formal limit was placed upon certified execution methods and the wide spectrum of modes of death restricted to a few (hanging, beheading). After 1795, burning at the stake was permanently removed from the executioners’ tools, as being inhuman. Progressively, sentences of body mutilation, and the mutilation of the body of the executed by the authorities, were abolished. The execution of the ‘cannibal’ gypsies in 1782/1783 in Hont county, without any control of the monarch, led to the restriction of death penalties.54 After restricting the prevalence of corporal punishments a new law pertaining to communal work was introduced, and sponging- and workhouses built. During the reign of Maria Theresa the drastic principles of the Praxis Criminalis were replaced by more refined methods of judicial practice. The penal code of Joseph II, the Sanctio Criminalis Josephina abolished once and for all the death penalties and the remainder of the right to torture in 1787. In



THE DECRIMINALIZATION OF MAGIC ... 309
1788–1789, Joseph II also revoked from the manors and the royal cities the right to hold blood courts. From this point, in principle the decision of every death sentence was brought to the king. However, shortly after the king’s death, the Diet of Hungary annulled the imposed codex, so that the court of law of the Estates was re-established (Tables 5 and 6). There may be multiple reasons and explanations for the continuation of legal proceedings against magical activities. One of them is that although the measures of the central authority put an end to witchhunts, they did not annul the legislation allowing the initiation of legal proceedings, and so even after the regulations were in effect the criminal courts could still hold witch trials (1782/Tolna county, Éva Frekkin, a gypsy girl55; 1790/Aranyosszék, Aniska Koldus, a beggar woman),56 and other cases of magical activity such as superstition and healing procedures considered as quackery and fraud. The central instructions also failed to prohibit private proceedings.

Another reason can be linked to the attitudes of Maria Theresa and Joseph II towards gypsies (and ‘beggars’ and ‘wanderers’ in general), namely their intention to forcefully integrate people with wandering lifestyles into the society. Based on the available criminal statistics of the time we can establish that the people convicted before 1770 came from their own community, while after 1770 the number of ‘foreigners’ and ‘wanderers’ grew among the accused. The Roma—as regards their quantitative weight in society—were proportionally more often cited to court in different criminal proceedings than any other ethnicity. We only need to mention the conspicuous case of the ‘cannibal’ gypsies from Hont in 1782. Moreover, in their cases the court did not question the factuality of the recently barely accepted accusation of sorcery. In the cases after 1768, among the people accused of witchcraft, sorcery, ‘money finding’, and enchantment there were even more gypsies than previously. Since the accusations—due to the prohibitive character of the regulations and to the lack of judicial assistance—had less at risk after 1768, the social prestige of the beliefs and of the magical activities cited in the trials shrank as well. Certain accusations even became ridiculous. Among the people engaged in these activities after 1768 we find more and more marginal persons, outlaws, wanderers, mendicants, simpletons, or actual imbeciles. The accused almost never belonged to the ‘normal’ representatives of the population, at least not the ones cited to court. As I earlier mentioned, after 1768 magical activities were no longer considered a criminal act by the court, but rather insanity or disease. In this regard, the gypsies were multiple victims of this judicial change of perception concerning magical activities. The authorities considered this ethnic group, even after the change, to be a childish, simpleminded and socially immature community. They thought that these people embodied the ‘fraudster’, the ‘illusionist’, the ‘sorcerer’, the ‘swindler’ and the ‘mistaken visionary’, who were mentally challenged. There remained aspects of magical activities that still figured as a legal category, defined most commonly by the notion of ‘fraud’. This was the accusation we encountered in the majority of the cases cited to court after 1768. Other categories that stayed under the same judgment were sorcery, digging for treasure, money finding; because they all might have involved the undue excavation of graves, the desecration of dead corpses, and using human bones for magical activities, which were forbidden because of the change of perception due to the process of medicalization. The reasons for the strict judgments could be justified by



THE DECRIMINALIZATION OF MAGIC ... 311
arguments related to public health, the concrete and transcendent fear of epidemics, and on moral grounds as well. The third reason lay within the ambiguity of the restrictive regulations. Although the decrees issued in Hungary and in Transylvaniaboth in general and those concerning individual cases—did not explicitly forbid the trial of witchcraft cases; they never said that witchcraft was not a crime. As the legal historian András Kiss observed, the central authorities could not state contrary to the religious philosophies of the time that the Devil did not exist, that Evil was not present in the world; and that witches cooperating with him therefore did not exist either.57 The theological and legal categories of witchcraft also figured in these decrees; moreover, these were still considered as a sin against God. What were the arguments that these decrees could still offer to justify the royal initiative to ban the hunt? Basically they claimed that the reason for not conducting these trials in court was that the truthfulness of the accusations could not be properly—that is, in compliance with the contemporary scientific requirements—verified and proven by the available judicial tools. In the end, Maria Theresa’s measures only achieved the ousting of witchcraft from the courthouses; she never intended to banish the issue from the arena of public morality. In fact, if we take into account all the regulations restricting all kinds of superstition, harmful beliefs, healing practices harming the health of the people, quackery and blasphemy, Maria Theresa, and even Joseph II were fighting against scandals which were shedding an unfavorable light on the realm. In summary, we can establish that it took a long time—approximately two generations—for society to finally give up the habit of taking witchcraft accusations and slanders to the courthouse, and also to stop explaining and settling every breach of the norms of social cohabitation with witchcraft accusations.
notes
1. In the Hungarian historical literature it used to be a commonly held view that we do not encounter witch trials in the judicial files after 1768. The result was that our historians only studied the judicial aspects of witchcraft beliefs no further than 1768. There are only a few, little-known exceptional examples, which indicated that it was worth researching later sources.

As an annex to the Corpus Iuris Hungarici they published the Tripartitum of István Werbőczy; the Directio Methodica by János Kithonich; and Newe Peinliche Landgerichtsordnung published in 1656 by Ferdinand III for Lower Austria, which was translated into Latin in 1687 by the archbishop of Esztergom under the title: Forma processus judicii criminalis seu praxis criminalis, also named Praxis Criminalis Kollonicziana after the archbishop, and Constitutio Criminalis Josephina after the Hungarian king Joseph I; furthermore, bearing in mind that it was republished along with the sections of law of 1723 treating the substantive criminal law during the reign of Charles III, the opus was also called Praxis Criminalis Carolina. Between 1740 and 1848 there were six new editions of the Praxis Criminalis: Buda, 1746, 1749; Kalocsa, 1748, Kolozsvár, 1748, 1763; Nagyszombat, 1751. In the witch trials they cited section LX.
6. Tripartitum Opus Juris Consuetudinarii inclyti regni Hungariae per magistrum Stephanum de Werbewcz. Between 1740 and 1848 there were 16 editions in the printing houses and publishers of Nagyszombat, Kolozsvár, Kalocsa, Eger, Bratislava, Kassa, Buda and Pest. In the witch trials they specifically cited the following section: Decretum Tripartitum Pars 1-a Titulum 15., Pars 3., Titulum 32. 7. Decr. Sancti Stephani II/32; Decr. Sancti Ladislai I/34; Decr. Colomanni I/57, 60. We find concrete references to these in both the Hungarian and Transylvanian texts of judgment up until 1762; however, it is cited in the witch trial of Aranyosszék in 1791/92 as a monument in legal history: Kiss and Pál-Antal, A magyarországi boszorkányság, No. 195); András Kiss, ‘A védelem szemléletváltozásának jelei a 18. századi boszorkányperekben’ [Signs of change in the perception of the defence in the witch trials of the eighteenth century], Limes, 1 (2000), 17–25; András Kiss, Boszorkányok, kuruzslók, szalmakoszorús paráznák [Witches, quack doctors, straw wreathed fornicators] (Bucharest and Cluj: Kriterion, 2004), 19.

Demonology and Catholic Enlightenment
in Eighteenth-Century Hungary
Dániel Bárth
exPosition of the ProbLem
It might come as a surprise at first that in Hungary research into ecclesiastic demonology in the narrow sense, and into the Catholic Enlightenment are still at a very early stage. This statement is relevant from the level of source discovery through to analytical studies. Our sense of loss (and in a way our confusion) is even more enhanced if we establish where our focus lies with respect to the international historical literature. The undiscovered status of the sources in Hungary and the lack of necessary preliminary investigations almost give rise to a sense of pointlessness in the researcher interested in the topic and intending to

During the research period to this study my work was supported by the János Bolyai Research Grant of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. The research leading to these results was financed by the European Research Council, in accordance with ERC grant agreement No. 324214 of the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme (2007–2013). The latter proved to be a great help during the finalization of the text of this study.

write a paper on the connection between the two concepts mentioned in the title. In the following, however, my attempt to point out some of the issues which seem important to me, and which hopefully can moreover be supported by Hungarian data, is obviously not an attempt to summarize and conclude; it is rather along the perspectives of future directions in the research that I intend to establish my views.
did CathoLiC demonoLogy have a hungarian ‘version’
in the earLy modern Period?
Even though the study of witch trials from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century has been a privileged research field of historicalanthropological and folkloristic source exploration and publication in recent decades in Hungary and the exploitation and contextualization of the trials in terms of demonology have given us satisfying results, the exploration of some related groups of sources have not received sufficient attention in recent research.1 While there have been several ground-breaking and enticing studies of the various genres of Protestant demonological literature (handbooks, treaties, sermons, etc.) and of the numerous aspects of Protestant devil concepts (ecclesiastic, theological, literary, material, iconographic, etc.),2 the Catholic equivalents of such phenomena have been neglected. I believe no one, whether closely or merely casually interested in this topic, would doubt the importance of the examination of sources related to the biggest religious denomination of its time. However, it is a fact, that while serious studies concerning the devil-perception of Protestant sermons have been undertaken,3 the exploration of similar Catholic sources has not even begun. While some pieces of demonological literature and their ethnographical and historical reception have appeared as bestsellers by ‘celebrity authors’4 (and rightly so, by the way); we know nothing about the Hungarian Catholic point of view of the period in question. Until recent times, the situation was no better concerning liturgical texts: typically, one of the rare local relics of Protestant exorcist rituals was republished in print5 earlier than its Catholic version (from Esztergom), which literally served as a basis for the former.6 There is no need to scrutinize structural and personal elements of this conspicuous absence, since it seems far more important to consider the real research possibilities that arise from this situation. This present study attempts to approach this perspective from a focused angle, namely



DEMONOLOGy AND CATHOLIC ENLIGHTENMENT ... 321
through an instructive case study on the relationship between Catholic Enlightenment and demonology. Before we get to it, however, it seems necessary to establish certain preliminary hypotheses.
1. First and foremost, we have to establish that the Hungarian sources from the early modern age allow us to put the system of Catholic demonology under a microscope. 2. This Catholic demonology (as opposed to the prevailing theological views of the time) does not appear as a uniform and exclusive system; it is rather to be interpreted as a multi-layered cluster in which, beside the ‘dominant’ views, further ‘alternative’ mental systems materialize. 3. Even though Hungarian demonology is a part of European demonology, the use (or sometimes the non-use) of the European handbooks in Hungarian context also reveals a peculiar and specific side of demonology.
The acknowledgement of this last premise is especially important, since it might have been precisely the hypothesis ignoring the existence of an autonomous literature and source material demonology in Hungarian that impeded previous research into the issue.7 The rich material of benedictions and exorcisms discovered in collections published in Hungary and the analysis of the deeper layers of eighteenth-century exorcism scandals traced back thus far prove the opposite.8 Even in the case of the supranational, universal liturgical texts it has been possible to sense certain Eastern European, and even minor regional differences.9 We have no reason to presume that the case is any different with demonological handbooks, tractates and ceremonial books.10 The comparative analysis and contextualization of these latter would be the task of (several) other studies. In fortunate cases data has been found to confirm their parochial and monastic possession and use. The direct or indirect relationship between the Catholic demonological literature and witch-hunting—whether there are clear traces of a decisive interference in this field, or whether we should be content with the rather sceptical and negative answers obtained so far in terms of the Hungarian relevance of the matter—might be a separate issue for study.11 The most interesting question, however, resides undoubtedly in the different concepts of demonology applied in practice, and the confrontation of the different opinions. Examples for the escalation of the conflicts proliferated parallel



322 D. BÁRTH
to the spread of rationalism throughout Europe. The pace of this process can be traced throughout two centuries; it can be depicted as a prolonged and regionally changing process. Scepticism within the Church was already visible during the great waves of exorcism in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; nevertheless, it was not until the Enlightenment appeared within the Church in the second half of the eighteenth century that most of the related phenomena were spectacularly thrust back.12
PossibLe aPProaChes to the CathoLiC enLightenment
With regard to the different forms of Catholic Enlightenment13 in Hungary, we encounter the most palpable silence among the representatives of reliable church history. Even in defining the concept of ‘Catholic Enlightenment’ we have for the most part to turn to the works of foreign authors.14 The main trends in the history of the Church already have an ambivalent take on the concept itself, sometimes interpreting it as an antagonistic opposition, sometimes cutting it short with a generalization.15 In Hungary there are as yet no comprehensive monographs that would present the changes of each diocese in terms of organization, religious practice and history of mentality, particularly with regard to this period. This despite there being an abundance of European examples! In the past century dozens of exemplary monographs were issued in this field, mostly within the discipline of German and French studies.16 These studies have usually arranged the data around the activities of one particular ecclesiastic leader.17 They often discuss issues like folk religion, folk traditions, folk beliefs, the fight against magic and superstition, etc.18 Internationally, one of the most exploited sources is the liturgical handbooks of the time, which inspired reform suggestions throughout Europe, especially concerning the use of native languages, the repression of ‘superstitious’ elements, and the simplification, explanation and individualization of the liturgy.19 These international studies remind us that there are in fact regional variants of Catholic Enlightenment in eighteenth-century Europe. The results of future Hungarian research—based on discovery of primary sources—can be only interpreted in a European perspective. Besides the shortcomings of Hungarian church history, we can only give an account of the partial results obtained in the field of literary history.20 We must, though, pay attention to the complexity and the overstrained nature of the concept of ‘Enlightenment’—especially in



DEMONOLOGy AND CATHOLIC ENLIGHTENMENT ... 323
terms of literary history—which sometimes impairs the interdisciplinary value of the results. The studies emerging in segregated disciplinary areas lack proper communication precisely because of terminological confusions that cause dissent. A fundamental matter when it comes to the analysis of Catholic Enlightenment is the determination of its ‘golden age’. In French studies of church history, Bernard Plongeron defines the period as lying between 1770 and 1830, during which the effects of Catholic Enlightenment ideology were the strongest and most dynamic.21 In German studies, even the mid-eighteenth-century decades are considered part of the Enlightenment era, while the first half of the century is referred to within the Church as the ‘early Enlightenment’ (Frühaufklärung).22 Compared to these Western examples, Hungarian church history shows some delay, which is mainly a consequence of Ottoman rule. In most parts of the country it was only at the end of the seventeenth, or more likely in the first third of the eighteenth century that the reform processes of the renewed Catholicism of the Tridentinum could start; although it occurred parallel to the process of the establishment of the Church organization and the consolidation of confessional borders. Catholic reform/renewal and parallel confessionalization in the first half of the eighteenth century make it a very busy and exciting period of research. Earlier Church historiography23 referred to these decades under the umbrella term of ‘late baroque’, which—in my belief—has unduly become a much overloaded category in the fields of history of ideas, church history, history of literature, and art history; and has thus become unsuitable as a general reference. It is still not clear where the borderlines of the different tendencies of Catholic renewal lie: in the background different measures of the councils or the Consistory, how long we should still speak of reform, and when we should start using the term (early) Enlightenment? As for rationalism and tolerance, the two key concepts of the Catholic Enlightenment, we are mostly in trouble with the former; since reasonableness is also already detectable in several reform regulations in the first half of the eighteenth century, in particular concerning certain elements of popular culture. Tolerance only brings noticeable change in Hungary in the period of Josephinism.24 Nevertheless, this in itself raises a question: to what extent should our calculations take into consideration the parallel nature of Catholic Enlightenment and enlightened absolutism in Hungary, which–compared to the Western model—seems to be a general phenomenon in this region?25



324 D. BÁRTH
CathoLiC enLightenment and PoPuLar CuLture
We are in an especially difficult position if we want to capture the changes in the ecclesiastical attitude towards popular culture, because the major trends of Church governance were often evolving in the same direction throughout the century. We have to identify the nodes by which changes in clerical attitude can be better observed.26 In what follows, we attempt to do so within the framework of a case study. Before arriving at that point, however, we must mention the importance of the intermediary role of the lower clergy, another grey area in the eye of the historical inquiry focusing on this period.27 yet it is my opinion that in the contact zone of Church governance and local communities it is in fact the traces of the change of attitude and of the concrete measures of the lower clergy that we have to examine in order to understand the complex tissue of the relationship between Catholic Enlightenment and popular culture. Sándor Bálint, one of the best Hungarian researchers in the field of religious ethnography, refers on several occasions in his writings with a tone of resentment and disapproval to the indisposition of the ‘josephinist clergy’ towards certain forms of folk piety; he could, nevertheless, never conduct a deep analysis of changes in clerical attitudes.28 Any extensive discovery of sources concerning the change of mentality and attitudes of seminary teachers is also missing29; and we know very little of the local execution of the intentions and regulations of the state, and of the ways the local clergy responded to them. The Catholic Enlightenment had an integral effect on every aspect of religious life: a thorough analysis should be made to clarify the extent and the intensity concerning each aspect. Since for the time being there are no existing studies concerning Hungarian dioceses, we have to accept the relevant conclusions of the international literature. We have no reason to assume that the effects of the Hungarian Catholic Enlightenment differed significantly from others. Following the monograph by Barbara Goy based on the source material from the dioceses of Würzburg and Bamberg we can consider, among others, the following aspects: holidays of the year; arrangements of holidays and workdays; veneration of saints; processions; pilgrimages; the possibility of obtaining indulgences; sacramentals; ringing the church bells against storms; rites of passage (the turning points in human life); prayers, religious songs, rituals.30



DEMONOLOGy AND CATHOLIC ENLIGHTENMENT ... 325
This series can be naturally extended depending on the given diocese’s source material. In this present study we have no room to make up for the shortcomings of monographs in this field, not even by enumerating a few mere examples of the above mentioned aspects. Fortunately there are some preliminary studies in Hungary which discuss some of these areas in a topical, non-regional approach; and which contain, even if sporadically, references to the changes induced by the Catholic Enlightenment. As examples I would mention the studies on pilgrimages,31 the changes concerning the cult of saints,32 and the analysis of the ecclesiastical benediction practices in the early modern period.33 As a common denominator of the above-mentioned we can highlight an important new development, namely that the influence of the Catholic Enlightenment caused a change in the attitude towards the miracle34: in the mindset of the upper levels of the ecclesiastical society the susceptibility towards various pseudo-miraculous phenomena has been gradually relegated into the background, and it became increasingly classified in the category of ‘popular religion’. Meanwhile, we can observe that in the second half of the eighteenth century there existed in Hungary as elsewhere several representatives of the ‘Counter-Enlightenment’35 (Gegen-Aufklärung) the points of view of which have been discovered in legal files thanks to some scandalous events they were involved in. In the following, we will attempt to detect the conflict zones of these two kinds of ecclesiastic attitude in the framework of a micro-analytic case study.
enLightenment and Counter-enLightenment as refLeCted
in the ConfLiCts of an eighteenth Century franCisCan
friar from zombor
In the background of this chapter lie the exorcist, healing, catechization, preaching and confessional activities of Rókus Szmendrovich, the Illyrian festive preacher of the Franciscan convent of Zombor.36 The repercussions of the case of the friar who exorcized dozens of Catholic and Greek Orthodox ‘possessed’ in the second half of the 1760s created immense documentation by the superior authorities of the diocese; which are today stored in the Kalocsa Archiepiscopal Archives.37 The population of Zombor in the eighteenth century was excessively mixed in terms of ethnicity and religion.38 The majority of the city’s population was Catholic Southern Slav also referred to in the official



326 D. BÁRTH
terminology of the time as ‘Illyrians’. Besides them, there were Hungarians, Germans and Greek Orthodox Serbs living here. These last disposed of 12 Orthodox priests and two churches.39 So far, we have only sporadic and indirect data on the life of Rókus Szmendrovich before he joined the local Franciscan convent in 1766; he was in his early forties when he conducted his outstanding activities. He was born in 1726 in the region of Turpolje, in Velika Mlaka, Croatia. He was originally baptized with the name of Peter. His ecclesiastic career—as a secular priest—was mostly related to the diocese of Zagreb. He had long been active in the city of Pozsega (Požega). With regard to our research it is worth mentioning that the parish priest of the city had given him written permission to practice exorcism. Later he was to take over the administration of the parish. It is still a mystery as to why the priest of more than 35 years standing asked him to join the Franciscans in the 1760s. (It is for further research to discover the—at present only assumed—connection between this action and his exorcist-healing activities.) What we do know for certain is that the former parish priest of Pozsega, Peter Szmendrovich joined the Franciscan order on 16th June, 1763 in the Sarengrad convent; and that exactly one year later he took an eternal vow. This is when he changed his name to Rókus. In the visitation of the convent they noted that besides Croatian and Latin, he also spoke some German, Slovakian and Hungarian. In Zombor, he was named Illyrian festive preacher (concionator festivalis), which title he held until May 1769.40 The first exorcism started on 8th December, 1766. Following liturgical regulations, Rókus began the exorcism of the wife of the local Antal Matich after the morning mass. The woman, named Anna, had been suffering for long years from a peculiar illness that her husband, her relatives and her neighbors all interpreted as diabolical possession. They told him that besides being confused and having seizures, the woman had been inhibited by a mysterious force from being able to receive the holy communion. The news of the first exorcism,41 which lasted two weeks, went around the city and its surroundings. Huge crowds gathered around the parish church to witness this extraordinary attraction. It is difficult to tell who might have been the one to ‘report’ the somewhat scandalous conduct of the Franciscan monk to the superior Church authorities; but by the end of the winter, that is February and March of the following year, he was struggling to free a dozen members of the Greek Orthodox community from presumed diabolical possession. In all



DEMONOLOGy AND CATHOLIC ENLIGHTENMENT ... 327
events, in the spring of 1767 the case was in front of the Archiepiscopal Consistory court (consistorium) of Kalocsa.42 The canon leading the session announced that it had come to their knowledge that a Franciscan monk from Zombor had been unsuccessfully exorcizing ‘allegedly possessed’ individuals for more than a month. His actions had been utterly irregular, at the expense and ridicule of the liturgy. According to their sources the person in question had even raised a stage-like wooden podium inside the church where he conducted the ceremonies. During the noisy attraction, the audience of various ages and both sexes repeated collectively the text of the exorcism cited in the vernacular language after the priest who—as a part of the ritual—lined up the possessed Greek Orthodox people with candles in their hands. They immediately ordered a thorough investigation of the case. They gave the dean of the district a letter of credence to travel as soon as possible to the city to forbid the named Franciscan friar from conducting public exorcism; and to organize an investigation based on the given line of questioning. The dean secretly observed the process of the exorcism. He saw the following: the ‘exorcist priest’—without a book and a stole—uttered the prayers in Croatian; the crowd repeated certain parts after him, for example “Get thee behind me, Satan, get thee behind me unclean spirit; may you be obliterated by the Passion of Christ, may his sacred blood crush you”. The dean called Father Rókus to account for the abuses, and at the instruction of the Consistory he forbade him to conduct public exorcisms.43 In his answers to the questioning, Father Rókus explained that after the news had spread of his first exorcism, more and more ‘schismatics’ suffering from different diseases had come to see him and he had identified the symptoms of true diabolical possession in nineteen out of thirty people. It was apparent that all of them were women. In vain did he try to tell them to go to their Orthodox priests and kalugers; they responded that they had already tried their help, unsuccessfully. Many of the liberated converted to Catholicism, as did several of the ‘spectators’.44 Rókus was present at the meeting of the Consistory at the end of April 1767, where he explained his defence and his justifications in detail.45 The Franciscan even presented three letters of certificate from different notables of the city, claiming unanimously that they had attended the exorcism rituals where they have not noticed any irregularities; everything that happened was in honour and for the benefit of the Catholic faith. According to them, Father Rókus was very circumspect with the exorcisms of the people suffering—as they said—undoubtedly



328 D. BÁRTH
from diabolical possession. They considered the conversion of those from other confessions as an obvious benefit resulting from the exorcisms.46 The personal appearance of the Franciscan monk had a positive effect on the notables of the Consistory thus far. The resolution considered the friar’s devotion, merits and virtuous lifestyle alongside the testimonies; therefore it only established the condition that the scandalous matter should not happen again. If the suspicion of possession arose again, he should seek the assistance of two fellow friars from the convent; detect the diabolical symptoms in their presence; and send the protocols to the Consistory. If the superior Church authority gave permission, he could then proceed with the exorcism, though only by following the regulations described in the rituals of the diocese. This resolution calmed the emotions for a while. Father Rókus even acquired a permit to become confessor priest for the whole diocese, thereby continuing his activities under official approval. Locals suspected of diabolical possession still went to see him now and again. After a couple of months the first lengthy protocol arrived at Kalocsa; it contained the description of the symptoms of the possession of a woman from Szabadka (Subotica).47 In September 1767 the Consistory permitted the exorcism of two diabolically possessed. After the procedure, he had to send a report of the outcome signed by two witnesses.48 Subsequently, the public exorcisms stopped for a while. In the period between 1767 and 1769, father Rókus excelled not only as a preacher, but as a catechist both of the young and of adults.49 He participated in the organization of religious associations. Later the city notables praised his skills as an orator and virtues as a catechist. The friar also took his fair share of other priestly duties. We can suspect from indirect references that, with his exceptional personality, he attracted many believers for confession. In later letters many extolled his confessor skills. Besides the obvious reason—his exorcisms—such talents surely contributed to the enthusiasm for the charismatic friar. However, the real key to the secret of his immense popularity and appeal was surely his clandestine healing activities. This is what the sources barely reveal, and what the letters of praise never mention. Nevertheless, this was the basis for the problems with and the accusation against him. By healing activities we refer not only to the public exorcisms, but also the secretly exercised incantations, a benediction practice with medieval roots that the friar cared to perform to comfort those of his supporters who were struggling with



DEMONOLOGy AND CATHOLIC ENLIGHTENMENT ... 329
physical complaints. No wonder that Rókus was so popular among the relatives of the dying. Most of those asking for the last unction asked specifically for him. (Contrary to his fellow friars, they say he entered the house smiling, and the patients already felt better at his sight.) People also ran to him in cases of severe illness. The friar never turned down a request. He discussed his view in several of his letters, claiming that the Devil often possessed his victims disguised as seemingly obvious diseases. According to this point of view, his healing method frequently consisted of benedictions and exorcism. Apparently, he only performed public exorcisms in severe cases of demonstrable diabolical possession that also manifested mental symptoms. Therefore the above mentioned spectacular exorcisms were only the tipping points of his hidden healing activities.50 The series of events resulting in similar exorcist séances and eventually leading to the end of Szmendrovich’s activities in Zombor started in the late spring of 1769. The news arrived at the Consistory of Kalocsa in May: the Franciscans in Zombor were exorcizing again. This time it was a local man and a woman who were the subjects of the ritual. Three fellow friars gave testimonial letters to confirm the diabolical possession of the two Catholics.51 The archbishop József Batthyány also contributed to the case, ordering that the diabolical possession of these people should be confirmed in front of the Consistory and that they should be confined until the truth was discovered. Batthyány’s impatient tone in his commanding letter suggests that he was becoming increasingly exasperated with the activities of the ‘often mentioned’ Franciscan friar.52 The Consistory investigation which made the final decision in the case took place in May 1769.53 The sick man was carried on a coach: he lay with his eyes closed, twitching, choking, and grinding his teeth. After the county doctor had examined him, he opened his eyes and presented his lengthy and confused story. The woman also told her story of her diabolical possession in which she involved the encounter with father Rókus. After that, one of the canons of the Consistory made an attempt to exorcize her, but the woman showed no sign of being diabolically possessed during the ceremony conducted according to the regulations of the official Roman Ritual. When they asked her what she felt during the exorcism, she said that besides the usual heart-strain she felt nothing. Next, it was the turn of Rókus—who thus far had only been a spectator of the events—to perform the exorcism. First there were no visible signs, but then in the second half of the ceremony, in the



330 D. BÁRTH
afternoon, she manifested some signs (distortion, seizures, the grinding of her teeth, screaming, trembling); nonetheless, the Church leaders were not convinced. They were already disturbed by the fact that the friar had performed this part of the exorcism in faint whispers. It was already evening by the time they started exorcizing the man. He claimed that his hand was mysteriously restrained by some force whenever he wanted to cross himself. He also felt terrible pain when he heard praying. To confirm this they started to pray, first in Croatian and then in Latin. The man was squirming in agony from the pain. The notabilities of the Consistory tricked him by gradually changing the text of the Latin prayer into a profane, unreligious text. The man naturally felt the same pain. His fraud was uncovered. The next morning, after hearing two witnesses, they issued a resolution establishing that the two allegedly possessed were in fact suffering from natural diseases. The man was insane (maniacus) and the woman epileptic. The specification of the diseases54 was based on the official medical records of the examination conducted by the county doctor Henrik Kerschner. However, this was not the reason on the basis of which they cast off the possibility of diabolical possession. The conclusive decision was made by the members of the Consistory, based on the fact that the woman showed no sign during the exorcism by the Consistory canon and the threefold exorcism by the Franciscan friar that would have proven unequivocally the presence of supernatural forces. The resolution did not favor the Franciscan. They pronounced that through the exorcisms he had violated the previous resolutions of the Consistory concerning him; the exorcism had incited a scandal among the ‘schismatics’; and the holy rituals had become a subject of ridicule among the people. For all this he had to face a double punishment: he was banned from performing any kind of exorcism, and his confessor license was revoked. The leader of the convent went even further: he disabled him in all of his capacities as a pastor and he confined him within the walls of the convent.55 The banning of their ‘favorite’ friar from all interaction with his followers sparked a huge upheaval in the city. The notables launched a new, desperate assault to fight the resolution. The Consistory of Kalocsa received a deluge of testimonies and letters certifying, requesting, and begging for the reinstatement of the monk. The honest and often passionate tone of the letters bears out just how fond the notables of the city were of Father Rókus. In an interrogation record they mention ten



DEMONOLOGy AND CATHOLIC ENLIGHTENMENT ... 331
cases related to him highlighting his activities in healing and comforting the sick. The document also clarifies the reason why his supporters bemoaned the banning of the friar from confessions.56 Their convulsion, however, must have achieved an effect opposite to what they intended. The Church leaders were only reassured in the correctness of their decision to ask their superiors to remove the scandalously popular Franciscan friar. His transfer to another diocese was encouraged by the archbishop himself. The further life of the Franciscan remains in pitch-black void. He was probably transferred to a monastery in the South, in Slavonia or Croatia. His name later comes up as a monk with no function in a convent in Diakóvár. He passed away on 7th December 1782 in Szentmihály (Drávaszentmihály, today: Mihovljan), and is buried in the crypt of a nearby Franciscan church.57

the exorCist Wonder heaLer
It has been a decade now since I come across this wonderful and ‘intact’ source material in the archives. The story of the exorcist from Zombor—among other topics—has been occupying me ever since. In the beginning, my initial hypothesis was that we were dealing with the conflict between the medieval, ‘folkish’ Franciscan attitude and the rational Church leadership permeated by Catholic Enlightenment. I have considered the use of exorcism as this spectacular healing method a unique and belated phenomenon here, in view of the observations on the vogue and the subsequent fade away of similar scandals in sixteenthand seventeenth-century Europe.58 This seemed to be justified by the fact that I have not found any other similar cases in Hungary from this period. In my search for European analogies, however, it was quite easy to come across the story of John Gassner,59 the most famous exorcist of the eighteenth century. Born in Vorarlberg, after his ordination this priest carried out his activities in the dioceses of Chur, Konstanz, Augsburg and Regensburg. He was involved in what might have been the biggest European scandal of the 1770s, which resulted in a multitude of contemporary manuscripts and printed source materials. Based on these materials researchers in church history (first Zimmermann,60 then more extensively Hanauer,61 and others exploring subtopics)62 presented meticulous analyses of the life of Gassner and the history of his impact.



332 D. BÁRTH
The exemplary studies reveal not only the unusual biographical facts of a priest’s life, but also the pros and cons of the evaluations of activities of the ‘wonder healer’ (Wunderheiler), his healing methods and a long list of the diseases he treated. Recently Gassner’s character even attracted the attention of American historical anthropology: Eric Midelfort, a specialist in early modern religious demonology, mostly working with German sources, presented the story to a wider readership in an autonomous mini-monograph in 2005.63 Taking all into account, we can decipher in detail the elements of the South German exorcising and healing events. The most apparent feature is the extended size of the scandal. Gassner started his healing activities at the end of the 1750s after having healed himself of a mysterious disease with benedictions and exorcism. After having been healed, he tried out the texts and the procedure on the parish congregation. The 1760s passed in his performing continuous, but relatively quiet healing activities. The news, however, started to spread quickly over a wider circle. Whichever parish he was assigned to, soon a crowd of blind, crippled, epileptic people and others suffering from various ailments started to gather around him. He started to keep his own records of his healings in a Diarium. Then the events reached fever-pitch in the middle of the 1770s. At this point we see a travelling ‘wonder healer’ whose arrival at every new venue was an occasion that attracted big crowds. His activities not only occupied the attention of the contemporary media, but also engaged the highest levels of Church and state leadership. His personality divided the intelligentsia: the number of pamphlets and tracts against and for him was approximately equal (in total there were more than a hundred individual publications). Among his supporters and opponents we find powerful Church leaders as well as prominent Church personalities on the Catholic and the Protestant side alike. The state leadership also voiced their opinion of him: Joseph II expressed his disapproval concerning the noisy miracles. That Gassner did eventually end his healing activities not long before he died was due directly to a ban issued by the highest of all earthly authorities: the Pope. During the more than one and a half decades that Gassner practiced his healings, he treated over tens of thousands of people, mostly from the lower echelons of society. According to contemporary evaluations he met for the most part with success. Subsequent scholarly opinions highlight the priest’s capacities as ‘Suggestor’ and ‘Hypnositeur’.64 Our task—in my



DEMONOLOGy AND CATHOLIC ENLIGHTENMENT ... 333
opinion—is not to examine the true or false nature of the healing powers of Gassner and his epigones,65 but rather to interpret the entire series of events in its own socio-cultural milieu.
ParaLLeLs and ConCLusions
After briefly presenting the biographies of the exorcist from Zombor and his famous German precursor, let us discuss the issues that lie in the background of the parallel nature of the two lives. In what followsessentially by ignoring the differences—I have aimed to focus on and highlight the analogies between the two. The topical clusters below might be the basis of a more extensive future analysis.
PersonaLity
Gassner and Szmendrovich spent the somewhat more than five decades of their lives over the same period, almost to the day, but separated by a distance of 1000 kilometres. They obviously did not know each other. They were both priests of the enthusiastic kind. As parish priests they applied every pastoral tool to care for their flock. Their charismatic personalities made them popular priests. In both cases they mention the suggestive capacity of their eyes. They appeared as strong servants of God, even in the eyes of those of other faiths. This type of evaluation is often seen in present day ethnographical and anthropological descriptions studying the relations between priests and the community. It is especially true concerning the practice of both Catholic and Protestant Hungarians living today in Romania who, even today, in the twenty-first century, resort to the services of benediction/malediction performed by Romanian priests and friars.66 Informants often explain this phenomenon with the extraordinary personality of the bearded Orthodox priests: their ‘mesmerizing eyes’ and the more powerful and effective nature of their liturgical texts.67 The Southern Hungarian story is even more exciting because there we see the inverse of these services: in the given religious zone members of the Serbian Orthodox community expected help from the Franciscan friar who, in fact, appeared as the stronger priestly personality. Both Gassner and Father Rókus excelled not only in their healing capacities, but also with their utmost dedication which manifested in other areas of their priestly activities. People showed a preference towards their preaching; they preferred to confess to them as opposed to other priests; and they always chose them when they called a priest to the dying.



334 D. BÁRTH
PerCePtion of disease
Evidently the background to their great popularity lay in the cures they provided to human diseases. Here we must turn our attention to their peculiar perception of diseases. Researching on a seventeenth-century exorcist from Piedmont, Giovanni Levi makes the observation that by using a language form prevailing in his age and used in the perception of diseases (which he calls personalistic; and according to which various natural, supernatural, social and personal causes lie in the background of all diseases) the priest preached an earlier and simpler causal perception. Levi calls this latter naturalistic; which is the explanation of a disease arising from the disturbed balance of Nature.68 We encounter this simplified perception in the case of the exorcist of Piedmont as in those of our parallel personalities, since in their belief it is the devil/demon who is behind the diseases most of the time. This perception was one of the keys to their success. The other important element was that they identified themselves with demonological views, which were considered outdated in the second half of the eighteenth century. They have decisively distinguished the basic types of possession; the manifestations of circumpossessio, obsessio and possessio. The latter two were healed with large-scale, ceremonial exorcism, while the effects of the demonic cirumpossessio were cured with benedictions and ‘minor’ exorcisms. As an argument against rationality and empiricism they claimed that the Devil was capable of disguising possession as a natural disease. Only certain people and texts were able to discover this treacherous circumstance. At the beginning of their procedures they performed a trial exorcism (exorcismus probativus) with texts different from and stronger than the official (Roman) ritual.69
‘White magiC’
Gassner and Szmendrovich both worked with handbooks and demonological treaties that referred to either medieval or ‘semi-official’ practices tolerated for a while after the Tridentinum. In the beginning of the eighteenth century, the books of Menghi, Stampa, Eynatten and others were integrated one after the other into the list of forbidden books, the Index of the Vatican.70 Their “superstitiosus” content linked them, among other things, to the mentality of ecclesiastic ‘white magic’71; and—by their emphasis on bewitchment (maleficium)—to



DEMONOLOGy AND CATHOLIC ENLIGHTENMENT ... 335
the already fading memory of the witchcraft hysteria. These were the sources based on which Father Rókus deployed the widespread arsenal of weapons of the millennial exorcism practices of the Western Church: besides the holy water he also used wax medallions blessed by the Pope; the Gospel of Saint John and other publications containing holy scripture; prayers to the Virgin Mary, Saint Francis and Saint Anthony; consecrated bread; and so forth. He made incense from blessed flowers and plants to smoke the demons out. He made the possessed drink holy water with a drop of holy oil in it. But it was not only the exorcist handbooks that were ‘outdated’; so were the collections containing the positive benedictions.72 The voluminous early modern handbooks by Martin von Cochem, Bernard Sannig, Gelasio di Cilia and others still show an equally rich arsenal of religious benediction and malediction texts, such as the one gathered by Adolph Franz concerning the medieval practice.73 The system of Church services providing a prompt and effective aid to every necessity of life was discarded only gradually from everyday practice. Earlier I prepared a selection of texts from the collections of benedictions published in Hungary, based on which we were able to distinguish about a hundred and sixty types of benediction and exorcism procedures used in the period covering the sixteenth to eighteenth century.74 There was a demand for sacramentals on the part of believers, a demand primarily met by the friars. We have mentioned that Father Rókus might have joined the Franciscans at a mature age in order to be able to exercise these kinds of services.
sPeCtaCuLum
It is certain that the two priests were not the only ones to use these texts and sacramental objects in the second half of the eighteenth century. There probably would not have been a scandal if they had performed their healings secretly, in quiet, and if they had not become an attraction. The Rituale Romanum75 and the ceremonial books of the diocese published in adherence to it all strictly forbid public exorcisms in front of an audience. The struggles, often dragging on for weeks, were understandably prone to becoming spectacular local events. Although the arguments made by the opposition included various other reasons, this might have been the severest problem for both religious and secular leaders: in the second half of the eighteenth century no one wanted to make the consecrated Catholic Church the venue of circus spectacles.



336 D. BÁRTH
CathoLiC enLightenment
The stories of the two exorcists provide us with an opportunity to study the several mentalities in the different layers of the given period’s ecclesiastical society. It is especially informative to examine the differences in attitudes toward demonology, sacramentals, miracles, and so on in terms of the propagation of the ‘Catholic Enlightenment’.76 Unfortunately we are still missing exemplary monographs that would analyse the relationship of this ideology and popular religion based on sources of each diocese. There should be detailed theoretical and analytic studies to clarify the transition from Catholic reform to Catholic Enlightenment. In the case of Rókus Szmendrovich it is clear that the high clergy leading the diocese in the 1760s was operating in the spirit of the Enlightenment; this is also proven by several of his other ordinances which we cannot discuss here. Of the two leading concepts of the Catholic Enlightenment, rationalism and tolerance, he especially favored the former. The Franciscan friar at the bottom of the religious hierarchical ladder confronted him on this issue; who—based on his mentality—can be considered as the Hungarian representative of the ‘Counter-Enlightenment’. It is very exciting to observe how the easily influenced group of monastic notables, lower clergy of the parish, deans, canons and vicars wavered between the two poles. This obvious wavering between faith in miracles and scepticism only proves the transitional and liminal nature of this period.
PoPuLar reLigion
How do the ‘people’ and popular religion come into the picture? Mostly through bottom-up demands/needs which the religious services offered by the Franciscans (and other religious orders) were meant to satisfy. On the other hand, they also appear in the form of enthusiasm. There were in fact minor ‘fan clubs’ around the personalities of Gassner and Szmendrovich. In the background of their ‘stardom’ we can find their efficacy, the respect of potentia; which for example in the Middle Ages was associated with the shrines guarding holy relics, or with the exorcist healings related to ‘living saints’. It was through them that their environment experienced the (healing) flow of God’s mercy, its praesentia, its existence.77 Through the analysis of the sources we also gain an insight into the deep layers of local religion and popular



DEMONOLOGy AND CATHOLIC ENLIGHTENMENT ... 337
beliefs; for example, with the analysis of the names of demons and demonological notions mentioned by Rókus, which originally were pronounced by the possessed. This task, nonetheless, goes beyond the frameworks of the present question-raising study. Finally, as an epilogue, I would like to point out that the similar endings to our parallel stories might be deceptive. They appear in the guise of the last crusaders of the ‘Counter-Enlightenment’ in an era where the former common sense of thinking with demons78 seemed to be diminishing; when the Catholic Enlightenment was staging loud scandals to overthrow the healing, enthusiastic movements. The latter were in fact effectively pushed to the background for a while, only to manifest themselves again and again under different socio-cultural circumstances. The mentality of the two priests, in various appearances, lives on to this day. In the autumn of 2012 there was a large international conference in Pécs of religious studies focusing on Spirit Possession. Many made the observation that in recent years, especially in the USA and Italy, there has been an increased demand on behalf of the clergy to apply exorcism more frequently. This reassured me of the tangible purpose of my research, if of course the anthropologists studying the exorcist healing activities of contemporary charismatic movements are open to historic examples. I believe that the retelling of the above mentioned storieswhich is primarily the task of ethnography—can be useful even if it is not for practical and contemporary use. If certain aspects of eighteenthcentury religious and everyday life have become more accessible through this method, I have attained my goal.

Talking Through Witchcraft—on the
Bewitchment Discourse of a Village
Community
Ágnes Hesz
On a summer night in the early 2010s, somewhere in Transylvania, Romania, a relatively well-to-do farmer sneaked out of his marital bed, went to the hayshed a couple of yards away from his house, and hanged himself. The village community, consisting almost exclusively of Roman Catholic Hungarians, was left perplexed, since there was no apparent reason for his action: he lived a quiet and peaceful life with his family, had small children and had no financial difficulties. His death was a leading subject of conversation for weeks; people talked about it while doing haywork in kalákas,1 meeting with acquaintances in the street or sipping one of their many daily coffees with friends and relatives. Theirs was a joint venture to understand what had happened; they were trying

to reconstruct the minutest details of his actions, speculating on his thoughts and emotions, and, most importantly, pondering about his possible motives. Some mentioned depression, others suspected business difficulties or a secret fatal illness. It wasn’t long before someone cautiously remarked that “something might have been after him”, a bewitchment or a curse maybe. Although in this case the suspicion of an “occult power at work” did not evolve into a full-fledged bewitchment story—or at least I have not heard of it—bewitchment was a common alternative in the community for explaining various kinds of misfortunes. Sudden or incurable illnesses, long years of addiction or depression, a series of misfortunes, a permanent lack of economic progress, or a conflict-ridden family life were all typical situations that invited the suspicion of bewitchment. Following Evans-Pritchard’s findings on Zande witchcraft,2 numerous anthropological and historical studies of witchcraft have convincingly shown the efficacy of witchcraft as an explanatory system of misfortune. By casting misfortune in the web of social relations, it serves “many practical needs”, as Mary Douglas has put it3: it makes conflicts manageable, offers patterns for counter-action and psychological solace to the victims, and provides a language for negotiating social relationships. As we could see in the case above, however, bewitchment is only one of a number of possible interpretations,4 a “choice to interpret events in a particular way”5 in a particular context. And this choice is always subject to contestation: it may seem credible to some, but totally unacceptable to others. Interpreting an event in terms of witchcraft is thus a matter of permanent negotiations: its proponents will corroborate it in culturally defined ways—by, for example, having bewitchment diagnosed by certain authoritative figures, and disseminating their version of the story in various narrative forms—while its opponents will come up with counter-explanations and counter-narratives. And then there are the “by-standers”: people who are not involved in the case in any way, but talk about it nevertheless, thus taking their fair share in the process of interpretation. The discursive nature of witchcraft has been in the spotlight for the last decades in the scholarly study of witchcraft. In her seminal work on contemporary rural witchcraft in France, Deadly words: witchcraft in the Bocage,6 Jeanne Favret-Saada argued that witchcraft is first and foremost a discourse: the understanding of certain events as witchcraft is constructed through a series of verbal interactions—with peers and with the unwitcher—, witches are believed to bewitch through words, and the



TALKING THROUGH WITCHCRAFT ... 351
fight against them is also done mainly through words. Although there are some rituals involved during the unwitching process, Favret-Saada sees witchcraft as a war fought with words in a very carefully chosen communicative strategy. With this shift towards the discursive quality of witchcraft, a new approach appeared in witchcraft research that understood it as a language through which people perceived and constructed their social reality. Studies of this sort set out to analyse how this ‘language’ was constructed and represented, what meanings it carried in different contexts and what political, moral and psychological influence it had on the lives of individuals and communities.7 As with all languages, witchcraft proved to be a versatile expressive system. It provided a tool for coming to terms with the harshness of living in highly hierarchical social contexts,8 offered an opportunity for the voiceless to be heard and to speak about subjects otherwise unaddressable,9 or to negotiate norms of motherhood.10 Several studies have demonstrated the strategic use of witchcraft narratives throughout different regions and eras. Accusations of witchcraft were launched with the intention of gaining an upper hand in political conflicts or to demonstrate power11 or for revenge 12; in other cases they were used to save face in cases of personal weaknesses.13 Competing lay healers accused each other of being witches to ruin the reputation of their rivals,14 while there were people who boasted of possessing the power of witches to gain certain advantages.15 Some authors16 have also pointed out the strong connection between witchcraft and narrative tradition. Witchcraft beliefs were maintained and passed on in traditional forms of narratives, and people turned to certain narrative patterns when reporting about their own experiences—either in the courtroom or when talking to their peers. As was argued for the legend17 as a traditional folk genre in general, there is a strong interdependence between this narrative category and belief: “legend derives part of its believability from the folk belief it reflects, while folk beliefs are supported by legend narratives”.18 Thus, employing traditional narrative forms and motives when implicating someone with witchcraft may lend authenticity to what had been stated. Timothy Tangherlini also brought together the legend and narrative rumour, claiming that there is a continuity between the two, with the latter becoming a legend if it persists.19 Others also made a strong link between rumour, gossip and witchcraft discourse. It has been widely demonstrated that most witches who were officially accused had already been held to be witches for years or decades,20 and that their reputations as such had been brewed by local

gossip. In their overview of witchcraft over several continents and eras, Pamela Stewart and Andrew Strathern argued that the link between gossip and witchcraft is more intrinsic than casual, since they are both part of “processes of conflict creation and resolution”,21 although they also remark that gossip may have an important role in the initial phases of witchcraft accusations. The present paper follows this language-centred approach. My aim here is to focus on witchcraft discourse understood as talking about witchcraft. I will show in detail how and why people in this particular Transylvanian village talked about bewitchment, and how they applied it in different contexts. I will argue that local witchcraft discourse worked as a powerful ‘cultural idiom’ due to two factors: (1) local ideas on bewitchment offered a rather flexible interpretative framework for people to negotiate their social environment; (2) the combination of these ideas with particular ways of communication (especially gossip) and particular narrative schemes produced messages with more communicative potential than other types of utterances. I have now been familiar with the community, where I have been doing anthropological fieldwork on other subjects, for well over a decade. While my primary focus of research has never changed, witchcraft had such a massive presence in the local culture that I could not help becoming increasingly interested in it. Much of the material in this paper dates back to the first half of the 2000s, and was collected somewhat unintentionally, as a by-product of other inquiries.22 Since witchcraft is a rather sensitive topic, I will not disclose the name of the settlement or its geographical location.23 For the same reason I will only give a schematic introduction to the community, with those facts and information that are inevitable to see the social significance of witchcraft. The settlement has always been considered relatively poor due to its peripheral location and harsh living conditions. In the 2000s it faced the difficulties many other Romanian villages have faced: after the collapse of socialist industry, most of its people—primarily menlost their wage jobs in the nearby cities, and had to return to agricultural production as their main source of living. In the case of this village this mainly meant cattle-raising and the growing of potatoes—the latter for subsistence only—which provided only meagre profit for households. People tried to supplement their income as they could: illegal or semi-illegal logging was a common solution after the reprivatisation of the forests around the village. Some were able to capitalize on this



TALKING THROUGH WITCHCRAFT ... 353
situation by starting their own sawmills of various sizes, or engaging in small trade. But for most, the decades after the revolution were characterized by lack of money and employment opportunities. Although by the size of its population the settlement is not small, due to the denseness of social relations its community could be characterized as ‘closeknit’ or ‘face-to-face’. Families have extended social networks made up of kin, fictive kin, neighbors and friends, which, at the time of my fieldwork they had to intensively mobilize for farming and some household activities. Interactions of any kind—everyday, economic or ritual—were, and still are, guided by the logic of reciprocity. As in any other communities with similar social traits, personal and family reputation is of utmost importance: it is an important—if not the most important—capital for making alliances and ensuring a supporting social network. Most families have some long lasting partnerships with other families, but even the closest relationships are sensitive and fragile: during the years I have been in contact with the community I have seen relatives, neighbors, friends or working allies cutting their ties over a dispute or disagreementonly to warm up again towards each other some time later in the lucky cases. Social relations are then in a constant flux, and under permanent negotiation. By the end of this paper I hope to show that witchcraft discourse—in its many forms—was a powerful and versatile tool in this process. Before discussing the core subject of the paper and some methodological considerations, I shall first describe local concepts of bewitchment. For lack of space, however, I will have to refrain from the detailed presentation of certain aspects24 and focus only on those that are crucial for my analysis.
LoCaL ConCePts on WitChCraft and beWitChment
According to local concepts, occult harm may be done in two ways: through the practices of a magical specialist, or through masses paid to the Romanian Orthodox priest. The two are terminologically differentiated in local discourse. There are several local terms used for maleficium by magical specialists. Among these, the most frequently used is fermeka, deriving from the Romanian word farmec, fermeca, fermecat (to bewitch, to enchant, to charm, or sorcery, quackery),25 but csinálmány or megcsináltatni (something done, to have somebody done in) and gurucsa, both being of Hungarian origin, are also common. Another synonym,



354 Á. HESZ
urszita from the Romanian ursită (its root, ursi, means to order, to prophesize)26 denotes a particular, especially strong type of bewitchment, which is given for the death of its target, and is held to be irreversible. A person who is believed to possess the knowledge to do magical harm is usually called fermekás or gurucsás, which terms are the local equivalents of the witch.27 People also use circumscription when they talk about bewitchment; they speak about evil practice or simply, maleficence (rossz), and about its perpetrators as these types, maleficent or those who know evil practice.
The terminology for the other method, sometimes termed in ethnographic literature as curse mass, is not so numerous. People talk about megmiséztetni valakit (having a mass said against someone), or misét fizetni, misérevalót adni (paying for a mass), the latter expressions being also generally used for any kind of votive masses paid either to the Romanian Orthodox or the Catholic priest. Sometimes the term priestly curse is used, often to differentiate it from the rather frequently uttered curses by ordinary people. To express their suspicion about the priestly origins of certain misfortunes, people usually dropped the remark of it being csudás (meaning unnatural in this context).28 When I went through my interviews for this article, I was rather surprised to see that locals hardly ever used the Hungarian term for bewitchment (rontás) when talking about bewitchment cases. They apparently knew it, and knew what it meant, but only used it occasionally when they answered my questions. Even so, they never applied it in the cases of magical harm done through a mass, and corrected me when I did so. Thus, the two methods of doing harm are rather consciously differentiated in terms of terminology. The only commonly applied expression that brings them under one semantic canopy was used when people voiced their suspicion about certain cases: “it was an unclean thing,” they would say, regardless of the power they believed to be involved. Although people rarely used the word bewitchment for fermeka in local discourse, I will stick to it as an etic category for analytical reasons and for the sake of simplicity. For the same reason, with certain constraints detailed later, I will also apply the term, curse mass, to masses paid for doing someone harm, even if these most probably have not much to do with official cursing rituals of the Eastern Christian church. The two forms of magical harm mobilize opposite transcendental powers and, as we shall see later, are based on different ideologies. Fermeka works through evil powers. There were some women in the



TALKING THROUGH WITCHCRAFT ... 355
community whom others believed to practice fermeka for their own malign intentions, but it was also widely supposed that people who were not capable of performing bewitchment themselves resorted to the services of magical specialists, mostly living in other settlements.29 Thus, practically anybody could have acted as a bewitcher without any occult knowledge, and practically anybody could have been suspected. When people talked about the possible motives of their bewitchers, envy was most frequently mentioned.30 They would say their attackers were jealous of their economic success or happy life, and had bewitched them so as to make them unable to progress or to lose everything. Occasionally other reasons, for example conflicts over property, a generally contentious relationship, or rivalry in love affairs were also suspected.31 In many narratives, however, especially in those related by uninvolved parties, no particular motive was mentioned at all, as bewitchments did not always have to be explained. It was and is seen as the manifestation of unconstrained, and often unconditional malice, which through the manipulations of evil powers would and could affect anybody. By contrast, in the case of the curse mass, misfortune is inflicted through the divine and not everybody may fall victim to it. This type of harmdoing was understood locally as a form of divine justice: people would beseech God through religious rituals performed by the Romanian Orthodox priest to punish their enemies. Conflicts leading to such retaliations were most frequently material in nature—theft, fraud, trespass, and disputes about land ownership or inheritance—but jealousy, adultery, or slander were also among the oft-cited motivations. It was firmly believed, though, that the curse mass was only effective against those who were really guilty, and if targeted at an innocent party, the punishment would fall back on those initiating it. Thus the curse mass functioned as a divine ordeal, which made it a risky business: only those could safely engage in it, who were 100% sure about having truth on their side. This feature made the curse mass at the same time the means of and a restrictive force on revenge. That Catholic or Protestant Hungarians resorted to the services of the Romanian Orthodox priests to seek revenge or justice for their grievances is well documented in Romania.32 All the information on how ‘paying a mass against someone’ was done is indirect and come from narratives that were—at least in the community I studied—told by someone other than the procurer of the ritual. From these it seems that a curse mass is



356 Á. HESZ
practically a votive mass, where the votum, the special intention of the mass is to ask God to make up for an injustice. This intention could be formulated explicitly, with people asking for concrete punishment for a particular person (‘let so and so be bedridden for the rest of his life’, ‘let the worms eat his body off the bier’), or it could be rather vague (‘God, please reveal who stole my money’, or ‘please let him suffer as much as I have’). In certain cases, additional rituals or action may accompany the mass. The priest may prescribe fasting for the procurer of the mass, to make it more effective, or they might also burn a certain number of candles while the mass, or series of masses, are celebrated; it is believed that the curse becomes irreversible if these candles have burned down. To what extent causing occult harm through the services of an Orthodox priest was a real practice, and how much of it was known to the church, is difficult to tell.33 It is equally difficult to estimate how many people did in fact pay masses in order to punish their enemies. While people admitted to turning to the Orthodox priest for healing and to pay masses for ‘good purposes’—that is, for health, a peaceful family life, and protection from maleficium34—I have only indirect information regarding actual curse masses. There are no narratives in my collection that were related from the perspective of a curse mass initiator, and I have not spoken to anybody who openly confessed to having paid masses for punitive purposes.35 There are only 6 texts (ca. 6% of all recorded narratives), which report on someone openly claiming to do so, but even these were second- or third-hand narratives related by the family members of the protagonist, or witnesses to their claims. Even those who had turned for help to the Romanian priest during their hardships were quick to assert that they had never wished anybody anything bad and had only paid masses for good purposes. Thus, in this community payment for the curse mass was almost always attributed: based on what they heard and observed, people concluded that one of their peers had resorted to priestly curses in the course of their troubles. However, since the healing and—assumedcursing practices of the priests were practically the same in terms of ritual, these conclusions may often have been drawn erroneously. The reason for this denial was the highly ambivalent moral judgement of the curse mass. Although people emphasised the divine, ordeallike nature of the priestly curse, most of my interlocutors expressed their disapproval, saying it was a sin, or ‘not nice wanting to hurt someone, to have somebody killed’, because it is against Christian morals; a view encouraged by the local Catholic clergy.36 On the other hand, people



TALKING THROUGH WITCHCRAFT ... 357
often talked about the curse mass as a righteous move, especially when the material, social or psychological damage thus avenged was a significant one: “my father-in-law had also paid [for a mass] somewhere, why, four of his big cows died, you see...”. Although they believed that God would punish every injustice, if not in this life, then after death, many of my interlocutors remarked that it was fairer if people doing harm to others suffered retribution in this world. The curse mass was very much part of the strategic tool-kit people could turn to in times of conflicts, and people must have often been torn between their morals and their desire for revenge. A clever way to solve this dilemma was to pay masses for God to reveal the identity of the originator of one’s suffering; a neutral and totally acceptable wish, but still one that entailed revenge, since God would usually do this by inflicting misfortune on the guilty. Formulating one’s request in this way clearly displaced responsibility, so much so that people suspected or accused of successfully inflicting God’s punishment on someone would use it as a defence, saying they had never wished anybody any harm and had only asked God to show who had hurt them. And while personal ill will was unacceptable on a moral level, people believed that the curse mass, by default, could not be unjust, for it could not go against God’s will. What it did was to bring forward divine punishment, which would befall on the guilty anyhow; but it would not operate if its target was innocent. In that sense the curse mass is the polar opposite of the maleficium exercised by or through a magical specialist, the fermekás, which would not select according to its victim’s merits. It is then reasonable to ask whether the curse mass (and the curse in general) should be classified as bewitchment. In a ‘technical sense’ it should not, since it operates through the divine, while bewitchment does so through demonic forces; the curse mass is an ordeal or divine judgement, while bewitchment is malice unrestrained. For analytical purposes, however, it is logical to consider the curse mass and its accompanying rituals as an integral part of the complex local system of bewitchment concepts, as has been done by Éva Pócs, who has called it a religious variant of witchcraft.37 There are three arguments supporting this approach. First of all, the ultimate driving force behind the curse mass and any kind of bewitchment is the wish to do somebody harm, and this harm is done through transcendental forces. Second, Orthodox priests were deeply involved in counter-actions against bewitchment, as more often then not people turned to them for diagnosis and curing. Counter-actions were always complex; besides going to the priests, people, in their despair,



358 Á. HESZ
usually also went to unwitchers, mostly to soothsayers who used cards or coffee-grounds for divination. Apart from prescribing various counter-rituals, which people had to carry out at home, these specialists often advised people to pay for masses to repel bewitchment, which people often paid to the Orthodox priest, considering their prayers more effective then that of their Catholic counterparts. The third—and for our subject the most important—reason for seeing the priestly curse as part of the local bewitchment complex is that, together with the fermeka, it forms one complex interpretational framework for misfortune. Without the curse mass, local discourse on bewitchment would be incomplete and incomprehensible. While there were certain kinds of mishaps—cows stopping giving milk, people falling in love with someone socially or physically not desirable—that were always attributed to fermeka, the two types of bewitchment mostly produced the same symptoms: chronic illnesses that doctors could not diagnose or cure, sudden or inexplicable deaths, suicides, permanent lack of economic luck or repeated farming misfortunes (e.g. deaths of cattle or other valuable domestic animals), a conflict-ridden family life, alcoholism or the inability to get married. So the same event could be attributed both to fermeka or to the curse mass. The various interpretations, however, assign very different roles to the parties involved, and thus yield very different connotations. In the case of the fermeka, the suffering parties are always seen as innocent, while their supposed bewitchers—if there are such—are guilty. The very opposite is true for the curse mass: since God’s wrath would not fall on the innocent, the victims are always considered guilty, either because they committed something against the initiator of the curse mass, or because they wrongfully launched a curse mass against someone. In the first instance the misfortunate are the victims of just revenge; in the second they are the victims of their own unjust revenge. This logic is clearly at work when villagers interpret mishaps around them. The priestly curse was hardly ever mentioned as a cause when people talked about their own troubles or the misfortunes of those close to them. I know only two cases when this happened38: on one occasion the curse was thought to have been transmitted from somewhere else, thus the narrator’s family was not the original target, and were not to blame for anything. On the second, the victim thought the curse had fallen on him for grazing his cattle on somebody else’s territory, which he thought its owner had abandoned—so the trespass was in good faith. In contrast, the occurrence



TALKING THROUGH WITCHCRAFT ... 359
of the curse mass as the root of trouble was significantly higher when people interpreted the misfortunes of others—a little fewer than half of the cases fell into this category.39 This did not mean that they always thought the victims guilty; in some cases alternative explanations were offered as well, for example that the priestly curse was ‘inherited’ from an ancestor, as it was commonly held that the curse would affect seven succeeding generations—in local terms, it was ‘looking for its lord’. As this example shows, the complex system of local bewitchment concepts offered an extremely flexible interpretive framework, which opened up space for various interpretations with often opposing connotations as to the roles and moral standings of the various protagonists. Owing to this flexibility, local bewitchment discourse becomes a very creatively adjustable language for understanding and constructing reality and managing social relations.
beWitChment as a subjeCt of Conversation
One of the core tenets of Favret-Saada’s work on Bocage witchcraft is that there is a thick veil of secrecy around it, which bears an impact on the accessibility of the subject to the researcher, and on the quality of the material they can collect. As she argued, people never talked about witchcraft merely to provide information or for the sake of phatic communion, and they did so for two reasons. Firstly, since witchcraft was fought with words, anything said were “moments in strategy”.40 Secondly, locals were very much aware of the low prestige of ‘superstition’ in mainstream, urban or elite discourse,41 thus they tried to avoid the subject or distance themselves from it whenever asked by an unbeliever or an outsider. Talking seriously about witchcraft, then, was confidential, and witchcraft discourse was restricted to believers. Thus, to get close to the heart of it, the researcher had to step in and take the position of either the victim or the unwitcher; otherwise he could only scratch the surface of the phenomena, as did folklorists, who wittingly or unwittingly represented the sceptical attitude of the “enlightened” elite.42 While Favret-Saada’s arguments were thought-provoking in terms of epistemological problems of anthropological fieldwork,43 the tabooing of witchcraft she described in the Bocage cannot be generalized. There are several works which prove that the uninvolved researcher is able to get beyond structured belief narratives relating past events, and glimpse into



360 Á. HESZ
the workings of contemporary witchcraft.44 These works also show that talking about witchcraft within the local community is not as restricted everywhere as Favret-Saada has claimed. In fact, it may not have been so in the Bocage either. In an illuminating critical review, Gregor Dobler, an economic anthropologist working in the same region, argued that people did seem to talk about witchcraft quite openly, even with him, who was by no means caught up in the discourse. According to Dobler, Favret-Saada had a different impression due to her choice of ethnographic methods: as he has pointed out based on the published version of her field diaries,45 she had never really mingled with locals in everyday situations for long, and thus could not see how witchcraft surfaced in casual, everyday interaction, or did not pay attention to it when she did so. By focusing on the victims and the process of unwitching—FavretSaada became the apprentice of an unwitching specialist—she studied witchcraft in a rather narrow context, where speaking about witchcraft followed special rules and showed peculiar characteristics. Thus while her insights into the “specialized” side of witchcraft discourse is undoubtedly invaluable, the picture she provides is somewhat restricted.46 My field experiences were in line with Dobler’s and others, and showed a seemingly stark contrast to Favret-Saada’s: witchcraft was not a rare topic of conversations and was not confined to the circle of believers. As scholarship on witchcraft has shown, witchcraft has always been a contested matter, with many different, often opposing discourses on it being current at the same time. This was not otherwise in this community either: apart from the believer’s discourse, the discourse of the unbeliever was also strongly present. There were always more interpretations at play when people tried to make sense of misfortune or tragedy, and rational and occult explanations were always measured up against each other in an argumentative manner. As we will see in the examples later, reasoning against understanding a particular case of mishap in terms of bewitchment could be versatile, and scepticism might have taken different forms and levels. yet even square disbelief in the reality of bewitchment did not hinder dialogue between believers and sceptics, who negotiated their different stances in—often—heated debates. Nor was there a clear-cut line between belief and disbelief on the level of discourse (and presumably, neither on cognitive level); people were familiar with both the bewitchment discourse and the discourse of scepticism (in its various forms), and may have alternated between the two in different situations.47 Belief and disbelief thus did not create two mutually exclusive interpretive communities—as is suggested in Favret-Saada’s



TALKING THROUGH WITCHCRAFT ... 361
works—48rather, they provided a dynamic for corporate interpretative processes. As a consequence, people would talk about bewitchment quite readily with the researcher as well. In the first years of fieldwork I never felt it was difficult to gain access to the subject: it came up in interviews on several occasions without me asking about it, and people often talked about their own cases as well. On one instance I was even able to accompany a friend to an unwitcher, and then partly follow, partly reconstruct their bewitchment narrative.49 I might have been lucky as well. When I first arrived at the village, witchcraft was very much ‘in the air’: many families in the neighborhood where I lived thought themselves bewitched, and not long before my arrival, an unwitcher had been invited to ‘take out fermeka’ in a nearby section of the settlement, offering a topic for conversation and heated debates for weeks.50 Although I was not looking for witchcraft stories, I was obviously interested when people talked about bewitchment during our interviews or conversations, and encouraged them to continue. After a while I learned to recognize cases and events that could have had something to do with magical harm according to the logic of local witchcraft beliefs, and applied the remarks which might have invited people to bring in bewitchment as an explanation. One strategy, for example, was to term an event or series of mishaps as csudás (strange) in an unassertive, contemplative manner. During most of these talks I acted as a researcher, and wanted to unravel the most I could about local concepts of bewitchment and their counter-rituals, or the logic behind them, along with the social relations underlying particular cases. In this sense, my questions were very different from the ones locals would ask, and obviously produced very different narratives and conversations. While these interviews did not reflect how people talked about bewitchment with each other, they did contain many hints on how they managed information about the subject: whom they shared their cases, how they got information about the cases of others, and what they thought about the strategies in disseminating this knowledge. Although most of my material came from interviews, on several occasions I was lucky enough to hear people discussing certain bewitchment cases or bewitchment in general; sometimes I was even lucky enough to record their conversations. This mostly happened during interviews I conducted with small groups of people—members of a household or random companies consisting of visiting friends, neighbors or relatives. The most valuable material, however, came from those occasions



362 Á. HESZ
when I just happened to be around people who spontaneously started to exchange their views about cases that they or the public interpreted as the consequences of bewitchment or a priestly curse. Since these interactions were often hard to follow for an outsider—a problem I will briefly return to in the next section—I sometimes had to interrupt them with questions for clarification; otherwise I tried to stay in the background. Other important sources were private conversations with friends about the bewitchment of their close or not so close acquaintances, after which I took notes or asked them to tell the stories again so that I could record them. These talks, addressed more to a friend than to the researcheror at least so I felt—were especially helpful to learn different interpretations of certain incidents and to track their spread within the community. During the years of my visit I became aware of 66 cases that were attributed either to fermeka or to the curse mass, and at least one of the parties was named.51 These incidents were then related in 96 narratives or segments of conversations, which I was able to record or summarise up in my diary. Of these, 40 texts considered the past or present cases of the narrators or their families, while 56 were about the troubles of others. This material, deriving from different types of speech situations, seems sufficiently versatile to give a glimpse into how and why locals talk about bewitchment. The next section deals with linguistic behavior characterizing local discourse on the subject.
When and hoW do PeoPLe taLk about WitChCraft?
When speaking about bewitchment, people followed particular patterns and verbal strategies depending on situation and communicative aims. For the researcher, the most familiar context is when in interview situations locals share their knowledge about bewitchment in the form of various forms of belief narratives. While interviews are artificial situations, similar texts may also be told in a rather similar manner in local discourse as well, for example at occasional gatherings of friends and neighbors, or at workplaces during breaks. One of my interlocutors, who had an exceptionally rich repertoire of belief narratives, learned most of his stories from an old co-worker while doing night shifts together. Most of the witchcraft stories that were told in such situations regarded people who had passed away long before, and tended to have a more traditional textual form with motifs (flying and gathering of witches, people



TALKING THROUGH WITCHCRAFT ... 363
tortured or taken away during the night) that hardly ever surfaced in the narratives explaining misfortunes of living people. Thus we may suppose that they were shared mostly for passing on knowledge about the world or for entertainment, and only rarely for providing information on the deeds of co-villagers.52 Some of the more recent incidents were also talked about in a similarly open manner. These cases were widely regarded in the community as the outcomes of a curse mass, and people talked about them quite openly with anybody.53 Most cases, however, were addressed more confidentially, and within a more selected circle. It is probably safe to claim that most exchanges on bewitchment happened through gossip in typical gossip situations.54 Gossip is a social phenomenon particularly resistant to definitions. As Nico Besnier has stated in his encyclopaedia entry “an airtight and universal definition of what constitutes gossip is probably not possible because the category itself is subject to context-dependent interpretations and contestations”.55 Most attempts at definition describe gossip as an informal, personal, and morally evaluative verbal exchange about people who are not present.56 Robert Paine in his seminal paper on the theory of gossip understood it rather as a form of information management, a particular mode of speaking through which people try to gain information by offering information in exchange. They do so to further different individual goals: to keep themselves updated on their social environment, to disseminate their own interpretations on certain events, or simply to maintain relationship with others. He argued that this exchange is rather business-like, in the sense that various pieces of information have different market value and are traded according to the logic of self-interest and profit: people want to gather more information than what they provide, and they want to get information relevant to their own purposes. Thus they are more willing to offer more valuable information when they want to learn about something that interests them, whereas they share less interesting information when only wanting to keep up the flow of information towards themselves.57 What makes a subject worthy of gossip could thus only be defined by context, but there are some general features that make certain information usually more valuable than others: reports about transgressions of community norms and morals, or information which is unfavorable to a person’s reputation or which is in stark contrast to the public persona they are maintaining58 for example, fare better on the ‘market’ than those less outrageous or more widely known. Bewitchment and its implications usually, but not always, fall into the first category.



364 Á. HESZ
While gossiping is an effective way of communication, it is also a risky business, which, if not practised with consideration and precaution, may seriously damage the reputation and the social network of an individual.59 To be identified as the source or transmitter of certain information could lead to serious conflicts, therefore special communicative strategies are applied to transfer, or at least distance, responsibility from the speaker. To this end, gossiping tends to be indirect and implicative through the massive use of reported speech, omissions, allusions, and ambiguous wording. By forcing the listener to make their own deductions instead of simply taking explicitly formulated messages, this mode of speech turns the process of interpretation into a joint venture, which also helps sharing individual responsibility.60
Due to the sensitive nature of bewitchment, the way locals talked about it often showed the above characteristics of gossiping. It was frequently introduced in a cautious and implicit manner, by dropping hints and implications. I will illustrate this with an excerpt from an interview. In this, I was talking with a woman about ritual change when she started speaking about a then recent conflict.61
A: He works there, that is, he also works there, and then he, (continuing in a lower voice) when they removed that thing [in a construction work], it was he who removed it. Allegedly, because we haven’t seen anything, and then we say it to no avail, and then, when hardly a month had passed, as far as I know, he had to work on something somewhere, and he fell and hurt himself very badly. Who? Pali?
A: Pali (almost whispering). He was hurt. And then he had to be taken by ambulance, can you imagine that? He had to be completely cared for. He could do nothing on his own. Oh my God...
A: And then they were happy, that family, and the people living there [at the site of the previous work]. They said he was punished for removing that thing. Yes.
A: And you know how people are. We are happy if someone is unfortunate, if something bad happens to someone. Did they say it was because he had taken that thing? A: yes. yes. Because they had cursed him. Who?
A: Well, that family.



TALKING THROUGH WITCHCRAFT ... 365
Ah. Because they were against it? A: yes, yes.
Ah, I see, I see. And how did they curse him? With the priestly curse?
A: Well... they said God should let him get into such and such trouble, because he had removed that thing. [she provides further details on the conflict, and takes the side of the allegedly cursed victim]
But they haven’t gone to the Orthodox priest...
A: (at a lower voice) Ah they have... they have... Have they?
A: They went there for sure. Because of this?
A: Well, who knows... they had been going somewhere, that is for sure, or who knows... so... I see. It wasn’t only them cursing, but they went as well [to the Orthodox priest].
A: yes, yes. yes.62
As could be seen, my interlocutor had introduced the subject of cursing very cautiously. The first hint that her account would be more than just the relating of an everyday working accident came when she lowered her voice and, before telling what happened, inserted the line, “allegedly, because we haven’t seen anything”, which was a common strategy for narrators to distance themselves from what they were saying. These indicators prepare the listener to look for an implied meaning, which in this case came through carefully supplied information. First my interlocutor told me that there were certain people who felt satisfaction over the woes of the misfortunate man and that they interpreted his accident as a fair punishment. Then, before accusing these people with the act of cursing the victim, she first explained away their reaction as the generally mischievous nature of mankind. Even after mentioning the curse, she hesitated to go as far as to blame them for launching a priestly curse, and only did so when I seemed to draw the wrong conclusion (that they did not go to the Orthodox priest). So she went with her accusation from mischief through individual cursing—which is a common habit and is considered much less effective than the priestly curse—to the curse mass, that is, from the morally petty or less serious vices to the hardly acceptable. And while doing so, she had masterfully tricked me into formulating this accusation; it is worth noting that she had not even uttered the words priestly curse or curse mass during our conversation, only confirmed my assumptions—sometimes in a rather evasive way (well, who



366 Á. HESZ
knows...). So in the end it was I instead of her who voiced the conclusion in a clear-cut manner; thus, the final interpretation seemed to be our common product. This strategy is not only helpful in shaking off responsibility, but gives people an opportunity to back out from the subject. In retrospect I realized that there were occasions when I had been offered the bait to discuss something in terms of bewitchment, but failed to take it. Once I was asked about the deteriorating condition of a mutual acquaintance, and received the remark, “it is precisely as it was predicted”, as a reaction to my answer. While I remember being somewhat startled, I did not ask my interlocutors what they meant and we immediately changed the subject. I am pretty sure now that they were referring to a former bewitchment diagnosis. The pattern of telling and then backing off, and then continuing with the story only to back off again was the most common feature of discourse on bewitchment:
And then others said that... well, we don’t know what we don’t know. That there was a girl in [...] who had a baby, well, that he would go there and make love to her, then she became pregnant, and had a baby—it even took after him. And then he was, well, they sued him, and he was even in jail for a while, and then she cursed him, or they might have had a mass served upon him... but what we don’t know, we don’t know, you see? And that’s why it happened so. But, well, we can’t know that. All that we know is that there was such talk.
This example illustrates another widespread strategy for distancing: the use of reported speech and frequent references to a general subject (they said, people said, it was said, it could be heard) so characteristic of gossip. Reported speech, as Donald Brenneis has pointed out, masks the identity of the speaking subject by pointing to others or the wider public as the real sender of the message, and allowing the actual speaker or speakers to take the role of the “mediator” or “mouthpiece”; a seemingly neutral stance.63 Through the use of reported speech, people indicate that what they are telling does not necessarily reflect their own opinion, and they are just reporting what others think or know, while they themselves are merely providing interesting information. In the passage above, my interlocutors made obvious efforts to stress their uncertainty on the truth-value of what they were just telling me. yet even so, and even despite their probably genuine scepticism, they did transmit the message,



TALKING THROUGH WITCHCRAFT ... 367
thus contributing to its currency as valuable information, and keeping it in the pool of collective knowledge, or collective memory in the case of past events and people.64 Another source of indirectness very typical in the local discourse on bewitchment is vagueness or elusiveness. Elsewhere I have already referred to the use of euphemisms when expressing suspicion, and pointed to the elusive nature of our first example in this chapter. Vagueness could also be achieved by the conscious omission of certain details. For example, people would only circumscribe the suspects instead of naming them, especially when they felt they could be overheard—as happened with two women who discussed an incident in the presence of their husbands. The case in question was a hot topic at the time, with many different interpretations in circulation; some people understood the events as a case of bewitchment, some as the outcome of a priestly curse, while others rooted for rational explanations. The women who, it seemed, regarded their husbands as untrustworthy audiences, were discussing the priestly curse version, which placed the guilt on the victim. I was told about their conversation some days later, when I was talking about the case with one of them:
And I heard about it back then, and Aunt Joli [the other woman] saidshe did not want to tell me who it was [the initiator of the priestly curse]. Do you know what I mean? The one who was attacked [by the latter victim].
But you know who it was...
Well, I said to Aunt Joli that I really heard about this back then, that [the victim] had shouted insults at that woman [the alleged initiator of the priestly curse]. And they [the husbands of the narrator and Aunt Joli] asked us whom we were talking about..., and I told Aunt Joli that it was a woman with brown hair, she was coming up the road, heading towards home. And Aunt Joli said: yes.
Also, people would sometimes try to avoid disclosing the identity of their sources, a wise strategy if one wanted to preserve one’s reputation as a trustworthy gossip partner. In the next passage, three women were telling me a story about a person, who was allegedly snatched away in the air by unidentified agents—fermekások, as my interlocutors implied. The conversation took place when A and C invited B to tell me about “old



368 Á. HESZ
stuff”, that is, beliefs of the past, since she was among the informants of a legend collection published in the 1980s.
A: Did you hear that Mrs. Kiss was carried away, at Mrs. Nagy’s house? B: yes, well yes, there is, there was, Mrs. Nagy had... C: She [Mrs. Kiss] was taken through the chimney. B: yes. C: In her nightie. B: And she said, the she... it was Mrs. Nagy who told you about it, wasn’t it? C: Who the hell knows where I heard it. I don’t know. B: As far as I know, it was Mrs. Nagy who spoke about it. C: I heard it somewhere. B: Nowhere else... C: But they [the Nagys] are not talking about it, because it was done by her. (they all laugh)
It is clear enough that C was reluctant to confirm the identity of her source, despite B’s insistence. B and C were relatives, while A was a friend of C, and lived in the neighborhood of the alleged bewitcher. And while she already knew the story—which was treated half-seriously, half-amusingly by the trio—C seemed to regard this information as too confidential to share. In addition, identifying her source in the alleged bewitcher would also have meant authenticating the story, which would have been, perhaps, far off her agenda. People resorted to the various forms of indirectness for fear of being accused of slander, or because they were afraid of putting their social relations at risk. For this reason they cautiously avoided speaking about certain cases in the presence of people whose relatives or allies were implicated, or they stuck to the interpretations favorable to them. For the same reason, people also often—but not always, as we shall soon see—tended to be obscure and indirect when formulating accusations against their own bewitchers. A man told me, for example, that when he suspected someone of taking the milk of his cow, he had publicly expressed his suspicion and even made threats to physically harm the perpetrator, but had not explicitly named her in his accusation, and even hinted at another suspect. Doing so, he was challenging his bewitcher without giving her the chance to fight back with accusation of slander, while also offering her an opportunity to amend damages. If people tended to speak about other people’s affairs with due consideration, they became more careful, even secretive, when it came to



TALKING THROUGH WITCHCRAFT ... 369
their own. As someone told me when I asked whether they had heard about cases of bewitchment: “you may hear about it, but we don’t, we don’t speak about it, everybody tries to amend their troubles on their own, as best they can”. They also tried to keep their visits to unwitchers and priests secret, by, for example, hitting the road while it was still dark outside. In a similar vein, prescribed counter-actions were also carried out secretly. There were basically two reasons for doing so. On the one hand, according to a commonly shared belief, witches could renew a bewitchment if they learned that counter-measures were being taken; and they could do so three times. On the other, since healing rituals are similar to alleged cursing or bewitching rituals, others could easily take visits to the religious or magical specialists, along with the counter-rituals, as bewitchment: “you pay masses for good, you know, but you have an enemy or something, who then would not think that you gave it for good, but to have him cursed or something”. And indeed, people would look for indications: a refusal to eat or drink, or longer journeys would often be taken as signs of magical action, positive or negative. While secrecy was the ideal behavior, bewitchment could never remain an entirely private affair, and not only due to unwittingly displayed signs. All my interlocutors had spoken about their troubles to a carefully selected circle of confidantes, as had their friends about their own. Even if they did not share all details with each other, they knew about one another’s woes and offered support. As has been documented elsewhere it was often acquaintances who pointed to bewitchment as a possible explanation.65 Neighbors or friends would also warn each other if they witnessed something suspicious: a rival fiddling about behind one’s barn, for example. It also frequently occurred that objects presumed to be bewitched were discovered by a larger company of people, for example during or after family feasts like weddings or funerals, when many acquaintances had gathered to help. On such occasions, identification of these items as bewitchments, and guesses about the identity and the motives of the possible bewitcher were made jointly by those present, and news of the incident went well beyond the boundaries of the family. Usually it was also friends and confidantes who suggested methods of counter-action, mostly visits to a certain specialist or priest. People often had to rely on others in pragmatic matters as well: those without a car, for example, had to arrange for a drive, and people who did not speak Romanian needed a translator to communicate with the Orthodox priest. I even know about a case when someone asked a friend to have



370 Á. HESZ
the Orthodox priest ‘open the Book’ on their behalf, and sent money to order masses for the general well-being of the family—a common remedy against magical attacks. People therefore could not and would not keep their bewitchment affairs secret. They did, however, very carefully select those to whom they disclosed the matter, and doing so took many aspects into consideration. Not all, and otherwise close and trustful friends were apt to be confidantes in all cases, since they might have been directly or indirectly related to people negatively implicated in the matter. A woman, for example, chose not to speak about her bewitchment case to one of her close friends and allies, because this friend and her family nurtured a good relationship with another family which was related to her alleged bewitcher, and she was afraid her bewitcher would learn about her being suspicious and taking counter-actions through this channel. Thus, by being secretive when it came to their own bewitchments, people attempted to control the public, rather than to totally exclude it. In fact, being a social phenomenon, witchcraft would not work without some amount of publicity: the state of being bewitched has to be acknowledged by at least some outsiders to be taken seriously; to be a social fact. Therefore—as we will see in the next chapter—people often used publicity rather strategically when it came to matters of their own bewitchment. As it has been shown in the previous examples, people usually talked about bewitchment in a fluid, conversational form. Characteristically these dialogues were full of references and untold details, not only because the speakers sometimes strove for a level of strategic vagueness, but also because they relied on a massive common background knowledge, which made it unnecessary for them to be more precise. This background knowledge involved shared ideas about the nature of bewitchment and bewitching, but also the knowledge of life histories of community members, along with their past and present relationships and conflicts with others.66 Without possessing all this information, these dialogues were difficult to follow, an almost impossible feat for an outsider. The next excerpt, which is taken from a heated debated revolving around whether a certain woman was a fermekás or not, is a good example of how people relied on their assumed common knowledge when talking about alleged cases of bewitchment67:
B: She was in agony, she couldn’t die... as, well, as such. C: It was said she stuck her head between two beds...



TALKING THROUGH WITCHCRAFT ... 371
A: But wait a minute. She might have run out of breath, or who knows how it happened, and she was alone. B: Well, people said she had also paid a curse mass against János and his family. A: Well, they say so, but I don’t know... B: And her son, what’s his name, this thing is after him as well, and what then... A: But listen, people also said that there was a piece of land at X. And they gave some money in advance for a piece of land to someone in y, but then never paid the rest. And those people were coming here for years to get the money, but they did not pay, and then it was through this, Aunt Mari even told me the name, the name of the owner of that land, you know. That was not an easy thing. And they were using it during their entire life.
Who, the family Nagy?
B: yes, and the man had died as, that is, he was confined to bed, his leg had been amputated, so... C: And his wife was bedridden a lot, as well.
To fully understand this section, one should first be familiar with the idea that a violent death-struggle was one sign of being a fermekás, or at least living a sinful life. So when debating the manner of the woman’s death, the speakers in fact were arguing about whether she was a fermekás or not. The listener should also know about the logic of the curse mass to understand that the section about the dubious land purchase and the subsequent illnesses of the buyers implied that their suffering was not due to the said woman’s evil workings but to another conflict in which they were rightfully punished through a curse mass. Speaker A introduced this story to argue further against the woman being a fermekás, and B and C, with their last comments, seemed to finally give into her version. The excessive usage of personal pronouns instead of naming the protagonists makes the dialogue even harder to follow for those not familiar with the underlying social relations; I remember desperately struggling to make any sense of it at the time. Presumably, the participants of the previous excerpt were already well aware of all the information that was shared during their debate. Due to this common knowledge of accusations and interpretations of certain incidents as bewitchments, it was often enough to drop a well situated comment to bring up bewitchment and get the intended message across. A woman, for example, whose husband was criticised by an acquaintance



372 Á. HESZ
for his heavy drinking, reacted with a quick riposte: “God save you from being in the same shoes,” by which she was implying that her husband’s misbehavior was down to bewitchment, and thus out of his control. These comments, which would often go unnoticed by outsiders, were the simplest successful communicative representations of bewitchment cases.
What PeoPLe do through taLking about beWitChment
People talked about bewitchment for different reasons and with different communicative aims. Since the position of the speaker was crucial, it would seem appropriate to address separately the way in which any speaker conversed about the bewitchment of others and of themselves. Although it may seem odd, I also include the accused in the latter category, since contrary to what Favret-Saada has found in the Bocage, in this community alleged bewitchers often chose to ‘talk back’ when they found themselves implicated in an incident of bewitchment. Moreover, the status of bewitcher is one that people could occupy openly, since one of the two possible ways of imposing magical harm, the curse mass, was widely regarded as a just revenge working through the powers of God. And while people considered it somewhat morally open to reproof, threatening one’s enemies with the priestly curse was not infrequent, and there were also some people—although not too many—who willingly admitted resorting to the priest’s services. As I have argued in the previous section, most people shared their information about bewitchment cases in the form of gossip. There, following Paine’s theory, I focused on the role of gossip as information management driven by individual interests and goals. However, theories of gossip, which combine individual goals of gossiping with its functions at community level have pointed out that while gossiping, people draw “a map of their social environment”,68 and through gathering and disseminating information for their own purposes, negotiate cultural rules and norms and their scope. Rapport thus calls gossip a meta-cultural process “through which individuals examine and discuss together the rules and conventions by which they commonly live”.69 When gossip is combined with witchcraft discourse, an effective way of speaking is coupled with powerful metaphorical language, creating an efficient mode of communication for those who believe in the reality of bewitchments. Witchcraft interprets misfortune in terms of personal



TALKING THROUGH WITCHCRAFT ... 373
relations by establishing socially and morally meaningful links between independent, and often only alleged, incidents. To understand events within the realm of witchcraft is always morally laden, for its traditional schemes cast the protagonists into “good” and “bad” roles. As was shown in the section about local ideas on magical harm, the dual system of “bewitchment” offers a very flexible framework in this sense. People smitten by mishap may either be seen as innocent victims or as sinners punished for transgressing various social norms, while their opponents may be regarded as evil wrongdoers, rightful avengers or passive ‘supporting actors’ (if the victims unjustly paid a curse mass against them). It is also up to subjective interpretation as to who—if anyone—would be drawn into the role of the opponent, because most people and families had more than one strained relationship in the past (or present), not to mention that priestly curses and former sins were also believed to affect many generations. Locals applied this framework creatively. While there were some incidents that were interpreted rather unanimously in the community, most cases gave rise to many conflicting versions—rational explanations being among them. I know of eight cases which had two, three or more interpretations, apart from the rationalistic reading of events. When a relatively young woman with teenage children died of terminal illness, there were narratives about her family believing she was bewitched, and seeking the help of unwitchers before turning to doctors. According to another version, she had groundlessly accused a woman of having a relationship with her husband, and this woman had a curse mass uttered against her for unjustly ruining her reputation. Some people were rather sceptical about both these versions, arguing that her illness was hereditary—thereby providing a third interpretation of her death. In another case, the spectacular illness and later death of an old man long dead by the time of my fieldwork was attributed to a curse mass, but two of his previous conflicts were brought up in connection with it in two different versions. According to the one, he had an illegitimate child whose mother paid a curse mass against him for not marrying her. In the other, he was hit by the curse because he was illegally using someone’s land. His widow, on the other hand, confided that some people had suggested that her husband’s death was triggered by “an evil person” (i.e. was due to fermeka), although she did not seem to give much credit to this when we spoke. In a third incident, a middle aged man accused his own mother of bewitching his son—her own grandson—while others



374 Á. HESZ
attributed the troubles of the family to a third person with whom they had a dispute over land. The contesting implications of the various versions are clear enough. Interpretation is deeply embedded in social relations, with the narrators’ relationships with or attitude toward the protagonists influencing how they see certain incidents, and what roles they assign to the different actors.70 In the first case described above, the priestly curse version was told to me by a fictive kin of the woman slandered by the victim. Although she told me all three interpretations, she seemingly gravitated towards this variant. In the second, the widow of the dead man was inclined to see her husband’s death in rational terms, connecting it to an accident that had taken place many years prior to his passing, and only hesitantly mentioned fermeka, which is nevertheless an interpretation absolving the victim of any responsibility. She never mentioned the curse mass versions. In the third, the second version, which saw the source of the magical attack outside the family, was promoted by a woman who was distantly related to this family by marriage, and had, in addition, a very tense relationship with the woman she implicated. It seems that people—instinctively or deliberately—tended to interpret incidents in ways favorable to the parties they liked or were somehow related to. The suicide of a relatively young woman is a rather good illustration for the emotions and motives influencing the interpretative process. I learned about her death from a friend, with whom she was in a close, confidential relationship. This woman, clearly shaken by her death—suicide was traditionally seen in the community as a cardinal sin, and thus an impediment to salvation—told me she was inclined to believe her friend had only committed suicide because she was bewitched by fermeka. This suspicion originated from the dead woman herself, who had told her earlier that she had been diagnosed as bewitched by an unwitcher. Her friend, being somewhat sceptical about the reality of fermeka, showed considerable hesitation when talking about this possibility; nevertheless, her love for her friend made this explanation the most easily acceptable for her. Moreover, a dream, in which she saw the unfortunate woman at the side of the Virgin Mary, convinced her that an evil force must have been at work71:
Therefore I... I never... I never really believed in unwitchers and in fermeka, but I... I’m saying that (whispering) it was done through fermeka. It was not her.



TALKING THROUGH WITCHCRAFT ... 375
yet, if someone commits suicide, the responsibility of those closest to them would also be an issue. In this particular case it was no secret that the dead woman had some conflicts within her family, and so her husband and his family could have rightly expected to be blamed for what had happened. To veer off criticism, they had, according to one of my interlocutors, interpreted the events in a way that took responsibility away from them and placed it on the shoulders of the dead woman. I heard this explanation from a woman who was only indirectly related to the victim:
After she hanged herself, they [the parents-in-law of the dead woman], they went [to the Orthodox priest] and had the book opened to see why this had happened, you know? To see what caused her death. Did they? Her parents-in-law? Or they only say so to protect themselves; you cannot know, you know, this... And then they would learn that she, she believed her husband had someone. Had a lover, you know. And then, that [she paid a mass] for that woman to die a miraculous death. And that her husband had nobody, and the curse fell back on her. you see? It was spoken at that time, so, and... if it was her husband’s parents who tried to... To circulate this?
But it was the parents of her husband, her parents-in-law, who went to the priest, you know, because of it. To see what the reason was, and then they said, this was the reason that she had paid a mass... because we heard that it was spoken that she [the dead woman] was convinced her husband having somebody, she was jealous [...].
Other variants of this version also circulated in the community. One omitted the involvement of the Romanian Orthodox priest, claiming that it was the woman herself who had cursed her rival during a tense moment. Another introduced an additional party to the events by alleging that the curse mass was paid for by the woman she had unjustly accused of having a relationship with her husband. Although the version I heard of this latter variant—related to me by someone not connected to the protagonists in any way—left the implicated woman anonymous, people were gossiping about her identity. The existence of various versions and the comments added to them suggest a strategic use. If speaking about “wars of discourse” may be a little exaggerating, it is clear that there were instances when people did



376 Á. HESZ
want to win the public over to the interpretations they preferred the most. It is a rather serious game over the reputation of others or of the narrators: these narratives could be—and sometimes indeed weredeployed to defend or undermine people’s positions in the community. A staff member of the local dairy company, who collected the milk from the farmers, told me about a woman who regularly implicated her own mother in taking the milk from other people’s cows:
[...] they were on bad terms, that is, her daughter never visited her. She did not visit her, and they always denigrated the old woman, they are still not getting along. [...] And they bring milk to us, and every time she comes, she always smears the old woman, and asks after the degree [of the fatness of her milk], and I tell her how much it is, and, well, her milk is thick indeed, her milk is so good, and if it is so through good things [naturally]... because people say she is not a good old lady either. Whether it [the milk] is so good through goodness, or how it is, I don’t know, but it is good. And then she [the daughter] calls her names, that she is a stupid old hag, and so on...
As the hesitation of the narrator and the existence of different interpretations show, there were no dominant narratives; different understandings of events existed side by side. People were often familiar with all—or at least more than one—reading of a case, and passed them on simultaneously, sometimes sharing even the variants they did not credit. When they talked about the various possible explanations to a curious event, transmission was far from being passive: they renegotiated the different versions, measured them against their existing knowledge, and argued for or against them. When somebody talked about an old woman’s allegedly violent death, which many considered to be proof of her practice as a fermekás, she hesitatingly mentioned, as a counter-argument, the religiousness of the accused:
How was her death?
That she was stuck between the beds, she was an old woman, but... although I don’t... she was regularly at the church, but that... We heard it so, anyway.
It is not necessary for an explanation of misfortune to be fully accepted to ‘work’. What really mattered was the fact that they were being circulated throughout the community: people knew about them, discussed



TALKING THROUGH WITCHCRAFT ... 377
them and transmitted them. Many who passed these narratives on were not in any way concerned in the incidents, and thus had no particular agenda when sharing them with others. Talking about these incidents and considering different options as explanations were part of the process of understanding the world, both culturally and socially. The narratives contributing to this process had, nevertheless lasting effect, since they became integrated into the life history of individuals and families,72 and the different roles they imposed on the protagonists shaped their reputation. While recent incidents of misfortune were, obviously, hot topics which kept the public excited for days or weeks, narratives of the past were also often mobilized in various contexts. Some of the stories told to me during casual conversations or interviews on other subjects dated back years or even decades, and were narrated to support certain ideas about how the world is, or to illustrate the morals of the community. These versions also formed a pool of collective memory, which people could rely on when having to interpret recent cases, as happened after the death of the farmer described in the introduction of this article: some people vaguely connected his death to former cases of bewitchment of his ancestors. Although in his case linking past and present events was more of a suggestion than a claim, it nevertheless opened up grounds for understanding his actions in terms of bewitchment. At a more general level, interpreting certain events within the framework of bewitchment also provides an opportunity to discuss moral issues and social norms: what counts as sin and in what circumstances, what behavior is acceptable and what should be deemed inappropriate. To see someone’s death as a result of a priestly curse given for cheating in business, or for theft, is a strong argument for fair and honourable conduct. To understand personal disasters as a punishment for any kind of slander may emphasise the unacceptability of ruining people’s reputations, social relations, or peace within their families, by accusing them with something they have not committed. To connect a series of mishaps to disputes over inheritance gives speakers an opportunity to discuss—unwritten—local rules of inheritance and the rights of the various parties. Cases attributed to a priestly curse also served to discuss the acceptable proportion of revenge: is the death of three grown cows, public humiliation, or the theft of a given sum monstrous enough for mortal punishment? Should people leave punishment as the capacity of God? Is revenge appropriate for a true Christian at all? These questions were subjects of frequent and endless discussions when it came to



378 Á. HESZ
bewitchment and curses, with particular cases and former opinions being cited as pros and cons. People’s stances on the subject shifted, depending on the context of their discussion and the circumstances of the debated events. Although consensus was never reached when it came to debating moral issues or the various interpretations of misfortunes, people were constantly shaping and readjusting their moral and social environment through speaking about bewitchment. If people sometimes talked about the bewitchment cases of others with a strategic purpose in mind, they always did so when voicing their own troubles. They would choose to speak about bewitchment for many purposes and in various speech situations, most of which were not so much different from the speech situations when talking about the cases of others. It was observable, though, that the two main forms of bewitchment were mentioned with different aims. One purpose in talking about bewitchment was to put pressure on one’s enemies. While, for obvious reasons, practically no one threatened anyone with launching a fermeka, there were many who publicly announced they would go to the Orthodox priests to order a curse upon their offenders. As has been documented elsewhere,73 people often used the institution of the priestly curse for normative purposes, particularly when something had been stolen from them. After the incident, they would go around the village and talk about their intention of paying a curse mass against the unidentified thief, hoping that he would return the stolen object; the strategy, at least according to the narratives, had often proved successful. Others would use this method to stop their enemies from disseminating slander or to force them to back out of conflicts over inheritance. The claim, “God will reveal who is right and who is wrong”, could sound rather discouraging in many situations. Some made such threats simply to inflict fear upon those who had offended them: someone told me that after being insulted, he wanted his opponents to feel the same distress he had, so he voiced his intention of going to the Orthodox priest. As this example shows, threatening with a curse mass may also provide psychological relief, a compensation for humiliation and an outlet of anger and revenge for those who could not retaliate their grievances in any other way. Most of these threats were made indirectly: people talked about them to uninvolved parties, kin, friends, neighbors, or people they had simply met in the street or in the shop, hoping that gossip would take their message to the intended listener, whose identity they often did not even



TALKING THROUGH WITCHCRAFT ... 379
know. Some people, however, did not shy away from direct personal confrontation. The next text describes such an interaction:
[...] they went to X [a settlement with an Orthodox church] and bought three or two black candles, or they said three, I could not tell, and they were going with these candles, when Uncle Tóni was coming from the market. He’d bought some vegetables there. And then one of them told him: “Well, Tóni, we are going to such a place now [to the priest] that you will very much regret stealing that money”. And then the old man [Uncle Tóni] said, he just turned back, put his hands together, and said: “Let God help you to go there in a good hour, and let God always help you in your progress.” He said only that much.
In this particular case—according to the narrator, a relative of Uncle Tóni—the threat was followed by action, but the enemies of the old man soon found themselves on the grieving side: several of their family members died in quick succession, not only because they had wrongly accused him, but also because the money was actually stolen by their own son. Apart from showing us how open threats might have been made, this narrative is a good example of how talking about bewitchment is used for manipulating people’s reputations. I heard the story during an interview with three people, a married couple and their neighbor, a relative of Uncle Tóni. They were discussing who was able to bewitch through fermeka and who was known for habitually launching curse masses on their enemies, when this narrative was told as a counter-narrative in the defence of Uncle Tóni. As my interlocutors hinted, some people accused him of paying for a mass against the unfortunate family, and therefore severed all contact with him. The narration I was told therefore defended the old man on two fronts, and cleared him both from the charges of stealing and of causing other people’s death, even if through the workings of God. For this interpretive group, the consecutive deaths of the accusers without doubt indicated the innocence of the old man. Accusing someone as one’s own bewitcher is another reason for bringing up the topic of bewitchment. As has been mentioned in the previous section, direct, face-to-face public accusations of performing fermeka were rare, and when people did voice their suspicion, they tried to wrap it up in ambiguity. To avoid conflict, many people were equally cautious when talking about their cases to third parties, which often happened in private, confidential situations.74 Some people, however,



380 Á. HESZ
decided to push their case to the extreme, and made their accusations in front of a wider public—during kalákas, for example, even if this meant escalating their conflict. A long and fierce feud over property between two families—family “A” and family “B”—is a good example of how participants translated their conflict to the language of bewitchment, with both families disseminating several interpretations of the events. I would not go as far as to suggest that this move was coolly calculated for strategic purposes; in times of distress people react according to ingrained cultural and social patterns, and understanding one’s troubles as an outcome of bewitchment was a common, psychologically and socially rewarding way of seeing and representing things. But let us look at a short summary of the case: after years of bitter feuding, a member of family “A” died suddenly, after which her family accused family “B” of having her “killed” through transcendental forces.75 By way of reply, family “B” came up with counter-interpretations. In their reading, it was family “A” who had paid for masses to harm them, but the curse had backfired, because it was they who were to blame in their feud. They also introduced a version which went beyond their initial conflict, but nevertheless placed the blame on their rivals. According to this, family “A” had been illegally using a plot of land whose owner in turn had cursed them through the Orthodox priest. Meanwhile, family “B” also denied having paid for masses against family “A”, although they did admit to having cursed them privately for all the injustices they had done. Both families made efforts to win the public over by talking about the case and making their interpretations known in the community. Bewitchment as a framework lent an extra dimension to their rather earthly conflict, and legitimated their stances. In playing the bewitchment card and accusing their rivals with occult murder, family “A” were emphasising the evilness and moral corruption of family “B”. Family “B”, in turn, used the logic of the priestly curse to turn the tables on their rivals, and point to their aggression and illegal conduct. With their second version they even killed two birds with one stone: on the one hand it suggested that family “A” had a habit of claiming other people’s land, while on the other it cleared them of accusations of magical aggression. The implications of the various interpretations were not lost on the general public: while many had criticised both parties for their fighting and gossiping over their feud, I heard someone concluding that the death in family “A” showed they were wrong, since “God is always right and punishes sinners”.



TALKING THROUGH WITCHCRAFT ... 381
As this case shows, interpretation of certain events in terms of bewitchment could be used to legitimate one’s position in a dispute. Here, the victim’s family applied this framework first, but there were several occasions when the mishap of someone was interpreted by their rivals as the consequence of a priestly curse. An old man, for example, being a rare representative of self-proclaimed curse-mass payers, bragged after the sudden death of his enemy in a property conflict that he had paid for a curse mass against him, and that God had proved he was in the right. While curse mass victims were deemed guilty, the victims of fermeka were always innocently attacked. Some examples cited in this paper have already shown that seeing something as a consequence of fermeka could take responsibility away from the victims. People may have used this explanation to save face when they or their family members transgressed moral and social norms: committing suicide, falling in love with unacceptable partners, having marital problems or failing to carry out their daily duties.76 Alcoholism and its repercussions—bad conduct, strained family life, a general inability to progress economically, or a downward spiral in living standards—were also often attributed to fermeka by the family of the addicted. People resorted to such explanations in various situations to make excuses for their troubled family members, and so their status as bewitched was well known—at least in circles that mattered: kin, friends and allies. Reactions varied from sceptical to supportive; some thought the addicted should nevertheless fight against their demons; some gave advice for countermeasures, while others responded by relating similar experiences of their own. While some people had their doubts, these explanations had a profound psychological effect both on the addicted and on their environment. Seeing them as innocent victims of somebody else’s ill will instead of norm-breakers, family members and acquaintances turned to these individuals with more patience and understanding, which made family life a little easier to bear.77 In these cases, the identity of the bewitcher was often secondary; it was the state of being bewitched, rather then the origin of bewitchment that counted—the explanation worked well without a culprit. Discourse on bewitchment could also be employed in manipulating the dynamics of social relationships. By talking about the bewitching activities of others, people could be brought to a common platform against a certain person, as happened in a rather peculiar case I was

lucky enough to witness. Here, a woman—let’s call her “A”—creatively applied the discourse to establish a friendship with someone she had formerly considered her enemy. She confessed that she had originally held this person, “B”, to be her bewitcher, but during the course of identification she realized it was actually a third woman, “C”, her closest friend at the time, who, at the same time, was the greatest rival of “B”. She also told “B” how “C” had been endlessly accusing “B” of repeatedly bewitching her, and had provided all the details of these often rather imaginative accusations. In addition, she attributed her former attraction to “C” as an outcome of bewitchment, and therefore something beyond her will and inclination. She also emphasised that her former suspicion of “B” was also due to “C’s” deceit. “A”, then, successfully mobilized the language of bewitchment to cast “C” into the role of the common enemy, against whom her newly founded ally with “B” could be defined and strengthened. As we have been able to see in various examples described above, people also talked about bewitchment from the position of the accused. Being implicated in bewitchment either as someone applying fermeka, or as a victim or initiator of a curse mass, did have an impact on the individual’s position and relations. Accusations led to various degrees of marginalization: people tried to avoid those commonly believed to be fermekás; they refused, if they could, to accept food or gifts from them, and did everything to keep them away from their houses. Although in many situations good manners prevented people from directly expressing their rejection,78 most suspects were very much aware of their reputation. Notorious curse mass payers were likewise shunned; people found it wise not to have anything to do with them in order to avoid conflict. Although some may have capitalized on this situation and exploited people’s fears for petty advantage,79 most felt hurt and became uneasy when contacting people: an otherwise popular woman for example, who was accused of fermeka by her mother-in-law, stopped visiting anybody on Tuesdays and Fridays, the days of the fermekás, lest people thought she came with bad intentions. Being accused was an attack against one’s reputation; accusers “ate one’s honour away”, as someone put it, thus a reaction of some kind was necessary. To do so, the accused had several strategies at hand. One was to remain silent and act as though nothing had happened. Most of them, however, chose to talk back, although the discourse they chose followed different lines. As shown earlier, a common strategy was to come up with



TALKING THROUGH WITCHCRAFT ... 383
and disseminate counter-narratives which pointed to other bewitchers, or, most frequently, following the logic of the priestly curse, to somehow pass the blame to the victims. Another possible and often applied counter-action was to complain about being slandered and try to convince the community at large of the absurdity of the accusations:
A: And then the old woman was complaining that ‘those people’, she said, ‘did a shitty thing with me, they filled the village that I have bewitched them. [...] So she was complaining here at our house about this, and afterwards I did not believe anybody. I don’t think that the old woman is exactly a witch, but such... B: you don’t believe it? A: ...but once someone is blamed in the village, village folk are, but...
This dialogue took place between a husband and wife, and while the wife sympathized with the accused and blamed the power of gossip for her bad reputation, her husband was more than convinced that she was a fermekás—and cited other incidents to prove his stance. Some people denied accusations by bringing up rational arguments. Victims of a series of mishaps and family members of those whose death was interpreted as the outcome of a curse mass insisted that their troubles were due to fate or natural causes. Others accused of performing fermeka often took the position of the sceptic and repeatedly questioned the existence of bewitchment. In the next excerpt, besides coming up with a practical argument, the accused appropriated the church’s discourse on bewitchment, claiming it a superstition, something of the past:
A: So. She, she [her mother-in-law] said she is ill because I have bewitched her. Really?
A: So. And then I’m offended because of this, because I would never, well, I have to die too, and I wouldn’t take anybody’s sins on myself, and it is me who has to care for her [if she is ill] anyway, isn’t it? She is eighty-something, and I have confessed this to the priest, and the priest told me she suffers from dementia. And he said to me, I should consider that she, she was born in 1918, to a world which was way more backward than ours. Well, I’m not saying that we are living in such a very developed world, we are back here, but he said that I should think about how much more backward her way of thinking is. He tried to console me with this.



384 Á. HESZ
Turning to the priest seemed to be common strategy: many accused confessed to him that they had been wrongfully implicated and their reputations ruined. Apart from receiving solace from him, they also used his authority to give more weight to—to legitimate, so to say—their claims of innocence. As we have seen so far, interpretation of events within the logic of bewitchment or the curse mass was always contested, and people—sometimes even those involved—usually wavered among different interpretations. In a generally religious community, as this one happened to be, the fact that someone had turned to the priest in these matters was a strong argument for their innocence. As someone has remarked regarding a particular case: “Had she been wrong [had she practiced fermeka], she wouldn’t have told the priest about it.”
ConCLuding remarks
On the previous pages I have tried to demonstrate the many ways local people talked about bewitchment, as well as the various purposes behind their doing so. The complex conglomerate of local ideas on magical harm, where demonic and divine powers may lead to the same set of misfortunes, provided a very flexible framework for interpretation. Depending on their position and degree of involvement, people were able to understand—and present—certain events in ways most acceptable to them. Talking about bewitchment was almost always about reputation: with its many implications it shaped personal histories and public images of individuals or families. Although not all references to witchcraft served a particular and well-defined agenda, it is also clear from the examples that people often talked about bewitchment with strategic aims. When people talked about certain events in terms of witchcraft, they were discussing and manipulating their social environment. While talking about bewitchment definitely had the potential to shape social relations and individual reputations, one should never forget that it was subject to contestation at many levels. First of all, witchcraft as a valid framework for interpreting the world could be contested; and was contested by some who generally considered it a misconception. Second, people who generally accepted the existence of bewitchment often questioned its relevance in respect to certain cases, and rooted for rational explanations instead. And third, the various interpretations of particular cases were contested and measured up against each other within the discourse of bewitchment. Scepticism therefore was an integral part of the



TALKING THROUGH WITCHCRAFT ... 385
local bewitchment discourse, with people permanently swaying between different possible explanations and adjusting their stance to context and situation. Even so, with all the questioning and hesitation, talking about bewitchment was an integral part of all the processes—discursive and otherwise—through which people constructed and renegotiated the world around them.

The use and definition of the term ‘legend’ has been subject to ongoing debates in folkloristics. Following the proposition of Linda Dégh, ‘What is Belief Legend’, Folklore, 107 (1996), 33–46; ead., Legend and Belief (Bloomington: Indiana UP, 2001), a more extended understanding has been becoming widespread in the last decades, which does not approve of the various subcategories of the legend (e.g. belief legend, historical legend etc.), nor does it make the classic distinction between memorate (first- or second person experience stories) and fabulate (narratives with fixed form and anonymous characters). Dégh, along with other scholars (e.g. Timothy R. Tangherlini, Interpreting Legend. Danish Storytellers and Their Repertoires. New york and London: Garland Publishing, 1994, https://books.google.hu/books?id=c7SgBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT8&lpg=P T8&dq=tangherlini+interpreting+legends&source=bl&ots=noXy3AlIU 9&sig=XzDVknKeeIL6kaFkL8EZVJ0IiCQ&hl=hu&sa=X&ved=0ahU KEwiHzo68_6TOAhUJbRQKHblRBsUQ6AEINzAE#v=onepage&q= tangherlini%20interpreting%20legends&f=false (accessed: 25/05/2016)

argued that the form of the legend is context dependent, and most narratives on beliefs come in a fluid, often conversational form; see also Gillian Bennett, ‘Belief Stories: a Forgotten Genre’, Western Folklore, 48 (1989), 289–311. These, nevertheless, have the main function of the legend, which is to help “understanding of the nature of the world and human experience” (Bennett, ‘Belief Stories’, 305), therefore, they should be understood as legends, even in the lack of fixed and traditional textual forms. While I accept this usage, I will also use the expression ‘belief narrative’ in this paper as a synonym for legend. 18. Tangherlini, Interpreting Legend. 19. Ibid. 20.

Writing about contemporary witchcraft is a difficult enterprise which raises serious ethical questions. Although I know that the most ethical step would be not to write about the subject at all, I hope to protect my informants and the whole community by clinging to some modes of representation. Apart from keeping the identity of the settlement and those concerned undisclosed, I will try to present my examples in the least factual manner, and only provide those details that are well known in the community. My protective measurements will not go as far as Marion Benedict’s ‘Fact Versus Fiction: An Ethnographic Paradox Set in the Seychelles’, Anthropology Today, 1 (1985), 21–23, who wrote fictive narratives and dialogues to illustrate local witchcraft discourse. I will quote fragments of actual interviews, but will omit all the details that would link actual people to the dialogues or to the cases mentioned in them. 24. I will not, for example, discuss thoroughly the magical actions involved in bewitchment and counter-bewitchment. I will address these matters in more detailed manner in an upcoming article. 25.

27. The Hungarian term for the witch, boszorkány, is used in local discourse with a slightly different meaning: it usually denotes a figure that is usually blended with the figure of the szépasszony, a typical name for fairies in Hungarian belief narratives; on the szépasszony in Hungarian beliefs see Éva Pócs, Fairies and Witches at the Boundary of South-Eastern and Central Europe (Helsinki: Academia Scientiarum Fennica, 1989); and ead., Between the Living and the Dead. A Perspective on Witches and Seers in the Early Modern Age (Budapest and New york: CEU Press, 1999). The usual wrongdoings of these beings are the torturing of horses in the stable, or feasting in desolate houses during the night. Some narratives with well-known witch-motifs—e.g. flying in the air, turning into an animal, being able to enter a room through the keyhole, or turning someone into a horse for a night—also call their perpetrators boszorkány. Occasionally, there is some overlap between the boszorkány and the living magical specialist: very rarely some of the above mentioned belief-motifs were attached to members of the community whom others suspected of practicing bewitchment, and some people sometimes used the term boszorkány as the synonym for fermekás. They mostly did so, however, in interview situations, and most probably as a result of my questions. Thus, although the boundaries between the semantic fields of fermekás and this local type of boszorkány are somewhat blurred, it is probably fair to say that in most cases the two terms denote distinct figures that appear in different contexts. 28. The Hungarian word csuda or csoda means ‘wonder’. 29. I only know of two local women who were rumoured to offer bewitchment as services. They also acted as fortune-tellers. The methods attributed to ‘witches’ were similar to what we know from all over Europe from witch trials and from folklore materials. 30. In the scholarly study of witchcraft envy, or perhaps more precisely the fear of it is commonly held the key force behind witchcraft as a social and cultural phenomenon. 31. It is interesting to note that accusations of those whom one had hurt or let down according to community morals—a pattern dominant in certain regions during the time of witch-hunts (Alan Macfarlane, Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England. A Regional and Comparative Study (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1970); Briggs, Witches and Neighbors, 135157; and also featuring in Hungarian folklore materials—is not present in my material at all. As we will see, vengeance is associated with the curse mass). 32. Dóra Czégényi has given a detailed summary of the material and a thorough overview of researches on the subject in her compilation of belief narratives on the figure of the Romanian priest, published in 2014:



TALKING THROUGH WITCHCRAFT ... 389
Dóra Czégényi (ed.), A mágikus erejű pap [Priests with magical power] (Kolozsvár: Erdélyi Múzeum Egyesület, 2014). Most of the works are publications of belief narratives, but there are some that are more analytical in their perspective: see for example Keszeg, Vilmos ‘A román pap és hiedelemköre a mezőségi folklórban’ [The Romanian priest and his beliefs in the folklore of the Transylvanian Plain], Ethnographia, 107 (1996), 335–369 and ead., ‘Egy rontáseset.

Studies on the anthropology of religion from the Carpathian basin] (Budapest: Balassi, 2016), 123–206. 33. For lack of space I cannot address this problem in more detail here. It seems likely though, that there was an equivocal compatibility (João de Pina-Cabral, Between China and Europe: Person, Culture, and Emotion in Macau (New york: Continuum, 2002) at play between the priest and their Hungarian clients when it came to curse masses: both parties considered their communication successful, although, not sharing a common language the priest and his clients may have interpreted their interaction differently (see also: Takács, ‘“Bal kezébe”’, 186–187). 34. I will return to the Orthodox priest’s healing practices later in this chapter. 35. In this respect my material is different from those collected by Tünde Komáromi and Éva Pócs at other locations: both of them have reported



390 Á. HESZ
about people confessing to paying for curse masses (Komáromi, Rontás és társadalom, 57 and Pócs, ‘Curse, Maleficium’, 177). 36. My interlocutors always stressed that Roman Catholic priests would adamantly refuse to perform masses with “wrong” intentions, and were very much against the alleged custom of the curse mass. There is one narrative in my collection, however, that tells about a certain Catholic priest from a nearby village, who celebrated a cursing mass against his enemies, and there are some others collected in other regions, which report on priests of Roman Catholic or other denominations exercising punitive magical practices against thieves or other criminals (Peti, ‘The Role of Black Magic’, 179; Czégényi, A mágikus erejű pap, 311–330). 37.

Her work is often mentioned in methodological discussions regarding the position of the anthropologist in the field, and it is cited as an example for going native, or as an argument for a more involved and admittedly subjective ethnography—see for example: Katherine Ewing, ‘Dreams from a Saint: Anthropological Atheism and the Temptation to Believe’, American Anthropologist, 96 (1994), 573; Barbara Tedlock, ‘From Participant Observation to the Observation of Participation: The Emergence of Narrative Ethnography’, Journal of Anthropological Research, 47 (1991), 84; Willem de Blécourt, ‘The Witch, her Victim, the Unwitcher and the Researcher: The Continued Existence of Traditional Witchcraft’, in Bengt Ankarloo and Stuart Clark (eds), Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: The Twentieth Century (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999). 44.

At one point, however, many years into my relationship with the community, I felt shut out from the discourse by some of my regular interlocutors; they stopped discussing cases of bewitchment or curse masses with me, and even claimed they were not ‘dealing with it’ any more. This change of attitude stood in stark contrast to their former behavior, and the reasons for it are still unknown to me (although I could think of several possible explanations). This turn, however, did not mean that others did not drop an occasional remark or tell a story about bewitchment in my presence. 51. Narratives that tell the stories of unidentified protagonists or are definition-like statements of bewitchment-related knowledge are not included in this number. While these may be informative regarding local concepts on bewitchment, witchcraft or priestly curses, they do not reveal much about underlying social relations and personal contacts. 52. According to Vilmos Keszeg, narratives that are told with these aims are usually triggered by the speech situation or narrative context, Vilmos Keszeg, Hiedelmek, narratívumok, stratégiák [Beliefs, narratives, strategies] (Kolozsvár: BBTE Magyar Néprajz és Antropológia Intézet and Kriza János Néprajzi Társaság, 2013), 301. 53. I was told that someone had allegedly even told the victim’s family not to lament over their troubles because they were an outcome of a curse mass they themselves had initiated. 54.

To see a dead person at a pleasant location or in the company of a saintly figure was generally interpreted as a sign of salvation. Since it was widely held that people driven into suicide by others—either by ill-treatment or through bewitchment—were not responsible for their deeds, and could therefore escape eternal damnation, this dream meant that the unfortunate woman was not driven by her own intentions when she took her life. 72. See also: Keszeg, Hiedelemek, 250. 73. Peti, ‘The Role of Black Magic’, 177. 74. This discretion was also due to their own uncertainty regarding the identity of their bewitchers. Unwitchers usually gave vague circumscriptions of the perpetrators, and so people had to weigh many factors in order to choose from several possible candidates. Many chose not to go that far, stating they would rather not know who had attacked them.

75. Interestingly enough, according to the version I heard they accused their enemies by paying for curse masses against them, which would be equal to accepting they were to blame in their conflict. Since I have not spoken to the family in person, the version I collected may differ from theirs in this respect. 76. See also: Argyrou, ‘Under a Spell’; Mencej, Styrian Witches. 77.
