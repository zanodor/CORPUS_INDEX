Sāndīpani (Ghora-Āṅgirasa) guru of kāśi teaches Chāndogya Upanisad of Sāmaveda to Śrī K ̥rṣṇa Devakiputra, the quintessence of Gītopadeśa
Guru-s of Śrī K ̥rṣṇa were Gargamuni and Saṁdīpanī Muni in the Puranas.
gārga mf(ī)n. composed the astronomical Saṃhitā. Garga is a male Indian name. It is a sage
name who did "nam karan" to lord Śrī K ̥rṣṇa. Garga is a sage who did "nāmā karaṇa" to
lord Śrī K ̥rṣṇa. Gargamuni and Saṁdīpanī Muni (Ghora-Āṅgirasa) are the ācārya of Śrī K ̥rṣṇa. It is clear that Garga lived when Śrī K ̥rṣṇa was born in 3112 BCE. It is reasonable to infer that Ghora-Āṅgirasa is also a contemporary of Śrī K ̥rṣṇa; thus, his philosophical excursus guiding Śrī K ̥rṣṇa should have occurred during the days of the gurukula of Śrī K ̥rṣṇa, ca. 3102 BCE.
Sage Ghora Aṅgirasa taught the folllowing science of puruṣayajña 'sacred life-activities' to Śrī K ̥rṣṇa:
'Let a man, when his end approaches, take refuge with this Triad:
"You are the imperishable,You are the unchangeable,You are the edge of Prāṇa."' On this
subject there are two R̥ k verses.
These ādhyātmikā explanations constitute the very essence of Gītopadeśa which Śrī K ̥rṣṇa
imparts to Arjuna during the war in 3067 BCE.

"According to the 66th chapter of Canto 10 of Srimad Bhagavatam, when Paundraka sent a
message to Dvaraka stating that he was God, Śrī K ̥rṣṇa declared war against him. Paundraka's
chariot was made similar to Śrī K ̥rṣṇa's, even with a flag of Garuda.After giving many
warnings to him to leave his false claims of pretending as Vasudeva, Śrī K ̥rṣṇa killed
Paundraka by beheading off Paundraka's head with the Sudarshana Chakra. The son of the
king of kāśi, Sudakshina, created a demon using black magic to destroy Dvaraka, with the
help of some corrupt priests. However, Śrī K ̥rṣṇa's Sudarshana Chakra set fire around kāśi. The whole kingdom was burnt and Sudakshina and all his priests were killed." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paundraka_Vasudeva
I infer that Śrī K ̥rṣṇa visited kāśi to destroy Pauṇḍraka, he visited Ghora-Āṅgirasa’, who had an āśrama in kāśi.
Chāndogya Upanisad which is part of Sāmaveda has an ākhyāna when Ghora-Āṅgirasa sang 2 ̥rca-s which are the quintessence of the Gītopadeśa later rendered by Śrī K ̥rṣṇa to Arjuna. One account states that Sāndīpani Muni had a nick-name of Ghora-Āṅgirasa.
Ghora Āṅgirasa means ‘the terrible descendant of the sage Aṅgiras’.
Ghora was one of the eight sons of the sage Aṅgiras. Hence he was known as ‘Ghora
Āṅgirasa’.[1] The Chāndogya Upanisad[2] has mentioned that the sage Ghora Aṅgirasa taught the science of puruṣayajña[3] to Kṛṣṇa (Devakiputra). This is apparently contradicted by the Visnupurāna[4] and Bhāgavata[5] which state that Sāndīpani of Avanti was the teacher of Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma.
If Sāndīpani belonged to the Aṅgiras gotra (lineage) and had the appellation ‘ghora’ (‘the
terrible’), since he was a strict disciplinarian, the two sages can be deemed as one and the same person. But there is no clinching evidence to prove it.

With this learning, he became free from desires (a-pipasa).
The Chandogya describes here man's life in the form of soma-sacrifice; the natural



6
function: eating, drinking, procreating and the cardinal virtues are describedas the rewards of the sacrifice. When Ghora Angirasa said (Uktva) this, healso told (uvaca) Krishna Devakiputra - for he had become free from desire:"In the final hour one should take refuge in these three thoughts: You are the Indestructible (asita); Your are the unshaken (acyuta); Your are the very essence of life (prana)."
The teachings which Krishna heard from Ghora Angirasa, is more or less the same which He taught to Arjuna in the Gita [XVI 1-2]. Ghora too already addressed Krishna as Acyuta, the infallible. In the Gita we find this term being used thrice, and each time Arjuna addresses Krishna as Acyuta [Bg. 1.2,11.42, 18.73.] Therefore, the self-evident quality of the quote demonstratesthe analogy. But there is not any evidence in other texts of any Krishna, asthe son of Devaki, besides our Krishna Yadava.

6. The sage Ghora, of the family of Aṅgirasa, taught this truth to Kṛṣṇa, the son of Devakī.
As a result, Kṛṣṇa became free from all desires. Then Ghora said: ‘At the time of death a person should repeat these three mantras: “You never decay, you never change, and you are the essence of life.”’ Here are two Ṛk mantras in this connection:
Ghora Âṅgirasa, after having communicated this (view of the sacrifice) to Krishna, the son of Devăkî -- and he never thirsted again (after other knowledge)--said: 'Let a man, when his end approaches, take refuge with this Triad: "Thou art the imperishable," "Thou art the unchangeable," "Thou art the edge of Prâna."' https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/9610/is-krishna-mentioned-in-thechandogya-upanishad This - Philosophy of the Sacrifice, - the sage Ghora - by name Angirasa - by Gotra - having expounded to Krishna, the son of Devaki - his disciple, said to him... Krishna, on listening to this philosophy, became thirstless... By this the text means to eulogize the Philosophy of the Sacrifice-Man as being so effective as to have relieved Krishna-Devakiputra of thirst for all other sciences. --Adi Shankaracharya's commentary
Jains believe that Ghora Angirasa is another name for their Tirthankara Neminatha, whom they claim Krishna studied under:
In the Chandogya Upanishads, the sage Ghora Angirasa relates the life of a man to the Soma sacrifice, and the daksina (alms) to austerity, liberality, simplicity, non-violence and truthfulness. In the process, he contributes the first recorded mention of ahimsa in the sense of non-violent behaviour. These values are common to Jainism and some claim Ghora Angirasa as a Jain sadhu instructing Krishna. The word Ghora Angirasa seems to be an epithet given to him because of the extreme austerities he undertook. It may be possible to suggest that Neminatha was his early name and when he had obtained Moksha after hard austerities, he might have been given the name of Ghora Angirasa.

Ghora (घोर).—A son of sage Aṅgiras. (Anuśāsana Parva, Chapter 85, Verse 131).
Ghora (घोर) is a name mentioned in the Mahābhārata (cf. XIV.8.28, XIV.8)
Name of a son of Aṅgiras, [Śāṅkhāyana-brāhmaṇa xxx, 6; Āśvalāyana-śrauta-sūtra xii, 13, 1; Chāndogya-upaniṣad; Mahābhārata xiii, 4148]

Ghora Angirasa only appears in the Chandoguia-upanishad (6th century BC). [ 1 ] He explains that this sage was a worshiper of the god of the sun , [ 2 ] who taught him how to purusha-yajna (human sacrifice) [ 3 ] [ 4 ]To a certain Devakiputra ('son of Devaki'). Despite the fact that in the Majabhárata (epicoreligious text of the 3rd century BC) the god Krishna is mentioned as the son of Devaki, possibly they are two different characters. [ 2 ] The Visnu-purana (1st century BC) [ 5 ] and the Bhágavata-purana (12th century AD) [ 6 ] established that the teacher of Krishna was Sāndīpaniof Avanti (so that this Devakiputra would not be the disciple of Ghora Anguirasa). Now, Sāndīpani also belonged to the Angiras-gotra lineage, [ 4] And was also nicknamed Ghora [ 4 ] ('terrible', a nickname that could mean 'strict' or 'disciplining'), [ 4 ] so both sages may have been the same person, and the Devaki Putra of theUpanishadcould be the same Devaki Putra of theMahabharata. [ 4 ] But there is no evidence to prove it. [ 4 ]

However I found translation of this verse by Dr. Radhakrishnan
" Ghora Angirasa, after having communicated this (view of the sacrifice) to Krishna, the son of Devaki -and he never thirsted again (after other knowledge)-said:
'Let a man, when his end approaches, take refuge with this Triad:
"You are the imperishable,You are the unchangeable,You are the edge of Prana."' On this subject there are two Rik verses
This verse clearly refers to Lord Krishna.
See how
First point to be noted is that Ghora Angiras didn't tell all the basic truth to Lord Krishna. He was just mentioning a view of sacrifice to Lord Krishna. So it is wrong to say that



9
Angiras told Lord all the basic spiritual truth. There is difference in between telling all the truths and imparting a view of sacrifice. Your own translation and that by Dr. Radhakrishnan gives support to this.
