Introduction
The locus of Veda culture and Sarasvati Civilization is framed by the Himalayan ranges and the Indian Ocean.



2
The Himalayan range stretches from Hanoi, Vietnam to Teheran, Iran and defines the Ancient Maritime Tin Route of the Indian Ocean – āsetu himācalam, ‘from the Setu to Himalayaś. Over several millennia, the Great Water Tower of frozen glacial waters nurtures over 3 billion people. The rnge is still growing, is dynamic because of plate tectonics of Indian plate juttng into and pushing up the Eurasian plate. This dynamic explains river migrations and consequent desiccation of the Vedic River Sarasvati in northwestern Bhāratam. Intermediation of the maritime tin trade through the Indian Ocean and waterways of Rivers Mekong, Irrawaddy, Salween, Ganga, Sarasvati, Sindhu, Persian Gulf, Tigris-Euphrates, the Mediterranean is done by ancient Meluhha (mleccha) artisans and traders, the Bhāratam Janam celebrated by R̥ ṣi Viśvāmitra in R̥ gveda (RV 3.53.12). Meluhha/Mleccha is the spoken form, parole of Proto-Indic.
The users of Mlecchita vikalpa (Meluhha cipher, i.e. Indus or Sindhu-Sarasvati Script) created the Meluhha Tin-Bronze revolution reaching tin from the largest tin belt of the globe (Ancient Far East) to the rest of Asia through an ancient Maritime Tin route which predated Silk Road by 2 millennia.
1. Originality & context: Veda culture and Indus Script, Bronze Age. Evidence for the civilization having been a link between the Ancient Near East and Ancient Far East in the tin/bronze age. Ancient Far East is the tin belt of the globe. Ancient Near East is a major region which used tin alloyed with copper to create bronze artifacts during the Bronze Age creating an urban revolution, the birth of civilization, a leap from chalcolithic, ‘copper-stone’ phase of human evolutionary, cultural itihāsa.
2. Approach/Methods: Cracking the code of Indus Script cipher by calling it Sarasvati Script
and using tantra yukti तंत्र युक्ति research methodology of Ancient Bhāratam.
A hypertext is a written document (cyphertext) with pictures and symbols (together called hieroglyphs or sacred signs). Gaṇeśa is an example of a hypertext signified orthographically with an elephant trunk as head on a human body.

Example of hypertext from a seal with Sarasvati Script
Tantra Yukti is a comprehensive review of hypertexts (cyphertexts) to derive plain texts, together with ‘meaningś – for e.g. vākyārtha ‘meaning or understanding of a sentence’ using 40 language categories such as adhikaraṇa (subject matter), yoga (arrangement). The subject matter of all 8000+ inscriptions relates to metalwork in manufactories called phaḍā. The arrangement is a combination of ‘pictorial motifś and ‘signś which are signifiers of messages and metallurgical experties and products are the signified wealth, metalwork.
3. Key results & conclusions: Sarasvati Script is a hypertext writing system which was invented ca. 3300 BCE evidenced by a potsherd with script discovered by Harvard Archaeology Project (HARP) team. The hypertexts of over 8000 inscriptions are Vākyapadīya (Sentence-Word) formations related to the metal-/mint-work of artisan guilds, seafaring merchants. Over 80% (i.e. over 2000) of the 2600 archaeological sites of the Sarasvati civilization are on the river basin of Vedic River Sarasvati. The present-day Bhāratīya are Sarasvati's children and constituted a Bhāratīya sprachbund (speech union) of what are today over 25+ Bhāratīya languages. The spoken language (lingua franca, parole) was called Meluhha (mleccha) and constitutes the language base for inscriptions of the Sarasvati Script detailing the technological competence achieved to catalyse the Tin-Bronze Revolution from 5th millennium BCE. The Sarasvati civilization people constituted the key link between Ancient Far East (AFE) and Ancient Near East (ANE). Evidences of Sarasvati Script have been found in AFE (e.g., over 200 Dong Son Bronze drums with script hieroglyphs such as frog, peacock, elephant, markhor, fish) and based on the Tin (cassiterite) resources of the Mekong, Irrawaddy, Salween Himalayan river deltas

which created the largest tin belt of the globe. The discovery of tin to create Tin-Bronze alloys was a brilliant discovery which overcame the shortage of naturally occurring Arsenical Bronzes all over Eurasia. Evidences of Sarasvati Script have been found in ANE (e.g. cylinder and circular seals of Persian Gulf, Mesopotamia, Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex, Fertile Crescent -- evidence of 3 pure tin ingots found in a shipwreck of Haifa and Nahal Mishmar bronze artefacts), all evidencing use of Sarasvati Script.
Section 1. Tantra yukti deciphers Indus Script
Tantra can be termed as that which discusses and details subjects and concepts; yukti is “... that which removes blemishes like impropriety, contradiction, etc., from the intended meaning and thoroughly joins the meanings together.”
Tantra-yukti thus denotes those devices that aid the composition of a text in a systematic manner to convey intended ideas clearly. upamānam (or d ̥rṣṭānta or analogy), vākyaviśeṣa (completion of a sentence meaningfully even in the absence of a word which is understood), pūrvapakṣa (objections, primafacie or provisional view), uttarapakSa (correct view or answers) are included as among 32 devices in Arthaśāstra list of Tantra yukti.
ु स्फटता न पदैरपाकृ ता न च न स्वीकृ त मथर्गौरवम् ‘Crispness (of an expression) is not obliterated by verbosity, nor is the depth of meaning that is intended to be conveyed is compromised (to attain crispness).
Caraka notes: तंेत्र समासव्यासोिे भवेन्त्यता हि त्स्नक्रशः एकदेशने ेदृश्यन्त समासाहभहिते तर्ा ‘all these tantrayukti-s occur in a scientific work in brief and in detail. But only some of them occur in a work written in brief.”
Forty tantrayukti devices are elaborated by decipherment of Indus Script Corpora.
1. Adhikaraṇa (subject matter) The subject matter of Indus Script Corpora relates to metalwork in the Bronze Age across Eurasia, from Hanoi, Vietnam to Haifa, Israel 2. Yoga (arrangement) The Corpora is arranged in about 8000 inscriptions presented on seals, tablets, copper plates, metal implements, ivory rods, potsherds or as writing on pendants or sculptures in the round (e.g. gold pendant with inscription painted and statue of ‘priest’ with Indus script hieroglyphs of dotted circle and uttarIyam) 3. Hetvārtha (extension of argument) The purpose achieved by the Corpora is to covey messages about the technical specifications of products (packages or cargo) which are authenticated by the messages 4. Padārtha (import of words) The import of words conveyed by the hieroglyphs read rebus is to specify the resources used: e.g. minerals, furnaces or smelters used in creating the product (either an ingot or alloy of minerals or implement or weapon or a cire perdue casting in metal) 5. Pradeśa (poetic adumbration) Some inscriptions are composed of narratives as semantic determinants (e.g. a tiger looking backwards connotes kola ‘tiger’ rebus: kol ‘working in iron’ PLUS krammara ‘look backwardś rebus: kamar ‘artisan, smith’; thus signifying an artisan working in iron).



5
h1973B h1974B Harappa Two tablets. One side shows a person seated on a tree branch, a tiger looking up, a crocodile on the top register and other animals in procession in the bottom register. Obverse side (comparable to h1970, h1971 and h1972) shows an elephant, a person strangling two tigers (jackals or foxes) and a six-spoked wheel. 6. Uddeśa (concise statement) Some inscriptions are just composite heads of animals joined to an animal or bovine body. The concise statement intends to signify three minerals which compose the product or package or cargo (e.g. combined animal with bovine body and heads of antelope, one-horned young bull, ox each signifying ranku ‘antelope’ rebus: ranku ‘tin’ PLUS konda 'young bull' Rebus: kondar 'turner' kuda ‘nidhi’ kundaṇa ‘fine gold’ PLUS barad, barat ‘ox’ rebus: bharat ‘alloy of pewter, copper, tin’). 7. Nirdeśa (amplification) Some inscriptions contain phonetic or semantic orthographic deteminatives to amplify the message conveyed (e.g. body of a person with legs spread out signifies two rebus renderings: meḍ ‘body’ rebus: meḍ ‘iron, copper’ karṇika ‘legs spread out’ rebus: karṇī ‘supercargo, engraver, scribe, account’ A Supercargo is a representative of the ship's owner on board a merchant ship, responsible for overseeing the cargo and its sale. Thus, the Supercargo is signified as in control of iron/metal merchandise on a seafaring ship. 8. Vākyaśeṣa (supply of ellipsis -- the omission from speech or writing of a word or words that are superfluous or able to be understood from contextual clues.) Some inscriptions signify ‘fish’ as a hieroglyph. In the context of Supercargo’s responsibility, the ‘fish’ hieroglyph may have orthographic accent on ‘finś of fish which signify: 'khambhaṛā' ‘fish fin’ rebus: kammaṭa ‘portable furnace to melt metals, mint, coiner, coinage’ PLUS ayo, aya ‘fish’ rebus: aya ‘iron’ ayas ‘metal’. 9. Prayojana (purpose) The purpose of the entire Indus Script Corpora is to document the products which are merchandise for exchange with contact areas and provide explanatory messages to the trade representatives such as Meluhha colonies in Ancient Near East or along the Persian Gulf metalwork sites. 10. Upadeśa (instruction) An example may be cited to explain how the instruction is achieved on Indus Script Corpora. A statue of a priest of Mohenjo-daro is shown wearing a fillet (dotted circle PLUS string) on the forehead and on right-shoulder. The message signified is: dhā̆ vaḍ 'iron-smelter' with Indus script hieroglyphs signifies पोतृ,'purifier' of dhāū, dhāv 'red stone mineralś. The compound phrase is broken up into two segments: hieroglyph dhā̆ v ‘strand’ rebus: dhā̆ v, dhātu ‘mineral’ PLUS hieroglyph -vaḍ ‘string’ rebus: వటగ 'clever, skilful' i.e., a person skilled in smelting minerals, hence an iron (red ore) smelter. 11. Apadeśa (advancement of reason) The choice of hieroglyphs in Indus Script Corpora is to avoid ambiguities in expressions. Thus, hieroglyphs such as elephant, rhinoceros, tiger, buffalo, fish are incorporated in inscriptions to signify: karibha ‘trunk of elephant’ rebus:



6
karba ‘iron’ ibha ‘elephant’ rebus: ib ‘iron’, gaNDa ‘rhinoceroś rebus: khaNDA ‘implementś, kola ‘tiger’ rebus: kol ‘working in iron’, kolle ‘blacksmith’ kolhe ‘smelter’, ranga ‘buffalo’ rebus: ranga ‘pewter’, ayo, aya ‘fish’ rebus: aya ‘iron’ ayas ‘metal’. These are further complemented by other hieroglyphs such as standing person with legs spread, rim-of-jar to signify meD ‘body’ rebus: meD ‘iron’ PLUS karNika ‘legs spread out’ rebus: karNIka ‘Supercargo, engraver, scribe, account’; kanka, karNika ‘rim of jar’ rebus: karNI ‘Supercargo’ karNIka ‘engraver, scribe, account’ PLUS kanda ‘pot’ rebus: kanda ‘fire-altar’ khaNDa ‘implementś. Hieroglyph: kariba 'trunk of elephant' rebus: karba 'iron' ibha 'elephant' rebus: ib 'iron’ ibbo ‘merchant’ ib ‘needle (writing stylus?).
Hieroglyph: dhāu 'strand of rope' Rebus: dhāv 'red ore' (ferrite) ti-dhāu 'three strands' Rebus: ti-dhāv 'three ferrite ores: magnetite, hematite, laterite'. Thus, Gaṇeśa is dhā̆ vaḍ 'ironsmelter’.
मेढा [mēḍhā] A twist or tangle arising in thread or cord, a curl or snarl (Marathi). Rebus: mēdhā yajña, dhanam.
Hieroglyph: Ash. piċ -- kandə ʻ pine ʼ, Kt. pṳ̄ ċi, piċi, Wg. puċ, püċ (pṳ̄ ċ -- kəŕ ʻpine-coneʼ), Pr. wyoċ, Shum. lyēwič (lyē -- ?).(CDIAL 8407). Cf. Gk. peu/kh f. ʻ pine ʼ, Lith. pušìs, OPruss. peuse NTS xiii 229. The suffix –kande in the lexeme: Ash. piċ-- kandə ʻ pine ʼ may be cognate with the bulbous glyphic related to a mangrove root: Koḍ. kaṇḍe root-stock from which small roots grow; ila·ti kaṇḍe sweet potato (ila·ti England). Tu. kaṇḍe, gaḍḍè a bulbous root; Ta. kaṇṭal mangrove, Rhizophora mucronata; dichotomous mangrove, Kandelia rheedii. Ma. kaṇṭa bulbous root as of lotus, plantain; point where branches and bunches grow out of the stem of a palm; kaṇṭal what is bulb-like, half-ripe jackfruit and other green fruits; R. candel. (DEDR 1171). Rebus: kaṇḍa ‘tools, pots and pans of metal’.Hieroglyph: కండె [
kaṇḍe] kaṇḍe. [Telugu] n. A head or ear of millet or maize. న్న జొ కంకి .
Rebus: Tu. kandůka, kandaka ditch,trench. Te. kandakamu id. Konḍa kanda trench made as a fireplace during weddings. Pe. kanda fire trench. Kui kanda small trench for fireplace. Malt. kandri a pit. (DEDR 1214). I suggest that kanda signifies ‘fire-altar, vedi’.

12. Atideśa (indication or application) On some inscriptions, an additional orthographic device is used to indicate that a metal implement is the product being managed by a Supercargo. Thus, on a Chanhudaro seal, the double-axe signifies a metal axe.
Double-axe found in a Mesopotamian site. Comparable to the double-axe shown on Chanhudaro seal C-23. Pictorial motif of a double-axe is a Sarasvati hieroglyph (Pict-133). 13. Arthāpatti (implication)



9
The fact that these hieroglyph compositions occur on bronze artifacts imply that the bronze metalwork is signified. 14. Nirṇaya (decision)
A simple seal of Daimabad which merely shows the ‘rim of jar’ hieroglyph is a decisive signifier of the rebus message: kanka, karṇika ‘rim of jar’ rebus: karṇika ‘Supercargo’. 15. Prasaṅga (restatement) A remarkable device in orthography on Indus Script Corpora is duplication. For example, a markhor is reduplicated back-to-back on a gold artifact.
Fig. 96f: Failaka no. 260 Double antelope at the belly in the Levant similar doubling occurs for a lion Readings, meanings: miṇḍāl 'markhor' (Tōrwālī) meḍho a ram, a sheep (Gujarati)(CDIAL 10120) Rebus: mẽṛhẽt, meḍ 'iron' (Santali.Munda.Ho.) med ‘copper’ (Slavic) meḍh ‘merchant’ PLUS dula ‘duplicated’ rebus: dul ‘metal casting’. Thus, a metal caster, merchant of metal castings.



10
16. Ekānta (categorical statement or invariable
rule) On this pectoral, the categorical emphasis is on the overflowing pot (in addition to other hieroglyphs such as standard device and one-horned young bull). The categorical message relates to lo ‘overflowing’ kaṇḍa ‘pot’ rebus: lokhanda ‘metal implementś. The invariable rule of Indus Script Corpora is that inscriptions are metalwork catalogues, metalwork proclamations. 17. Naikānta / anekānta / anekārtha (comprising statement) Using the pectoral example this tantrayukti can be demonstrated. The message conveyed: kan.d. kan-ka 'rim of jar'(Santali) karn.aka 'ear or rim of jar' (Sanskrit) kan.d. 'pot' (Santali)Rebus: karaṇika 'writer' (Telugu). kaṇḍa 'fire-altar' (Santali). করণিক [karaṇika] n an office-clerk, a
clerk. কারণিক [kāraṇika] a pertaining to cause, causal; ex amining, judging. n. an
examiner; a judge; a clerk (Bengali). खनक [Monier-Williams lexicon, p= 336,3]m. one who digs , digger , excavator MBh. iii, 640 R. 18. Apavarga / apavarja (exception or restriction of a pervasive rule) While many seals and tablets are incised, the writing also occurs in paint (perhaps ferrous oxide on metal) on a gold pendant.
This 2.5 inch long gold pendant has a 0.3 inch nib; its ending is shaped like a sewing or netting needle. It bears an inscription painted in Indus Script. This inscription is deciphered as a proclamation of metalwork competence.
19. Viparyaya (opposite) I would not to elaborate on the objections raised by over 150 decipherment claims. My submission is that the orthography is NOT intended to signify syllables but full words, hence the script is logographic. Second point is that it is an error to exclude pictorial motifs from the decipherments and focus only on ‘signś. Both signs and pictorial motifs have to signify TOGETHER a message of the Bronze Age. Most decipherments prejudge that names or titles should be signified by ‘signś. This prejudgement leads to erroneous results. The possibility that all hieroglyphs (both signs and pictorial motifs) signify metalwork catalogues should NOT



11
be ruled out because of the imperative created by the Bronze Age revolution which resulted in surplus goods which were bartered by seafaring merchants.
20. Pūrvapakṣa (objection) The previous arguments also relate to this device of tantra yukti. There are, in Indus Script Corpora words which signify functionaries like Supercargo and also minerals such magnetite (poḷa ‘zebu’ rebus: poḷa ‘magnetite ferrous ore’).
21. Vidhāna (right interpretation) The right interpretation should relate to the Bronze Age economic imperative. Wealth was created by metalwork and mintwork and artifacts were created like the Nahal Mishmar cire perdue artifacts which were proclaimed in processions (as evidenced by Jasper cylinder seal).
22. Anumata (concession or agreement) There is general consensus that Indus Script Corpora is related to trade since many seals also had exact replicas as seal impressions. So, the logical extension is to review the Corpora as metalwork catalogues for trade transactions.
23. Vyākhyāna (explanation) The explanation is provided in the decipherment of almost all 8000 inscriptions in 16 volumes which also include explanations of some pictorial motifs as Indus Script hieroglyphs/hypertexts on Ancient Near East and Persian Gulf (Dilmun) seals.

Sites of Đông Sơn type drum findings
“The use and manufacture of bronze drums is the oldest continuous art tradition in South Asia. Carbon-14 analyses have established that bronze drums were used before the sixth century BCE in North Vietnam, where in recent years several archaeological excavations have unearthed many new examples. The advanced technique and design of these early drums indicate that they are the product of a prior development and therefore the use of broze drums probably began at an earlier date...At present, bronze drums have been found in all the countries of Southeast Asia except the Philippines. It has been proposed that the drums found scattered throughout the island world of Indonesia (p.107) See: http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/cooler1986use.pdf Cooler, Richard M., The use of Karen bronze drums in the royal courts and Buddhist temples of Burma and Thailand: a continuing mon tradition, pp. 107 - 120

NOTE: There is perfect correltion between the locations of Austro-Asiatic language speakers and the locations of Bronze Age finds in



17
northeastern Bhāratm and Ancient Far East. Hawaii Univ. scholars opine that Munda is the root of Austro-Asiatic languages.
Stannifrous areas of the world (From RG Taylor, Geology of Tin Deposits, Amsterdam 1979, 6, fig. 2.1) 24. Samśaya (doubt) There are linguistic arguments which raise doubts about the Meluhha (Mleccha) language. It is possible that this was the spoken version of Prakrtam or Proto-Indic which co-existed with the chandas which is the metrical, literary version of Samskrtam or Vedic diction. There is general consensus that Ancient India was a sprachbund (language union or linguistic area) whch evinces many common features of languages of ancient Bharatam Janam ‘metalcaster folk’ as self-identification by Viśvāmitra in R̥ gveda (3.53.12). One example of common feature is the feature of reduplication to convey semantics, e.g. kaṇḍānmuṇḍān ‘metal bits and pieces’.
25. Atītāpekṣaṇa / atītavekṣaṇa (retrospective reference; atikrāntāvekṣaṇa ‘reference to a past statement’) The occurrence of Indus Script hieroglyphs on Dong Son bronze drums is also explained by the occurrence of Yupa inscriptions in East Borneo and occurrence of Śivalingas in the Ancient Far East. This suggests the possibility of a Maritime Tin Route from Hanoi to Haifa because the largest tin belt of the globe is in the Far East, along the Mekong delta.
26. Anāgatāvekṣaṇa (prospective reference) The continued use of Indus Script hieroglyphs on early punch-marked coins from Takṣaśila to Karur to Anuradhapura are indicative of an Age of Symbols coterminous with the Bronze Age. The hieroglyphs signify metalwork catalogues and in many cases together with Brāhmī or Kharoṣṭhī inscriptions which signify names or titles using the syllabic scripts which are distinct from the logographic Indus Script hieroglyphs/hypertexts.
27. Svasaṁjñā (technical nomenclature) The entire Indus Script Corpora of about 8000 inscriptions provide many examples of technical nomenclature such as poḷa (zebu) ‘magnetite ore’, maraka (peacock) ‘a type of steel’, rango (buffalo) ‘pewter, an alloy of copper, zinc and tin’, sattva ‘svastika hieroglyph’ rebus: sattva, jasta ‘zinc’



18
. Three tin ingots found in a shipwreck, Haifa. Indus Inscriptions are: ranku ‘liquid measure’ ranku ‘antelope’ rebus: ranku ‘tin’ mũh ‘face’ rebus: mũh, muhã 'ingot' or muhã 'quantity of metal produced at one time in a native smelting furnace.' dāṭu ‘crosś rebus: dhātu ‘mineral’.
28. Ūhya (deduction or what is understood) When a string of, say, five hieroglyphs signify minerals and operations in a furnace, the inference is that the signified is the metalworker or artisan working with such minerals and furnaces (in a workshop or mint).
29. Samuccaya (specification or combination, collection of ideas) A typical example of collection of related messages occurs in hieroglyph-multiplexes or hypertexts, say, of a composite animal.



19
Orthographic components explained by Dennys Frenez and Massimo Vidale. In this composition, each hieroglyph is a component of the hypertext message. 30. Nidarśana (illustration) The illustration of the devices of tantra yukti used is seen on a cylinder seal from Ancient Near East, the seal of Sharkali-Sharri.
Cylinder Seal of Ibni-Sharrum Agade period, reign of Sharkali-Sharri (c. 2217-2193 BCE)Mesopotamia Serpentine H. 3.9 cm; Diam. 2.6 cm Formerly in the De Clercq collection; gift of H. de Boisgelin, 1967 AO 22303 http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2014/04/continuity-inhieroglyph-motifs-from.html The signifiers: rango ‘buffalo’ rebus: rango ‘pewter’ lo ‘overflow’ kanda ‘pot’ rebus: lokhanda ‘metal implementś baṭa ‘six’ rebus: baṭa ‘iron’, bhaṭa ‘furnace’ meḍ ‘curl’ rebus: meḍ ‘iron’. Thus, Sharkali-Sharri is a smelter working with pewter, iron and metal implements.
31. Nirvacana (definition or derivation or etymology of terms) An Indian Lexicon provides etyma which include most of the 25+ ancient languages of Indian sprachbund. Many metalwork terms used in Indus Script Corpora as hypertexts are traceable to one or more of the etyma of the sprachbund. IndianLexicon.pdf (file://HP-PC/Users/HP/Google%20Drive/IndianLexicon.pdf )
32. Niyoga / sanniyoga (injunction) The occurrence of Indus Script hieroglyphs on 21 stoneware ceramic bangles is a pointer to the 21 types of functions identified during the Bronze Age for metalwork and trade. This bangle becomes the standard. Example: Elamite standard. Hieroglyphs on the Elamite standard atop a bangle comparable to the ceramic stoneware rings of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa: Tor. miṇḍ 'ram', miṇḍā́ l 'markhor' (CDIAL 10310) Rebus 1:meḍ (Ho.);mẽṛhet 'iron' (Munda.Ho.) med 'copper' (Slavic) dula 'two' rebus: dul 'metalcasting'. Rebus 2: meḍh 'metalcasting merchant's helper' (Desi namamama of Hemacandra). Thus, a merchant dealing with metalcastings (of copper, alloys).



20
The bangle Eelamite standard is comparable to the dharma samjnA 'ceramic stoneware bangles' found in Mohenjo-daro and Harappa with Indus Script inscriptions detailing the responsibilities assigned to artisans of the metalwork/merchant guild. The dharma samjnA (responsibility badge) on this Elamite standard signifies the responsibility related to a merchant trading metalcastings of copper/metal. karã̄ n. pl.wristlets, bangles:’ rebus: kh ār ‘blacksmith’ See: All Bronze Age standards of Ancient Near East are Indus Script hypertext proclamations of metalwork https://tinyurl.com/y776fjdc
33. Vikalpana (option) It is possible to indicate alternative rebus readings for some select inscriptions. Thus, a standing person may signify meḍ ‘body’ rebus: meḍ ‘iron’ and also karṇika ‘legs spread out’rebus: karṇī ‘Supercargo’ or karṇaka ‘scribe, engraver’
34. Pratyutsāra / pratyucāra (rebuttal) The decipherment of Indus Script Corpora as metalwork catalogues is a rebuttal of arguments spuriously made that the people who created the writing system were ‘illiterates and hence, suggesting that the hieroglyphs are indicative of some rituals. The stronger argument is that the writing system was necessitated by the Bronze Age revolution which resulted in the production of surplus metal artifacts for exchange or barter transactions to create wealth. A dramatic demonstration of the wealth of ancient Bhāratam is provided by the bar chart of Economic Historian of OECD, Angus Maddison who demonstrated that this nation contributed to over 32% of world GDP in 1 CE. The decipherment of Indus Script Corpora is a demonstration of the wealth created by Bhāratam Janam who were Bronze Age artisans and merchants from 8th millennium BCE to 1st millennium BCE accounting for and validating the Economic History charted by Angus Maddison.
35. Uddhāra (reaffirmation) Inscription after inscription continue to refer to technical terms of metalwork, furnace/smelter work, mint work. This rebus rendering occurs for over 500 hieroglyphs (called signs) and over 100 hieroglyphs (called pictorial motifs). These 600



21
hieroglyphs śabdasphoṭa ‘word sound meanings’ are composed as hypertexts vākyasphoṭa ‘message meanings’ to create vākyārtha ‘document archives of metalwork wealth.’
36. Sambhava (possibility) The Indus Script Cipher as rebus reading of ancient Prāk ̥rtam words points to the possibility that the Vedic Sarasvati River Basin was the epicenter of trade and production activity along the Maritime Tin Route from Hanoi to Haifa which predated the Silk Road by over 2 millennia.
37. Paripraśna (question and answer) A paripraśna is: why would even wild animals be shown in front of feeding troughs, unless both the animal and the trough are hieroglyphs to be pronounced, read and understood rebus? Why was the water-carrier shown in parenthesis together with star hieroglyphs on a circular Gadd seal?

38. Vyākaraṇa (grammar) Since the writing system is logographic and composed of lists of 0 to 5 terms (glosses), there is no need for grammatical expressions in the writing system on Indus Script Corpora or on devices used on tens of thousands of early punch-marked and cast coins in an extensive Bronze Age civilizational area of Eurasia, from Bogazkoy to Karur and Rakhigarhi to Anuradhapura, from Amaravati to Angkor-Wat..
39. Vyutkrāntabhidāna (transgression) The presence of trefoils on the base of a śivalinga is a transgression of the ādhyātmikā connotations of the divine iconography of linga as a fiery pillar of light and fire. The base with trefoil may signify tri-dhātu ‘three strandś rebus: ‘three mineralś which are subjected to smelting operations. The presence of a mukha ‘human face’ or Bhuteswar śivalinga atop a smelter is indicative of rebus: muha ‘quantity produced from a furnace, ingot’.



22
tri-dhātu ‘three strandś rebus: ‘three mineralś which is also a synonym of Gaṇeśa is explained in the context of his leadership of the gaṇa, ‘hosts’ working with metals.and rebus representation of karibha ‘elephant’ rebus: karba ‘iron ore’. There are three types of iron, ferrite ores worked during the Bronze Age. magnetite ore, haematite ore, laterite ore. The signifiers are: poḷa ‘zebu; rebus: poḷa ‘magnetite’; bica ‘scorpion’ rebus: bicha ‘haematite’; goṭa ‘round pebble, stone’ rebus: goṭa ‘laterite’.
40. Hetu (purpose) The tantrayukti devices have demonstrated the purpose of the Indus Script Corpora. They are metalwork catalogues as proclamations to promote trade across diverse linguistic areas. Such proclamations also occur on procession tablets or on a monolithic signboard of Dholavira.

This tablet showing three hieroglyphs may be called the Meluhha standard. Combined reading for the joined or ligatured glyphs.
Rebus reading is: dhātu kõdā sangaḍa ‘mineral, turner, stone-smithy guild’.
Dawn of the bronze age is best exemplified by this Mohenjo-daro tablet which shows a procession of three hieroglyphs carried on the shoulders of three persons. The hieroglyphs are: 1. Scarf carried on a pole (dhātu Rebus: mineral ore); 2. A young bull carried on a stand kõdā Rebus: turner; 3. Portable standard device (Top part: lathe-gimlet; Bottom part: portable furnace sã̄ gāḍ Rebus: stone-cutter sangatarāśū ). sanghāḍo (Gujarati) cutting
stone, gilding (Gujarati); sangsāru karaṇu = to stone (Sindhi) sanghāḍiyo, a worker on a lathe (Gujarati) sangara ‘proclamation, trade’.
The procession is a celebration of the graduation of a stone-cutter as a metal-turner in a smithy/forge. A sangatarāśū ‘stone-cutter’ or lapidary of neolithic/chalolithic age had graduated into a metal turner’s workshop (koḍ), working with metallic minerals (dhātu ) of the bronze age.
Three professions are described by the three hieroglyphs: scarf, young bull, standard device dhātu kõdāsã̄ gāḍī Rebus words denote: ‘ mineral worker; metals turner-joiner (forge); worker on a lathe’ – associates (guild).

Section 2. Momentous discovery of Soma samsthā yāga on Vedic River Sarasvati Basin
Archaeo-metallurgy (Ancient India’s contributions to the Bronze Age Revolution)
The recent discovery (2015) by ASI at a site called Binjor (near Anupgarh) on the banks of River Sarasvati points to two features: 1. Presence of yajna kunda in the Vedic tradition evidenced by an octagonal pillar indicative of Soma yaga as prescribed in ancient Vedic texts) and 2. Metalwork activity and presence of a seal attesting to mature period of the civilization (perhaps dated to ca. 2500 BCE). Further archaeo-metallurgical studies are needed to map 1) the resources from Khetri mines which seem to have sustained sites like Binjor, Kalibangan, Karanpura (see note below) on Sarasvati River Basin and 2) nature of contributions made by Bharatiyas to Bronze Age Revolution, with particular reference to mleccha ‘copper’.

A remarkable discovery is the octoganal brick which is a yaṣṭi.in a fire-altar of Binjor site on the banks of Vedic River Sarasvati. Thi yaṣṭi attests to the continuum of the Vedic tradition of firealtars venerating the yaṣṭi as a baton, skambha of divine authority which transforms mere stone and earth into metal ingots, a manifestation of the cosmic dance enacted in the furnace/smelter of a smith. Bhuteswar sculptural friezes provide evidence to reinforce this divine dispensation by describing the nature of the smelting process displaying a tree to signify kuTi rebus: kuThi 'smelter' with kharva 'dwarf' adorning the structure with a garland to signify kharva 'a nidhi or wealth' of Kubera. A Bhutesvar frieze also indicates the skambha with face signifying ekamukha linga rebus:
mũhe 'ingot' (Santali) mũhã̄ = the quantity of iron produced at one time in a native smelting furnace of the Kolhes; iron produced by the Kolhes and formed like a four-cornered piece a little pointed at each end; mūhā mẽṛhẽt = iron smelted by the Kolhes and formed into an equilateral lump a little pointed at each of four ends;kolhe tehen mẽṛhẽt ko mūhā akata = the Kolhes have to-day produced pig iron (Santali).

Abstract
Karanpura is located on the River Chautang (ancient Drishadvati, a tributary of River Sarasvati)
nearly 60 km west of Hissar and 6 km west of Bhadra on the Bhadra-Goga Medi road in District
Hanumangarh, Rajasthan. The Excavation Branch II of the Archaeological Survey of India
excavated the site for two field seaso-ns, viz., 2012- 13 and 2013-14. The excavation brought to
light occupational remains of Early Harappan and Mature Harap-pan phases of Harappan
civilization. The occupational remains of over 3 m evidenced a continuous occupation at the site
starting around circa 2800 BCE until around the end .of second millennium BCE. The upper 1.5
m of occupational deposit had been removed by local villagers for agricultural purposes and it
hence could be presumed that the end of the habitation occurred towards 2000 BCE.
Nevertheless the excavation has enabled us to understand the dynamics of Harappan culture and
its spread into the areas watered by the tributary rivers like River Drishadvati for reasons of
exploitation of various copper resources located in the northern Aravalli region. The access to
these raw material sources might have been facilitated through the settlements located on the



31
River Drishadvati to a larger extent. This paper puts forth the preliminary results of two seasons
of excavation at this site
http://repository.iitgn.ac.in/handle/123456789/1462?show=full medha is yajña.
Indus Script Corpora hieroglyph meḍhā m. ʻpost, forked stake' is read rebus: medha, 'yajña'. Sivalinga is a divine impeller; the metaphor is ताण्डव नृत्यम् the cosmic dance of transmutation.
Such a yupa, a post fixed in the middle of the sacrificial ground is used in yajña. अन्तःपूवेण
यूपं परीत्यान्तःपात्यदेशे र्स्ापयहत Kāty. -पाहतत,-पाहतन् (Apte. Samskrtam). This is clearly an invocation to the paramaatman, as elaborated in this note with particular reference to the octagonal shape of the Yupam यूपं before commencing the yajña.
Almost every fire-altar found in Sarasvati civilization sites has such a meḍhā installed in the altar. The conclusive evidence comes from Binjor yajña kuNDa with an अष्टाहि 'having eight corners' (Vedic) yupa discovered in April 2015 by a young team of students from Institute of Arcaheology, National Museum, New Delhi.
ashtAs'ri yupa is signified by s'ivalinga and ekamukha s'ivalinga. A s'ivalinga is meḍhā -- with a unique octagonal/quadrangular shape as prescribed in Vedic texts -- rebus medha 'yajña'. Scores of s'ivalingas are found in India, Nepal, Laos, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand with such s'ivalinga and ekamukha s'ivalinga of octagonal shape in rudra bhAga (middle). Images of such lingas of octagonal shape in rudra bhAga are appended for ready reference. If a mukha 'face' is ligatured to the linga, the rebus rendering is: mũh 'face' Rebus: mũhe 'ingot' rebus: muhã 'quantity of metal produced at one time in a native smelting furnace.' PLUS meḍhā 'stake, yupa' rebus: medha 'yajña'. See: http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2016/01/casala-on-yupa-indus-script-hieroglyph_6.html
चषालः caṣāla on Yupa, is an Indus Script hieroglyph like a crucible to carburize ores into steel/hard alloys (vajra).
The transmission and dissemination of a knowledge system to carburize ores to produce hard alloys and metals is thus complete, precise and unambiguous, through Indus Script Corpora.
This authenticated transmission through data archiving using inscriptions on seals or tablets or other objects reinforces that Indus Script is a knowledge system conveyed through metallurgical metaphors of hypertexts (hieroglyph-multiplexes).
This meḍhā rebus: medha 'yajña' is also a metallurgical metaphor to signify
Prakrtam lōkhaṇḍa 'iron work, iron implements' as will be seen on Candi-Sukuh evidence
discussed by Stanley J. O'Connor (embedded article). Mulavarman's yupa inscription described
the soma yaga as बहुसुवणथक , bahusuvarṇaka, the same metaphorical expression used in the epic



32
Valmiki Ramayana, sto ignify creation and distribution of wealth. Every one of the 19 yupa
inscriptions are on octagonal-shaped pillars and relate to the performance of soma yajña
categories of अिीन सत्त्र (performed for 2-12 days, for more than 12 days).
'यज्ञो वै मेधः' इहत िुतेः । एकहवंशहत- मेधाेन्त Mb.14.29.18. (com. मेधो युद्ध यज्ञः । 'यज्ञो वै मेधः' इहत िुतेः

All the 19 yupa inscriptions recorded in Epigraphia Indica are अिीन or सत्त्र soma yajña lasting
for over 2 days.
अष्टन् [p=116,2] अष्ट ्/औ ([ RV. AV. &c ]) or अष्ट ्/आ ([ RV. viii , 2 , 41]) or अष्ट ्/अ ([ RV. x , 27 ,

4 S3Br. &c ; loc. अष्टास् /उ S3Br. &c );[Lat. octo ; Goth. ahtau;
Mod. Germ. acht ; Eng. eight ; Lith. asztuni ; Slav. osmj.]). The dual form अष्ट ्/औ (in Vedic) is
semantically 'two fours'. gaNDa 'four' rebus: kanda 'fire-altar'. Thus, the expression अष्टा * हि
'having eight corners' in 3rd kanda of Shatapatha brahmana also signifies the key comprehensive
penetration of space by the यूपं or skambha or .meḍhā 'stake' coveredwith cashAla (wheat chaff)
in the carburization process to produce hard metal out of the working with fire.áṅgāra m. n. ʻ

The centrality of the carburization process using caSAla atop yupa is a significant component of
the knowledge system of ancient metallurgists to enhance the utility and exchange value of hard
alloys or hardened metals (e.g. from mRdu 'soft iron' to .ukku 'steel'). The semantics of the north

and stone getting transformed into utility value and exchange value metal ingots generating
wealth for a fire-worker artisan working with fire and dhAtu'minerals.
Knowledge system disseminated through Indus Script Corpora also finds expression in Vedic
metaphor such as ईशावास्यम् N. of the ईशावास्योपहनषद् , also called ईशोप- हनषद् ; the only

This may explain the octagonal or eight-faced pillar which is the subject of an adhyatma
philosophical tractus par excellence in Atharva Veda X.7 Skambha Suktam.

Which of his members is the seat of Fervour: Which is the base of Ceremonial Order? Where in
him standeth Faith? Where Holy Duty? Where, in what part of him is truth implanted?
Consequently, his insight is that an octagonal yupa signifies any somayaga. Vajapeya is one of
seven somayagas which constitute somasamsthA. The evidence for the performance of a soma yajña in Binjor and Kalibangan dated to ca. 2500 BCE in Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization is a stunning evidence of the Vedic yajna tradition. This tradition continues into the historical periods evidenced by 19 yupa inscriptions in regions such as Rajasthan, Isapur (suburb of Mathura) and East Borneo.
It will thus be appropriate to refer to the octagonal yupa in the Binjor agnikuNDa as a signifier of a somayaga, perhaps a particular type of somayaga which was called Vājapeya Soma samsthA.
In most of the 19 yupa inscriptions, the yaga is recorded to have gone on for several days, hence may be called अिीन Soma yoga (or Soma samsthA). such a somayaga could have been a Vājapeya.
एकहवंशहत is a count of twenty-one , a collection or combination of twenty-one TS. S3Br.
Thus, medha is yajña. अिीन is a yajña lasting 2 to 12; a सत्त्र is an extended अिीन which could

Somayaga or soma samsthA are seven. “Agnishtoma is considered to be a prakriti soma yajna (A template based on which other six are done --Atyagnistoma, Aptoryama, Atirātra ,uktha, shodasi, Vājapeya). The Vājapeyais the highest soma yajna. The performer of the Vajapeya has to be led into the country by the king himself and anna abhishekam has to be performed by the king for the performer of Vājapeya. Then the person who has performed this is given the title Vājapeyaji. Generally based on number of days performed, soma sacrifices are split into 1. Ekaha (one day) 2. Ahina (2-12 days) and 3. Satra (12 days till one year). The agnishtoma is an example of a 1 day sacrifice. The Vajapaya is an example for Ahina and the Gavamayana is an example for a satra. Specifically it is a samvatsara satra meaning it lasts for one year. The entire 7th kanda of the Taittriya samhita deals with satra type sacrifices.” http://jayasreesaranathan.blogspot.in/2012/10/what-are-vedic-yajnas-guest-post-by-r.html

Section 3. Binjor seal
The seal reported from Binjor is a signature tune of the civilization and consistent with about 7000 inscriptions of Indus Script Corpora. This seal has been deciphered and authenticates the findings so far that the entire Indus Script Corpora constitute metalwork catalogues of the Bronze Age by Bharatam Janam,'metalcaster folk' artisans speaking Meluhha parole of Indian sprachbund. The location of the Binjor archaeological site (4MSR) is significant in identifying the desiccation point of Vedic River Sarasvati. A LANDSAT image shows clearly the bifurcation of the River Sarasvati into two channels, one



36
channel flowing westwards towards Ganweriwala (Bahawalpur Province) and another flowing southwards towards Surkotada/Dholavira (Gujarat). The River Sutlej had joined River Sarasvati at Shatrana as a tributary. This tributary emanating from Manasarovar glacier in the Himalayas, took a 90-degree turn westwards at Ropar (another archaeological site with a site museum). This 90-degree turn is evidence of the impact of plate tectonics resulting in the River Sutlej changing its course abandoning the supply of glacial waters to River Sarasvati/Drishadvati drainage system.
Thus, Binjor (4MSR) site is a time marker for the River Sarasvati as a navigable channel prior to 1900 BCE, allowing for the trade indicated by the Binjor seal of metal implements which might have been carried by seafaring merchant caravants across the Persian Gulf.
Sarasvati-Sindhu Script seal. Binjor Hieroglyph: kõda 'young bull, bull-calf' rebus: kõdā 'to turn in a lathe'; kōnda 'engraver, lapidary'; kundār 'turner'.
Hieroglyph: sãghāṛɔ 'lathe'.(Gujarati) Rebus: sangara 'proclamation, trade’. Together, the message of the Binjor Seal with inscribed text is a proclamation, a metalwork catalogue (of) 'metallic iron alloy implements, hard alloy workshop'

Together, with the hypertexts on the field symbol, the message of the Binjor Seal with inscribed text is a proclamation, a metalwork catalogue (of) 'metallic iron alloy (hard iron, steel) implements, hard alloy workshop'.
An exposition by Sadhashiv A Dange: "the yūpa is described as being the emblem of the sacrifice (RV III.8.8 yajñasya ketu). Though it is fixed on the terrestrial plane at the sacrifice, it is expected to reach the path of the gods. Thus, about the many sacrificial poles (fixed in the Paśubandha, or at the Horse-sacrifice) it is said that they actually provide the path for reaching the gods (ib., 9 devānām api yanti pāthah). They are invoked to carry the oferings to the gods (ib., 7 te no vyantu vāryam devatrā), which is the prerogative of the fire-god who is acclaiemd as 'messenger' (dūta); cf. RV I.12.1 agrim dūtam vṛṇimahe). In what way is the yūpa expected to carry the chosen offering to the gods? It is when the victim is tied to the sacrificial pole. The prallelism between the sacrificial fire and the yūpa is clear. The fire carries it through the smoke and flames; the yūpa is believed to carry it before that, when the victim is tied to it, as its upper end is believed to touch heaven. A more vivid picture obtains at the vajapeya. Here the yūpa is eight-angled, corresponding to the eight quarters. (śat. Br. V.2.1.5 aṣṭāśrir yūpo bhavati; the reason given is that the metre Gayatri has eight letters in one foot; not applicable here, as it is just hackneyed. At Taitt.Sam. I.7.9.1, in this context a four-angled yūpa is prescribed.) The one yūpa is conceived as touching three worlds: Heaven, Earth and the nether subterranean. The portion that is above the caṣāla (ring) made of wheat-dough (cf.śat. Br. V.2.1.6 gaudhūmam caṣālam bhavati) represents Heaven. This is clear from the rite of ascending to the caṣāla, made of wheat-dough, in the Vajapeya sacrifice. The sarificer ascends to it with the help of a ladder (niśrayaṇī); and, while doing so, calls upon his wife, 'Wife, come; let us ascend to Heaven'. As soon as he ascends and touches the caṣāla, he utters, 'We have reached Heaven, O gods' (ib., 12). According to Sāyaṇa on the Taiit.Sam. I.7.9.1, the sacrificer stretches his hands upwards when he reaches the caṣāla and says, 'We have reached the gods that stay in heaven' (udgṛhītābhyām bāhubhyām). Even out of the context of the Vajapeya, when the yūpa is erected (say in the Paśubandha), it is addressed, 'For the earth you, for the midregion you, for heaven you (do we hoist you)' (Taitt. Sam. I.3.6.1-3; cf. śat. Br. III.7.1.5-6). The chiselled portion of the yūpa is above the earth. So, from the earth to heaven, through the midregion the yūpa represents the three-regions. The un-chiselled portion of the yūpa is fixed in the pit (avaṭa) and the avaṭa, which represents the subterranean regions, is the region of the ancestors (ib.4).The yūpa, thus, is the axis mundi...Then, it gave rise to various myths, one of them being that of the stūpa of Varuṇa, developing further into Aśvattha tree, which is nothing but a symbol of a tree standing with roots in the sun conceived as the horse (aśva-stha = aśvattha), a symbol obtaining at varius places in the Hindu tradition. It further developed into the myth of the churning staff of the mountain (Amṛta-manthana); and yet further, into the myth of Vasu Uparicara, whom Indra is said to have given his yaṣṭi (Mb.Adi. 6y3.12-19). This myth of the yaṣṭi was perpetuated in the ritual of the Indra-dhvaja in the secular practice (Brhatsamhita, Chapter XLII), while in the s'rauta practice the original concept of the axis mundi was transformed into the yūpa that reached all regions, including the under-earth. There is another important angle to the yūpa. As the axis mundi it stands erect to the east of the Uttaravedi and indicates the upward move to heaven. This position is unique. If one takes into account the position of the Gārhapatya and the āhavaniya fireplaces, it gets clear that the march is from the



38
earth to heaven; because, the Gārhapatya is associated with this earth and it is the household fire (cf. gṛhā vai gārhapatyah, a very common saying in the ritual texts), and the seat of the sacrificer's wife is just near it, along with the wives of the gods, conceptually. From this fire a portion is led to the east, in the quarter of the rising sun (which is in tune with such expressions as prāñcam yajñam pra nayatā sahāyah, RV X.101.2); where the Ahavaniya fireplace is structured. As the offerings for the gods are cast in the Ahavaniya, this fire is the very gate of heaven. And, here stands, the yūpa to its east taking a rise heavenwards. This is, by far, the upward rise. But, on the horizontal plane, the yūpa is posted half-inside, half-outside the altar. The reason is, that thereby it controls the sacred region and also the secular, i.e. both heaven and earth, a belief attested by the ritual texts. (Tait. Sam. VI.6.4.1; Mait. Sam. III.9.4)."(Dange, SA, 2002, Gleanings from Vedic to Puranic age, New Delhi, Aryan Books International, pp. 20-24). Skambha Sukta ( Atharva Veda X-7 ) begins with this enquiry to unravel the implanted truth:
kásminn áṅge tápo asyā́dhi tiṣṭhati kásminn áṅga ̥rtám asyā́dhy ā́hitam kvà vratáṃ kvà śraddhā́sya tiṣṭhati kásminn áṅge satyám asya prátiṣṭhitam 1
1.Which of his members is the seat of fervour: Which is the base of Ceremonial Order? Where in him standeth Faith? Where Holy Duty? Where, in what part of him is truth implanted?
The sequences of questions posed in 44 sukta verses are an inquiry as profound as the Nasadiya Sukta of Rigveda. The wonder of the Rishi and the insights provided linking earth and heaven in an axis mundi the primordial pillar signified by the skambha (linga) metaphor is unsurpassed in any cosmic-consciousness enquiries of all time.
This wonder, this enquiry gets embedded in some hieroglyph-multiplexes of Indus Script Corpora and on Bhuteswar friezes linking sivalinga to a smelter and processes of the smith working with minerals to produce metallic implements. This is one reason why the stella are implanted in almost every fire-altar of Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization.

On this seal, the key is 'combination of animalś. This is an example of metonymy of a special type called synecdoche. Synecdoche, wherein a specific part of something is used to refer to the whole, or the whole to a specific part, usually is understood as a specific kind of metonymy. Three animal heads are ligatured to the body of a 'bull'; the word associated with the animal is the intended message.
The ciphertext of this composite animal is to be decrypted by rendering the sounds associated with the animals in the combination: ox, young bull, antelope. The rebus readings are decrypted with metalwork categories: barad 'ox' rebus: bharat 'alloy of copper, pewter, tin'; kondh ‘young bull’ rebus: kũdār ‘turner, brass-worker, engraver (writer)’; kunda ‘nidhi’ kundaṇa ‘fine gold’ ranku 'antelope' rebus: ranku 'tin'.

Jiroft artifacts with Meluhha hieroglhyphs referencing dhokra kamar working with metals.
Dark grey steatite bowl carved in relief. Zebu or brahmani bull is shown with its hump back; a male figure with long hair and wearing akilt grasps two sinuous objects, representing running water, which flows in a continuous stream. Around the bowl, another similar male figure stands between two lionesses with their head turned back towards him; he grasps a serpent in each hand. A further scene (not shown) represents a prostrate bull which is being attacked by a vulture and a lion.
The zebu is reminiscent of Sarasvati Sindhu seals. The stone used, steatite, is familiar in Baluchistan and a number of vessels at the Royal Cemetery at Ur were made out of this material.
The bowl dates from c. 2700-2500 B.C. and the motif shown on it resembles that on a fragment of a green stone vase from one of the Sin Temples at Tell Asmar of almost the same date.
Khafajeh bowl; a man sitting, with his legs bent underneath, upon two zebu bulls. This evokes the proto-Elamite bull-man; the man holds in his hands streams of water and issurrounded by

ears of corn. He has a crescent beside his head. On the other side of the bowl, a man is standing upon two lionesses and grasping two serpents.

Indus Script hypertext to signify फडा phaḍā 'metals manufactory' has cognates in expressions of Bhāratīya languages
https://tinyurl.com/y8me6tze
All cognates: phaṭā फटा (Samskrtam), phaḍā फडा (Marathi), paṭam (Tamil. Malayalam), paḍaga (Telugu) have the same meaning: cobra hood. Rebus words/expressions which signify 'manufactory, metals workshop' are: bhaṭṭh m., °ṭhī f. ʻ furnaceʼ, paṭṭaṭai, paṭṭaṟai 'anvil, smithy, forge', paṭṭaḍe, paṭṭaḍi 'workshop'.
This concordance suggested by the use of Indus Script Cipher evidenced in many inscriptions (See links cited below) indicates the essential semantic unity of Bhāratīya languages and the evolution of manufactories/workshops for metalwork all over Bhāratam during the Bronze Age.
The semantic unity is matched by the cultural significance of the pratimā of Gaṇeśa of Gardez, with the Indus Script hypertexts of cobra hood and elephant-face ligature to a human body attesting to the significance of Gaṇeśa as the leader of the hosts performing ironwork (karibha,
ibha 'elephant' rebus: karba, ib 'iron'); phaḍā फडा 'cobra hood' rebus: phaḍā फडा 'metals manufactory'; mūṣa 'mouse' rebus: mūṣa 'crucible'; meḍ 'step, dance step' rebus: mẽṛhẽt, meḍ 'iron' med 'copper' (Slavic)
Based on this example of word-sets of Bhāratīya languages suggesting phonetic variants of phaḍā, paṭam meaning 'cobra hood', I suggest that phaḍā 'metals manufactory' in Marathi is cognate with and explains, semantically, the derivatives with cognate meanings: paṭṭaḍe, paṭṭaḍi 'workshop' (Kannada) and paṭṭaṭai, paṭṭaṟai 'anvil, smithy, forge.'(Tamil). It is also possible to suggest a cognate bhaṭṭh m., °ṭhī f. ʻ furnaceʼ (Punjabi). baṭa ‘iron’ (Gujarati) bhaṭṭī f. ʻ forge ʼ (Marathi). Semantics of forge, smithy are seen in the following lexemes signifying 'furnace work': bhráṣṭra n. ʻ frying pan, gridiron ʼ MaitrS.

Tri-dhātu Gaṇeśa in Gardez; Indus Script hypertext cipher, ib 'iron worker’, phaḍa, 'manufactory in-charge'
https://tinyurl.com/y7vo7gqx
Tracing back through the mists of time into the periods prior to 8th millennium BCE, it is possible to realize the significance of Tri-dhātu Gaṇeśa venerated from the days of R̥ gveda. Veneration of Gaṇeśa dates back to Rigvedic times (See RV 2.23 sukta gaṇānāṃ tvā gaṇapatiṃ havāmahe kaviṃ kavīnām upamaśravastamam). In the tradition of Bharatam Janam, gana are related to kharva, dwarfs as part of Kubera's nidhi; rebus: karba 'iron'. See:

पावथती , or according to one legend of पावथती alone ; though गणे*श causes obstacles he also removes them ; hence he is invoked at the commencement of all undertakings and at the opening

6. dance step
Rebus readings of the hypertexts relate their significance to iron-metal work:

The association of Gaṇeśa with iron-working gives him the name tri-dhātu 'three mineralś wich are:
goṭa 'laterite, ferrite ore' poḷa 'magnetite, ferrite ore' bicha 'haemtite, ferrite ore'. These three ferrite ores are signified by the hieroglyphs: goṭa 'round pebble stone' poḷa 'zebu, dewlap, honeycomb' bica'scorpion'.
Gaṇeśa is signified as part of Marut गण[p= 343,1] troops or classes of inferior deities (especially

[quote] Hindu Shahi Rule
The Shahi dynasties ruled portions of the Kabul Valley (in eastern Afghanistan) and the old province of Gandhara (NE Afghanistan, northern Pakistan and NW India), known as Kabulshahan, with twin capitals at Kapisa and Kabu, from the aftermath of the Kushan Empire in the 3rd century CE to the early 9th century.
The term Shahi was a popular royal title in Afghanistan — used at various times by Achaemenids, Bactrians, Sakas, Kushan rulers and Huns (Hephthalites), as well as by the 6th- to 8th-century Shahi rulers of Kapisa/Kabul.
Historians divide the Shahi Period of Kabul/Gandhara into two eras: the so-called Buddhist Turk-Shahis (before 870 AD), and the so-called Hindu-Shahis (after 870 AD).
Despite numerous references to the Shahis as decendents of the Kushans or Western Turks, the Shahi rulers of Kabul/Kapisa almost certainly descended from the warrior caste known as Ashvakas (the word from which, several scholars contend, the term "Afghan" is derived) who for many centuries dwelt in the region known as Kambojas on the northern and southern sides of the Hindu Kush range.

I suggest that the glyphics on the sacred thread and on the garment worn on the sculpture signify cobra-hoods. Cobra hoods are clearly seen on the following sculpture, on the left shoulder of
Gaṇeśa. These cobra-hoods are also comparable to the glyphics shown on Sanchi sculptural frieze.

A 5th century marble Gaṇeśa found in Gardez, Afghanistan, now at Dargah Pir Rattan Nath, Kabul. The inscription says that this "great and beautiful image of Mahāvināyaka" was consecrated by the Shahi King Singal. For details of inscription cf. Dhavalikar, M. K., "Gaņeśa: Myth and Reality", in: Robert Brown, 1991, Ganesh: Studies of an Asian God, SUNY Press, NY,pp. 55, 63. Dhavalikar ascribes the quick ascension of Gaṇeśa in the Hindu pantheon, and the emergence of the Ganapatyas, to this shift in emphasis from vighnakartā (obstacle-creator) to vighnahartā (obstacle-averter). (Ibid., p. 49)
For statement that "Fifty-nine manuscripts of the Ādiparvan were consulted for the reconstruction of the critical edition. The story of Gaṇeśa acting as the scribe for writing the Mahābhārata occurs in 37 manuscripts", see: Krishan, Yuvraj (1999), Gaņeśa: Unravelling An Enigma, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, p.3, note 4 loc. cit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaṇeśa

Section 7 Note on Mohenjo-daro seal m0304: phaḍā ‘metals manufactory’
See: http://tinyurl.com/hoq2t3e
I deeply appreciate Donal B Buchanan sending me a reconstructed image of m0304 Mohenjodaro seal.
The image of Mohenjo-daro seal impression on the Left is a splendid reconstruction done by Donal B. Buchanan (personal communication) and the seal (m0304) is from the Corpus of Indus Inscriptions, Vol. I.
Don couldn't complete 'healing' the missing back and tail of the tiger, but at least he is still recognizable. Thus, the pictorial narrative on Seal m0304 is unambiguous and clear. All hieroglyhs are readable as hypertexts rebus of a metalwork catalog.
m0304 seal of Mohenjo-daro showing a seated person surrounded by animals has been deciphered.
The message of metalwork is from a brass-worker's mint and (अहि-)कु ण्ड , (agni-)kuṇḍa, 'sacred
fire-altar'.
This message is conveyed using Indus Script hieroglyphs.
The hieroglyph on Seal m0304 ligatured to the buffal-horns of the seated person. Hieroglyph: thattār 'buffalo horn' Rebus: taṭṭār 'brass worker' urukku, n. < உருக்கு-. [T. ukku,

Thus the entire glyphic composition of hieroglyphs on m1181 seal is a message conveyed from a sodagor 'merchant, trader'. The bill of lading lists a variety of repertoire of the artisan guild's trade load from a mint -- the native metal and brass workshop of blacksmith (guild) with furnace: aḍar kuṭhi 'native metal furnace'; soḍu 'fireplace'; sekra 'bell-metal and brass worker'; aya sal 'iron (metal) workshop'. Rebus: kunda ‘nidhi’, kuṇḍaṇa ‘fine gold’
Thus, the horned crown is read together as: taṭṭār 'brass worker' PLUS kuṇḍa 'fire-pit'.

phaḍā फडा 'metals manufactory’.
maṇḍā ‘raised platform, stool’ Rebus: maṇḍā ‘warehouse’.
The person is seated in penance: kamaḍha 'penance' (Pkt.) Rebus: kammaṭi a coiner (Ka.); kampaṭṭam coinage, coin, mint (Ta.) kammaṭa = mint, gold furnace (Te.) Thus, the over-arching message of the inscription composed of many hieroglyphs (of glyphic elements) thus is a description of the offerings of a 'mint or coiner (workshop with a golf furnace)'. Thus, together the person seated in penance PLUS platform PLUS corn-rick read: kammaṭa maṇḍā 'mint warehouse' PLUS phaḍā ‘metals manufactory’.
kuṇḍī = crooked buffalo horns (L.) Rebus: kuṇḍī = chief of village. kuṇḍi-a = village headman; leader of a village (Pkt.lex.) I.e. śreṇi jeṭṭha chief of metal-worker guild.
dula 'pair' rebus: dul 'metal casting'. Thus, two hayricks and two markhors relate to 1. metalcasting furnace; and 2. copper/iron metal castings meḍ kuṁḍa 'iron furnace or fire-altar'.
There is also a semantic reinforcement: on seal m0304, stacks of hay signify mēṭa 'stack of hay' which are phonetic determinants of the platform, raised place: mēṭa 'raised place'. Rebus reading is: mẽṛhẽt, meḍ 'iron (metal)' 'copper' (Slavic languages).

Part 2 with two hieroglyhs:

6. PLUS kanka, karṇaka 'rim of jar' rebus: karṇī 'Supercargo' karṇaka 'account, scribe'. Thus, this second part of the hypertext reads: Mintwork account (to) Supercargo, a representative of the ship's owner on board a merchant ship, responsible for overseeing the cargo and its sale.
Thus, seal m0304 Mohenjo-daro is a comprehensive metalwork catalogue of a mint, metals manufactory, documenting, using dharma saṁjñā 'responsibility markers or hieroglyphs, the tasks assigned to kuṇḍi-a = village headman' ; leader of a village (Pkt.) i.e. śreṇi jeṭṭha chief of metal-worker guild.
This is an unambiguous, remarkable example proving that Indus Script is a knowledge system. There are over 8000 inscriptions on Indus Script Corpora detailing the technical specifications of the knowledge system which facilitated trade/exchange transactions by seafaring merchants of Meluhha.
Section 8. Conclusion
Veneration of Gaṇeśa is a celebration of the superintendent of the gaṇa, ‘guild of artisans’ who created metal artifacts in a metals foundry using mere earth and stone and through the messenger divinity, Agni. This is exemplified in the Veda culture and continues in the Indus Script hypertext mlecchita vikalpa representations as data archives of metalwork, wealth creation activities of a Bronze Age civilization which is a veritable revolution in human evolution by Himalaya Parivār. Bhāratam Janam.
The momentous discovery of performance of Soma samsthā yāga ca. 3rd millennium BCE on Vedic River Sarasvati Basin reinforces the locus of Vedic River Sarasvati as a navigable waterway linking Rakhigarhi-Kalibangan-Bhirrana, Anupgarh-Dholavira through Persian Gulf to TigrisEuphrates doab in Ancient Near East.

The witing system flourishes into the historical periods retaining the features of the writing system on tens of thousands of punch-marked coins in an extensive region stretching from Takshasila to Anuradhapura and on Sohgaura and Dhruva II copper plate inscriptions. The civilization is exemplified by over 2000 archaeological sites (80% of the total number of sites) on the Vedic River Sarasvati basin. The civilization continuum defines the form and function of and is the bedrock of Bhāratīya Itihāsa, culture and socio-economic spectrum of life activities with phenomenal contributions made by metalwork wealth creation, making Bhāratam the richest nation on the globe ca. 1 CE.
