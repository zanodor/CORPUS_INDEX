The unique shape of the Mundigak priest fillet called ‘wavy’ hieroglyph is also found on some select Indus Script inscriptions (Harappa button seal shows this wavy hieoglyph) which are discussed in Haematite ore, equipment, ingots merchant identified on two Harappa seals https://tinyurl.com/yydr2sus
This presentation demonstrates that the ‘wavy’ hieroglyph shape of fillet of Mundigak priest signifies metal infusion of haematite ore.
Eraka ‘copper, metal infusion’ is the reading of the shape on Harappa
button seal. This gains enormous cultural significance in Ancient India tradition.

"Mundigak IV, 3, the context of the head found near the terraced building of Mundigak," writes Vidale, "is contemporary to Shahr-i Sokhta [in Iran] late Period III to Period IV (Phases 3 to 0, ca. 2200-1800 BC . . . [when] all the stone sculptures of the same model from Mohenjo-Daro were notoriously found in the uppermost and latest layers of the city's settlement, i.e. to late horizons grossly belonging (following the chronology established at Harappa) to Harappa 3C period, ca. 2200-1900 BCE." (Vidale, Massimo, 2017, A Priest-King at Shahr-I Sokhta? In: Archaeological Research in Asia 15, pp. 5-6).
The paper discusses the published fragment of a statuette, about 10 to 12 cm high, made of a buff-grey limestone, recently found on the surface of Shahr-i Sokhta (Sistan, Iran) and currently on exhibit in a showcase of the archaeological Museum of Zahedan (Sistan-Baluchistan, Iran)... a male character sitting on the right heel, with the left hand on the raised left knee, and a robe leaving bare the left shoulder.

Mundigak ṛtvij is Eraka subrahmaṇya; he wears eraka fillet
This hypothesis on the identity of Mundigak priest is premised on the following evidences:
1. The shape of fillet worn by Mundigak ṛtvij is eraka ‘metal infusion’, comparable to the shapes used on Indus Script Corpora 2. On Bactrian silver vase of Bactria, dated c. 2nd millennium BCE, all 8 ṛtvij performing yajna are seen seated in comparable postures and wearing shawls decorated, perhaps with trefoils as seen on the shawl of Mohenjodaro priest statuette 3. Investiture ceremony of priests is documented in detail in ancient text of śatapatha brāhmaṇa 4. Details of the text in R̥ tvij displayed on Bactria Silver Vase, Miho Museum may have worn fillets; four gold fillets and gold disc identified archaeologically https://tinyurl.com/4u6abx9f

As noted in V.5.5.7, the Traidhâtavî ends with presentation of gold coins. Such gold coins are either tied as goldbead-fillets on the forehead and right shoulder of the priest or stitched on as embroidered adornments on the robe of the priest.

5.5.5.16. Three gold pieces of a hundred mânas 2 each are the sacrificial fee for this (offering). He presents them to the Brahman; for the Brahman neither performs (like the Adhvaryu), nor chants (like the Udgâtri), nor recites (like the Hotri), and yet he is an object of respect. And with gold they do nothing 3, and yet it is an object of respect: therefore he presents to the Brahman three gold pieces of a hundred mânas each. Note: According to Sâyana, these 'satamânas' are similar to the round plate worn by the king during the Consecration-ceremony; see p. 104, note 2. These plates (as the 'rukmas' generally, VI, 7, 1, 2 seq.) were apparently used for ornament only, not as coins

Ockam’s razor is used in this solution to an integral equation. The organizing principle: "Entities are not to be multiplied
without necessity" (Non sunt multiplicanda entia sine necessitate)

इयं त्रवसृत्रियकत आबभूव यत्रद वा दधे यत्रद वा न। यो अस्याध्यिैः परमे व्योमन्त्सो अङ्ग वेद यत्रद वा न वेद॥७॥ RV 10.129.7 संूक्त १०.१२९ प्जापत्रतैः परमेिी। दे. भाववृत्तमत। त्रिुष्ट्पत ।
Wilson translation: 10.129.07 He from whom this creation arose, he may uphold it, or he may not (no one else can); he who is its superintendent in the highest heaven, he assuredly knows, or if he knows not (no one else does). [sa bhagavah kasmin pratiṣṭhita: Chāndogya Upaniṣad 7.24.1].
Ockam’s razor – simple, known entities (known functions in integral equation), to identify the unknown person using Nāsadīya Sūkta of Rgveda
f is a known function, and K is another known function of two variables, the kernel function.



Conclusion, Possible identifiers of the Unknown function:
Potr̥ ‘purifier of metals’
Known functions in Meluhha Ancient India sprachbund, ‘speech union’ point to
--metalwork in yajna
--investiture ceremony of R̥ tvij ‘priests’ includes embroidering rukma, ‘metal tokens’ into the shawls presented; fillets as badges of honour are tied on their forehead and right shoulder.
--The Mohenjo-daro sculpture signifies potr̥ ‘purifier priest’
पोतदार pōtadāra, ପ ୋଦ୍ଦୋର୍ poddār 'village-silversmith',
‘assayer of metals in treasury’, ‘a person who sets coins’.
