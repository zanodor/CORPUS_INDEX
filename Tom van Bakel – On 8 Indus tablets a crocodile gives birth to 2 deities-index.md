On 8 Indus tablets a crocodile gives birth to 2 deities
M-1393 a
In this essay I examine this complicated Mohenjo-Daro tablet with seven animals and two small human shapes. At that time one may have found it fascinating because it was copied at least 7 times.
M-440 A
This is one of those 7 copies and I also use it in this essay because it shows three animals and a small human shape more clearly.



I start with these two bovines that represent the sun god Kartikeya and his wife, the river goddess Valli. They face each other from March to November.

Close to Mohenjo-Daro
According to some myths, Kartikeya was born in Krittika (the Pleiades). In the Indus Culture the sun went through this nakshatra in March and the table above shows that the temperature then began to rise and it remained high until November.
In the same period plenty of water flowed through the rivers: the discharge was at a minimum from December to February:
‘The principal rivers of the Indus River system are snow-fed. Their flow varies greatly at different times of the year: the discharge is at a minimum during the winter months (December to February), there is a rise of water in spring and early summer (March to June), and floods occur in the rainy season (July to September).’
https://www.britannica.com/place/Indus-River
So, the sun was deadly hot from March to November, (Kartikeya was also identified with Kali, the goddess of death), but in the same period the life-giving river was wide. This meant that in a certain sense the sun and the river balanced each other, which was perfectly symbolized by the two opposing bovines.
Although they faced each other, the two deities also made love and about nine months later the river goddess gave birth to two young gods. The Sacred Marriage took place in Taurus and therefore the couple took on the shape of two bovines.



Then the river goddess took on the shape of a crocodile nowadays the mount of Ganga. In the Indus Valley Period this reptile represented river goddesses like Saraswati, Valli and Yami themselves and it also represented the constellation Makara/Capricorn:
‘Makara is a Sanskrit word which means ‘sea dragon’ or ‘water-monster’. It is the origin of the Hindi word for crocodile, मगर(magar), which has in turn been loaned into English as the name of the Mugger crocodile, the most common crocodile in India’. ‘In Hindu iconography, Makara is represented as the vahana ('vehicle') of Ganga, the river goddess’.
‘In Hindu astrology, tenth of the twelve symbols of the Zodiac’.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makara_(Hindu_mythology)
In the Indus Valley Perod the sun passed through Makara in November. Valli is a mother goddess and she then gives birth to two deities:
1. Saraswati, the deity of Shravana, she is represented by a cow with the head of a peacock. 2. And Vishnu, another deity of Shravana, he is represented by a tiger.
Shravana — the Star of Learning; Ruling Planet: Moon Animal symbol: female monkey Deities: Vishnu, Saraswati
The Nakshatras: The Lunar Mansions of Vedic Astrology by Dennis M. Harness
Above the tiger is a small monkey, the animal symbol of Shravana, and the rhino on the other side represents Shashthi, the goddess of the moon, which is the ruling planet of Shravana.
Shravana herself is a nakshatra situated close to Makara/Capricorn:



This human-like shape with large ears and a tail is a monkey, the animal symbol of Shravana:
Shravana — the Star of Learning; 10°00' to 23°20' Capricorn
Symbol: An ear, three footprints. Ruling Planet: Moon Nature: Deva (god like) Primary Motivation: Artha (material prosperity Animal symbol: female monkey Direction: North Sounds: Ju, Je, Jo, Gha Qualities: Sattwa/Tamas/Rajas Deities: Vishnu, Saraswati
The Nakshatras: The Lunar Mansions of Vedic Astrology by Dennis M. Harness
And this tiger looking backwards usually represented Kartikeya. However, this deity was identified with Vishnu:
‘In Tamil literature: The Tolkāppiyam, one of the most ancient texts of the Tamil literature, mentions cēyōṉ ‘the red one’, who is identified with Murugan, whose name is literally Murukaṉ ‘the youth’; the other gods referred to in the Tolkāppiyam are Māyōṉ ‘the dark one’ (identified with Vishnu), Vēntaṉ ‘the sovereign’ (identified with Indra) and Korravai ‘the victorious’ (identified with Kali) and Varunan ‘the sea god’.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartikeya
And Vishnu is the one who is depicted here, because Shravana is symbolized by three footprints: the footprints of his famous three steps. Besides that, this sun god is the deity of this nakshatra. In front of the tiger stands a small human shape. It represents Vishnu as a child and it indicates that he is born in Shravana.



This mythical animal, having the body of a cow and the head of a peacock, represents Saraswati.
Nowadays a peacock is the mount of Kartikeya and Saraswati. In the Indus Culture this bird represented the sun god himself as well as all river deities.
Saraswati has the body of a bovine. Bovines represent about all deities and they also represent rivers that are often linked to cows, for example in Rigveda 3.33.1:
‘Like two bright mother cows who lick their youngling, Vipas and Sutudri speed down their waters.’
And Rigveda 7.95.2. and other verses (e.g. Rigveda 8.21.18) speak of the Sarasvati pouring ‘milk and ghee’.
Shravana — the Star of Learning; Ruling Planet: Moon Animal symbol: female monkey Deities: Vishnu, Saraswati
The Nakshatras: The Lunar Mansions of Vedic Astrology by Dennis M. Harness
All in all the bovine with a peacock head represents Saraswati, a deity of Shravana. In front of her is a small human shape. It represents the river goddess as a child, and it indicates that she is born in Shravana.



The rhino represents the moon goddess Shashthi, one of the spouses of Kartikeya.
M-1138 H-1136 M-1906
These six seals show six wombs divided in six parts. They symbolize the mother goddess Shashthi, who’s name means ‘Sixth’. In this simple way these seals indicate that rhinos are affiliated to the moon goddess.
M-1137 M-88 M-274
Shashthi is the goddess of the moon, which is the ruling planet of Shravana. In addition, Shashthi is related to childbirth: ‘The worship of Shashthi is prescribed to occur on the sixth day of each lunar month of the Hindu calendar as well as on the sixth day after a child's birth’:
‘The worship of Shashthi is prescribed to occur on the sixth day of each lunar month of the Hindu calendar as well as on the sixth day after a child's birth. Barren women desiring to conceive and mothers seeking to ensure the protection of their children will worship Shashthi and request her blessings and aid. She is especially venerated in eastern India.’
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashthi
On the 8 tablets she is related to the birth of Vishnu and Saraswati.



M-1393 a
If we once more look at this complicated tablet that we clearly see that the crocodile lays between Taurus (the two bovines) and Shravana (symbolized by the monkey). It’s snout is in between the two bovines, indicating that the river is slender in March (Taurus). Then the body is fat, symbolizing that the river is broad from March until November (Shravana). At last, the tail below symbolizes that the river starts to be slender again after November.
This was the surprising statement of this tablet and this may have been the reason why it was popular and why it was copied at least 7 times.



This beautiful tablet depicts two crocodiles, a bull man and a peacock woman. The bull man represents Kartikeya and the peacock woman represents the river goddess Valli.
The two gods are quarreling which symbolizes the conflict between the hot sun and the cooling water of the wide rivers.
The first crocodile may have indicated that this conflict began in March when the temperature as well as the water in the rivers began to rise. The second crocodile may have indicated that this conflict ended in November, when the sun went through Makara, and the sun as well as the water in the rivers diminished.
Although Kartikeya and Valli were quarreling they also made love and about nine months later Valli gave birth to two children, Vishnu and Saraswati: on the left she holds them high.

M-489 C
Kartikeya Shashthi Devasena Valli
This side of a three sided tablet also found in Mohenjo-Daro depicts a crocodile with some fish (?) and 4 bovines. The unicorn on the left represents Kartikeya and the three other bovines represent his three wives: Shashthi, Devasena and Valli. The 4 deities took on the shape of bovines as this whole scene was situated in Taurus. At that time the sun went through this constellation in March. The crocodile and fish indicated that the rivers then began to rise.
M-489 B
On the left Kartikeya and Valli are shaped like sheep, the animal symbol of Krittika. As usual they are quarreling under a neem tree, a tree that cools down:
Krittika — the Star of Fire. Range: 26°40' Aries — 10°00' Taurus Symbol: axe, razor, blade, knife, flame, peacock Deity: Karttikeya, Agni (God of fire) Mode of Functioning: Active Cast: priestly or brahminical Gender: Female Body parts: hips, loins and the crown of the head Humor (Ayur Vedic Constitution): Kapha Direction: the arc covering the directions from east, south-east to south Guna (Essence): Rajas Tattwa (Element): Earth Gana (Type): Rakshasa (demonic) Orientation: Downward Disposition: Mixed (alternates between sharp and soft) Ruling Planet: Sun Sounds: A, Ee, Oo, Ay
Animal symbol: Sheep or Goat Primary Motivation: Kama Enemy: Vishakha Published: en.Vedicencyclopedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
But in the middle of the tablet the two deities also perform a Sacred Marriage. On the right is a three headed animal symbolizes Trimurti: it indicates that Valli in fact represent the three spouses of Kartikeya.



M-489 A
Devasena Shasthi Valli Kartikeya
The third side of the tablet shows another crocodile with fish. Here it indicates the diminishing of the water in the river that begins in Makara, at the end of November. The 4 quadrupeds below represent Kartikeya and his three wives in the first place:
1. The elephant represents the storm goddess Devasena, 2. The rhino represents the moon goddess Shashthi, 3. The tiger looking forward represents the river goddess Valli 4. And the tiger looking backwards represents the sun god Kartikeya.
Valli and Kartikeya may be an equivalent of Vishnu and Saraswati, the deities of Shravana. They may have been born then.
‘In western states of India such as Gujarat the festival of Diwali
signifies the start of a new year’
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali
A Diwali festival was celebrated between mid-October and mid-November:
‘The preparations, and rituals, for the festival typically last five days, with the climax occurring on the third day coinciding with the darkest night of the Hindu lunisolar month Kartika. In the Gregorian calendar, the festival generally falls between mid-October and mid-November.’
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali
The big question is: ‘Did a new year begin with Diwali at the time of the Indus Valley Civilization?’ At that time the sun went through Shravana from mid-October to mid-November. The point is that this nakshatra is indicated on many Indus seals, so it may well be possible that in the Indus Culture a new year began when the sun went through it.
Like in Mesopotamia a new year began with deities born in March, the above seals indicate that in the Indus Valley Culture a new year began with the birth of Vishnu and Saraswati in Shravana. But the birth of these two deities had to be prepared: in March they must have been conceived before they could be born in November. And that is wat we see on Indus seals: both March and November are indicated over and over again.

Two of these stamps have an illustration on their back, namely three tigers that are pushed together with their backs. They may represent the three spouses of Kartikeya.

About Valli
The name Valli means: ‘creeper’:
Vaḷḷi (Tamil: வள்ளி) (‘Creeper, Sweet Potato Plant’) is a Hindu goddess and the consort of the god Kartikeya.She is a form of Vishnu's daughter Sundaravalli.
And on the above wall the branches of a creeper meander like a river delta.
H-97
And on the left of this tablet is a ‘creeper’ or ‘a river with leaves’ representing Valli.
Valli was linked to water because she was born via the sweat drop from Lakshmi that fell on the grass:
‘One of the famous places to visit near Ponnai is Vallimalai; according to Vallimalai, it is a place where Valli, the daughter of Lord Vishnu and Lakshmi was born (i.e. via the sweat drop from Lakshmi that fell on the grass at this place, and later on consumed by a deer, thereafter Valli was born via the deer). Raised up by the chief of the tribe, Valli grew up to be a beautiful damsel’.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponnai
And she drew water from a pond from to quench the thirst of Murugan:
‘Vaḷḷi is also known as Pongi at Vallimalai in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, and the pond from which she drew water to quench the thirst of Murugan is still there. This pond, though in an open ground, does not receive the rays of the sun’.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valli
Because of this pond she is linked to Saraswat, which means: ‘pooling water’:
‘Saraswati, is a Sanskrit fusion word of saras (सरस्) meaning ‘pooling water’, but also sometimes
translated as ‘speech’; and vati (वती) meaning ‘she who possesses’. Originally associated with the river or rivers known as Saraswati, this combination, therefore, means ‘she who has ponds, lakes, and pooling water’ or occasionally ‘she who possesses speech’. It is also a Sanskrit composite word
of surasa-vati (सुरस-वतत) which means ‘one with plenty of water’.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraswati#Etymology



About Kartikeya
M-272 B-12 a
Kartikeya is the deity of Krittika. He is a sun god, the ruling planet of this nakshatra. On these two seals he is depicted as a ram because the animal symbol of this nakshatra is a sheep:
Range: 26°40' Aries — 10°00' Taurus Symbol: axe, razor, blade, knife, flame, peacock Deity: Karttikeya, Agni (God of fire) Mode of Functioning: Active Cast: priestly or brahminical Gender: Female Body parts: hips, loins and the crown of the head Humor (Ayur Vedic Constitution): Kapha Direction: the arc covering the directions from east, south-east to south Guna (Essence): Rajas Tattwa (Element): Earth Gana (Type): Rakshasa (demonic) Orientation: Downward Disposition: Mixed (alternates between sharp and soft) Ruling Planet: Sun
Sounds: A, Ee, Oo, Ay
Animal symbol: Sheep or Goat Primary Motivation: Kama Enemy: Vishakha
Published: en.Vedicencyclopedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
Being a sun god Kartikeya is identified with Vishnu, and ‘his body glows like the sun rising from the emerald sea’. He is called: ‘the youth’, because every year when the sun enters Krittika (Pleiades) he is reborn in the morning (‘the red one’):
‘In Tamil literature: The Tolkāppiyam, one of the most ancient texts of the Tamil literature, mentions cēyōṉ ‘the red one’, who is identified with Murugan, whose name is literally Murukaṉ ‘the youth’; the other gods referred to in the Tolkāppiyam are Māyōṉ ‘the dark one’ (identified with Vishnu), Vēntaṉ ‘the sovereign’ (identified with Indra) and Korravai ‘the victorious’ (identified with Kali) and Varunan ‘the sea god’. ‘In the Tirumurukāṟtruuppaṭai, he is called Muruku and described as a god of beauty and youth, with phrases such as ‘his body glows like the sun rising from the emerald sea’. It describes him with six faces each with a function, twelve arms, his victory over evil, and the temples dedicated to him in the hilly regions’.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartikeya



M-1134 M-288 M-1103
These seals depict three six-divided circles symbolizing Kartikeya: when the sun passes through Krittika (the Pleiades) it takes on the shape of 6 of the 7 stars 9 according to some myths he is the son of six mothers), which means that he is depicted as a six-divided sun:
‘Six mothers symbolizing the six stars of Pleiades cluster who took care of newly born baby Kartikeya’.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartikeya
By the way, all the above animals represent Kartikeya. So, both Kartikeya and his second spouse Shashthi can be represented by a rhino, just like Kartikeya and first spouse Valli are represented by the two opposing bovines.
