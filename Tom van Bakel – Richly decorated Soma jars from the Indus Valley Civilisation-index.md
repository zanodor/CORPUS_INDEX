Richly decorated Soma jars from the Indus Valley Civilisation
g katyan misra auf Twitter: ‘#Pottery of Indus Valley civilization of Harappa or Mohenjedaro https://t.co/kREPn4irwj’ / Twitter
Many decorated bowls and jars have been found in the ruins of the towns and villages in the Ancient Indus Valley. From the decorations of some of these pots it can be concluded that they were used for Soma rituals.
In the Vedic tradition, soma (Sanskrit: सोम) is a ritual drink of importance among the early Vedic Indo-Aryans. The Rig Veda mentions it, particularly in the Soma Mandala. Gita mentions the drink in Chapter 9. It is equivalent to the Iranian haoma. The texts describe the preparation of soma by means of extracting the juice from a plant, the identity of which is now unknown and debated among scholars. Both in the ancient religions of Historical Vedic religion and Zoroastrianism, the name of the drink and the plant are not exactly the same.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma_(drink)
In ‘The Hymns of the Rig Veda’ (translated by Ralph T. H. Griffith) this Soma is mentioned 1675 times. From this alone it becomes clear to us that this ritual drink has been extremely important: according to the following hymn it even has been poured in daily rites:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 1-86
1. The best of guardians hath that man within whose dwelling place ye drink, o Maruts, giants of the sky. 2 Honoured with sacrifice or with the worship of the sages' hymns, O Maruts, listen to the call. 3 Yea, the strong man to whom ye have vouchsafed to give a sage, shall move into a stable rich in kine. 4 Upon this hero's sacred grass Soma is poured in daily rites: praise and delight are sung aloud. 5 Let the strong Maruts hear him, him surpassing all men: strength be his, that reaches even to the Sun. 6 For, through the swift Gods' loving help, in many an autumn, Maruts, we have offered up our sacrifice. 7 Fortunate shall that mortal be, O Maruts most adorable, whose offerings ye bear away. 8 O Heroes truly strong, ye know the toil of him who sings your praise, the heart's desire of him who loves. 9 O ye of true strength, make this thing manifest by your greatness – strike the demon with your thunderbolt. 10 Conceal the horrid darkness, drive far from us each devouring fiend, create the light for which we long.

In many hymns this Soma is called a ‘steer’:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-64 1. Soma, thou art a splendid Steer, a Steer, O God, with steer like sway: Thou as a Steer ordainest laws.
2 Steer-strong thy might is as a steer's, steer strong thy wood, steer-like thy drink A Steer indeed, O Steer, art thou.
3 Thou, Indu, as a vigorous horse, hast neighed together steeds and kine: Unbar for us the doors to wealth. 4 Out of desire of cows and steeds and horses. potent Soma-drops, Brilliant and swift, have been effused.
And that is why on many pots a zebu is depicted that represents this Soma drink.

Moreover, according to the following hymn this Soma drink even bellowed into the jars, which is of course neatly suggested by the zebu depicted on this jar:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-75
1. Graciously-minded he is flowing on his way to win dear names o'er which the Youthful One grows great. The Mighty and Far-seeing One hath mounted now the mighty Surya's car which moves to every side. 2 The Speaker, unassailable Master of this hymn, the Tongue of sacrifice pours forth the pleasant meath. Within the lustrous region of the heavens the Son makes the third secret name of Mother and of Sire. 3 Sending forth flashes he hath bellowed to the jars, led by the men into the golden reservoir.
The milky streams of sacrifice have sung to him: he of the triple height shines brightly through the morns. 4 Pressed by the stones, with hymns, and graciously inclined, illuminating both the Parents, Heaven and Earth, He flows in ordered season onward through the flee, a current of sweet juice still swelling day by day. 5 Flow onward, Soma, flow to bring prosperity: cleansed by the men, invest thee with the milky draught. What gladdening drinks thou hast, foaming, exceeding strong, even with these incite Indra to give us wealth.

On this pot we see that liquid flows from the neck of a zebu and not, for example, from its mouth or from its genitals. This shows that the Soma steer itself flows:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-37 1. Soma, the Steer, effused for draught, flows to the purifying sieve, Slaying the fiends, loving the Gods.
2 Far-sighted, tawny-coloured, he flows to the sieve, intelligent, Bellowing, to his place of rest.

Also in the following hymn we can read that Soma is a Bull who flows with a pleasant stream:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-6 1. Soma, flow on with pleasant stream, a Bull devoted to the Gods, Our Friend, unto the woollen sieve. 2 Pour hitherward, as Indra's Self, Indu, that gladdening stream of thine, And send us coursers full of strength.

So, on some bowls, a current flows from the zebu's neck, ostensibly suggesting that this bull itself flows as described in a number of Rig Veda hymns.

Soma is a steer by lustre, moreover it is a sap of the yellow meath-distilling juice:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-65
1. The, glittering maids send Sura forth, the glorious sisters, close-allied, Send Indu forth, their mighty Lord. 2 Pervade, O Pavamana, all our treasures with repeated light, God, coming hither from the Gods. 3 Pour on us, Pavamana, rain, as service and rain praise for Gods: Pour all to be our nourishment. 4 Thou art a Steer by lustre: we, O Pavamana, faithfully Call upon thee the Splendid One. 5 Do thou, rejoicing, nobly-armed! pour upon us heroic strength: O Indu, come thou bitherward. 6 When thou art cleansed with both the hands and dipped in waters, with the wood. Thou comest to the gathering-place.
7 Sing forth your songs, as Vyasva sang, to Soma Pavamana (‘purified Soma’), to, The Mighty One with thousand eyes; 8 Whose coloured sap they drive with stones, the yellow meath-distilling juice, Indu for Indra, for his drink. 9 We seek to gain the friendly love of thee that Strong and Mighty One, Of thee the winner of all wealth.
10 Flow onward with thy stream, a Steer, inspiriting the Maruts' Lord, Winning all riches by thy might.
And it is also a Steer that flows onward with its stream.

And on this jar a stream from the zebu is flowing to two plants. This of course is not done without reason, because this scene demonstrates that, among others, Soma has to bring weal to growing plants:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-11
1. Sing forth to Indu, O ye men, to him who is purified, Fain to pay worship to the Gods. 2 Together with thy pleasant juice the Atharvans have commingled milk, Divine, devoted to the God. 3 Bring, by thy flowing, weal to kine, weal to the people, weal to steeds. Weal, O thou King, to growing plants
4 Sing a praise-song to Soma brown of hue, of independent might. The Red, who reaches up to heaven.
Besides that, it is the Lord of the plants:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 1-91
6 And, Soma, let it be thy wish that we may live and may not die:
Praise-loving Lord of plants art thou.
And in another hymn it even flows onwards from the plants:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-59
1. Flow onward, Soma, winning kine, and steeds, and all that gives delight: Bring hither wealth with progeny. 2 Flow onward from the waters, flow, inviolable, from the plants: Flow onward from the pressing-boards.



Number 1
In this jar the zebu itself is streaming all over which demonstrates that this Soma-steer is a stream of meath:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-7
1. Forth on their way the glorious drops have flowed for maintenance of Law, Knowing this sacrifice's course. 2 Down in the mighty waters sinks the stream of meath, most excellent, Oblation best of all in worth. 3 About the holy place, the Steer true, guileless, noblest, hath sent forth Continuous voices in the wood.
And these details on the jar symbolize that Soma like rivers down a steep descent:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-17
1. Like rivers down a steep descent, slaying the Vrtras, full of zeal, The rapid Soma-streams have flowed.
Additionally, these details may express the following sentence: ‘As down the steep slope of a river to the vale, drawn from the Steer the swift strong draughts have found a way’:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-69 7 As down the steep slope of a river to the vale, drawn from the Steer the swift strong draughts have found a way.
Well be it with the men and cattle in our home. May powers, O Soma, may the people stay with us.

This zebu has a remarkably large eye, which is of course not without reason, for example in the following hymn it is said that with this eye the Steer is our protector:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-89
1. This Chariot-horse hath moved along the pathways, and Pavamana flowed like rain from heaven. With us hath Soma with a thousand currents sunk in the wood, upon his Mother's bosom. 2. King, he hath clothed him in the robe of rivers, mounted the straightest-going ship of Order. Sped by the Hawk the drop hath waxed in waters: the father drains it, drains the Father's offspring. 3 They come to him, red, tawny, Lord of Heaven, the watchful Guardian of the meath, the Lion. First, Hero in the fight, he seeks the cattle, and with his eye the Steer is our protector. 4 They harness to the broad-wheeled car the mighty Courser whose back bears meath, unwearied, awful. The twins, the sisters brighten him, and strengthen-these children of one damethe vigorous Racer. 5 Four pouring out the holy oil attend him, sitting together in the same container. To him they flow, when purified, with homage, and still, from every side, are first about him. 6 He is the buttress of the heavens, supporter of earth, and in his hand are all the people. Be the team's Lord a well to thee the singer: cleansed is the sweet plant's stalk for deed of glory. 7 Fighting, uninjured come where Gods are feasted; Soma, as Vitra-slayer flow for Indra. Vouchsafe us ample riches very splendid may we be masters of heroic vigour.



Number 2
This yar depicts four circles with a point in the middle. They are Soma drops and resemble the eye of the sheep in between them. This was of course done on purpose because Soma, the Mighty One, has thousand eyes, all looking like this eye of the above sheep:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-65
1. The, glittering maids send Sura forth, the glorious sisters, close-allied, Send Indu forth, their mighty Lord. 2 Pervade, O Pavamana, all our treasures with repeated light, God, coming hither from the Gods. 3 Pour on us, Pavamana, rain, as service and rain praise for Gods: Pour all to be our nourishment. 4 Thou art a Steer by lustre: we, O Pavamana, faithfully Call upon thee the Splendid One. 5 Do thou, rejoicing, nobly-armed! pour upon us heroic strength: O Indu, come thou bitherward. 6 When thou art cleansed with both the hands and dipped in waters, with the wood. Thou comest to the gathering-place. 7 Sing forth your songs, as Vyasva sang, to Soma Pavamana, to, The Mighty One with thousand eyes;
8 Whose coloured sap they drive with stones, the yellow meath-distilling juice, Indu for Indra, for his drink.



https://nl.pinterest.com/pin/338614465710394221/?mt=login bowl. Indus valley 3200-2700 BC
It turns out that Soma can also be depicted as a lion:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-97
26 Effused by us let God-delighting Somas bring as they flow a home with noble heroes. Rich in all boons like priests acquiring favour, the worshippers of heaven, the best of Cheerers. 27 So, God, for service of the Gods flow onward, flow, drink of Gods, for ample food, O Soma. For we go forth to war against the mighty make heaven and earth well stablished by thy cleansing. 28 Thou, yoked by strong men, neighest like a courser, swifter than thought is, like an awful lion.
And in this predator are six Soma drops depicted like 'eyes', which of course symbolizes that this dreaded animal is many eyed:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-26
1. The sages with the fingers' art have dressed and decked that vigorous Steed Upon the lap of Aditi, 2 The kine have called aloud to him exhaustless with a thousand streams, To Indu who supporteth heaven. 3 Him, nourisher of many, Sage, creative Pavamana, they Have sent, by wisdom, to the sky. 4 Him, dweller with Vivasvan, they with use of both arms have sent forth, The Lord of Speech infallible. 5 Him, green, beloved, many eyed, the Sisters with prosing stones Send down to ridges of the sieve. 6 O Pavamana, Indu, priests hurry thee on to Indra, thee Who aidest song and cheerest him.

And in the middle of this bowl is a Soma-plant. It is depicted on a number of Soma-pot and here it is indicated by two radiant Soma drops above it.
At the top of this bowl are meandering lines symbolizing a river, and next to the Soma-plant are two zebus. The river, the plant and the zebus may express that the Soma drink with rivers roarest in the beaker:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-96
14 Pour, hundred-streamed, winner of thousands, mighty at the Gods' banquet, Pour the rain of heaven, While thou with rivers roarest in the beaker, and blent with milk prolongest our existence.

The zebu cow of course provides milk and on this jar the two M-characters behind this animal symbolize this liquid:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-91
1. As for a chariot-race, the skilful Speaker, Chief, Sage, Inventor, hath, with song, been started. The sisters ten upon the fleecy summit drive on the Car-horse to the resting places. 2 The drop of Soma, pressed by wise Nahusyas, becomes the banquet of the Heavenly PeopleIndu, by hands of mortal men made beauteous, immortal, with the sheep and cows and waters. 3 Steer roaring unto Steer, this Pavamana, this juice runs to the white milk of the milch-cow.

On this bowl the Soma-characters and the milk-characters alternate, symbolizing that Soma and milk are mingled together:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-72
1. They cleanse the Gold-hued: like a red Steed is he yoked, and Soma in the jar is mingled with the milk.
He sendeth out his voice, and many loving friends of him the highly lauded hasten with their songs.
Again, the following sentences state that Soma is blended with milk as suggested on this bowl:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-107
I., Hence sprinkle forth the juice effused,. Soma, the best of sacred gifts, Who, friend of man, hath run amid the water-streams. He hath pressed Soma out with stones. 2 Now, being purified, flow hither through the fleece inviolate and most odorous. We ladden thee in waters when thou art effused, blending thee still with juice and milk.



Ancient Indus Valley Pottery Jar Cup decorated with a Bull and Trees WorthPoint
On this cup is the Indus Valley character for 'grain', which of course resembles the Sumerian 'grain' sign:
XE
The Sumerian sign (Jaritz #669) reads še (for *ši), 'barley', and 'grain, seed'; the proper word for 'grain, seed' (SE-?A) is discussed above under SE.
Grain or barley is used in combination to Soma as a it is enjoyed in milky food or barleybrew:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 1-187
7 If thou be gone unto the splendour of the clouds, Even from thence, O Food of meath, prepared for our enjoyment, come. 8 Whatever morsel we consume from waters or from plants of earth, O Soma, wax thou fat thereby. 9 What Soma, we enjoy from thee in milky food or barley-brew, Vatapi, grow thou fat thereby. 10 O Vegetable, Cake of meal, he wholesome, firm, and strengthening: Vatapi, grow thou fat thereby.
By the way, the steer not only represents the Soma drink, but it also ploughs this barley in:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 1-176
1. Cheer thee with draughts to win us bliss: Soma, pierce Indra in thy strength. Thou stormest trembling in thy rage, and findest not a foeman nigh. 2 Make our songs penetrate to him who is the Only One of men; For whom the sacred food is spread, as the steer ploughs the barley in.



Number 4
And here we see the 'grain' character again and around it there are five smaller grain characters, three ‘eyes’ symbolizing Soma drops and five M-characters symbolizing milk. Here all the characters are mixed up which of course symbolizes that Soma, milk and grain are mingled together:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 3-42
1. Come to the juice that we have pressed, to Sorna, Indra, bleat with milk: Come, favouring us, thy Bay-drawn car! 2 Come, Indra, to this gladdening drink, placed on the grass, pressed out with stones: Wilt thou not drink thy fill thereof? 3 To Indra have my songs of praise gone forth, thus rapidly sent hence, To turn him to the Soma-draught. 4 Hither with songs of praise we call Indra to drink the Soma juice: Will he not come to us by lauds? 5 Indra, these Somas are expressed. Take them within thy belly, Lord Of Hundred Powers, thou Prince of Wealth. 6 We know thee winner of the spoil, and resolute in battles, Sage! Therefore thy blessing we implore. 7 Borne hither by thy Stallions, drink, Indra, this juice which we have pressed, Mingled with barley and with milk.
8 Indra, for thee, in thine own place, I urge the Soma for thy draught: Deep in thy heart let it remain, 9 We call on thee, the Ancient One, Indra, to drink the Soma juice, We Kusikas who seek thine aid.

And on this bowl we see a stylized banyan tree with three leaves and four bunches of figs.

On the left is a photo of a cut fig and on the right is the character of the fig as symbolized on various bowls and jars, which of course looks like a Soma drop.



Sold Price: Huge Indus Valley Pottery Vessel - Bulls & Fish w/ TL - August 4, 0120 8:00 AM MDT
It seems that the figs of the banyan tree sweetened the Soma drink:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-68
1. The drops of Soma juice like cows who yield their milk have flowed forth, rich in meath, unto the Shining One, And, seated on the grass, raising their voice, assumed the milk, the covering robe wherewith the udders stream. 2 He bellows with a roar arourd the highest twigs: the Tawny One is sweetened as he breaks them up. Then passing through the sieve into the ample room, the God throws off the dregs according to his wish.
The Soma steer is enriched with sweets:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-80
5 Deft-handed men with stones, the ten swift fingers, drain thee into waters, thee, the Steer enriched with sweets.
Thou, Soma, gladdening Indra, and the Heavenly Host, flowest as Pavamana like a river's wave.
And Soma is sweetly-flavoured or mingled with sweetness:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-97
4 Let us sing praises to the Gods: sing loudly, send ye the Soma forth for mighty riches. Let him flow, sweetly-flavoured, through the filter, and let our pious one rest in the pitcher. 10 Strong Indu, bathed in milk, flows on for Indra, Soma exciting strength, to make him joyful. He quells malignities and slays the demons, the King of mighty power who brings us comfort. 11 Then in a stream he flows, milked out with press-stones, mingled with sweetness, through the fleecy filterIndu rejoicing in the love of Indra, the God who gladdens, for the God's enjoyment.
Again, it is made sweet, and the scenes on bowls indicate that this sweetness is derived from the banyan figs:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-67
31 The man who reads the essence stored by saints, the Pavamani hymns, Tastes food completely purified, made sweet by Matarisvan's touch. 32 Whoever reads the essence stored by saints, the Pavamani hymns, Sarasvati draws forth for him water and butter, milk and meath.



Number 3
A Soma drop with small rays is depicted on the right of this pot. This does not just happen as in the next hymn we can read that Soma resembles the sun and that it shines just like the sun in its splendour:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-54
1. After his ancient splendour, they, the bold, have drawn the bright milk from The Sage who wins a thousand gifts. 2 In aspect he is like the Sun; he runneth forward to the lakes, Seven currents flowing through the sky. 3 He, shining in his splendour, stands high over all things that existSoma, a God as Surya is.
4 Thou, Indu, in thy brilliancy, pourest on us, as Indra's Friend, Wealth from the kine to feast the Gods.
Potent Soma drops are brilliant and swift:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-64
4 Out of desire of cows and steeds and horses. potent Soma-drops, Brilliant and swift, have been effused.
They are bright and flashes brilliantly:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-64
28 Bright are these Somas blent with milk, with light that flashes brilliantly. And form that utters loud acclaim.
Of course, that is these reasons why the above Soma drop is depicted with these small rays.

6 As thou, O Indra, to the ancient singers wast ever joy, like water to the thirsty,
So unto thee I sing this invocation. May we find strengthen in fig food in full abundance.
In this way a distinction is made between Soma drops and figs.

And this bowl shows that the four ingredients are mixed.
Here we can clearly see that the shining Soma drops, the figs, the grain and milk characters are neatly interspersed, which of course symbolizes that all the ingredients are mingled:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-72
1. They cleanse the Gold-hued: like a red Steed is he yoked, and Soma in the jar is mingled with the milk.
He sendeth out his voice, and many loving friends of him the highly lauded hasten with their songs.
Rig Veda hymn nr, 9-86
45 Dweller in floods, King, foremost, he displays his might, set among living things as measurer of days. Distilling oil he flows, fair, billowy, golden-hued, borne on a car of light, sharing one hom-e with wealth. 46 Loosed is the heavens! support, the uplifted cheering juice: the triply-mingled draught flows round into the worlds. The holy hymns caress the stalk that claims our praise, when singers have approached his beauteous robe with song.



Number 5
The middle part of this bowl is completely inscribed with Soma and milk characters.

When we take a closer look it seems as if it is raining Soma drops and milk like drops of Soma juice effused fall like rain upon the earth:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-17
1. LIKE rivers down a steep descent, slaying the Vrtras, full of zeal, The rapid Soma-streams have flowed.
2 The drops of Soma juice effused fall like the rain upon the earth: To Indra flow the Soma-streams.

This is an extremely interesting bowl because it shows various plants as well as a zebu cow. These plants and the cow provide the ingredients for the Soma drink.
1. The stalks of grain supply the grain. 2. The banyan tree supplies the sweet figs, 3. The Soma plant naturally supplies the Soma, 4. And the zebu cow supplies the milk.
It is even possible that a recipe is shown here: a ritual Soma drink consists of two parts of grain, one part of figs, one part of Soma and one part of milk.



Number 6
I'm showing this bowl because it has a special drawing on it.
When we enlarge this drawing it looks like a sheep with long haired wool. That wool is used to purify the Soma:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-103
1. To Soma who is purified as ordering Priest the song is raised: Bring meed, as 'twere, to one who makes thee glad with hymns.
2 Blended with milk and curds he flows on through the long wool of the sheep. The Gold-hued, purified, makes him three seats for rest.
3 On through the long wool of the sheep to the meath-dropping vat he flows: The Rsis' sevenfold quire hath sung aloud to him.



Number 7
And here is another picture of a sheep with long-haired wool. For a further explanation of the wool character I give the floor to Richard Dibon-Smith:
Pottery designs of this time show the horns of the ibex wrapped around a celestial symbol while the body has been reduced to nothing (9). Indeed, the ibex soon disappears completely from pottery ware in Susa. Small bowls from Susa Ca (c3600 BC) show just what kind of transformation the ibex was undergoing before it faded from view altogether. As Edmond Pottier described these designs, the legs first multiply under the stomach (11a), then the head and tail are reduced to nothing more than hooks while the legs resemble the teeth of a comb (11b). These are the same designs that Ackerman had seen as rain clouds. We will
now see that Pottier’s concept, i.e., that of an animal undergoing some sort of transfiguration, is the more likely.
A little knowledge of the physical nature of the ibex will be useful at this point. Normally the ibex is a short-haired animal. In winter, however, it grows a long shaggy coat to help it survive the high mountain climate. It is suggested here that the multiple legs and teeth of a comb are nothing more than artistic renderings of a winter coat. Thus, the Figure 5 meaning becomes clear: The ibex as the Sign of Life and Fertility (i.e.Spring) is dead; henceforth you shall regard the ibex as the Sign of Death (Winter). If this is so, then it would mean that the ibex had been replaced by another animal as the primary sign of Fertility and Spring. The winter season was apparently not of much interest to the designers of pottery. The ibex does not survive in this role on pottery, but it does survive on cylinder seals, and it is through the study of these seals that the death and transfiguration of the ibex can be fully traced. But first, these same
seals can tell us the process by which the ibex as a symbol of Spring and Fertility was replaced by the bull. http://www.dibonsmith.com/ibex.pdf



Number 8
So, the wool of the sheep depicted here is used to purify the Soma:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-103
1. To Soma who is purified as ordering Priest the song is raised: Bring meed, as 'twere, to one who makes thee glad with hymns.
2 Blended with milk and curds he flows on through the long wool of the sheep. The Gold-hued, purified, makes him three seats for rest. 3 On through the long wool of the sheep to the meath-dropping vat he flows: The Rsis' sevenfold quire hath sung aloud to him.
When it wanderest through the cloth of wool:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-16
1. The pressers from the Soma-press send forth thy juice for rapturous joy The speckled sap runs like a flood. 2 With strength we follow through the sieve him who brings might and wins the kine, Enrobed in water with his juice. 3 Pour on the sieve the Soma, ne'er subdued in waters, waterless, And make it pure for Indra's drink. 4 Moved by the purifier's thought, the Soma flows into the sieve: By wisdom it hath gained its home. 5 With humble homage, Indra, have the Soma-drops flowed forth to thee, Contending for the glorious prize. 6 Purified in his fleecy garb, attaining every beauty, he Stands, hero-like, amid the kine. 7 Swelling, as 'twere, to heights of heaven, the stream of the creative juice Falls lightly on the cleansing sieve. 8 Thus, Soma, purifying himwho knoweth song mid living men, Thou wanderest through the cloth of wool.



Number 8a
And on this bowl the sheep and the wool characters symbolize that the Soma, grain and milk has been purified: obviously it is purified within this bowl:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-8
1. Obeying Indra's dear desire these Soma juices have flowed forth, Increasing his heroic might.
2 Laid in the bowl, pure-flowing on to Vayu and the Asvins, may These give us great heroic strength. 3 Soma, as thou art purified, incite to bounty Indra's heart, To sit in place of sacrifice. 4 The ten swift fingers deck thee forth, seven ministers impel thee on: The sages have rejoiced in thee. 5 When through the filter thou art poured, we clothe thee with a robe of milk To be a gladdening draught for Gods.
6 When purified within the jars, Soma, brightred and golden-hued, Hath clothed him with a robe of milk.

In the next hymn Soma is compared to the waves of waters, which is symbolized by the meandering lines at the top:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-33.
1. Like waves of waters, skilled in song the juices of the Soma speed onward, as buffaloes to woods. 2 With stream of sacrifice the brown bright drops have flowed with strength in store of kine into the wooden vats. 3 To Indra, Vayu, Varuna, to Vishnu, and the Maruts, flow the drops of Soma juice effused. 4 Three several words are uttered: kine are lowing, cows who give their milk: the Tawny-hued goes bellowing on. 5 The young and sacred mothers of the holy rite have uttered praise: they decorate the Child of Heaven. 6 From every side, O Soma, for our profit, pour thou forth four seas filled full of riches thousandfold.
Besides that, the bull and the waves may suggest that the Soma drink is loud as a river's roaring wave:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-50
1. Loud as a river's roaring wave thy powers have lifted up themselves: urge on thine arrow's sharpened point. 2 At thine effusion upward rise three voices full of joy, when thou flowest upon the fleecy ridge. 3 On to the fleece they urge with stone the tawny well-beloved One, Even Pavamana, dropping meath. 4 Flow with thy current to the sieve, O Sage most powerful to cheer, to seat thee in the place of song. 5 Flow, Most Exhilarating! flow anointed with the milk for balm, Indu, for Indra, for his drink



Number 9
A fish is, of course, the animal of the water and therefore it represents the waters as well as the rivers, like a bird represents the wind. When we read the Rig Veda it is noticeable that the Soma drink is regularly called 'Indu' the most important river in the Indus Valley:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-30
1. Streams of this Potent One have flowed easily to the straining-cloth: While he is cleansed he lifts his voice. 2 Indu, by pressers urged to speed, bellowing out while beautified. Sends forth a very mighty sound. 3 Pour on us, Soma, with thy stream manconquering might which many crave, Accompanied with hero sons. 4 Hither hath Pavamana flowed, Soma flowed hither in a stream, To settle in the vats of wood. 5 To waters with the stones they drive thee tawny-hued, most rich in sweets, O Indu, to be Indra's drink. 6 For Indra, for the Thunderer press the Soma very rich in sweets, Lovely, inspiriting, for strength.
The fishes thus represent this Indus River, which in turn represents the Soma drink.



Number 10
I end this essay with this bowl: the fish above the zebu indicates that the small V-characters that form a line above the zebu's back represent a river. This river is Soma, the Lovely One that flows over the ox-hide:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-65 25 Urged forward o'er the ox-hide flows the Lovely One of tawny hue, Lauded by Jamadagni's song.
Soma is even sporting on the ox hide:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-66
29 This Soma, through the pressing-stones, is sporting on the ox hide, and Summoning Indra to the draught.
And its stream rests upon the wild-cow’s hide:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-12
2 As mother kine low to their calves, to Indra have the sages called, Called him to drink the Soma juice.
3 In the stream’s wave wise Soma dwells, distilling rapture, in his seat, Resting upon a wild-cow’s hide.
All in all, in this essay I claimed that images and characters on Ancient Indus Valley pots suggested that these pots were used for ritual purposes

Number 6 Today an unusual and spectacular exhibition opens at the National Museum of Oriental Art (MNAO) 'Giuseppe Tucci' in Rome, Italy. Living Symbols presents a group of painted protohistoric objects from the 4th and 3rd millennium BCE, illegally excavated in Balochistan and seized in 2005 by the Italian police. Although much about their provenance is lost, they are apparently from the little know Nal Buthi and Kulli cultures that preceded (Nal) and accompanied (Kulli) the height of Indus culture. They use of the zebu bull, pipal tree, tiger and other major motifs familiar to us from Harappa and Mohenjo-daro. These are among the most splendid objects ever found from the area, and show how vibrant the use of color was. They convey the sophistication of symbolism and art in the 4th and 3rd millenniums (4000-2000 BCE). The exhibition, organized by MNAO in collaboration with the Pakistan Embassy and with the support of Eural Gnutti s.p.a., represents a precious opportunity for a first encounter with the cultures that succeeded in Pakistan. Curated by Giovanni Lombardo (MNAO) and



Harappa.com contributor Massimo Vidale (University of Padua, Italy). More at http://www.simbolivivi.beniculturali.it/english.html. [Image 2] The archaeologist Ute-Franke-Vogt wrote of the Kulli culture from which the second image may stem ‘This late Kulli occupation to which the largest number of sites in southern
Balochistan belong, co-existed with the Indus Civilization (Kanri Buthi).The presence of quite a number of town-like settlements added a new and unexpected dimension to this cultural complex and to an area which so far had remained in the shadow of the Indus Civilization. These new and exciting findings require a rethinking of models of interaction and center-periphery relations between these two areas.’ Additional information can be found in Franke-Vogt's slide show The Archaeology of Southeastern Balochistan.

Number 10 Ancient Ceramics From Indus Valley 5-7,000 years ago, someone could have told you what the symbols and paintings represented, why the bull was tied up while fish hovered over him; but not today. Today, no one is really sure about the culture that produced this and other pieces, even though it was one of civilization's 4 cradles. Still, this piece and the others make quite an impression even today.
