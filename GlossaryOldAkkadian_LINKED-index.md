PREFACE
The publication of the Glossary of Old Akkadian, announced in
1952, at the time when volumes I and II of the Materials for the Assyrian Dictionary were being issued, has been delayed until now for two main reasons, which have forced me to set aside, at least temporarily, the work on the present volume. The first reason, growing out of my preoccupation with the initial stages of publication of the Assyrian Dictionary, needs no further elaboration. The second reason is connected with the steadily growing mountain of new material, either pub
lished or made available to me through the kind cooperation of scholars everywhere, which had been accumulating while I was occupied by pressing duties with a higher priority.
The Glossary presents a picture of the Old Akkadian lexicographical material from the oldest times down to the end of the third Dynasty of Ur. Two terms need an explanation. The term "glossary" means exactly what the term normally implies and no more. The Glossary contains words collected for the use of the Assyrian Dictionary, ordered according to form and rough semantic grouping, with translations intended solely to serve as a guide to future investigators of the meanings. The term "Akkadian" embraces probably more than the term implies since the Glossary includes a number of entries used as loan words in Sumerian, which may have been borrowed not from Akkadian but from other Semitic languages spoken in Mesopotamia or in the neighboring areas. Similarly, in order not to prejudice the matter of their linguistic affiliation, all the non-Sumerian names marked as MAR.TU
("Amorite") have been included, as well as some names, such as I-la-sama-ar or Mar-da-ba-an, which may be Amorite even through they are
attested without the MAR.TU designation. The occurrence or lack of
the designation MAR.TU is regularly marked in the Glossary.
Three types of sources have been included in the Glossary. The primary sources, consisting of Akkadian words occurring in the Akkadian texts, and the secondary sources, consisting of Akkadian loan words in
Sumerian and of Akkadian words which occur as elements in proper names
in either Akkadian or Sumerian texts.
The Glossary does not give a complete picture of the Old Akkadian
lexicon as it can be reconstructed from the available sources, in that
it has no entries which are written logographically only and for which
vii
oi.uchicago.edu



no known syllabic spellings can be attested or safely reconstructed. I did collect for the use of the Assyrian Dictionary all the logographic spellings occurring in Old Akkadian, but have decided not to include
them in the present Glossary as they would have required a different type of listing and would have doubled the size of this volume.
Certain qualifications should be made in respect to the complete
ness of coverage of the Old Akkadian onomastic material. Originally, my plan was to excerpt completely all the Akkadian material found in personal names of the Pre-Sargonic and Sargonic sources, but to leave out the comparative material in the Ur III Period, relying on Schneider's publication in Orientalia XXIII-XXIV to take care of this portion of the Old Akkadian lexicon. This turned out to be impossible, however. So many important corrections and additions had to be made to the
Schneider publication that in the middle of my work I was forced to
revise my original plans and to collect the Ur III materials indepen
dently. Due to the immense number of the Ur III sources, it would
have been impossible for me to collect the Ur III personal names as
completely as I did the Pre-Sargonic and Sargonic names. Some short
cut had to be made, and I have decided not to collect completely such
common elements as abum, ilum, nadanum, for which ample documentation is attested. Thus the onomastic material is quoted fully for the Pre
Sargonic and Sargonic Periods but is quoted in selection in the Ur III
Period when it was thought that the additional examples add nothing of
importance to our knowledge of Akkadian in the Ur III Period.
While personal names excerpted from the texts found in the Diyala
region, Gasur, Susa in Elam, and from the Manistusu Obelisk are quoted
simply with reference to D (and FM), G, E, and MO, it must be clearly
understood that they have been collected directly from the respective
text publications and not from the lists of personal names. The quota
tion of the lists of personal names, while it is a short-cut, is useful
since the lists often quote many more references than are given in the
Glossary. The specific sources are quoted fully in the case of readings
which differ substantially from those found in the published lists of
personal names.
While words occurring in Old Akkadian sources are quoted with
complete references, the personal names usually bear only one reference
from each of the three periods of Old Akkadian, only in exceptional
cases two or more. The + symbol after a reference means that there
are more references which I have collected but have not quoted in the
Glossary. This symbol is reliable in the case of Pre-Sargonic and
viii
oi.uchicago.edu



Sargonic materials, which I have collected fully. Owing to my somewhat unsystematic method of collecting the Ur III onomastic material, I have the feeling that the + symbol will have to be added in many more instances of Ur III quotations than are so marked. This is also true of
some very common Akkadian loan words occurring in the Ur III texts, which add nothing of lexical importance to the instances quoted in the Glossary. The three periods of Old Akkadian are distinguished, whenever necessary, by symbols "PSarg." for Pre-Sargonic, "Sarg." for Sargonic, and "U" or "Ur III" for Ur III. The symbol "PSarg." is regularly used with all occurrences of the Pre-Sargonic Period; the symbol "Sarg." is written only when needed in the discussion, it being taken for
granted that lack of any symbol means that the occurrence is dated to the Sargonic Period. Since the majority of occurrences are from the Sargonic Period, it is important for the users of the Glossary to mark this point well. "U" or "Ur III" is used regularly with Ur III references, except in the cases of U followed by a number, which refer to Ur III personal names quoted after Schneider, Orientalia XXIII-XXIV. Comparative materials from later periods are regularly marked by abbreviations denoting periods, such as OB, OA, MB, etc. Additional information is often found with references, giving the place of origin of the sources, such as Mari or Chagar Bazar. The Elamite sources are not marked because they can be easily recognized from the MDP references in which they were published. The "CM" abbreviation (for Cruciform Monument) is given regularly after the reference to warn the readers of the spurious character of this source (cf. Gelb in JNES VIII 346ff.). The symbol "copy" after a reference means that the source is known only from a late copy and it may not reproduce correctly the older form of the language. Generally, this symbol is omitted in the case of such well-known texts as the royal inscriptions published in PBS V 34 + XV l1and UET I 274-276. For important dis
tinctions between different types of later copies of the Sargonic royal inscriptions, cf. MAD II 11. Two types of sources, one marked "Der"
(inscriptions from Der) and the other "Voc. prat." (Vocabulaire pratique published in RA XVIII 49-78), have been included in the Glossary, even though they may have been composed in the early OB Period, because they contain materials linking them with the Ur III Period. A warning is also in order about the three texts published as Ur III in BE III 76-78 and included in the Glossary, even though their Ur III date, rather than early OB, may be in question.

Personal names used for PSarg., Sarg., Gutian, etc. kings have no references since they can be easily found with the full critical apparatus in Jacobsen, The Sumerian King List ( AS XI). Ur III dates are quoted generally after Ungnad, "Datenlisten" in Reallexikon der Assyriologie II 136ff. Only one, main, text is quoted in the case of the royal inscriptions, omitting the sometimes quite numerous duplicates. The entries in the Glossary are preceded by what normally would be called "roots," but what actually should be considered as a kind of consonantal skeleton, which is used to help in grouping related entries and in cross referencing. Thus while the "root" of qaqqadum is QDQD (or reduplicated QD) or, with vowels, qadqad, the consonantal skeleton given in the Glossary is QQD, reproducing the three occurring consonants of qaqqadum. Similarly anta is placed under the consonantal skeleton of INT and not N oor an. Due to typographical difficulties, the transliteration of Sumerian could not be distinguished as carefully from that of Akkadian as it would have been in a printed volume. Sumerian logograms in Akkadian texts are regularly in roman capitals. However, Sumerian elements in Sumerian texts are also given in roman capitals (and are not in spaced roman) to distinguish them clearly from Akkadian elements quoted in small roman minuscules. The only exception are long Sumerian quotations and Akkadian loan words in Sumerian ending in -um, such as ar-ga-num, ta-za-num, which must be considered as foreign words in Sumerian. In both cases small roman minuscules are used.
Often no line references are quoted, mainly due to the difficulty of finding the correct number of the quoted line in large texts with
several columns. Occasionally, such expressions as top, middle, end, or bottom are used to help in finding the quoted reference in texts with many lines in a column. Commas are often added to separate phrases in longer quotations, even though they do not reproduce the the original. This departure from the standard transliteration procedure was introduced to enable scholars to follow complicated Akkadian or Sumerian contexts more easily. Throughout the long process of preparation of this volume I have enjoyed the most helpful cooperation of scholars throughout the world, which I feel a pleasant duty to acknowledge here. In the first place I should like to mention institutions and scholars who have either provided me with photographs or copies of unpublished materials or have made it possible for me to study the texts in their museums: Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Here, at home I have received much valuable help from nm colleagues in the Oriental Institute. I have enjoyed close collaboration with Professor Thorkild Jacobsen especially in the early stages, while I was still working on the transliteration of the vast Diyala material. Professor A. Leo Oppenheim read an early draft of the manuscript and offered many valuable suggestions. I had the good fortune of being able to discuss with Professor B. Landsberger some of the difficult problems of Old Akkadian lexicography. To all these scholars I owe more than can be expressed in words or gleaned from a casual perusal of the volume. The recognition of my indebtedness must include the names of Frangois Thureau-Dangin and Arthur Ungnad, whose pioneer work in the early phases of the Mesopotamian civilization serves and will remain to serve as an ideal model for future generations.

PSarg., Sarg., and Ur III PN's:
PN's of the type listed below have been the subject of much discussion. Schneider, Museon LIX 68ff. and Oppenheim, CCTE p. 180 n. 6 take
for granted that the element all and the like stands for ill and the like. Stamm, ANG pp. 165, 285f., 314 interprets the great majority of PN's with the elements alum, ali, al by translating them as "where?"; only on pp. 88, 90 does he consider the possibility that alum "city" occurs in some of the PN's. For other opinions cf. Stamm, ANG p. 286, also Nyberg in Archiv fur Religionswissen
oi.uchicago.edu



schaft XXXV (1938) 338ff., 386, who operates with a divine element
Cal(um). Actually, a large proportion of PN's listed by Stamm and below, esp. those with ali, must be interpreted by taking the element in question to mean "where?." The clearest of these is the
PN A-lisu-ni (below) which must mean "where are they?" (on -suni S-sunu cf. MAD II 173) on the basis of comparison with a-li su-nu, a-li su-u, a-li at-ta, etc. (Delitzsch, AHWB p. 66). On the other side, a separate group of PN's must be interpreted as containing the element alum, Wal, al "(deified) city." Cf. Lu-dA-l1 (below); A-lf-li-bur (bel6w) with A-l3-lu-mu-ur (Stamm, ANG p. 86, OB), URU-lu-mur (ibid., NB), and A-li-a-mur (MDP XVIII 31, OB); I-bid~RKI (below); A-lu-a-11 (below); A-lu-i-lum (below); *ul-gi-a-al (below) with dul-gi-URU.MU (U 915 passim); la-ku-un-a-li (Bauer, Die Ostkanaanaer p. 92) with la-ku-un-A-sar (ibid.) and A-li-a-sar (below); Be-li-a-li (below) with i-li-a-li (A 2188h, OB) and f-lia-li (UET V 165, OB); Su-um-ru-ug-a-li (UCP X p. 169:12, OB) with gu-um-ru-ug-Sin (p. 94:23).

HSS X p. xv drew the conclusion that both DUMU and su mean "son
(of)." Same conclusion might be drawn from 1-lu-lu DUMU ME-DINGIR = i-lu-lu su rME-DINGIR1 (both at D). Careful consideration of DUMU and su in texts which use both terms makes Meek's conclusion
unacceptable, and it might be suggested that the two cases in favor of the identification of DUMU with su are due to a scribal confusion. The following texts suggest that su means "grandson" PN1 DUMU PN2 su PN3 si PN4 (MO A iii) = PN2 DUMU PN3 si PN (MO A ii) PN1 DUMU PN2 si PN (MO A iv) PN2 DUMU PN3 (ibid.)

Further evidence can be drawn from D 335 listing barley assigned to Zu-na-num and 4 other persons, all of whom are listed as su-ut Zu-na-num, evidently a different person from the other Zu-na-num. Cf. also the text D 319 listing 14 persons with their paternity

NAMES POSSIBLY AKKADIAN
This list includes a variety of names which for one reason or another have not been entered under the respective elements in the main Glossary. Mostly, they are names which should be considered Akkadian because of the endings, such as Du-su-um, Uu-zu-um, Ma-gu-um, but for which no plausible interpretation could be offered. For other names in the list some questionable interpretation could be given, as in Ua-ar-bu-uk-SI = ar-buqlim, La-ma-da = La-ma~da, but the interpretation could not be considered safe enough to warrant inclusion in the main list. Some names, such as Ma-ri-bi-DINGIR, Un-nu-bi-DINGIR, I-tini-la-a[g]?, Mi-tu-uk-l[i]?, have suspicious and doubtful readings, in others, such as KIL-DINGIR, KIL-um, DINGIR-li-NI, UD-ra-NI, UR-me-a-ni, KA-KA-LUM, the reading of certain polyphonic signs cannot be ascertained. There is no doubt that this list could be enlarged considerably by many more possibly Akkadian names, mainly in the Ur III Period.
