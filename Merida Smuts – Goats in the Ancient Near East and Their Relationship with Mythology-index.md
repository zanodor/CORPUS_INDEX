Goats in the Ancient Near East and Their Relationship with the Mythology, Fairytale and Folklore of These Cultures
This study investigates the role of goats in the myths and folklore of
various Ancient Near Eastern (ANE) cultures. Images in artefacts, and
metaphors or direct reference to goats in texts (the primary sources in
this study) from the geographic area of Mesopotamia, Sumer, Akkad,
Anatolia and Ancient Iran (Elam) were studied. Secondary sources
provided the context within which the sources occurred. Where
images and references to goats occurred, their meaning and
relationship to belief systems or their underlying ‘motifs’ within the
ANE cultures are identified, categorised and discussed. This study
shows that aside from the important utilitarian function of goats in
the ANE, their use in rituals and symbolism has provided us with
several motifs related to goats that are still in use today. These include
the motifs of fertility, intelligence and craftiness.
1. Introduction
Man is essentially a myth-maker—using myths, folklore, fable and
legend to contextualise the society in which he lives. Since goats have
been a companion of man in the midst of his society since the dawn of
civilisation, it is only logical that goats feature in oral tradition. Oral
tradition that, over millennia, has been captured in the written myths,
legends, epics, fable and fairy tales that we know today.
Many cultures have used goats in stories that portray various social
constructs of their times. But here, it may be important to first digress


 and provide some analysis of the different types of folklore. Folktales,
specifically, can be compared across cultures through recurring ideas
or ‘motifs’ (dominant themes), which are defined by the political,
economic and religious discourse of the time. Motifs may be
situations, actions, events, characters or objects. Very often, the motifs
are abstractions or models, the details being secondary and differing
according to the variant: thus the typical situation (motif) of the hero
outwitting the stupid giant or giants is the same whether the hero is a
god, a prince, a young huntsman, a retired soldier or the Three Billy
Goats Gruff. The purse of gold may be a jug of oil that never empties,
the bird that lays the golden eggs, a plant that provides eternal life or
the little goat that bleats causing a table laden with food to appear to
the melancholic (but always attractive), ill-treated, stepsister [1]. It
can be said that once we have identified the motif behind a folktale,
we can then determine whether the goat has been used as a cursory
object to creatively illustrate the story or whether the goat is the
actual subject of the story.
Very often, in folktales, goats are used for creative illustration
(sometimes the goat could just as well have been a pig, cow or
chicken). But, other times, goats convey a specific meaning to the
story and play a role in the motif that cannot be as accurately
illustrated by another animal [2].
Folklore includes popular traditions, legendary ballads, local
proverbial sayings, superstitions, old customs, folktales, legends,
games, sports and nursery rhymes. Edward Clodd believed that the
chief function of folklore was to explore the savage beliefs and
practices underlying established religion. However, folktales also
provide insight into human psychology through their underlying
meaning [3].
Myth is generally distinguished from legends and fairy tales in that


 the former addresses cosmic themes such as the creation of the world,
the beginning of life and the origins of civilisation. They may have
arisen as embellished accounts of historical events, as a means to
justify religious ritual or as metaphor or representation of natural
phenomena [4]. Mythic stories are enacted on a supernatural scale:
heroes of myth are gods and superhumans. Heroes of fairy tales and
legends are ordinary men and women [2] although magic and
fantastic animals, creatures or events may be involved.
Fables are a somewhat different genre. It is generally thought that
fables were the creation of the slave Aesop who lived on the island of
Samos in the sixth century BC. He won the favour of Croesus, king of
Lydia, (and his freedom) by telling stories [5]. Aesop’s fables have an
industrious, efficient style, always ending with a moral. They are
mainly for adult enjoyment and generally depict animals’ instinctive
behaviour in humanistic terms: the ant is industrious, the fox is crafty,
and the tortoise is slow. Fable ‘morals’ or ‘motifs’ are centred on the
notion that ‘life is a constant struggle’ and of ‘survival of the fittest’
[2].
Whereas fables are indifferent and realistic, the animals of European
fairy tale are more compassionate and magical. Fairy tales are
generally more optimistic and joyful than fables (although this is
disputed by some and proven by some stories with unhappy endings
[6]), are characterised by a lack of realism, are not believed by those
who tell them and generally aim to teach [2]. Fables tend to depict
animals as merciless and irresponsible, while fairy tales make them
intelligent and benevolent. Fables tend to depict animals in terms of
behaviourism, while the fairy tale reminds one of the analytical
psychologies of Freud or Jung [2]. A distinction has been made that
fairy tale and myth bring animals closer to men, while fables and
satire, while seemingly doing the same thing, do the reverse; they are
conflict-ridden and put animals in their place—as submissive to


 humans [2].
However, as we may all have experienced, the interaction with a live
animal is a very fundamental and personal encounter, which largely
negates the limitations often imposed by cultural perception. Thus,
the goat, being an animal of unique intelligence, virility and
behaviour, so close to man because of its usefulness and hardiness, has
characteristics that have been described in the same way among
different cultures. The goat is depicted as a symbol of fertility,
abundance, aggression and good luck in many of these civilisations.
These cross-cultural similarities and differences are of interest but,
also, the changes in how these animals are depicted over time warrant
scrutiny. It is surely modifications in human and social conditions that
create or cause these fluctuations in how goats are depicted because
the character of goats is a genetic rather than an environmental
manifestation.
This chapter investigates the role played by goats in the myths and
folklore of various Ancient Near Eastern (ANE) cultures. To this effect,
images in artefacts, and metaphors or direct reference to goats in texts
(to be considered the primary sources in this study) from the area are
studied. Secondary sources provided the context within which the
sources occur. Where images and references to goats occur, their
meaning and relationship to belief systems or their underlying ‘motifs’
within the ANE cultures are identified and discussed. Ultimately, this
chapter aims to determine whether ANE cultures ascribed certain
characteristics to goats that may still be applicable today.
2. Materials and methods
Although the array of domesticated animals is vast, this analysis
investigates primarily goats (and similar species such as the ibex


 where relevant or where ambiguity occurs) in the myth, folklore and
fairy tale (if these can be defined) of the Near Eastern cultures of
Mesopotamia, Sumer, Akkad, Anatolia and Ancient Iran (Elam). The
timespan that is covered by this chapter is approximately 3000 years.
It is acknowledged that this is too vast an expanse to make specific
inferences about the impact of the goat on the political, social or
religious contexts within which goat symbolism may occur, nor can
one surmise at the influence that this political, social or religious
context makes on the way the goat is considered in society.
3. The domestication and use of goats (and
other species)
It is believed that wild animals were herded into enclosures for killing
to improve on the success of hunting—images depicting this practice
have been found [7]. After a time, animals that exhibited certain
characteristics that would make them predisposed to domestication
became accustomed to this close contact. This close association
between man and animal led to the domestication [8] of some species
(but not others). These ‘phases of domestication’ can be categorised
into ‘wild’, ‘managed’ and ‘domesticated’ [9] states.
Jared Diamond [10] has suggested several characteristics that would
predispose certain species to domestication, and these include:
High fertility and reproductive rate and a fast growth rate
Animals that can be herded and handled without becoming
aggressive
Animals that are adaptable to a range of environments and
feedstuffs that are not directly in competition with man’s diet
Animals with a docile nature that are not prone to flightiness or


 skittishness
Animals that naturally move in herds, and submit to a pack
leader
In all these characteristics, the goat excels.
According to Gilbert [11], wild sheep (Ovis) and goats (Capra) were
the earliest livestock domesticated during the Palaeolithic to Neolithic
transition (9000–7000 B.C.E.) in northern and eastern Mesopotamia.
Pigs (Sus) and cattle (Bos) were predominantly domesticated in
southern Mesopotamia. Later introductions included horses (Equus
2500 B.C.E.), donkeys (Equus 4000–3000 B.C.E.) and chickens
(Gallus gallus 1500 B.C.E.).
Recent research [12] has placed the process of the domestication of
goats in the region of south-western Asia, from the eastern
Mediterranean to Turkey and from the southern Levant though south
eastern Turkey and northern Syria to the high Zagros mountain
pastures and arid lowland plains of Iraq and Iran. The process of
domestication spanned approximately 500 years—culminating around
8000 B.C.E. Zeder and Hesse [12] identified a distinct profile of
young male goat slaughter and prolonged female survivorship (or
delayed slaughter of females) in herds in the upland areas of northern
Iraq and north-western Iran through the analysis of goat remains.
Animal production involves the practice of keeping females for
breeding and slaughtering males at a younger age for meat. This is in
contrast to the remains of hunted populations, which clearly show a
focus on fully adult males with females and young taken only
occasionally.
The ancestors of the modern goat were potentially two species, Capra
falconeri, and the Bezoar goat, Capra aegagrus [13], being the most
cited candidate (Capra hircus aegagrus is still found in its wild form in


 the Zagros mountains of Iran and Iraq).
Most of the domesticated animals we know today originated in the
Ancient Near East. These include cattle, goats, pigs, sheep, cats, dogs,
ducks, chickens, geese, horses, donkeys and mules [8]. Their use for
milk, meat, fat, leather, wool, hair, draught, transportation, manure
[8], cheese [9], the storage of wealth [11], eggs [9], recreational (and
possibly educational) zoos [9], drugs [9] and for religious use
(sacrifice, extispicy and for maintenance of the religious complex) is
documented.
Sheep and goats were kept in large flocks that belonged to the state,
the temple or private owners and each was branded with its owner’s
mark (or that of the god for which it was intended). Clearly
articulated contracts between owners and shepherds have been found.
Shepherds often kept all the dairy products and some of the wool as
compensation for their work. Their compensation could also include a
share of the growth in the flock. Figure 1 shows terracotta tablets
inscribed with the records of goatherds and cowherds [14].

Lagash, Mesopotamia, and dated to 2250–2175 B.C.E. (housed in the collection at the Louvre, Paris:
[17]).
Wool (from sheep) and hair (from goats) were initially plucked
(pulled or combed), but shearing was practised from the middle of the
second millennium. Milk was obtained from cows, sheep and goats
(camels and water buffalo were also used for this purpose). Yoghurt,
cheese, butter and ghee were produced. Butter was made by churning
the milk in a narrow-necked jar [7] and rolled with the foot or rocked
[9]. Since fresh milk spoiled rapidly, it was often only used in
medicines, which would be made fresh and used immediately. Figure
2 shows a cylinder seal from Mari with a typical agricultural scene.


 Many such seals have been found, which may indicate the economic
activity in which the owner of the seal may have distinguished him (or
her)self.

Although horses were important in battle, goats were often taken as
booty (Figure 3) and inflated goat skin bags were used in warfare as
flotation devices (Figure 4).

4. Goats in the texts, art and imagery of the
ANE
Primary sources available to the modern scholar of the ANE cultures
include objects, architecture and written texts that have survived
environmental extremes. This investigation seeks to determine
whether, if goats appear in these material artefacts, there is some
indication that they were considered more than merely useful as a
livestock species with utilitarian value but also as an object in myth,
legend or fairy tale.
4.1. Goats in ANE literature
Several texts excavated from ancient Mesopotamia refer to animals in
general [15]. These can be categorised into the following types:


 Wordlists
Omen collections (omina) (including guidelines involving
extispicy and apotropaic rituals)
Myths
Short, functional fables, with no expressed moral
Personified animals in longer narrative fables, debates or contests
Mentioned in propagandistic literature as being subjugated,
hunted, collected, etc. by the king.
The consumption of animals (as well as recipes)
In humorous and ironic anecdotes.
For several of these categories, examples were found in a collection of
Sumerian inscriptions [16, 17]. If evident, this categorisation is shown
and possible explanations for the texts are provided in parentheses.
Page 99. 3.111—‘Although it has never gone there, the goat
knows the wasteland’ (Category: ironic anecdote. Possible
explanation: a goat has instinct to survive in the desert, or a goat
is intelligent—this perhaps relates to the idea of someone having
a ‘gut feeling’ about something)
Page 101. 3.123—‘May you hold a kid in your right arm and may
you hold a bribe in your left arm’ (Category: ironic anecdote.
Possible explanation: the kid can be brought as an offering—to
request a favour from the god—but if the offering does not work,
you also can back it up with a bribe to the priest who can implore
the god on your behalf. This is interesting, since it suggests that
people were quite aware that priests could ‘bend the rules’ if


 requested/motivated to do so).
Page 106. 3.153—‘The goat spoke in the manner of a (wise) old
woman, but acted in the manner of an unclean woman’
(Category: ironic anecdote. Possible explanation: goats are
considered intelligent, but they are bawdy and eat everything
including unclean things, which make them unclean. Here, the
sexual nature of the goat is identified).
Page 128. 5.55—‘A lion had caught a helpless she-goat’ (and she
said), ‘Let me go and I will give you my fellow ewe in return.’ ‘If I
let you go, tell me first your name!’ The she-goat answered the
lion, ‘You don’t know my name? “I am cleverer than you” is my
name.’ After the lion had come to the sheepfold he roared, ‘I
released you!’ She answered from the other side, ‘You released
me, you are clever,... the sheep are not here!’ (Category:
narrative contest. Possible explanation: again showing the
intelligence of the goat. Alster [16, 17] suggests that this is the
Sumerian fable that resembles closest to a true ‘Aesopian’ one.
The Sumerian fables provide a definite answer to the much
discussed question, whether or not the fable as a genre was
invented by the Greeks. Although the genre is now proven to be
considerably older than the Greeks, it does not necessarily mean,
however, that it was first invented in Mesopotamia).
Page 167. 8.Sec.B4.—‘Wearing a long beard like a goat’
(Category: humorous anecdote. Possible explanation: merely a
physical description of a ‘goatee’ beard)
Page 167. 8.Sec.B5.—‘A goat is the gift of a large kid’ (Category:
ironic anecdote. Possible explanation: goats can reproduce at a
very young age—as young as 4 months).
Page 167. 8.Sec.B6.—“A goat speaks as follows to another goat: I


 also toss my head.” (Category: ironic anecdote. Possible
explanation: animals of the same species are likely to behave in
the same way. Or, people of a certain character can identify with
another person of the same character, that is, it takes one to
know one).
Page 169. 8.Sec.B8—‘When the wolves were pursuing a goat, it
turned around, and its feet stumbled over its own feet’ (Category:
humorous anecdote. Possible explanation: a goat is ‘tripsy
footed’?)
Page 171. 8.Sec.B28.—‘A fox spoke to a goat, “Let me put my
shoes in your house!” The goat answered, “When the dog comes,
let me hang them on a nail!” The fox answered, “If the dog stays
like that in your house, bring me my shoes. Let me not stay till
midnight!”’ (Category: narrative contest. Possible explanation:
this dialogue again suggests the intelligence of the goat in being
able to outwit another creature).
4.2. Goats in ANE artefacts and imagery
Goats are evident in the mythology of ANE as shown in various
imagery. Two types of artefacts are available to the art historian [18]:
objects in the round and two-dimensional objects. Objects carved in
the round include figurines, theriomorphic vessels and weights.
Figurines and animal-shaped vessels were often rendered in baked
clay and rhyta (singular rhyton) in metal. Many of these objects were
used in the temple complexes as votive objects (being brought as
tribute to a god), as apotropaic figures (buried underneath the floors
of buildings to ward off evil), were used during religious ceremonies
or were used to weigh the produce brought to the temple by the
citizens who formed part of the distributive temple economies. Two
dimensional objects included low-relief stelae, perforated panels in


 stone or ceramic, tablets and hollow carved stamps or cylinder seals.
These objects had decorative use in temple architecture (stelae and
panels). Tablets were used as administrative tools (to record numbers
of livestock or produce), to train scribes, to capture true literature and
royal inscriptions or to write letters. Stamps and cylinder seals were
personal signatures used to identify objects or show ownership [19].
A general search for images of goats on ANE artefacts was
undertaken. This was done through a search of archaeological
research papers and books, which either provided references to
relevant artefacts or showed photographs or tracings of artefacts.
Where these items were considered important but the images were
unclear, higher quality images were sought. Museum collections that
have been made available for public viewing via the Internet were also
examined.
This was followed by a classification and comparison of the images of
the various artefacts.
To provide structure to the comparison, images that depict a similar
theme or ‘motif’ were grouped. To this effect, a method was sought to
provide some meaning to a classification. Whereas some scholars have
argued that the depiction of animals in Mesopotamian art illustrates
the start of religion, others have argued that animals provide merely a
symbolic representation of the world as the artist saw it. However, it
must be agreed that there must be multiple levels of meaning. To this
end, the system provided by Root [20] to classify the use of animals in
art is used here. An approximate seriation within each group was also
undertaken (although it is conceded that the chronology provided by
scholars commenting on these pieces is assumed correct, which may
not necessarily be the case). The groupings made are discussed below.
4.2.1. Group A: goats as vehicles for experimentation with


 abstraction and decorative compositional dynamic
The goat lends itself to abstraction and decoration with its curved
horns and upturned tail—this is especially the case in the use of the
goat (or ibex) in the art of Ancient Anatolia. The depiction of goats in
Mesopotamian art is often stereotypical, allowing one to assume that
sketchbooks were used and artists trained in standard doctrines. In
the artefacts of this group, the artists have attempted to depict goats
in their most recognisable form (Figures 5 and 6). These include full
profile; walking, or standing with their horned heads shown from the
side; or lying down. Mostly, single animals are shown. Where goats
are not shown entirely, they are suggested by parts of their body, such
as horns in the goat-head rhyton (Figure 7).
Figure 5.

Figure 6.
A baked clay pot, sporting a goat, from Umma which is dated to the Amorite dynasty of the nineteenth
eighteenth century B.C.E. (housed at the Louvre, Paris: [17]).
Figure 7.
(a) Burnished pottery rhyton in the form of a goatʼs head from Iran (Elam) that is dated to 1000 B.C.E.
(b and c) Earthenware goat rhyton dated to between 1000 and 2000 B.C.E. (All housed at the Sankokan
University, Japan).
Although the objects and images shown here have been placed in the
category of ‘abstraction and decorative composition’ because they are
particularly striking, some inferences regarding their symbolism can
be made. Firstly, these objects may have served as votive objects, as
apotropaic figurines or as libation vessels (as part of a ritual in which
characteristics of the animal depicted are expected to be imbibed by
the drinker). Furthermore, it is interesting to note that in both objects
of Figures 5 and 6, the goat is shown with its right leg foremost. As
Green [21] suggests in a paper dealing with apotropaic figurines (that


 lead with the left foot), this may be the beginnings of the custom of
entering a holy place with the right foot first.
4.2.2. Group B: goats as players in specific rituals of human
society
Generally, ancient Mesopotamian gods were human in form. But both
demonic and virtuous creatures were often depicted as animal-human
hybrids. Specific animals were associated with certain gods and often
became their symbols [9]. Thus, the dog was associated with Gula, the
god of healing; the lion-snake-eagle with Marduk and the goat-fish
with Ea (or Enki) [9]. Hatziminaglou and Boyazoglu [22], however,
state that goats were sacred to Marduk and is often pictured
accompanied by a goat (unfortunately, they do not reference this
statement and are perhaps confusing images of Ea with Marduk).
Goats were an important element of divining the future [9, 23]: firstly,
through unsolicited omens or observations (as from the omen list ‘If a
City is Situated on an Elevation’ where both domesticated and wild
animals were used) and secondly, through solicited omens through
extispicy (reading of entrails) or merely a ritual involving an animal
that did not necessarily involve its slaughter.
Where a god had an associated animal, as is the case, for example,
with Ea or Enki, worshippers could bring tribute to a god either by the
live goat itself or in the form of their animal statue (these votive
objects could be clay, gold, bronze and/or sliver), or in the form of a
figure bringing the goat tribute. Images and figurines depicting this
practice (shown in Figure 8) are referred to by modern scholars as
‘goat bearers’ (British Museum). It is interesting to note the
abundance of the ‘goat bearer’ imagery over several cultures
(Sumerian, Anatolian, Assyrian and Elamite) and over a long expanse
of time. Further examples can be found in the work of Marchesi and


 Marchetti [24], which shows more than five examples from several
Early Dynastic Mesopotamian sites.
Figure 8.
(a) Plaque from Nippur, temple of Inʼanak (early dynastic I (3000–2330 B.C.E.)) [27]. (b) A worshipper
carrying kids from Susa, middle Elamite, thirteenth century B.C.E. (housed in the Louvre, Paris: [17]) (c)
from the citadel gate of Zincirli 900–800 B.C.E. ([26]: Plate XV) (d) apotropaic protective spirit
guarding entrance to private chambers, from Nimrud (ancient Kalhu), northern Iraq, neo-Assyrian, 883
859 BC. His curled moustache, long hair and beard are typical of figures of this date. Carrying goat and
ear of corn (housed in the British Museum).
Comparison of these images reveals that all the goat bearers have
goatees or beards and all but one (from Zincirli carrying the goat on
his neck) bear the goats in his arms. This may be important since, as
Breniquet [18] mentions, very often the animal used to represent the
god in visual material or in association with him shares the facial
features or appearance (physiognomy) and behaviour of the god. The
placement of the animal with the god renders the reading unequivocal
and is part of the essence of the god.
According to Heinsohn [25], tribute was not so much to the god but
to the priests themselves who managed the temple complex, as thanks
for the role played by the priest in the act of sacrifice (it could be
dangerous), as well as for absorbing the guilt for the killing itself (an
act created to calm an emotionally traumatised community—initially
following a cataclysmic event). It seems that ritual sacrifice was
abandoned when further cataclysmic events no longer occurred and
thus sacrifice (used to placate an anxious community) was no longer
necessary. At this point, votive objects may have replaced tributes of
live animals.
Although modern scholars refer to these images as ‘goat bearers’
(British Museum; [16]), it is not clear from, nor mentioned in, the
literature whether these statues represent worshippers, priests or the


 god Ea (Enki) himself. Where the goat bearers form part of a scene
where other tribute is being brought, it seems clear that the goat
bearer is indeed a worshipper or tribute-payer; however, where the
images are solitary, the identity of the bearer is ambiguous.
Whole herds of animals were kept for their gods by their temples and
branded with their marks [9, 23]. One can assume that when live
animals were replaced by votive objects as tributes, then, these same
herds would not have been used as sacrificial animals, but as a means
to support the attendants of the temple complex and to redistribute to
the community.
Animals were also used as the recipients of evil transferred from a
human host, what we know today as the ‘scapegoat’ ritual [23]. This
‘transferral’ of the evil (whether bad luck or an illness) could be
achieved through the patient handling the animal, by the performance
of a ritual and then letting the animal go (into a wasteland or a river),
by the performance of a ritual and then slaughtering the animal and
burying it (or discarding its remains in a river or wasteland, or by
splitting the animal in half and passing between the two halves) or by
the patient spitting on it, or eating it, or being covered with it (its
blood), or by merely having the animal in proximity to the affected
person. The scapegoat ritual was often used by the military and
sometimes by cities to remove the scourge of a plague [27].
Animal figurines could be used for scapegoat rituals or as apotropaic
figurines that were buried under the floors of domestic dwellings,
barracks or temples to ward off evil [21]. Elaborate rituals describing
an array of figurines to use (including the goat-fish), and the numbers
of figurines that are required, have been documented [21].
4.2.3. Group C: goats as signifiers of specific political/social ideas
of human society


 The name ‘Enki’ literally means Lord, en, of the earth or the
netherworld, ki, the patron deity of the apkallus (fish-men), who lived
in the underground sweetwaters, the Abzu (Sumerian) or Apsu
(Akkadian) [28]. In this imagery, the god Enki/Ea was associated with
the ‘Sacred tree’ (often erroneously called the ‘Tree of life’).
The Anzu/Apsu was considered, a not altogether unpleasant
intermediary place, between the earth and the netherworld (almost
literally the place of spring water from which life springs). This idea
may be suggested by the imagery of the goat in the tree (as shown in
Figure 9). This was possibly a libation device, and used as temple
furniture.
Figure 9.
The lapis-lazulli goat buck in the tree from the Royal Cemetery at Ur, belonging to the Uruk period c
2600–2500 B.C.E. was probably temple furniture—possibly a stand (housed in the British Museum).
What is important to note here is that although the goat in the tree
represents a certain idea known to the community (Enki and the
Sacred tree), and goat imagery is used in furniture or libation devices,
the animals themselves were not worshipped [18].
4.2.4. Group D: goats as figures in cosmic contests and
‘performances’
Two examples of the use of goats in this manner were found.
4.2.4.1. Ishtar or the mistress of the beasts?
In Anatolian art and folklore, a ‘mistress of the beasts’ occurs, often
associated with the hunt. This mistress (and sometimes master) is
associated with a feline (usually a lion) and a wild goat, ibex or
gazelle [29]. This goddess may have been Cybele (or Dali in Armenia)
and may also be related to the goddess associated with the hunt of the


 Caucasus (Georgians who are believed to be descendants of the
Hittites) who is always associated with goats, ibex or turs (Capra
cylindricornis or Capra [ibex] caucasica) [30]. However,
representations showing similar iconography (a female figure
associated with goats and lions or hunting or warfare) are attributed
by some scholars as Ishtar: the goddess of warfare and sexuality. Some
of these artefacts are shown in Figures 10 and 11.
Figure 10.

Figure 11.
Queen of animals feeds her wild goats, thirteenth B.C.E., from tomb III, Minet el-Beida, harbour of
Ugarit, Syria. Lid of pyxis (round box with lid) (housed in the Louvre).
4.2.4.2. Enki/Ea
The myths that incorporate Ea (or Enki) are of particular significance
here since the primary sources reveal him to be associated with the
goat. The spouse of Ea was Damkina and his cult centre was Eridu.
Marduk was Ea’s son. During the Kassite period, Marduk was elevated
to the top of the Babylonian pantheon and his cult centre was Babylon
[19].
Ea plays a role in several of the Mesopotamian myths. In the Epic of
Gilgamesh, where aside from being mentioned as one of the gods that
have made Gilgamesh wise, he is the god that breaks rank and warns
the human Ut-napishtim (whom Gilgamesh seeks to reveal the secret
of eternal life since Ut-napishtim survived the flood and has been
made immortal) of the impending flood sent by the gods to destroy
man. This role of Enki is again shown in the myth of Atrahasis, the
Flood story. Here too, Enki warns man about the flood and gives him
instruction to build a boat.


 Enki plays a larger role in the Epic of Creation. Here, it is explained, in
the beginning, there were only two gods, Apsu (who represents the
primordial waters under the earth) and Tiamat (the personification of
the sea). They beget four generations of gods, who become noisy and
unbearable. Apsu decides to put an end to their troublesome ways,
but the plot is discovered by Ea ‘who knows everything’. He puts Apsu
and his evil vizier, Mummu, to sleep and then slays them. He then
assumes the belt, crown and mantle of radiance, takes over the
dwelling place of Apsu as his own, and there, with his spouse
Damkina, creates Marduk. Marduk then proceeds to win all sorts of
fantastic battles with the encouragement of his father, Ea, and is
finally made the king of the gods. One of Marduk’s actions is to create
man (to do the work of the gods so that the gods can be at leisure).
In shorter myths, again Ea plays a role. Mostly as the ‘one who knows
everything’. These include the myth of Adapa (a priest of Ea in his cult
temple at Eridu); the Epic of Anzu; the Descent of Ishtar to the
Underworld and the myth of Nergal and Ereshkigal.
The relief and apotropaic figures below (Figure 12) depict the god
Enki (Sumerian) or Ea (Akkadian). Enki was the god of productivity
[31] and freshwater streams, springs and lakes, as well as the abzu
(or apsu – the subterranean freshwater ocean on which the earth
supposedly floated; [31, 8) and, in this guise, was symbolized as the
(or a) fish [9].
Figure 12.
(a) Enki represented as a fish-man in stone relief and (b) as an apotropaic figure (source unknown).
Enki was also associated with wisdom, science, craftsmanship and
magic and this part of his nature was symbolised by a goat [9].
Several stone reliefs and cylinder seal impressions were found
showing goat bearers, a goat in the scene, or a goat shown below the


 god with water or fishes also represented.
This ‘dual’ nature of the god ultimately resulted in the use of the
symbol of the goat-fish (literally ‘Carp-goat’) for the god Enki or Ea
[32] (Akkadian suḫurmašû; Neo-Sumerian Selekuid). Figures of this
deity are named in certain apotropaic (averting evil) rituals [21].
Although no Assyrian monumental art of this deity has been found,
the requirements for their manufacture (dimensions, gold leaf
required etc.) are alluded to in Nimrud texts for a temple of Nabu at
Kalhu [32]. Artefacts representing this deity are shown in Figures
13–15.

and had an original coating of black wash). On the left side of the figurine is a one-line inscription that
reads ‘Come in, favourable hearing and compliance!ʼ ([32]: Plate V).

The boundary stones each show celestial objects (stars and crescent
moons), monuments or temples and deities. On all three boundary
stones, the goat-fish (curved or twisted horns and hooves) can be
clearly distinguished from the dragon (which is generally depicted
with straight horns, talons or claws and a snake-like body).
Similarities between the renditions of goat-fish include one front leg
bent back and the other forward (slightly bent and lifted) (although
both left leg and right leg forward can be seen), cross-hatchings used
to indicate the scales of a fish, twisted splayed horns (except the


 foundation figurine, which may have had horns that are now broken
off). All the boundary stones’ goat-fish are without beards (goatees).
5. Discussion
From the preceding source material, several inferences relating to the
perception of ANE societies regarding goats can be made. The images
shown by the material artefacts, in which goats are portrayed, possess
a decorative, symbolic, religious or mythological motive. It is clearly
discernible when goats are merely portrayed as a livestock species.
These include the goatherd tablets, the agricultural scene in the
cylinder seal from Mari, and the battle scene where goats and sheep
probably represent booty. It is clear from the (quantitatively)
numerous depictions of goats in domestic scenes that goats played an
important role in the household and temple economies of the time. In
these scenes, it is clear that the goat represents itself and no
underlying ‘motif’ or meaning is intended.
Also, generally, goats are rendered very realistically (long, straight or
curved horns and upright tail) and in their characteristic attitudes
since they were a familiar sight in everyday life. This can be expected,
since, in general, variations are most often found in animals that the
artists were not as familiar with (such as elephants or giraffes) [33].
The animal-animal hybrid, the goat-fish, representing Ea or Enki, is
most probably the basis of the constellation Capricorn. According to
Roy [34], all evidence points to the Sumero-Akkadian astronomer
priests as the makers of the constellations as we know them.
Mesopotamia is found on the required latitude to have seen all the
constellations (some are not visible from the southern hemisphere),
the position of the stars at that time (3000–2000 B.C.E.) would
provide a perfect fit for their observations, and the constellations
themselves match almost every deity in the Mesopotamian pantheon,


 including the goat-fish of Ea, now known as Capricorn (so-named by
the Greeks [35]).
In the myth of the creation of the world, Marduk, aside from creating
man, also defined the calendar, setting up the Zodiac and the
sequence of celestial events that would signify the changing seasons
[34]. Star lists in cuneiform have been found, detailing these
constellations and their positions relative to each other. The positions
of the stars were used for navigation, divining the future and as a
means to map boundaries (constellations often appear on boundary
stones). Gurshtein [35] agrees that the goat-fish constellation has
Sumerian origins. It is interesting to note that the goat-fish icon is
called a suḫurmašû [32], whereas Capricorn is called SUHUR.MAS in
tablets from Uruk [36].
The use of goat imagery in the artefacts described show the goat in
association with the god Enki or Ea, and is used in libation vessels,
temple furniture, plaques and votive objects used in the worship of
this god. But, it should be noted that it is not the goat that is
worshipped.
In literature too, although the goat is associated with the god Enki or
Ea, it is the god in his human form that acts in the myths—not the god
in animal form. The goat is used to represent the god in visual
material or in association with him. This finding is corroborated by
Breniquet [18] who states that in iconography, the animal is closely
related to the god and acts as his substitute. Of more interest is her
statement that the facial features or appearance (physiognomy) and
behaviour are also those of the god. The animal is not merely an
accessory, enabling the illiterate to interpret the portrayals; the
placement of the animal with the god renders the reading unequivocal
and is part of the essence of the god.


 The Sumerian texts [16, 17] reveal that goats were considered
intelligent, wise and cunning. The genetic characteristics of goats such
as their ability to reproduce at a young age, their physical appearance
(goatees) and their bawdiness are also alluded to in everyday
proverbs. Goats are thus used as metaphors for intelligence,
mischievousness, virility and fertility.
In each of the Mesopotamian myths described above, Ea or Enki plays
the role of the wise god, offering solutions to a myriad of problems.
He is described as the god ‘who knows everything’ and ‘the Lord of
intelligence’. In the myth of Adapa, it may be suggested that the role
of Ea ‘who knows everything’ is to show man that it is better not to
have eternal life. Alternatively, here Ea could be assuming the role of
the ‘trickster’ often ascribed to goats in later myth and alluded to
again in the Aesopian-type dialogues with the lion and the fox in the
Sumerian inscriptions shown above.
In the Descent of Ishtar to the Underworld, the role of Ea in creating a
‘playboy’ may allude to the sexual nature of goats. And again in the
myth of Nergal and Ereshkigal, the story has an overtly sexual nature.
It is suggested by Root [20] that the use of rhyton as libation vessels
originated in the notion that imbibing liquid from a vessel resembling
one of the more vital animals would magically convey some of the
animal’s own vitality to the drinker. It is perhaps these qualities of
intelligence and fertility that worshippers intended to obtain when
drinking from rhyton shaped as goats or from libation devices
decorated with goat motifs.
6. Conclusion
The depiction of goats in the art and literature of the Ancient Near
Eastern cultures provides us with a means to understand man’s


 attitudes towards goats during this period in time. From the resources
used, it is clear that goats fulfilled an immensely important utilitarian
function. The heritage of Enki (Ea) as the constellation of Capricorn is
significant. The use of goats in ritual and symbolism has provided us
with many motifs related to goats that are still in use today: these
include the motifs of fertility, intelligence and craftiness. From all
accounts, Enki (Ea) was a benevolent god, always available to solve
problems, and often assisting mankind to avert extinction. The
imagery associated with Enki/Ea, as in the sacred tree, the sweet
waters, the apotropaic suḫurmašû and ultimately the goat,
communicates Enki as a symbol of life and an averter of evil.
These are powerfully hopeful and positive images.
