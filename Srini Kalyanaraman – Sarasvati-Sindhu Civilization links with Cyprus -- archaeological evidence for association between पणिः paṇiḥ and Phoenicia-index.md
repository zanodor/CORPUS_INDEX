Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization links with Cyprus -
archaeological evidence for association between पण िः
paṇiḥ and Phoenicia
See: Who were the Paṇi? Vedic Index
https://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.com/2020/08/who-were-pani-vedic-index.html
This monograph is presented in the following Sections.
Section 1. Paṇi and Phoenicians
Section 2. Archaeological evidence: shipwreck and Mohenjodaro tablet with Indus Script
Section 3. Annex A. Decipherment of Indus Script hieroglyphs on Mohenjo-daro tablet; Annex B. Harp-Player hieroglyphs
The thesis posited is as follows: पण िः paṇi are merchants, artificers from SarasvatiSindhu CIvilization in the Veda tradition narrated in the episode of Brbu as the head of paṇi. The evidence for trade in metalwork artifacts is provided on an Indus Script inscription on a Mohenjo-daro prism tablet. It is hypothesised that the oxhide shape ingots (of tin and copper) carried as cargo on this consignment documented on the tablet were further shipped through Cyprus ports to Ancient Far East and the Levant. The roots of Phoenicia in Cyprus can be traced to the Veda
tradition of पण िः paṇiḥ 'metalwork artifices, seafaring merchants'. Archaeological evidence --which links with Indus Script epigraph evidence -- is presented of comparable artifacts with 1. merchants carrying ox-hide shape ingots and 2. harpplayers signifying copper wealth resources, on Cyprus artifacts proclaiming metalwork.
Section 1. Paṇi and Phoenicians
The reference to पण िः paṇiḥ occurs in the Rgveda. Brbu is referred to a head of the
पण िःpaṇiḥ.

I submit that Phoenicians migrated from Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization to Cyprus. The theory that paṇi are the Phoenicians has been debated in 1904, over 120 years ago. I summarise this debate by the following excerpt: frome https://phoenicia.org/rigveda.html Two eminent scholars of the day have already expressed their opinion off the subject of this treatise regarding the historical aspect of the vedas. I append them below as they may encourage others like me in this interesting study.
1. Translation of a letter in Bengali addressed to the author by Mr. R. C. Dutt, member of the Indian Civil Service:
I have read your assay on the Panic War. I am glad to see the scholarship and research you have brought to bear on the subject.
I see nothing improbably in the theory that there was a race called Pani or Panis, that the Indian Aryan seized their cows and that many of the suktas of the Rig Veda were composed to record historical events. In fact your exposition seems more plausible than that of Prof. Max Muller. But I am unable to decide which of these two expositions is correct: indeed I cannot say if it is possible to come to a decision on the subject after so many thousand years.
To what nation or race did the Panis belong, if they were really men? You say they were Phoenicians. A good many proofs are wanted before the statement can be accepted. That the Phoenicians always came to ancient India by the land route: that they quarreled and fought with the Indian Aryans, and that the latter knew them as Panis: or, that the Phoenicians have in their own works mentioned the Aryans living on the banks of the Indus -- these are conclusions which



3
require to be amply demonstrated. I do not say that your theory is a groundless one, but still it is only a theory for the present. Hundreds of hill tribes inhabited Afghanistan, and it s not improbable that they quarrelled with the Indian Aryans for cattle (cows), and that some of them were referred to as the Panis in the Suktas of the Vedas.
I cannot accept your meaning of the word Saramá as correct. It may be taken to mean the Dawn even if the word Pani signifies some hill tribe or a trading people -- "at dawn of day the Aryans discovered the concealed cows and recovered them with the help of Indra."
There can however be no doubt that the word go means cows if your interpretation of the word Pani be correct.
Sd. Romesh Chunder Dutt
May 1, 1902
[The Phoenicians dwelt in some part of Afghanistan long before they colonised Phoenicia, and the wars described in the Vedas refer to those days. Defeated in those wars or for some other reasons they migrated westward and founded the colony of Phoenicia. Or it may be that Phoenicia was their principal colony in those remote Vedic days, and after their defeat in the wars referred to in the sacred books they removed there for good. Mr. Dutt's suggestion, therefore, that the Phoenicians came to India by land, is not borne out by my conclusions -- Author.]
2. The following appeared in the columns of the Indian Mirror (Calcutta), of the 22nd May 1902, from the pen of the eminent Sanscrit scholar Prof. Satis Chandra Acharya Vidyabhusan M. A. of the Presidency College (Calcutta):
" It was nearly ten years ago that I marked with surprise several passages in the Rig Veda (as for instance, in Mandala VI, Sukta 53) where the word Pani repeatedly occurred. Looking into the commentary of Sayanacharya, I found the word Pani interpreted as Vaninj, a merchant. In the Chapter on Unádi suffixes in Panini's Sanskrit Grammar, the word Vanij was found to be derived from the root Pan. I then suspected that the word Pani, meaning a merchant and occurring in the Rig Veda, might refer to the Phoenician race. Eventually I gave expression to the fact in several places, and lately in the introduction to my edition of Kachchayana's Pali Grammar. I expressed my view on the subject With great diffidence. Now I am very glad to find my view confirmed by our learned friend; Babu Rajeswar Gupta, Head Master of the Rangpore Normal School, and Editor of Anjali, who has published a long and interesting article on the subject in the Chaitra number of his journal. The article is an admirable one and is a product of deep researches into the Vedic literature. It reflects great credit on the scholarship of the writer and has brought to light some very important facts of earliest history."

More info. on Phoenicia from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenicia The cities of Phoenicia were janapadas, city-states. [quote] Byblos and Sidon were the earliest powers, though the relative prominence of Phoenician city states would ebb and flow throughout the millennium. Other major cities were Tyre, Simyra, Arwad, and Berytus, all of which appeared in the Amarna tablets of the midsecond millennium BC. Byblos was initially the main point from which the Phoenicians dominated the Mediterranean and Red Sea routes. It was here that the first inscription in the Phoenician alphabet was found, on the sarcophagus of King Ahiram (c. 850 BC). Phoenicia's independent coastal cities were ideally suited for trade between the Levant area, which was rich in natural resources, and the rest of the ancient world. Early into the Iron Age, the Phoenicians established ports, warehouses, markets, and settlement all across the Mediterranean and up to the southern Black Sea. Initially led by Tyre, colonies were established on Cyprus, Sardinia, the Balearic Islands, Sicily, and Malta, as well as the fertile coasts of North Africa and the mineral rich Iberian Peninsula. Though disputed, some scholars believe Carthage, which would later emerge as a major power in the western Mediterranean, was founded during the reign of Pygmalion of Tyre (831735 BC). The Phoenician's complex mercantile network supported what Fernand Braudel calls an early example of a "world-economy", described as "an economically autonomous section of the planet able to provide for most of its own needs" due to links and exchanges provided by the Phoenicians.A unique concentration in Phoenicia of silver hoards dated some time during its high point contains hacksilver (used for currency) that bears lead isotope ratios matching ores

Mohenjo-daro tablet
Mohenjo-daro boat tablet is Rosetta stone for ḍhālako ox-hide-shape copper & tin ingots cargo of Meluhha merchants
https://tinyurl.com/yxcave2w
A characteristic feature of Tin-Bronze Age is the use of ox-hide-shaped large copper and tin metal ingots as cargo for transport by seafaring merchants.
Such cargo has been identified in shipwrecks of Gelidonya and Uluburn. The ox-hide-shape of ingots was evidenced for both copper and tin ingots.
Surprise!!! Such a pair of ingots was shown as cargo on a boat on a Mohenjo-daro tablet. m1429 Prism tablet with Indus inscriptions on 3 sides. Since Indus Script writing is most pronounced in the Mature phase of Sarasvati Civilization, the tablet can be dated to between ca. 2500 -1900 BCE. It is surmised that the ingots shown on the boat were produced by Meluhha merchants because the language used in the script is Meluhha rebur renderings of metalwork.

Ox-hide ingot is so-called because of its shape https://www.andywhiteanthropology.com/blog/the-oxhide-ingot-from-lake-gogebicmichigan " of Turkey (source in text). For those of you unfamiliar with the term, an oxhide ingot is an ingot of copper cast into a quadrilateral shape with concave sides and four "handles" (apparently its called an “oxhide” because it resembles a stretched animal hide in shape). During the Bronze Age in the Mediterranean (ca. 3200-1000 BC), copper was smelted and cast into ingots of this shape weighing about 60-70 pounds (~30 kg) for transport. " (tamar) -- palm tree, date palm (Hebrew) rebus: tāmra 'copper' (Skt.)
Thus, hard alloy ingot (ox-hide shape) are signified as supercargo on the boat.
They signify ox-hide-shaped large ingots of copper and tin carried as cargo by Meluhha seafaring merchant and helmsman.
Source of tin in AFE powering the Tin-Bronze Revolution of 4th millennium BCS.https://tinyurl.com/y5rbl2ap
The provenance analyses by Begemanna et al is conclusive evidence for the source of copper which powered the Tin-Bronze Revolution in ANE. The stunning finding is that the copper came from Khetri mines, not far from Rakhigarhi. One reason why Rakhigarhi was the capital, the key river port town of the maritime riverint-waterway civilization. Similar provenance studies should continue to firmly anchor the source of tin. The largest source was in AFE. See map.
Enormous quantities were used to progress the revolution. What is the largest tin belt of the globe? It is in AFE. I have posited this for further detailed analyses and testing. (So have Muhly and Potts,, archaeometallurgists).Tin ore is accumulated as placer deposits by Himalayan rivers grinding down granite rocks creating cassiterite ore.

A lead isotope study »On the Early copper of Mesopotamia« reports on copper-base artefacts ranging in age from the 4 th millennium BC (Uruk period) to the Akkadian at the end of the 3 rd millennium BC. Arguments are presented that, in the (tin)bronzes, the lead associated with the tin used for alloying did not contribute to the total in any detectable way. Hence, the lead isotopy traces the copper and cannot address the problem of the provenance of tin. The data suggest as possible source region of the copper a variety of ore occurrences in Anatolia, Iran, Oman, Palestine and, rather unexpectedly (by us), from India. During the earliest period the isotopic signature of ores from Central and North Anatolia is dominant; during the next millennium this region loses its importance and is hardly present any more at all. Instead, southeast Anatolia, central Iran, Oman, Feinan-Timna in the rift valley between Dead Sea and Red Sea, and sources in the Caucasus are now potential suppliers of the copper. Generally, an unambiguous assignment of an artefact to any of the ores is not possible because the isotopic fingerprints of ore occurrences are not unique. In our suite of samples bronze objects become important during ED III (middle of the 3 rd millennium BC) but they never make up more

than 50% of the total. They are distinguished in their lead isotopy by very high 206 Pbnormalized abundance ratios. As source of such copper we suggest Gujarat/ Southern Rajasthan which, on general grounds, has been proposed before to have been the most important supplier of copper in Ancient India. We propose this Indian copper to have been arsenic-poor and to be the urudu-luh-ha variety which is one of the two sorts of purified copper mentioned in contemporaneous written texts from Mesopotamia to have been in circulation there concurrently.
Indus Script: Supercargo of copper-/tin- smithy work ingots
The pair of ox-hide ingots which flank doorways on Bharhut scultpural friezes also occur on an Indus Script inscription on Mohenjo-daro prism tablet m1429. The two ox-hide ingots are shown as cargo on a boat flanked by two palm trees and twwo auatic birds.

Why is Orpheus shown as a harp-player? Indus Script tradition provides the answer to the link between harp and animals as wealth-accounting ledgers in rebus Meluhha readings. Harp is copper, animals are metallurgical process-products of wealth. The bird on the top register, left, is not a crow,
but a black drongo which is pōlaḍu, rebus pōlaḍ 'steel'. The donkey, right, is khara 'wild-ass, onager'

The association of harp hieroglyph with animal heiroglyphs is further explained using scores of ANE Indus Script inscriptions which are explained as rebus Meluhha expressions related to metalwork and creation of metal artifacts by guilds of artisans.

"There is evidence to suggest that copper was initially smelted into rough products bars and ox-hide ingots - close to the mines. This was then transported for further refinement and working to the coastal settlements. Ceremonial bronze stand, possibly Kourion, Cyprus. Shows a man carrying an oxhide ingot towards a tree, and another playing a Lyre. "Bronze tools and weapons were cast in double moulds. The cire perdue process was evidently employed for the sockets of the fine decorated spear-heads of the Late Minoan period. Copper was available in some parts of Crete, notably in the Asterousi mountains which border the Mesara plain on the south, but it may have been imported from Cyprus as well. The standard type of ingot found throughout the East Mediterranean in the Late Bronze Age was about two or three feet long, with inward-curving sides and projections for a man to grasp as he carried it on his shoulder. Smaller bun-shaped ingots were also in use." (Sinclair Hood, 1971, The Minoans: Crete in the Bronze Age, Thames and Hudson, p. 106) Oxhide ingot in Indus Script is signified by the word: ḍhālako 'a large metal ingot' (Gujarati) This shape of ingot is sshown on a Mohenjo-daro seal with a boat carrying a pair of such ingots. dula 'pair' rebus: dul 'metal casting'. Thus,metal casting ingots. The association of the lyre-player or harpist with the person carrying an ox-hide ingot is significant. This lyre-player signifies: tanbura 'harp' rebus: tambra 'copper'. Thus, the oxhide ingot is a large copper

"HARP (čang, q.v.),a string instrument which flourished in Persia in many forms from its introduction, about 3000 B.C.E., until the 17th century. The original type was the arched harp as seen at Čoḡā Miš and on later third millennium seals (Figure 1a-c)...Third millennium B.C.E. This was the era of arched harps in Persia. It came to an end with the arrival of angular harps, ca. 1900 B.C.E. (Figure 5a). However, arched harps survived in India and diffused from there during the first millennium C.E. (Lawergren,

[quote]The stele of music shows the foundation rites - performed to the sound of the lyre - of the temple built by Prince Gudea (c. 2100 BC) at his capital of Telloh (ancient Girsu), for Ningirsu, god of the state of Lagash in the Land of Sumer. The stele thus accords with the tradition of Neo-Sumerian art, which unlike that of the preceding period that focused on the warlike exploits of the rulers of Akkad, tends to show the king engaged in pious activities. Hieroglyph: tambura 'lyre, harp, string musical instrument' Rebus: tambra 'copper', tāmbarā 'coppersmith' (Oriya)
The building of Ningirsu's temple
In the Neo-Sumerian Period (c. 2100 BC), the rulers Gudea and Ur-Nammu had themselves
depicted taking part in the foundation rites of temples, notably on steles, as statues, and as
figurines. On the stele of music, Gudea, carrying a peg and cord and followed by figures
probably representing his princely heir and two priests, prepares to lay out the plan of
Ningirsu's sanctuary. The ceremony is punctuated by music, which accompanies the chanting
or singing of liturgical poems. Behind the cantor, a musician plays on a lyre whose sound box
is decorated with a bull. The deep tones of the instrument evoked the bellowing of a bull, and
by poetic identification, within the temple of Ningirsu "the room of the lyre was a noisily
breathing bull." The making of the god's lyre gave its name to the third year of Gudea's reign,
called "the year in which was made the lyre [called] Ushumgalkalamma [the dragon of the
land of Sumer]."
Music in temple foundation ceremonies
The spirit embodied by the lyre played a part in the events leading to the building of the
temple, for it appears in the dream in which the god reveals to Gudea the task he is to
accomplish (Gudea Cylinders, Louvre, MNB 1512 and MNB 1511): "When, together with
Ushumgalkalamma, his well-beloved lyre, that renowned instrument, his counselor, you bring
him gifts [...] the heart of Ningirsu will be appeased, he will reveal the plans of his temple."



35
When the work was complete, Ushumgalkalamma went before Gudea, leading all the musical
instruments, to mark the arrival of the god in his new abode. Ushumgalkalamma is the god's
counselor because its song calms the emotions that disturb the spirit, allowing the return of
the reason indispensable to good judgement. Among the divine servants of Ningirsu, it is the
lyre's duty to charm his master, a god of changeable mood. It is assisted by the spirit of
another lyre that brings consolation in times of darkness: "So that the sweet-toned tigi-drum
should play, so that the instruments algar and miritum should resound for Ningirsu, [...] his
beloved musician Ushumgalkalamma accomplished his duties to the lord Ningirsu. To soothe
the heart and calm the liver [the seat of thought], to dry the tears of weeping eyes, to banish
grief from the grieving heart, to cast away the sadness in the heart of the god that rises like
the waves of the sea, spreads wide like the Euphrates, and drowns like the flood of the storm,
his lyre Lugaligihush accomplished his duties to his lord Ningirsu."
Representations of musicians in Mesopotamia
Representations of musicians are not uncommon in Near-Eastern iconography. They are
found from the early 3rd millennium BC in the banquet scenes that appear on perforated
plaques and cylinder seals. Early in the next millennium, they would appear on molded
terracotta plaques, such as the example with the harpist in the Louvre (AO 12454). Very few
examples of musical instruments have survived until today (among them the lyres from the
royal tombs of Ur, c. 2550 BC); these representations are therefore particularly valuable.

Banquet plaque. The top register of this plaque shows a seated
man and woman celebrating an unidentified event or ritual by participating in a banquet. Two servants attend them while others bring a jar (probably filled with beer), an animal to be slaughtered, and other edibles carried in bundles on their heads. Musicians and dancers in the bottom register add to the festivities. Plaques such as this were part of a door-locking system for important buildings. The plaque was embedded in the doorjamb and a peg, inserted into the central perforation, was used to hold a hook or cord that secured the door and was covered with clay impressed by one or more
seals. https://oi.uchicago.edu/collections/highligh

exchanges would have led to lengthy arguments carried out in various dialects. At best, the deals ended in banquets and at worst, in blood feuds. History abounds with trade arguments leading to wars. A bloody massacre such as that at Tell Brak would have led to the antagonists finding ways to appease tension during negotiations. Urukeans developed one of the most subtle and ancient arts as a possible solution. This is substantiated by the emergence of harps fitted with three or four strings, as depicted on a fourth millennium seal impression from Choga Mish, east of Uruk in Elam, in modern south-west Iran (Fig. 3). The seal depicts a four-string arched harp played by a seated person, while two others beat a drum, a bowldrum and clappers. (Dubé, L.; Chebat, J.-C.; Morin, S., ‘The effects of background music on consumers desire to affiliate in buyer-seller interactions.’ Psychology and Marketing. Vol. 12/4. Published by Wiley-Blackwell (1995) pp. 305-319.)As early as the fourth millennium, Urukeans would have discovered that harp music could unite people, allowing them to share feelings and emotions that they could otherwise only have experienced individually. This was the primary function of the harp: the music it produced would have facilitated the exchange of goods. From the beginning it promoted equal understanding; in other words, ‘all were in tune’. From then on, owing to the fact that the harp was a remarkable mediator, music would have been included in communication procedures between different communities, changing people’s mindset and developing empathy between them. Being the first to understand that music could have a significantly smoothing effect on those that listened to it, Urukeans found that it could also affect protagonists during negotiations. If music cannot change the product itself, it can unconsciously act favourably on the customer’s mood. The smoothing effect of the harp on bad tempers, and its contribution to emotional reactions, would have meant that the instrument had high status, from dawn to dusk. The harp was found in potters’ and

weavers’ workshops, on goods barges, in banquets (Fig. 6) and even during sexual intercourse (Fig. 4-B). The Urukeans’ pride in their invention was so great that they engraved it on cylinder seals; in its silent manifestation, it sounded to the inner ears of those looking at its impression on seals and tablets. On tablets it was denoted by the Sumerian words BAN.TUR, BAN meaning ‘bow’ and TUR meaning ‘small’, hence harp, and the Sumerogram BALAG, voiced as the onomatopoeic ‘dubdub’, a word echoing the sound of the object it depicts. Around 3,300 to 3,000 BCE, the pictogram with which it is associated clearly depicted a harp with three or four strings (Fig. 4) (Dumbrill, R. (1998).
