Epigraphia Indus Script – Contributions to Art & Cultural History of Ancient India and Hindu Iconography
I suggest that the elephant-head of GaṇeĞa in sacred sculptures is modeled after the hypertext compositions signified as 'composite animals' on Indus Script epigraphs.
m1177, m0300 Mohenjo-daro seals ligature a human face to the trunk of an elephant.This epigraphy model provides the framework of an artistic style in iconography of GaṇeĞa. (The meanings of the inscriptions m1177, m0300 are presented in Epigraphia Indus Script discussed in this monograph). Hypertext expressions of Indus Script inscriptions are also replicated on artifacts in the round, examples of which are presented in this monograph.

A seal and octagonal brick pillar in a yajñakuṇঌa in Binjor (4MSR) archaeological site on the
banks of River Sarasvati. The octagonal pillar of the Bronze Age civilization provides the
framework of an artistic style in iconography of RudrabhƗga of ĝivalinga.
The rudrabhƗga of ĝivalinga which is octagonal in shape is traceable to this octagonal pillar
evidenced in Binjor which is in consonance with the R
ࡢ
gveda tradition of installing a ketu, 'emblem' proclaiming the performance of a yajña, a Soma yajña in particular.
Ekamukhalinga from Vat Sak Sampou with Brahma-, Rudra
and Viṣṇu-bhƗga in three segments from the bottom-up.
On the top segment of Vat Sak Sampou ĝivalinga, a human face is ligatured on the artistic style of the human face ligatured to the trunk of an elephant on Mohenjo-daro epigraphs m0300 and

m1177. In Epigraphia Indus Script, an elephant signifies: hieroglyph: karibha, ibha 'elephant' rebus: karba, ib 'iron', ibbo 'merchant'. [In Epigraphia Indus Script, the human face
signifies: hieroglyph mũh 'face' rebus: mũhe 'ingot' (Santali) mũhã̄ 'the quantity of metal taken out of a furnace')].
I suggest that the Rudra-bhƗga of ĝivalinga is modeled after the octagonal pillar of Binjor as a ketu proclaiming the performance of a Soma YƗga.
Thus, the iconography of ĝivalinga and GaṇeĞa in ancient BhƗratīya cultural tradition, in
iconogaphy in particular, are rooted in hypertext expressions of Epigraphia Indus Script.
This monograph presents a thesis that the Indus Script Corpora are also a repository of Hindu Art & Cultural History since the roots of Hindu iconography are traceable to the Indus Script writing system.
“Iconography, as a branch of art history, studies the identification, description, and the interpretation of the content of images: the subjects depicted, the particular compositions and details used to do so, and other elements that are distinct from artistic style. The word iconography comes from the Greek εἰțών ("image") and γράφεȚν ("to write"). A secondary meaning (based on a non-standard translation of the Greek and Russian equivalent terms) is the
production of religious images, called "icons", in the Byzantine and Orthodox Christian tradition
... In art history, "an iconography" may also mean a particular depiction of a subject in terms of
the content of the image, such as the number of figures used, their placing and gestures.” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconography

Twenty sets of inscriptions of Indus Script Corpora have been presented in the monographs listed below. The sets cover over 5000 inscriptions from Mohenjo-daro, Harappa and 40+ other sites of Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization. The sets present readings of the Meluhha (BhƗratīya sprachbund) hypertext expressions and deciphered plain text meanings as metalwork wealth (artha) account ledgers. Thus, the inscriptions constitute the repository of Ancient India Economic History –wealth of nations of Eurasia created by artisans and seafaring merchants, during the Tin-Bronze Revolution from ca. 5th millennium BCE.

TridhƗtu on Indus Script metalwork for crucible steel, ƗdhyƗtmikƗ metaphor pr

thvyaptejorūpadhƗtu (R
ࡢ
gveda)



16
This monograph presents the roots of the sacred association of GaṇeĞa with TridhƗtu from the evidences provided by Sarasvati-Sindhu (Indus) Script Corpora and relates it to Sayaṇa's interpretation of TridhƗtu in a R
ࡢ
gveda R
ࡢ
ca (RV 1.154.4). pr
ࡢ
thvyaptejorūpadhƗtu (R
ࡢ
gveda) makes the expression of Sayaṇa an ƗdhyƗtmikƗ metaphor.
The detailed evidences provided principally relate to metalwork resources of ferrite minerals, processing of crucible steel and creation of hypertext expression by combining body parts to expand hieroglyph compositions into a hypertext as shown on Dholkal GaṇeĞa, with clear intimations of metalwork: GaṇeĞa wears a steel chain and holds a kaṇঌe 'pinecone' rebus: kaṇঌa 'metal implements' on his hand.
Dholkal GaṇeĞa of Chattisgarh with extraordinary hieroglyphs used in the pratimƗ.Association
with the assur, 'smelter' tradition links this mūrti with the metalwork traditions traceable to
Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization. Chattisgarh is the ironore and mineral part of BhƗratam. BhƗratiya
ItihƗsa traditions link GaṇeĞa to ĝiva and PƗrvati (daughter of Himavan, Himalayan mountain,
hence associatd with mr
ࡢ
t 'earth' used to form GaṇeĞa pratimƗ for worship).
Just as GaṇeĞa is traced to Sarasvati-Sindhu script traditions of hieroglyph/hypertext cipher



17
(Meluhha cipher of Mlecchita vikalpa), ĝiva is traced to the presence of ĝivalingas in Harappa
and the find of an octagonal pillar in a yajna kunda in Binjor.
The rudrabhƗga of ĝivalinga which is octagonal in shape is traceable to this octagonal pillar
evidenced in Binjor which is in consonance with the R
ࡢ
gveda tradition of installing a ketu, 'emblem' proclaiming the performance of a yajna, a Soma yajna in particular. The same tradition is seen in 19 Yupas which are octagonal and with Yupa inscriptions in Rajasthan historical sites, Allahabad, Mathura, East Borneo (Mulavarman). The trace to R
ࡢ
gveda tradition is attested in
greate detail in Satapatha Brahmana which describes the details of the yupa and caṣƗla (which is
godhuma, 'wheat chaff'. caṣƗla infuses carbon into the metal processed in a yajna kunda making
the metal hard by a process carburization in metallurgy. Thus, element carbon enters the elements of the mineral ores in specific metals or metal alloys.
In 1940, archaeologist M.S. Vats discovered three Shiva Lingas at Harappa, dating more than 5,000 years old. This rare archival photo shows that ancient Shiva Linga as it was being excavated from the Harappa site. Lingam, grey sandstone in situ, Harappa, Trench Ai, Mound F, Pl. X (c) (After Vats). "In an earthenware jar, No. 12414, recovered from Mound F, Trench IV, Square I... in this jar, six lingams were found along with some tiny pieces of shell, a unicorn seal, an oblong grey sandstone block with polished surface, five stone pestles, a stone palette, and a block of chalcedony..." (Vats,MS, Excavations at Harappa, p. 370)

Ekamukhalinga from Vat Sak Sampou
“The JaiyA ekamukhalinga is divided into three parts in accordance with the prescriptions in the
Siva Agamas. The base, BrahmabhAga, is cubic in form and is 47.8 cms. High. The middle section, the ViSNubhAga, is octagonal in shape and is approximately 43 cm. High. The topmost section, the RudrabhAga, is cylindrical and is approximately 51 cms high, while the superimposed face measures 29.5 cms from the bottom of the chin to the top of the jaTA. The two lower sections of the linga would not normally be visible, since they would be enclosed in the pedestal (pIThikA)...One of the singular features of these pre-Angkorian mukhalingas is the fusing of the jaTA with the filet on the gland of the RudrabhAga (fig.2)...There is, however, an ekamukhalinga from Vat Sak Sampou (fig. 3) which displays a coiffure which is very muh like

Siam, The Journal of the Siam Society. The Siam Society. pp. 43-49). http://www.siameseheritage.org/jsspdf/1961/JSS_054_1e_OConnor_EkamukhalingaFromPenins ularSiam.pdf
Linga with One Face of Shiva (Ekamukhalinga), Mon–Dvaravati period, 7th–early 8th century. Thailand (Phetchabun Province, Si Thep) Stone; H. 55 1/8 in. Octagonal form of ViSNubhAga and the occurrence of pancamukhalinga is consistent with the tradition of pancaloha 'five dhAtu or five mineral alloy' images as utsavaberas.
I suggest that the mukha on the linga is read rebus from the hieroglyph:



22
mũh 'a face' Rebus: mũh,muhã 'ingot' or muhã 'quantity of metal produced at one time in a native smelting furnace.' This reaffirms the association of the octagonal brick of Binjor fire-altar with the Skambha as linga or vajra which participates in the process of smelting dhAtu, 'ores'.

An excellent treatise on GaṇeĞa's iconographic forms is a work in Kannada by Vidwan Ganesa
Bhatta Hobali titled: ఔಜ෨ఓನ ಯಿ್ ෨ఓఔು , ಾವಿ ఒ ಿಾబఔಳಂಿೆ , 2015, MS Jagannatha Singh Publisher, Bengaluru. One attribute of GaṇeĞa is m ֈrtpriya, 'fond of earth'.
It is inferred from this metaphor of the form of GaṇeĞa with an elephant's trunk as his head attached to the body is relatable to the earth's elements or three basic mineral resources. This explanation is at an ādi bhautika level.

An ādhyātmikā, ādidaivikā interpretation is provided by Sayana in his bhashya of Rigveda reference to tri-dhātu in RV 1.154.4 Sayana says: रयाणाम् धातॐनां ऺमाऻाररिधातॏ
प्॑यतॕजख़ॺपधातॏरय -- विविटम् यथा भिवत तथा दाधार ध॑तिान् -- Sayana's elucidation of the r
ࡢ
ca
reference to tridhƗtu is provided in the following R
ֈ
gveda text and translation (Griffith's variant translation is also provided)..
I submit that the hieroglyphis metaphors of GaṇeĞa in iconographic tradition is traceable to
Sarasvati-Sindhu Script hieroglyphs and hypertexts. One remarkable characteristic of Meluhha cipher (mlecchita vikalpa) of the Script is the device of hypertexts by joining body parts of different animals including human faces and bodies. Many examples of this device called ऺांगड sāṅgaḍa 'joined animal parts'(Marathi). This is rebus for sangara 'trade' using invoices with products delivered on jāṅgaḍa, i.e. on approval basis. A derived expression in
Gujarati is jangadiyo 'military guard carrying treasure into the treasury', i.e. the warehouse of the commonwealth of guild (śreṇi).
At an ādi bhautika level, the meaning of the expression tridhātu is provided by the following lexical entries from ancient languages of Bharatiya sprachbund:
dhāҽtu n. ދ substance ތ RV., m. ދ element ތ MBh., ދ metal, mineral, ore (esp. of a red colour) ތ Mn., ދ ashes of the dead ތ lex., ދ *strand of rope ތ (cf. tridhāҽtu -- ދ threefold ތ RV., ayugdhātu -ދ having an uneven number of strands ތ KƗtyĝr.). [√dhƗ] Pa. dhātu -- m. ދ element, ashes of the dead, relic ތś KharI. dhatu ދ relic ތś Pk. dhāu -- m. ދ metal, red chalk ތś N. dhāu ދ ore (esp. of copper) ތś Or. ḍhāu ދ red chalk, red ochre ތ (whence ḍhāuā ދ reddish ތś M. dhāū, dhāv m.f. ދ a partic. soft red stone ތ (whence dha
̄
̆
vaḍ m. ދ a caste of iron -- smelters ތ, dhāvḍī ދ composed of or relating to iron )ތ ś -- Si. dā ދ relic ތś -- S. dhāī f. ދ wisp of fibres added from time to time to a rope that is being twisted ,ތ L. dhāī ̃ f. (CDIAL 6773)
Based on this resource, it is submitted that the expression tridhātu means: three red stone ores worked on by dha
̄
̆
vaḍ 'smelters'. The three red ores signiied on many Sarasvati-Sindhu Script inscriptions are: magnetite, haematite, laterite (Meluhha words: pola (magnetite), gota (laterite), bichi (hematite) magnetite ore [pōḷa], steel [pōlāda]; bica 'haematite, ferrite ore'; gota laterite, ferritte ore'. The hieroglyphs related to these three forms of red ore ferrite minerals are: karibha,ibha' elephant' rebus: karba, ib 'iron' ibbio 'merchant'; goTa 'round stone' rebus: goTa 'laterite ore'; bica 'scorprion' rebus: bicha 'haematite, ferrite ore'; poLa 'zebu bull, bos indicus' rebus: poLa 'magnetite, ferrite ore'.
I submit that there are hieroglyhs used in composing GaṇeĞa iconŚ (human) body, (head) elephant trunk, one elephant tusk (tooth). These are presented as hieroglyphs and rebus readings as follows: meḍ 'body' rebus; meḍ 'iron' PLUS karba, ibha 'elephant' rebus: karba, ib 'iron' PLUS Ku. N. dã
̄
t 'tusk, tooth' rebus:dhatu 'mineral ore'. A combination of these three ore expressions as hieroglyphs result in the expression TridhƗtu as a name for or attribute of GaṇeĞa.
This semantic clustering of ferrite ore related hieroglyphs is semantically reinforced by the
determinative hieroglyph associated with GaṇeĞa as his vƗhana which is a mūṣa which is a
homonym for which means mūṣā, mūs ʻcrucibleތ used for producing pōlāda, 'crucible steel',



27
Thus, human body PLUS elephant tusk PLUS elephant trunk PLUS mouse yield the Meluhha terms: meḍ 'body' rebus; meḍ 'iron' PLUS dã
̄
t 'tusk, tooth' rebus: dhatu 'mineral ore' PLUS mūṣa
'rat, mouse' rebus: mūṣā, mūs ʻcrucibleތ for processing in a crucibleŚ karba, ibha 'elephant'

[pa_rthiva_ni vimame raja_m.si = lit. he made the earthly regions; pr.thivi_ = three worlds: atra trayo loka_ api pr.thivi_ s'abdava_cya_; Indra and Agni are said to abide in the lower, middle and upper pr.thivi_ or world-- yad indra_gni_ avamasya_m pr.thi_vya_m madhyamasya_m paramasyam uta stha (RV. 1.108.9; Taittiri_ya Sam.hita_ 1.2.12.1); seven lower loka_s are also included in the word pr.thivi_;or, the term is limited to the three regions addressed in prayer, bhu_h bhuvar svar; who sustained the lofty: uttaram sadhastham askabha_yat: sadastha = the firmament, as the asylum of the three regions-lokatraya_s'rayabhu_tam antariks.am; or, the seven regions above the earth; or, the highest region of all, whence there is no return; or the above of the righteous, the satya-loka; askabha_yat = nirmitava_n, created; thrice traversing: vicakrama_n.as tredha_ (idam vis.n.urvi cakrame: RV. 1.22.17); traversing in various ways in own created worlds]. 1.154.02 Vis.n.u is therefore glorified, that by his prowess he is like a fearful, ravenous, and mountain-haunting wild beast, and because of that in his three paces all worlds abide. [Mountainhaunting wild beast: mr.ga or sim.ha, a lion, as applicable to Vis.n.u: one who seeks for his enemies to inflict punishment on them, and is therefore, fearful and fierce; giris.t.ha_h = he who dwells on high, or who abides in prayer and the like: mantra_diru_pa_ya_m va_ci artama_nah]. 1.154.03 May acceptable vigour attend Vis.n.u, who abides in prayer, the hymned of many, the showerer (of benefits), who alone made, by three steps, this spacious and durable aggregate (of the three worlds). [Who abides in prayer: giriks.it, who dwells in speech, or who abides in high places]. 1.154.04 Whose three imperishable paces, filled with ambrosia, delight (mankind) with sacred food; who verily alone upholds the three elements, and earth and heaven. [The three elements: tr.dha_tu, the aggregate of three elements, earth, water, light: pr.thivyaptejoru_pa dha_tutrayavis'is.t.am; or, the three periods of time, or the three qualities]. 1.154.05 May I attain his favourite path, in which god-seeking men delight; (the path) of that wide-stepping Vis.n.u, in whose exalted station there is a (perpetual) flow of felicity; for to such a degree is he the friend (of the pious). [His favourite path: the firmament: patho anatariks.am]. 1.154.06 We pray (to Vis.n.u) that you may both go to those regions where the many-pointed and wide-spreading rays (of light expand); for here the supreme station of the many-hymned, the showerer (of benefits), shines (with) great (splendour). [You both: the sacrificer and his wife. In the Yajus. VI.3 the pa_da: ta_ va_m va_stu_nyus'masi gamadhyai is varied: ya te dha_ma_nyus'masi gamadhyai, those places to which we desire your going; the hymn is addressed to the yu_pa, or post of sacrifice, while trimming it to shape; the second pa_da is retained in tact, replacing avabha_ti with avabha_ri].
Griffith:
1. I WILL declare the mighty deeds of Visnu, of him who measured out the earthly regions, Who propped the highest place of congregation, thrice setting down his footstep, widely striding. 2 For this his mighty deed is Visnu lauded, like some wild beast, dread, prowling, mountainroaming-; He within whose three wideextended- paces all living creatures have their habitation. 3 Let the hymn lift itself as strength to Visnu, the Bull farstriding-, dwelling on the mountains,



29
Him who alone with triple step hath measured this common dwellingplace-, long, far extended. 4 Him whose three places that are filled with sweetness, imperishable, joy as it may list them, Who verily alone upholds the threefold, the earth, the heaven, and all living creatures. 5 May I attain to that his wellloved- mansion where men devoted to the Gods are happy. For there springs, close akin to the WideStrider-, the well of meath in Visnus' highest footstep. 6 Fain would we go unto your dwellingplaces- where there are manyhorned- and nimble oxen, For mightily, there, shineth down upon us the widelystriding- Bulls' sublimest mansion.

Bera Utsav is a regional festival celebrated in the Murshidabad district of the state of West Bengal. The annual event is organized at the historical and picturesque location of Lalbagh, which at one time was the home of the Nawabs and is located on the banks of River Bhagirathi. People throng the district of Murshidabad to witness this magnificent event. The event is held on the last Thursday of the Bhadra month of the traditional Bengali calendar.

The elephant head ligatured with a buffalo at Nausharo is a curtain-raiser for the practice of ligaturing in Indian tradition for utsava bera 'idols carried on processions'. The phrase utsava bera denotes that processions of the type shown on Mesopotamian cylinder seals or Mohenjodaro tablets are trade processions for bera 'bargaining, trade'. Thus, the processions with hieroglyphs may be part of trade-exchange fairs of ancient times. It is significant that the utsava bera of Ganesa is shown together with a rat or mouse -- as vāhana: ibha 'elephant' Rebus: ib 'iron'. mūṣa 'rat, mouse' Rebus: mūṣa 'crucible'. Thus both rat/mouse and elephant face ligatured to a body, are Meluhha hieroglyphs related to metallurgical processes.
Utsava bera pōḷā (zebu, bos indicus) may be seen in the processions during festival days of Utsava Nandi and veneration in temples on days of pradosham.

The eyes are defined as raised lumps that may have originally been painted. Short feline ears contrast with two short horns similar to a bull rather than the curving water buffalo horns. Two holes on either side allow the mask to be attached to a puppet or worn as an amulet.

Two composite anthropomorphic / animal figurines from Harappa.Whether or not the attachable water buffalo horns were used in magic or other rituals, unusual and composite animals and anthropomorphic/animal beings were clearly a part of Indus ideology. The ubiquitous "unicorn" (most commonly found on seals, but also represented in figurines), composite animals and animals with multiple heads, and composite anthropomorphic/animal figurines such as the seated quadruped figurines with female faces, headdresses and tails offer tantalizing glimpses into a rich ideology, one that may have been steeped in mythology, magic, and/or ritual transformation.

[quote]Rajasuya (Imperial Sacrifice or the king's inauguration sacrifice) is a ĝrauta ritual of the Vedic religion. It is a consecration of a king.[1] It is described in the Taittiriya corpus,
including Apastamba Srauta Sutra 18.8–25.22.[1] It involves soma pressing, a chariot drive, the
king shooting arrows from his bow, and a brief cattle “raid.”[1] There is a telling of the tale
of Shunahshepa, a boy who was nearly sacrificed to Varuna on behalf of the sonless king Harishchandra.[1] Also included is a game of throwing dice by which the king is enthroned and the cosmos is regenerated...This yagya (sacrifice) can be included under the list of other complex yagyas like ishti, pashuyagya, somayagya darvihoma etc. This is a very complex yagya including 129 ishti yagya, 2 pashu yagya, 7 darvi homas and 6 soma yagyas. There are most amazing type of gifts that are given to the priests ( purohitas) who are performing this yagya.Two gold-coated mirrors should be given to the "adhwaryu", who is one of the main priest in this yagya. A Golden chain should be given to the "Udgatha", another type of priest in this yagya.Another type of priest called "Hotha" should be given a Golden ornament called "rukma" as presentation.A white horse each for "Prathihartha" and "Prasthotha" two types of priests performing this yagya. The main priest called "brahma" should ge given 12 healthy cows . "maithra varuna" -the second most important priest should be presented by a "pregnant cow". The "brahmanajhamsi" priest should be presented by a healthy "Ox" . "neshta" and "potha"



41
should be given a couple of two precious "silks". The "achavaka" priest should be presented by a cart full of "yava" a type of cereal. Finally the "agneeth" priest should be presented by a healthy "ox". There are special fees that should be given to the priests who are performing this yagya for the king (Satapatha Brahmana Second adhyaya Third brahmana onwards 13 chapters)...In Yudhishtira's Rajasuya,agra puja was given to Lord Krishna. Another yajna equivalent to this yajna is called as "vaishnava yajna". Rajasuya is performed by king Yudhishtira in mahabharatha and "Vaishnava yajna" is performed by king Duryodhana in mahabharatha [unquote] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasuya

And that which had been his (Vritra's) seat, his retreat, that he shattered, grasping it and tearing it out 1: it became this offering. And because the science (the Veda) that lay in that retreat was, as it were, a threefold (tridhâtu) one, therefore this is called the Traidhâtavî (ishti).
RƗjasūya
5.5.5.1 He prepares a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra and Vishnu. Now as to why he makes this offering. Of old, everything here was within Vrit ... 5.5.5.7. And as to why the oblation is one for Indra and Vishnu, it is because Indra raised the thunderbolt, and Vishnu stood by him. 5.5.5.8. And why it is (a cake) on twelve potsherds,--there are twelve months in the year, and the offering is of equal measure with the year: therefore it is one of twelve potsherds. 5.5.5.9. He prepares it of both rice and barley. He first puts on (the fire) a ball of rice, that being a form (symbol) of the Yagus-formulas; then one of barley, that being a form of the Rik-verses; then one of rice, that being a form of the Sâman-hymns. Thus this is made to be a form of the triple science: and this same (offering) becomes the Udavasânîyâ-ishti (completing oblation) for the performer of the Râgasûya. 5.5.5.10. For, verily, he who performs the Râgasûya gains for himself (the benefit of) all sacrificial rites, all offerings, even the spoonful-oblations; for him the sacrifice becomes as it were exhausted, and he, as it were, turns away from it. Now the whole sacrifice is just as great as that triple Veda; and this (offering) now is made a form of that (Veda, or sacrifice); this is its womb, its seat: thus he commences once more the sacrifice by means of that triple Veda; and thus his sacrifice is not exhausted, and he does not turn away from it. 5.5.5.11. And, verily, he who performs the Râgasûya gains for himself all sacrificial rites, all offerings, even the spoonful-oblations; and this offering, the Traidhâtavî (ishti), is instituted by the gods: 'May this offering also be performed by me, may I be consecrated by this one also!' thus he thinks, and therefore this is the completing offering for him who performs the Râgasûya.
5.5.5.12. And also for him who would give (to the priests) a thousand (cows) or more 1, let this



43
be the completing offering. For he who gives a thousand or more becomes as it were emptied out; and that triple Veda is the thousandfold progeny of Vâk (speech): him who was emptied out he thus fills up again with a thousand; and therefore let it be for him also the completing offering. 5.5.5.13. And also for those who would sit through (perform) a long sacrificial session 2, for a year or more, let this be the completing offering. For by those who sit through a long sacrificial session, for a year or more, everything is obtained, everything conquered; but this (offering) is everything: let it therefore be for them also the completing offering. ... 5.5.5.16. Three gold pieces of a hundred mânas each are the sacrificial fee for this (offering). He presents them to the Brahman; for the Brahman neither performs (like the Adhvaryu), nor chants (like the Udgâtri), nor recites (like the Hotri), and yet he is an object of respect. And with gold they do nothing 3, and yet it is an object of respect: therefore he presents to the Brahman three gold pieces of a hundred mânas each. (Note: According to Sâyana, these 'satamânas' are similar to the round plate worn by the king during the Consecration-ceremony...These plates (as the 'rukmas' generally, were apparently used for ornament only, not as coins.)

r.s.i: gr.tsamada (a_n:girasa s'aunahotra pas'ca_d) bha_rgava s'aunaka; devata_: br.haspati, 15,9,11,17,19 brahman.aspati; chanda: jagati_, 15,19 tris.t.up
2.023.01 We invoke the Brahman.aspati, chief leaderof the (heavenly) bands; a sage of sage; abounding beyond measure in (every kind of) food;best lord of prayer; hearing our invocations, come with your protections, and sit down in the chamber of sacrifice. [Brahman.aspati = brahman.o annasya parivr.d.hasya karman.o va_ pa_layita_, the protector or cherisher of food,or of any great or solemn acts of devotion; he has other attributes in the text, as, gan.a_na_m gan.apatih, chief of the gan.as (inferior deities); jyes.t.hara_jam brahman.a_m, the best lord of mantras, or prayers: pras'asyam sva_minam mantra_n.a_m]. 2.023.02 Br.haspati, destroyer of the asuras, through you the intelligent gods have obtained the sacrificialportion; in like manner as the adorable sun generates the (solar) rays by his radiance, so are you the generator of all prayers. [Br.haspati = Brahman.aspati; perhaps Br.haspati is of a more martial character; his protection is souhght for against enemies and evil spirits; perhaps, br.hata_m veda_na_m pa_lakah: br.hat = mantra, br.hato mantrasya, sva_min]. 2.023.03 Having repelled revilers and (dispersed) the darkness you stand Br.haspati, on the



47
radiant chariot of sacrifice, (which is) formidable (to foes), the humiliator of enemies, the destroyer of evil spirits, the cleaver of the clouds, the attainer of heaven. 2.023.04 You lead men, Br.haspati, by virtuous instructions; you preserve them (from calamity); sin will never overtake him who presents (offerings) to you; you are the afflicter of him who hates (holy) prayers; you are the punisher of wrath; such is your great mightiness. [Him who hates holy prayers: brahmadvis.ah = those who hate either the bra_hman.as,or the mantras or prayers]. 2.023.05 The man whom you, Brahman.aspati, a kind protector, defend, neither sorrow nor sin, nor adversaries nor dissemblers ever harm, for you drive away from him all injurious (things). 2.023.06 You, Br.haspati, are our protector and the guide of (our) path; (you are) the discerner (of all things); we worship with praises for your adoration; may his own precipitate malice involve him (in destruction) who practises deceit against us. 2.023.07 Turn aside from (the true) path, Br.haspati, the arrogant and savage man who advances to injure us, although unoffending and keep us in the right way for (the completion of) this offering to the gods. 2.023.08 Br.haspati, defender (from calamity), we invoke you, the protector of our persons, the speaker of encouraging words and well disposed towards us; do you destroy the revilers of the gods; let not the malevolent attain supreme felicity. 2.023.09 Through you, Brahman.aspati, (our) benefactor, may we obtain desirable wealth from men destroy those (our) unrighteous enemies, whether nigh or far off, who prevail against us. 2.023.10 Through you, Br.haspati, (who are) the fulfiller of our desires; pure, and associated (with us), we possess excellent food; let not the wicked man who wishes to deceive us be our master; but let us, excelling in (pious) praises, attain (prosperity). 2.023.11 You, Brahman.aspati, who have no requiter (of your bounty), who are the showerer (of benefits), the repairer to combat, the consumer of foes, the victor in battles, you are true, the discharger of debts, the humiliator of the fierce and of the exulting. 2.023.12 Let not, Br.haspati, the murderous (weapon) of that man reach us, who, with unrighteous mind, seeks to harm us; who, fierce and arrogant, designs to kill (your) worshippers; may we baffle the wrath of the strong evil-doer]. 2.023.13 Br.haspati is to be invoked in battles; he is to be approached with reverence; he who moves amidst combats, the distributor of repeated wealth; the lord Br.haspati has verily overturned all the assailing malignant (hosts), like chariots (overturned in battle). 2.023.14 Consume with your brightest (weapon) the ra_ks.asas, who have held your witnessed prowess in disdain; manifest, Br.haspati, your glorified (vigour), such as it was (of old), and destroy those who speak against you. 2.023.15 Br.haspati, born of truth, grant us that wonderful treasure, wherewith the pious man may worship exceedingly; that (wealth) which shines amongst men; which is endowed with lustre, (is) the means of (performing holy) rites, and invogirates (its possessor) with strength. [dravin.am citram = lit., various or wonderful wealth; in the Bra_hman.as it is interpreted as brahma varcas or tejas, brahmanical virtue or energy (cf. Yajus. 26.3; dravin.am = dhanam (Aitareya Bra_hman.a 4.11)]. 2.023.16 Deliver us not to the thieves, the enemies delighting in violence, who seize ever upon the food (of others); those who cherish in their hearts the abandonment (of the gods); (they), Br.haspati, who do not know the extent of (your) power (against evil spirits). [Who do not know the extenf of your power: na parah sa_mno viduh = ye puma_msah sa_mnah sa_maya_t tvattah parah parasta_d anyadukr.s.t.am sa_ma yad raks.oghnam na ja_nanti, those men who do not



48
know anything greater than the faculty of destroying ra_ks.asas, derived from you made up of that faculty; sa_ma vai raks.oha = sa_ma is the killer of ra_ks.asas]. 2.023.17 Tvas.t.a_ engendered you (chief) amongst all beings, (whence) you are the reciter of many a holy hymn: Brahman.aspati acknowledges a debt to the performer of a sacred rite; he is the acquitter (of the debt), and the destoyer of the oppressor. [When you are the reciter: sa_mnah sa_mnah kavih, the reicter or another of every sa_ma, sarvasya sa_mnah ucca_rayita_ karta_si; or kavi refers to tvas.t.a_, further explained as the sage who created Brahman.aspati by the efficacy of the sa_ma: sa_mnah sa_ren.a tvam aji_janat; acknowledges a debt: r.n.acit stotr.ka_mam r.n.am iva cinoti, he takes the intention of the praiser as if it was a debt, or obligation; acquitter of the debt: r.n.aya is explained as the discharger or remover of the debt which is of the nature of sin: pa_paru_pasya r.n.asya pr.thak karta_]. 2.023.18 When Br.haspati, descendant of An:giras, for your glory, Parvata had concealed the herd o fkine, you did set them free, and with thine associate, Indra, did send down the ocean of water which had been enveloped by darkness. 2.023.19 Brahman.aspati, who are the regulator of this (world), understand (the purport) of (our) hymn, and grant us posterity; for all is prosperous that the gods protect; (and therefore) may we blessed with excellent descendants, glorify you at this sacrifice. [Yajus. 34.58; vadema = may we declare or glorify you; or, let us speak, let what we ask be given to us;let it be enjoyed by us: di_yata_m bhujyata_m ucca_rayema].

The artistic entwining of three tigers is seen on a seal with Indus Script from Mohenjo-daro.
This can be seen as a precursor model for the three tigers/lions shown on a Sanchi torana (gateway). Out of the seven friezes showing a hieroglyph-multiplex of three winged tigers, one frieze adds hieroglyphs 'leafless stalks' as horns of two tigers; two riders are also added to signify the artisans at work:
Thus, tigers with wings joined reads: eraka kol saMghAta 'moltencast metal, iron worker caravan'. With karaṇঌƗ 'stalks' as koD 'horns' and artisans (carrying goads or weapons or काਔॎ kANDI 'little stalk or stem') hieroglyph components added: karaঌƗ eraka kol saMghAta 'hard alloy moltencast copper working in iron caravan' PLUS kuThAru 'armourer', or kamar 'artisan'
PLUS koD 'workshop'. [In Udipi and coastal Dakshina Kannada districts of Karnataka, there is a
practice of ‘Pili Kola’ worshiping Tiger. The festival is conducted once in every two years in

Thus the two riders of the hieroglyph-multiplex of stalk-as-horn PLUS winged tigers can be read as: armourers working in a smithy-forge, kolimi and with hard alloy, karaDa; moltencast metal, eraka. The riders seem to be arrying: कॏ ठार (p. 167) [ kuṭhƗra ] m S An ax or a hatchet. Hence, they are kuThAru 'armourers'.

mAtri is a knower, one who has true knowledge; hence, mahAmAtra is an elephant trainer. A mahout is a person who rides an elephant. The word mahout comes from the Hindi words mahaut (मऻग़त) and mahavat (मऻाित), which eventually goes back to Sanskrit mahamatra
(मऻामार). Another term for mahout is cornac (as in French, from the Portuguese; kornak in
Polish, also a rather current last name). This word comes form Sanskrit term karinƗyaka, the
compound of Sanskrit words karin (elephant) and nayaka (leader). In Tamil, the word used is "pahan", which means elephant keeper, and in Sinhalese kurawanayaka ('stable master'). In Malayalam the word used is paappaan.In Burma, the profession is called oozie; in Thailand kwan-chang; and in Vietnam quản tượng. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahout
The 'horns' are 'stalks', hieroglyphs: कारं डा [ kƗraṇঌƗ ]करं डा [ karaṇঌƗ ] m A chump or block. the stock or fixed portion of the staff of the large leaf-covered summerhead or umbrella. A clump, chump, or block of wood. करांडा [ karƗṇঌƗ ] m C A cylindrical piece as sawn or chopped off the trunk or a bough of a tree; a clump, chump, or block. करख़ळा [ karōḷƗ ] m The half-burnt grass of a Potter's kiln: also a single stalk of it. Kalanda [cp. Sk. karaṇঌa piece of wood?] heap, stack (like a heap of wood? cp. kalingara) Miln 292 (sīsa ̊) (Pali) करਔ [L=44277] n. a piece of wood , block Bhpr.

triĞiras वर--विर्ऺ may be a metaphor of Rigvedic times to signify three high points or foreparts or principals, say, minerals or components (i.e. three firsts of a classs). In the context of metalwork, it is appropriate to construct morphemes with tri- prefix: वर num. a. [Uṇ.5.66] (declined in pl. only, nom. रयः m., वतिः f., रॎवण n.) Three;-धा ind. in 3 parts, ways or placesś triply,  ̊वम् tripartition; Ch. Up. -धातॏः an epithet of GaṇeĞaś -तॏम् 1 the

trident.  ̊अकः,  ̊धाररन् m. an epithet of ĝiva. Thus, if three 'heads' of animals, say, elephant,
buffalo, tiger are ligatured to create a hypertext, the rebus words may constitute three minerals aggregating to produce an alloy.
Thus, three heads of tigers (winged) on Sanchi stupa torana:

There are many examples of the depiction of 'human face' ligatured to animals:



73



74
Ligatured faces: some close-up images.
The animal is a quadruped: pasaramu, pasalamu = an animal, a beast, a brute, quadruped
(Te.)RebusŚ pasra ‘smithy’ (Santali) AllographŚ panǰƗ́r ‘ladder, stairs’(Bshk.)(CDIAL 7760) Thus
the composite animal connotes a smithy. Details of the smithy are described orthographically by the glyphic elements of the composition.
Rebus reading of the 'face' glyphŚ mũhe ‘face’ (Santali) mũh opening or hole (in a stove for
stoking (Bi.)ś ingot (Santali)mũh metal ingot (Santali) mũhã̄ = the quantity of iron produced at
one time in a native smelting furnace of the Kolhes; iron produced by the Kolhes and formed like
a four-cornered piece a little pointed at each endś mūhƗ mẽṛhẽt = iron smelted by the Kolhes and
formed into an equilateral lump a little pointed at each of four ends; kolhe tehen mẽṛhẽt ko mūhƗ
akata = the Kolhes have to-day produced pig iron (Santali.lex.) kaula mengro ‘blacksmith’
(Gypsy) mleccha-mukha (Skt.) = milakkhu ‘copper’ (Pali) The Sanskrit loss mleccha-mukha should literally mean: copper-ingot absorbing the Santali gloss, mũh, as a suffix.
A remarkable phrase in Sanskrit indicates the link between mleccha and use of camels as trade caravans. This is explained in the lexicon of Apte for the lexeme: auṣṭrika 'belonging to a camel'. The lexicon entry cited Mahābhārata: औवटर क a. Coming from a camel (as milk); Mb.8. 44.28;
कः An oil-miller; मानॏहाणां मलं लॕछा लॕछाना- मग़वटर का मलम् ͡ औवटर काणां मलं ह्ाः ह्ानां राजयाजकाः ͢ Mb.κ.45.25. From the perspective of a person devoted to ĞƗstra and rigid disciplined life, BaudhƗyana thus defines the word लॕछः mlēcchḥ : -- गख़मांऺखादकख़ यतॏ विॹधं बॽ भाहतॕ ͡ ऺिााचारविऻॎनच लॕछ ುयवभधॎयतॕ ͢ 'A person who eatrs meat, deviates from traditional practices.'
The 'face' glyph is thus read rebus: mleccha mũh 'copper ingot'.
It is significant that Vatsyayana refers to crptography in his lists of 64 arts and calls it mlecchitavikalpa, lit. 'an alternative representation -- in cryptography or cipher -- of mleccha words.'

The composite animal (bovid) is re-configured by Huntington. http://huntington.wmc.ohio-state.edu/public/index.cfm Components of the composite hieroglyph on seal M-299. A ligaturing element is a human face which is a hieroglyph read rebus in mleccha (meluhha): mũhe ‘face’ (Santali) ś rebusŚmũh metal ingot (Santali). Using such readings, it has been demonstrated that the entire corpora of Indus writing which now counts for over 5000 inscriptions + comparable hieroglyphs in contact areas of Dilmun where seals are deployed using the characeristic hieroglyphs of four dotted circles and three linear strokes.

Zebu is ligatured as distinctive high horns to create a composite hieroglyph ‘composite animal motif’ as in m0301Ś human face, body or forepart of a ram, body and forelegs of a
unicorn, horns of a zebu, trunk of an elephant, hindlegs of a tiger and an upraised serpent-like tail:

On this seal, the key is only 'combination of animals'. This is an example of metonymy of a special type called synecdoche. Synecdoche, wherein a specific part of something is used to refer to the whole, or the whole to a specific part, usually is understood as a specific kind of metonymy. Three animal heads are ligatured to the body of a 'bull'; the word associated with the animal is the intended message.



78
Mohenjo-daro Seal 1927 with epigraphs on two-side is a confirmation that the horns ligatured to the composite animal on m1927b are horns of zebu.
The pictorial motif hieroglyphs message on the seal:
khũṭ ‘zebu’ Rebus: ‘(native metal) guild’ This refrain is detailed by the zebu horns affixed to the
compositive animal hieroglyph. A synonym is aḍar ḍangra read rebus: aduru
ḍhangar ‘blacksmith’(Santali)
The composite animal hieroglyph can thus be seen as an expansion of the message conveyed by
the zebu hieroglyph expanding the blacksmith guild activities to other minerals and metals
beyond aduru ‘native, unsmelted metal’. The text message seems to be identical on both sides of
the seal m1927: bronze workshop; metal smithy castings; forge. The zebu side a of the seal seems to denote the work of a native-metal-smith; the composite animal side b of the seal seems to denote the expanded work of a blacksmith working with stones, minerals and metals. The composite hieroglyph on m1927b was perhaps called:याळ [ vyƗḷa ] m (याल S) A serpent.

The composite animal glyph is one example to show that rebus method has to be applied to every glyphic element in the writing system.
The glyphic elements of the composite animal shown together with the glyphs of fish, fish ligatured with lid, arrow (on Seal m0302) are:
--ram or sheep (forelegs denote a bovine)
--neck-band, ring
--bos indicus (zebu)(the high horns denote a bos indicus)
--elephant (the elephant's trunk ligatured to human face)



82
--tiger (hind legs denote a tiger)
--serpent (tail denotes a serpent)
--human face
All these glyphic elements are decoded rebus:
meḍho a ram, a sheep (G.)(CDIAL 10120);
kaḍum ‘neck-band, ring’
adar ḍangra ‘zebu’
ibha ‘elephant’ (Skt.)ś rebusŚ ib ‘iron’ (Ko.)
kolo ‘jackal’ (Kon.)

the composite animal glyph is decoded as: polished metal (artifact).

Orthographically, the glytic compositions add on the characteristic short tail as a hieroglyph (on both ligatured signs and on pictorial motifs)

Ligaturing of glyphs on the Indus script is paralleled by sculpted ligatures of Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization
Glyphs on Indus script: Ligatured human body, metal wheelwright
There are many variants of this human body glyph (Sign 1, Mahadevan Indus script corpus). There are many composite glyphs with many ligatures to this human body frame.

Vikalpa: kƗṭhī = body, person; kƗṭhī the make of the body; the stature of a man (G.) Rebus:
khƗtī ‘wheelwright’ (H.)
eṛaka 'upraised arm' (Ta.); Ka.eṟake wing; rebus: eraka = copper (Ka.); eraka ‘metal infusion’ (Tu.)
Characteristic ligatures are: scarf on hair-pigtail, armlets on arms, raised arm, seated (hidden, spy?) on a tree, ligatured to buttocks (back) of a bovine, horned (often with a twig betwixt horns).
All these orthographic glyptic elements can be explained rebus as mleccha smith guild token glyphs, all in the context of a smithy/forge/smithy guild. This decoding is consistent with rebus readings of other glyphs such as ligatured tiger + eagle, tiger+ wings, tiger+ human body.
Bauddham tradition explains the expression Tridhātu at an ādhyāmikā level as three realms of cyclic existence.
Three realms (Skt. tridhātu; Tib. ĸམས་Ĺུམ་ , kham sum; Wyl. khams gsum) — the desire realm, the form realm and the formless realm, all within cyclic existence.
• the desire realm, • the form realm, and • the formless realm. Three realms The three levels within samsara: the desire realm, the form realm, and the formless realm. The desire realm is the environment of hell beings, hungry spirits, animals, human beings, demi-gods, and the gods who enjoy the five objects of desire. The form realm is the environment of the gods who possess form. The formless realm is the environment of the gods who do not possess form. Beings of the desire realm have powerful delusions, beings of the form realm have more subtle delusions, and beings of the formless realm have very subtle delusions. These realms are all within the domain of samsara.
