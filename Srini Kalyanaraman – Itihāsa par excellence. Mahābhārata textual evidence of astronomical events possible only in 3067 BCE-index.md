Itihāsa par excellence. Mahābhārata textual evidence of astronomical events possible only in 3067 BCE
-- Thanks to MM Pandit and Saraswati Films for the video from which these frames have been taken.
-- Thanks to MM Pandit for the extraordinary efforts he has made to debate with those who have made contra claims.
--Mahābhārata is the only historical document of all times to precisely date historical events based on astronomical observations. This makes the Epic the most accurately dated historical document of human civilizational history.
-- I request those who contest these evidences to offer their comments and arguments so that the efforts made by indic scholars to understand their heritage, can stand the test of scrutiny on any fora.
One event related to Balrama’s pilgrimage is recorded in sculpture in Angkor Wat. It is the Gada yuddha between Bhima and Duryodhana which occurs at Kurukshetra.
