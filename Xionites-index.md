Xionites
Xionites, Chionites, or Chionitae (Middle Persian: Xiyōn or Hiyōn;
Avestan: Xiiaona; Sogdian xwn; Pahlavi Xyon) are Romanisations of
the ethnonym of a nomadic people who were prominent in
Transoxania, Bactria and Iran during the 4th and 7th centuries CE[.1]
The Xionites appear to be synonymous with the Huna peoples of
classical/medieval India,[2] and possibly also the Huns of European
late antiquity. It is unclear whether the Xionites were connected to a
people named in Ancient China as the Xunyu (Hünyü 獯鬻; Wade
Giles Hsünyü), Xianyun 猃狁 (Wade–Giles Hsien-yün) and Xiongnu
(匈奴 Wade–Giles Hsiung-nu). (While some sources use names such
as Hunas, Huns and Xiongnu interchangeably, this remains
controversial.)
They were first described by the Roman historian, Ammianus Marcellinus, who was
in Bactria during 356-57 CE; he described the Chionitæ as living with the
Kushans.[3] Ammianus indicates that the Xionites had previously lived in
Transoxiana and, after entering Bactria, became vassals of the Kushans, were
influenced culturally by them and had adopted the Bactrian language. They had
attacked the Sassanid Empire,[1][4] but later (led by a chief named Grumbates),
served as mercenaries in the Sassanian arm.y
Within the Xionites, there seem to have been two main subgroups, which were known in the Iranian languages by names such as
Karmir Xyon and Spet Xyon. The prefixes karmir ("red") and speta ("white") likely refer to Central Asian traditions in which
particular colours symbolised the cardinal points. The Karmir Xyon were known in European sources as the Kermichiones or "Red
Huns", and some scholars have identified them with the Kidarites and/or Alchon. The Spet Xyon or "White Huns" appear to have
been the known in India by the cognate nameSveta-huna, and are often identified, controversiall,ywith the Hephtalites.

Origins and culture



The original culture of the Xionites and their geographical urheimat are uncertain.
They appear to have originally followed animist religious beliefs, which mixed later
with varieties of Buddhism and Shaivism. It is difficult to determine their ethnic
composition.[1]
Ancient Greek and Roman sources, such as Simocatta, Menander and Priscus,
appear to distinguish between the Xionites and the Hephthalites. However, some
modern scholars, such as Richard Nelson Frye (1991), believe that the Hepthalites
were a prominent subgroup of Xionites[.6]
The theory that the Xionites were a proto-Turkic or para-Turkic people was
expressed by Sir Harold Walter Bailey (1932). Bailey wrote that the "Xyon"
mentioned in "Pahlavi and Avestan texts... would appear to be... an enemy of the
Iranian people in Avestan times, transferred later to the Huns owing to similarity of
sound, as Tur was adapted to Turk in Pahlavi". Bailey suggested that "three divisions" of the "Xyon ... seem to be recognized",
namely "the Turks, the Karmir (Red) Xyon, and the White Xyon.["7]
Differences between the Xionites, the Huns who invaded Europe in the 4th century, and the Turks were emphasised by Carlile
Aylmer Macartney (1944), who suggested that the name "Chyon", originally that of an unrelated people, was "transferred later to the
Huns owing to the similarity of sound". The Chyon who appeared in the 4th century, in the steppes on the northeastern frontier of
Persia were probably a branch of the Huns that appeared shortly afterwards in Europe. The Huns appear to have attacked and
conquered the Alans, then living between the Urals and the Volga about 360 AD, and the first mention of the Chyon was in 356
AD.[8] Macartney also considered that the name Chyon was later "replaced by that of the... Kidarite Huns". (However, he also
claimed, erroneously, that "the Kidarites were... identical with the Kushan", when the Kushan Empire had been destroyed by the
Xionites and/or Hunas in the mid-4th Century.) Macartney also considered the question of the identity of the Karmir Xyon or
Kermichiones, saying that that they could not have been "the true Turks" (the Gokturks, who appear to have entered history on the
western steppe, when "their embassy reached Constantinople... in 568". Macartney adds that the Khagan of the Turks at the time was
Silzabul, Dizabul or Istämi, but the ruler of the Karmir Xyon was Askílt (Aσκήλτ, often romanised as Scultor). "Neither can they
have been the Juan Juan [Rouran]... nor the Epthalites [Hephthalites], who were well known to the Byzantines and would not have
been described in this way. Moreover, the Epthalites were [sometimes] known as White Huns, and... Karmir Xyon, meaning Red
Chyon, occurs in a Pahlavi text in juxtaposition with Spet Xyon, White Chyon".
At least some Turkic tribes were involved in the formation of the Xionites, despite their later character as an Eastern Iranian people,
according to Richard Nelson Frye (1991): "Just as later nomadic empires were confederations of many peoples, we may tentatively
propose that the ruling groups of these invaders were, or at least included, Turkic-speaking tribesmen from the east and north,
although most probably the bulk of the people in the confederation of Chionites... spoke an Iranian language.... This was the last time
in the history of Central Asia that Iranian-speaking nomads played any role; hereafter all nomads would speakurTkic languages".[9]
The proposition that the Xionites probably originated as an Iranian tribe was put forward by Wolfgang Felix in Encyclopedia Iranica
(1992).[1]
In 2005, AS Shahbazi suggested that they were originally a Hunnish people who had mixed with Iranian tribes in Transoxiana and
Bactria, where they adopted theKushan-Bactrian language.[4]
The Xionites may have originated as a confederation of Proto-Turkic and/or Proto-Mongoliantribes that collectively adopted Eastern
Iranian languages and cultural practices, according toPeter B. Golden(2005).[10]
The defeat of the Xiongnu in 89 CE by Chinese forces at the Battle of Ikh Bayan and subsequent Chinese campaigns against them,
led by Ban Chao may have been a factor in the ethnogenesis of the Xionites and their migration into Central Asia.

History



Xionite tribes reportedly organised themselves into four main hordes: "Black" or northern (beyond the Jaxartes), "Blue" or eastern (in
Tianshan), "White" or western (possibly the Hephthalites), around Khiva, and the "Red" or southern (Kidarites and/or Alchon), south
of the Oxus. Artefacts found from the area they inhabited dating from their period indicate their totem animal seems to have been the
(rein)deer. An inscription on the walls of the royla palace in Persepolis about Darius's empire calls themHunae.
The Xionites are best documented in southernCentral Asia from the late 4th century AD until the mid-5th century AD.
Sometime between 194 and 214, according to the Armenian historian Moses of
Khorene (5th century), Hunni (probably the Kidarites) captured the city of Balkh
(Armenian name: Kush) .[12] According to Armenian sources, Balkh became the
capital of the Hunni.
At the end of the 4th century AD, the Kidarites were pushed into Gandhara, after a
new wave of invaders from the north, the Alchon, entered Bactri[a1.3]
Early confrontations between the Sasanian Empire of Shapur II with the Xionites
were described by Ammianus Marcellinus: he reports that in 356 CE, Shapur II was
taking his winter quarters on his eastern borders, "repelling the hostilities of the
bordering tribes" of the Xionites and the Euseni, a name often amended to Cuseni
(meaning the Kushans).[14][15]
Shapur made a treaty of alliance with the Chionites and the Gelani in 358 C[E1.6]
In 460, Khingila I reportedly united a Hephthalite ruling élite with elements of the
Uar and Xionites asAlchon (or Alχon). when.
At the end of the 5th century the Alchon invaded North India where they were
known as the Huna. In India the Alchon were not distinguished from their immediate
Hephthalite predecessors, and both are known as Sveta-Hunas there. Perhaps
complimenting this term, Procopius (527-565) wrote that they were white skinned,
had an organized kingship, and that their life was not wild/nomadic and they lived in
cities.
The Alchon were noted for their distinctive coins, minted in Bactria in the 5th and
6th centuries. The name Khigi, inscribed in Bactrian script on one of the coins, and
Narendra on another, have led some scholars to believe that the Hephthalite kings
Khingila and Narana were of the AlChoNo tribe. They imitated the earlier style of
their Hephthalite predecessors, the Kidarite Hun successors to the Kushans. In
particular the Alchon style imitates the coins of Kidarite Varhran I (syn. Kushan
Varhran IV).
The earliest coins of the Alchon have several distinctive features: 1) the king’s head
is presented in an elongated form to reflect the Alchon practice of head binding; 2) The characteristic bull/lunar tamgha of the Alchon
is represented on the obverse of the coins[.18]

The Hephthalites, or White Huns, were a nomadic tribe who conquered large parts of the eastern middle-east and may have originally
been part of the Xionites.
Although the power of the Huna in Bactria was shattered in the 560s by a
combination of Sassanid and proto-Turkic forces, the last Hephthalite king
Narana/Narendra managed to maintain some kind of rule between 570 and 600 AD
over the nspk, napki or Nezak tribes that remained.
H. W. Bailey argues that the Pahlavi name Xyon may be read as the Indian Huna
owing to the similarity of sound.[7]In the Avestan tradition (Yts. 9.30-31, 19.87) the
Xiiaona were characterized as enemies ofVishtaspa, the patron of Zoroaster.[1]
In the later Pahlavi tradition, the Karmir Xyon ("Red Xyon") and Spet Xyon ("White
Xyon") are mentioned.[1] The Red Xyon of the Pahlavi tradition (7th century)[19]
have been identified by Bailey as theKermichiones or Ermechiones.[1]
According to Bailey, the Hara Huna of Indian sources are to be identified with the
Karmir Xyon of the Avesta.[20] Similarly he identifies the Sveta Huna of Indian sources with the Spet Xyon of the Avesta. While the
Hephthalite are not mentioned in Indian sources, they are sometimes also linked to the Spet Xyon (and therefore possibly to the Sveta
Huna).
More controversially, the names Karmir Xyon and Spet Xyon are often rendered as "Red Huns" and "White Huns", reflecting
speculation that the Xyon were linked to Huns recorded simultaneously in Europe.
