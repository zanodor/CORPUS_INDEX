About Islam – Quora post – Erik Haraldsson
(originally answering What does the Quran say about non-Muslims?)
I know what they say about assumption but I’m going to do it anyway. When most
people ask what, the Quran says about non-Muslims, what they really want to know is what does Islam say about non-Muslims. The Quran is not the only book that Muslims must follow. The teachings that are required of all Muslims are not found only in the Quran and this is very important to realize.
I skimmed through the previous answers and they’re mostly just a load of rubbish, lies, or half-truths at best and at worst... Quora censorship is a bit trigger-happy so we’ll just
stick with saying they’re quite wrong rather than saying what my first instinct directs me to say about them.
You should absolutely read some of them if you find yourself as delighted as I when
presented with such creative fiction. I would advise you then to read what I’m about to follow with.
I will attempt to make this as concise as possible while still providing the basic
information to prove my point. If you don’t already know and you care what is the truth, then I urge you to stick with me. I’ll head this off before it happens because I’ll be accused of copy and pasting. Yes, I am going to copy and paste from my own notes. I’ve been studying Islam for well-over 15 years. I have hundreds of pages of Word documents worth of verses and notes. I’m not typing again what I have already typed and organized.
First of all, the Quran does say quite a bit about non-Muslims and the vast majority of it isn’t good. There are verses in there that if taken by themselves and without the proper
knowledge of Islam they will sound like they mean well. This is a large problem and this is why there’s such a common tendency for people to be lied to and to be mistaken about the truth of what Islam teaches.
The teachings of Islam consist of 3 important pieces which are as follows:
The Quran – a collection of words that per Islam are the direct orders from Allah which were passed through the Angel Gabriel directly to Muhammad & were written down word for word.
The Hadith - is a collection of narrations of the life and deeds of Muhammad.
The Sira - is the recorded biography of Muhammad also known as the Sunnah & is said to be Muhammad's way of life, on which Islamic law (Sharia) is based.
• None of these are optional. These are all required to understand & or follow Islam properly & thus to accurately call yourself a Muslim or to be considered a Muslim by other Muslims.



According to Islam it’s a fact that the rules/orders written in the Quran are the perfect, unchanging, & unalterable words of God himself & apply to all humans for all time.
Now, since you specifically asked about the Quran let me start with some basic and useful information about that Quran.
The Quran contains at least 109 verses that call Muslims to war with nonbelievers for the sake of Islamic rule. Many Muslims want to tell you that Jihad (war) actually means
internal struggle and not violent warfare. This is a lie if they know what they’re talking about. The context is not in the Quran it’s in the Hadith and Sira. Jihad can mean both
war and internal spiritual struggle. Unfortunately, the truth is that when it is referenced in the Hadith and Sira, the word Jihad is used as, and very clear indicates violent warfare and not internal struggle in 97% of instances. Only 3% of the time Jihad is used does it describe an internal conflict.
In the Quran, there are another roughly 3 Dozen Verses that specifically & clearly order Muslims to fight against non-Muslims without going into so much detail as the previous 109 Verses.
• There are at least 500 Verses that speak about non-Muslims regarding their prescribed place in Hell. • At least 400 of these Verses go into detail about the torment Allah has planned for non-Muslims in hell. • Allah does, after-all, create infidels solely for the purpose of providing firewood to fuel his hell-fires.
• These verses alone span across 87 of the Quran’s total 114 chapters.
• When all is said & done, somewhere around 95% of the Quran contains some manner of reference toward Allah’s hatred of non-Muslims.
• At least 61% of the Quran is very specifically about non-Muslims & the manner in which Muslims are expected to treat them (which is not nice). The teachings of Islam are very clear & specific that non-Muslims are not to be treated well.
Now... as I said previously, there are verses like some of the previous posters used that when alone they do sound like they’re nice or at least neutral. This is why they choose these verses if they know what they’re doing. The thing that most people don’t realize is that the verses in the Quran are not arranged in chronological order related to the time Muhammad received them. The alleged first verse Muhammad would have received is not first in the Quran and the last one he received is not last. The verses are arranged
from longest to shortest. The fact that they aren’t in order makes it a lot easier these days for lying to infidel. This isn’t why it was done this way but it worked out for them. Islamic scholars and MYSELF know very well that the verses are also divided into the Meccan period and Medinan period verses and that’s important. Meccan verses were in the
beginning when Muhammad allegedly first started receiving transmissions from Allah. At this time, Muhammad had no followers and even at the end of his Meccan time he only had somewhere around 100. In Medina, which was several years and many verses later,



he collected a much more significant following. This is important because it’s the Meccan verses that are always used to show how nice and tolerant Islam is. These verses are nice and tolerant because Muhammad had no army and few followers and therefore, no power. Muhammad had to be nice at first because he couldn’t force anything on
anybody. In fact, he first presented himself as the final prophet of Judaism, more or less. The Jews basically told him to get lost though, and we can still see to this day the grudge that has caused.
You see, the problem is that most people don’t know this. Later, when Muhammad was in Medina and gaining followers and power the verses became very quickly, far-less tolerant and nice. No compulsion in religion went right out the window and so did treating other “people of the book” with respect and dignity. Medinan verses always abrogate Meccan verses if the message they convey is at odds. If a Meccan verse says to treat Christians and Jews as equals and with respect and a Medinan verse says to slay them wherever you find them... Guess what? Slay them wherever you find them takes precedent.
• Abrogate means repeal or do away with (a law, right, or formal agreement). What I am telling you here is that these other posters telling you Islam says nice things about non-Muslims and orders them to be treated well are either lying to you or they don’t know the religion they’re claiming they know.
According to these teachings of Islam there is a very clear hierarchy with Muslim men at the top and being better than everybody else. Muslim women fall below and are not equal to Muslim men. At the bottom are non-Muslims or infidels who aren’t really to be considered human at all in many cases but are always undeserving of rights & especially not rights equal to those of Muslims.
According to Islam it’s a fact that the rules/orders written in the Quran are the perfect, unchanging, & unalterable words of God himself & apply to all humans for all time.
• These orders include the requirement that the orders of Muhammad must be followed & his actions should be emulated. With all of that having been said it is important to realize that the Quran itself only makes up about 14% of the total teachings of Islam & therefore, knowing & trying to follow the Quran alone does not make somebody a Muslim according to the Islamic teachings themselves.
None of this is optional... not debatable... not circumstantial... this, according to Islam is the will of God & if you don’t follow all the rules & therefore remain on the side of Allah & Muhammad then you are against them & there’s no other option.
The other 86% of the Islamic teachings are found in the Hadith & Sira & therefore they reside in the sayings, actions, & life of Muhammad who was according to Islam (according to Allah) the perfect man.
• Everything Muhammad did was sanctioned & directed by Allah.



Now there’s a lot of nasty stuff in the Quran & there’s even more when you go to the Sira & Hadith & learn the context behind the divine orders (i.e. Verses) in the Quran).
When you read into these & find the reason these verses were given to Muhammad by Allah & how Muhammad carried them out (with the blessing of Allah himself) then you start to understand how truly nasty they actually were.
• Muhammad led more than 65 offensive military campaigns in just the last 10 years of his life. • In one instance alone Muhammad ordered a trench dug for the Tribe of Quarayza Jews who surrendered to his offensive without a fight. All men over the age of 12 (which came to roughly 700 – 900 of them in total) were systematically brought to the side of the trench, forced to kneel there & were beheaded on Muhammad’s order.
• The surviving children of the men became slaves. • The wives (now widows) & daughters of the tribe became sex slaves to the Muslims. • Muhammad raped one of those women the same night he murdered her husband. All non-Muslims are not only to be punished by Allah in the afterlife but they are to be punished, terrorized, & fought against by Muslims in this life & that is also not option rather it is actually considered, & is documented in the teachings to be a test which Muslims must pass in order to be considered a good Muslim & thus enter paradise after death.
The teachings regularly order Muslims to fight all non-Muslims until they all covert or are killed.
They remind Muslims not to have compassion for unbelievers.
They remind Muslims that it isn’t stealing to take from non-Muslims because Allah wills this.
Muslims are supposed to take our land & possessions in any way they can & that includes women.
There is nothing peaceful about the religion that is Islam.
There is absolutely no way one can even gain half-an-understanding of what Islam teaches & mistake it for something that is peaceful overall.
The only peace prescribed in Islam is between & amongst Muslims & we must not forget that any so-called Muslim who does not follow every, last one of the teachings of Islam is considered by these teachings to be a hypocrite & therefore is expected to be killed.
• All of this is written & all very clearly.
For the time being though, we’ll look at some more Quran verses.



The Quran specifically and quite often, makes very clear that Allah very much HATES the “unbelievers” {i.e. non-Muslims, Infidel, Kafir.}
Quran (30:45) – “He (Allah) does not love the unbelievers”
• Only those who fully obey Allah AND “his Prophet” Muhammad will receive any mercy.
Quran (3:32) – Says that any who “turn back” or “reject faith” (in Islam) are hated by Allah.
Quran (22:38) – Says that “Surely Allah does not love anyone who is unfaithful, ungrateful.
Allah intends for Muslims to triumph over unbelievers in every way. The only acceptable position of non-Muslims to Muslims is subjugation under Islamic rule. Per Islamic law, non-Muslims may be owned as property by Muslims. Nobody of any other faith whether Christian, Jew, Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, or even Atheists or Agnostics are to be considered worthy of equality with Muslims. Under the Sharia (Islamic Law), non-Muslims are worth approximately 1/3 the value of a Muslim.
Muslims are referred to as “the best of people,” who are “evolved for mankind” and many other lovely compliments.
More of the Quran is devoted to distinguishing that Muslims are better than nonMuslims in all ways. Allah condemns all non-Muslims to Hell based only on their unbelief. There is nothing which can affect or changes this in any way except conversion to and strict practice of Islam.
{Note: The Arabic word used to describe the ideal treatment of non-Muslims (shin-dal-dal) is the same word used in over 25 places in the Quran to describe how painful Allah has made Hell for them.}
{Note: Islamic law forbids formal Muslim charity (the Zakat) from being used to meet the needs of non-believers.}
There is no shortage of verse in the Quran that refer to non-Muslims using comparisons that would require some serious moral gymnastics in-order to decide they were complimentary. Some examples might help.
Quran (2:10) – “Diseased”
Quran (2:99) – “Perverse”
Quran (2:171) – “Stupid”
Quran (3:73) – “Deceitful”
Quran (9:28) – “Unclean”
Quran (6:111) – “Ignorant“



Quran (23:55) – “Helpers of the Devil“
Quran (98:6) – “The Worst of Creatures.”
Quran (8:55)– “The Vilest of Animals in Allah's sight”
Quran (7:176) – Referencing their worthlessness & idiocy... non-Muslims are compared in this one to “Panting Dogs."
Quran (7:179) – This one compares non-Muslims to “Cattle” except worse than cattle.
Quran (46:29 – 35) – Say that “Unbelievers are Worse than Demons.”
Quran (5:60, 7:166, & 2:65) – Refer to Allah having transformed Jews of the past into apes and pigs.
Some of the Hadith - (Bukhari 54:524, Sahih Muslim 7135 & 7136) – Speak of how Muhammad (“Allah’s Prophet”) believed rats to be "mutated Jews."
The Quran tells Muslims (repeatedly) to be compassionate with one another but ruthless to the infidel.
Quran (48:29) – “Muhammad is the messenger of Allah and those with him are severe against the disbelievers but merciful among themselves.”
Quran (4:141) – “Never will Allah grant to the unbelievers a way to triumph over believers.”
Quran (9:29) – Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.
{Note: Jizya is the money that non-Muslims must pay to their Muslim overlords in a pure Islamic state.}
The Quran says that non-Muslims must never be taken as friends. Muslims are ordered that they should not be friendly with anybody who does not accept Islam, even if it’s a family member.
Quran (58:22) – “Thou wilt not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day,
loving those who resist Allah and His Messenger, even though they were their fathers or their sons, or their brothers, or their kindred.”
Quran (4:144) – “O ye who believe! Take not for friends, unbelievers rather than believers: Do ye wish to offer Allah an open proof against yourselves?”



Quran (5:51) – “O ye who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians for friends. They are friends one to another. He among you who taketh them for friends is (one) of them. Lo! Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk.”
Quran (3:118) – “O ye who believe! Take not into your intimacy those outside your ranks: They will not fail to corrupt you. They only desire your ruin: Rank hatred has already appeared from their mouths: What their hearts conceal is far worse.”
Quran (4:101) – “Unbelievers are open enemies unto you.”
Quran (25:55) – “Listen not to the unbelievers, but strive (Jihad) against them with the utmost strenuousness.”
Quran (86:15) – reference to non-Muslims - “As for them, they are but plotting against you.”
Quran (25:55) – reference to non-Muslims - “The unbeliever is a helper of Evil, against his own Lord! {Allah is your “Lord” whether you accept it or not.}
Quran (60:4) – "hostility and hate will exist between Muslims and infidels forever.”
{Peace & Tolerance (all “just getting along”) are not among the available options. Allah himself says that the only acceptable outcome is that all humans must accepts, convert, admit that “there is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his Messenger” and then legitimately and accurately practice Islam and only Islam.}
Allah does not simply give the order that Muslims must never befriend non-Muslims. A Muslim cannot be friends with unbelievers, this is true. They must not stop at that in accordance with Allah. In addition, they must be openly hostile and must fight the unbelievers.
Quran (9:30) & (4:76) – Allah himself fights against the unbelievers, so why should Muslims not fight in his cause rather than in the cause of evil.
{Note: Any-and-all ‘causes’ supported by non-Muslims are necessarily “Evil.”}
Quran (9:123) – “O ye who believe! Fight those of the disbelievers who are near to you, and let them find harshness in you, and know that Allah is with those who keep their duty.”
Quran (83:34) – “Muslims will spend eternity laughing at unbelievers and mocking their suffering as they are tortured in Hell.”
Quran (8:60) – “Against them make ready your strength to the utmost of your power,
including steeds of war, to strike terror into (the hearts of) the enemies of Allah and your enemies and others besides, whom ye may not know.”



Quran (66:9), (9:73), & (9:123) – “Strive hard (Jihad) against the Unbelievers and the
Hypocrites, and be firm against them. Their abode is Hell. (an evil refuge indeed) "Fight those of the disbelievers who are near to you, and let them find harshness in you."
Quran (13:33-34) – “For them (unbelievers) is harsh penalty in both the life of this world and in the “hereafter.”
Quran (2:191, 9:26) – These verses say that ‘violent death’ is prescribed for all nonMuslims (by Allah himself) as the ‘reward’ for their unbelief.
Quran (3:56) – “Those who reject faith will be punished with terrible agony in this world."
Quran (9:14) – Here, Muslims are told that Allah uses them to violently punish others nonMuslims and says “Fight them and by your hands (Allah) brings them to disgrace.”
Quran (47:4) – "If it had been Allah's will, He-Himself could certainly have punished them (without you). But (He lets you fight), in-order-to test you, by means of others. But those who are killed in the Way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost.”
{Note: it is in the text and teachings that Allah could slay unbelievers himself {obviously}. He does not however, choose to do this. The reason is because orders that Muslims must do it for him to prove their faith and devotion.} ----
----- {Or by failing to strive at and complete this task, prove their lack of true faith, their hypocrisy, and to secure their own place in Hell with the others who fail to (without question) do everything that Allah (and his Messenger) order of them.}
One simply has but to look to the Hadith and Sira to see that these orders were dutifully {one might venture to say ‘Religiously’} carried out by Muhammad who was {after-all} the “Perfect Man” who was the one and only, ‘Chosen by Allah,’ ‘Messenger,’ and ‘Prophet of’ ‘Allah the Exalted,’ and of course... ‘Peace be upon him.’”
Quran (9:33) – Allah orders Muhammad and his followers that they must “make Islam superior over all religions.”
Quran (8:57) – Orders Muslims to “gain mastery over them (non-Muslims) in war and
punish them severely in order to disperse those who are behind them, so that they may learn a lesson "
Quran (13:15) – “And unto Allah falleth prostrate whosoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly.”
{Note: To put this verse simply... All humans will bow to Allah and willingly is preferred but in the event, they should reject this option then any-and-all necessary force is acceptable.”}
Quran (61:4-11) – {this one reminds Muslims that} Allah "loves those who fight in his way" {which is to} make Islam "victorious over all other religions, even though the disbelievers resist" and “those who do resist Islam will be humiliated.”



Quran (58:20) – “Those who resist Allah and His Messenger will be among those most humiliated.
{Note: The context for this verse is the eviction of the Jewish tribes of Medina and the confiscation of their wealth, land, and children by Muhammad.}
Quran (5:52) – says that “those with ‘diseased hearts’ (i.e., Christians, Jews, ... non-Muslims) are to be "seized wherever found and slain with a (fierce) slaughter"
Quran (33:60 - 62) – says that Allah prescribes the same punishment for ‘hypocrites’ that he does for unbelievers.
{Note: ‘Hypocrites,’ according to Allah, are all Muslims who, by association with, friendship, tolerance, etcetera, of unbelievers, or by unwillingness to engage in Jihad against the unbelievers in the ‘Way of Allah.”}
Included in these actions that Muslims must engage in are that Muslims must “encroach upon,” “Pressure,” and “Punish” non-Muslims whenever this is possible.
Quran (13:41) & (21:44) – “See that we gradually reduce the land (in their control) from its outlying borders.”
Quran (68:44) – “We shall punish them gradually from directions they perceive not.”
Quran (33:27) – “He (Allah... of course) made you heirs to their (their = non-Muslims) land and their dwellings and their property, and (to) the land which you have not yet trodden, and Allah has power over all things. {More context can be found in Bukhari 53:392}
Quran (8:65) – “O Prophet! Exhort the believers to fight. If there be of you twenty steadfast they shall overcome two hundred, and if there be of you a hundred (steadfast) they shall overcome a thousand of those who disbelieve, because they (the disbelievers) are a folk without intelligence.” {yes, that’s right... if you aren’t Muslim you are stupid and will be easy for Muslims to defeat.}
{{--{{Look at what is happening in Europe right now... Ponder momentarily... Is this not a prophesy which is beginning to prove accurate?}}--}}
Quran (4:95) – “Not equal are those of the believers who sit at home to those who strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and lives"
{Note: Those who kill or who die in Jihad in the cause of Islam are more preferred by Allah. This is backed up in numerous Hadith... In fact, Muhammad said that fighting Jihad against non-Muslims was 100 times greater than any other possible ‘deed.’}
As I previously stated, the Quran contains only Allah’s orders. The Hadith & Sira contain the context in the form of how the “Prophet Muhammad” carried out these orders. This is the man that Muslims consider to be the perfect role model. There are a lot of nasty
Quranic verses about non-Muslims but you haven’t seen anything until you dive into the



information about what Muhammad did with Allah’s orders. The Quran orders repeatedly that Muslims must not only obey Allah but also the Prophet Muhammad. Only
Muhammad gets to “interpret” anything in the Quran and if a Muslim is unsure they look at Muhammad’s example. Now let’s look at Muhammad’s examples... Here are some
examples of things Muhammad told his followers and things that Muhammad did. I have a couple hundred pages of notes so there’s a lot more where these came from but for now, just a few.
Sahih Muslim (1:417) - Taken to mean that one's own relatives should not be taken as friends if they are not Muslim.
Sahih Muslim (2167) - "Allah's Messenger said: Do not greet the Jews and the Christians before they greet you and when you meet any one of them on the roads force him to go to the narrowest part of it."
Abu Dawud (41:4815) - "The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: A man follows the religion of his friend; so each one should consider whom he makes his friend."
Abu Dawud (41:4832) - The Messenger of Allah [said] "Do not keep company with anyone but a believer and do not let anyone eat your food but one who is pious."
Sahih Bukhari (59:572) - "O you who believe! Take not my enemies And your enemies as friends offering them (Your) love even though they have disbelieved in that Truth (i.e. Allah, Prophet Muhammad and this Quran) which has come to you."
Ishaq 262 - "Some Muslims remained friends with the Jews, so Allah sent down a Quran forbidding them to take Jews as friends. From their mouths hatred has already shown itself and what they conceal is worse"
Ishaq 252 - The story of a young man who converts to Islam after hearing Muhammad. He then tells his own father that he can no longer have anything to do with him because, "I have become a Muslim and follow the religion of Muhammad." (To maintain a relationship with his son, the father "converts" as well). This is an important passage because it establishes that shunning is based merely on the status of non-Muslims as unbelievers, not on their behavior toward Muslims. In this case, the father desperately loved his son and meant him no harm.
Ibn Kathir v.2 p.213 - No believer shall kill any believer for any non-believer. Nor shall he help any non-believer against a believer - People wonder why Muslims are not at the forefront of the fight against Islamic terror.
Sahih Bukhari (59:727) - Allah's Apostle [said]... "Allah's curse be on the Jews and the
Christians" This was spoken on Muhammad's death bed, and was one of the last things that he ever said.
Ishaq 240 - "The Jews are a nation of liars.... The Jews are a treacherous, lying, and evil people"



Sahih Bukhari (52:177) - Allah's Apostle said, "The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. "O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him."
Sahih Bukhari (52:256) - The Prophet... was asked whether it was permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night with the probability of exposing their women and children to danger. The Prophet replied, "They (i.e. women and children) are from them (i.e. pagans)." In this command, Muhammad establishes that it is permissible to kill non-combatants in the process of killing a perceived enemy. This provides justification for the many Islamic terror bombings.
Sahih Bukhari (52:65) - The Prophet said, 'He who fights that Allah's Word (Islam) should be superior, fights in Allah's Cause. Muhammad's words are the basis for offensive Jihad spreading Islam by force. This is how it was understood by his companions, and by the terrorists of today.
Sahih Bukhari (52:220) - Allah's Apostle said... 'I have been made victorious with terror'
Sahih Bukhari (52:44) - A man came to Allah's Apostle and said, "Instruct me as to such a deed as equals Jihad (in reward)." He replied, "I do not find such a deed."
Sahih Muslim (1:33) - the Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to fight against people till they testify that there is no god but Allah, that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah
Sahih Bukhari (8:387) - Allah's Apostle said, "I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah'. And if they say so, pray like our prayers, face our Qibla and slaughter as we slaughter, then their blood and property will be sacred to us and we will not interfere with them except legally."
Sahih Muslim (1:30) – “The Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to fight against people so long as they do not declare that there is no god but Allah."
Sahih Bukhari (52:73) - "Allah's Apostle said, 'Know that Paradise is under the shades of swords'."
Sahih Muslim (19:4321-4323) - Three separate hadith in which Muhammad shrugs over the news that innocent children were killed in a raid by his men against unbelievers. His response: "They are of them (meaning the enemy)."
Sahih Muslim (19:4294) - "Fight against those who disbelieve in Allah. Make a holy war... When you meet your enemies who are polytheists, invite them to three courses of action. If they respond to any one of these, you also accept it and withhold yourself from doing them any harm. Invite them to (accept) Islam; if they respond to you, accept it from them and desist from fighting against them... If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse



to pay the tax, seek Allah's help and fight them."
Sahih Muslim (31:5917) - "Ali went a bit and then halted and did not look about and then said in a loud voice: 'Allah's Messenger, on what issue should I fight with the people?' Thereupon he (the Prophet) said: 'Fight with them until they bear testimony to the fact that there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is his Messenger'." The pretext for attacking the peaceful farming community of Khaibar was not obvious to the Muslims. Muhammad's son-in-law Ali asked the prophet of Islam to clarify the reason for their mission to kill, loot and enslave. Muhammad's reply was straightforward. The people should be fought because they are not Muslim.
Sahih Muslim (31:5918) - "I will fight them until they are like us." Ali's reply to Muhammad, after receiving clarification that the pretext for attacking Khaibar was to convert the people (see above verse).
Tabari 7:97 - The morning after the murder of Ashraf, the Prophet declared, "Kill any Jew who falls under your power." Ashraf was a poet, killed by Muhammad's men because he insulted Islam. Here, Muhammad widens the scope of his orders to kill. An innocent Jewish businessman was then slain by his Muslim partner, merely for being non-Muslim.
Tabari 9:69 - "Killing Unbelievers is a small matter to us"
• The words of Muhammad, prophet of Islam. Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 992 - "Fight everyone in the way of Allah and kill those who disbelieve in Allah."
• Muhammad's instructions to his men prior to a military raid. I could go on and on with this for a long, long, very-long time. Islam teaches that nonMuslims are to be treated with contempt, fought, murdered, stolen-from, and anything else the Muslim chooses to do. Non-Muslims are to be wiped off the planet through violence or conversion and that is not optional in the teachings of Islam. This sort of thing makes up so much of the Quran, Hadith, and Sira, there is no possible way that
Islam will ever change. There’s no peaceful coexistence. There has never been any change in the goals of Islam over 1400 years and there won’t be in the future either. Don’t believe the lies.
