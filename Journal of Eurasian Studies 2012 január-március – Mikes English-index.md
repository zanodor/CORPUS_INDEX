DEAR READER,
ZHUANGZHI’S BUTTERFLY AND THE ULTIMATE URSPRACHE
Certain books need to be written, regardless of popular acceptability. Such a book is ‘Youth without Youth’ by Mircea Eliade. Written in 1976, it was first published in Munich in 1978‐79 in a journal for Romanian émigré writers as ‘Tinerețe fără de tinerețe’. This intriguing and multi‐layered novella from the renowned philosopher and historian of religion deals with time, interior consciousness, memory, love, second chance, history, and quest for the ultimate Ursprache, just to name a few. Topics that we are dealing with in our journal, from the very beginning.
Even more important is to make certain movies that need to be made, regardless of box‐office success. Thanks God, there are people who are capable and willing to do just that. Such a person is Francis Ford Coppola, who created a movie based on the novella, acting as producer, director, and screenplay writer. By financing the film completely out of his own pocket he could avoid any commercial pressure that would have jeopardized the quality of the movie; the novella Youth without Youth does not allow cheap adaptation. The motion picture bearing the same title as the novella was released in 2007 and is a real jewel. The screenplay, which stays very close to the novella, is brought to life by an excellent cast, highlighted by brilliant photography and exotic music, composed by Osvaldo Golijov. On top of this, the connoisseur is also overwhelmed with a plethora of languages: English, Romanian, German, Russian, Chinese, Armenian, Latin, French, Italian, Sanskrit, Latin, Egyptian, and Babylonian, just to name a few.
It is a privilege that we may enjoy such great artistic creations that next to their aesthetic value highly enlarge our intellectual and spiritual horizons.

Ancient Arts in Japan
Example issue from the Coloring Booklet Series of Eurasian Arts1
Japan is the easternmost great cultural community in Eurasia. The people of Japan speak agglutinatetype languages. In this sense they are far‐away relatives for Hungarians. An overview of the history of Japan reveals interesting counterparts in Hungarian history. The society developed a type of feudalism in Japan, from its own power sources. The feudal‐like state of Japan shows strong similarities to the European feudal states. After the Tokugawa‐era the modern Japan had been organized by the Meijireform of 1868. This date is very near to the reconciliation between Hungary and Austria (1867).
Fig. 1. The Ancient Arts in Japan booklet’s front cover displays famous sculptures from Japan with military leaders as follows: upper row left and right — two Ouchi princeps from Yamaguchi; lower row: left ‐ Kusunoki Masashige (Tokyo), middle – Yosgimone Tokugawa (Tokyo), right — Ohta Doukan (Tokyo).
Japan has been formed by influences coming from the eastern regions of Asia; therefore the history of Japan can be traced back to interplay between Korea, China and Japan. Because of the extended EasternAsian influences that swept over the Eurasian steppes there are several common points between Hungarian and Japanese history. One such point is the Mongolian invasion during the first third of the

13th century. Hungarians call it “Tatárjárás” (Tartar Invasion) which resulted in significant destruction in Hungary. The invasion army of the Mongolians met with a great storm which dispersed the fleet and only smaller fights took place at the western shoreline of Japan by the remnants of the army.

Let us consider Japanese history and civilization in parallel with Hungarian history. There are beautiful bronze bells comparable to Hun‐Scythian bells, although they are larger and on display in the National History Museum of Tokyo. Large ceramic soldiers, horses and other interesting figures of life are known as haniva sculptures, first found in emperor tombs, later in other funeral graves.

Looking at them we are reminded of the famous terracotta army figures of Chinese Emperor Cs’in ShiHuang Ti, who had let them prepared for his funeral tomb near Xian, (ancient Changan), Northwest Chine. The people who arrive to the International Airport Narita, can meet human sized haniva soldiers standing at the entrance. These funeral sculptures were arranged on the large funeral hills of the early Japanese Emperors, around the key‐formed mounds recently seen near Osaka. These tombs date back to the 5‐7th centuries AD, the Hun and Avar age in the Carpathian Basin, which is called the Kofun period in Japan’s history.
Fig. 4. Ancient Izumo Shrine with a cavalier on horseback in the exhibition in the Izumo Shrine Museum, near Matsue. The old building once had been the tallest architecture in medieval Japan, in the 6th century. Later lower and lower buildings were reconstructed, and in 2000 the roots of the ancient building were excavated. The reconstruction of the Old Izumo Shrine can be seen in left center, the modern shrine to the right of it. The Izumo Princeps on horseback is also on display in the Izumo Museum exhibition.
The Kofun period is the era of the organization of the centralized state in Japan. In the central region of Japan, east of the Kyoto‐Osaka line, first the Yamato Court had been organized, then the emperor’s seat and capital was placed in the Asuka‐Valley, then in Nara, and then finally in Kyoto. Kyoto had been the seat of the Japanese Emperor for more than 1000 years, and it remained a symbolic capital even after the Tokugawa shoguns moved the organizing center to Edo (the recent Tokyo) between 1600 and 1868.
It is interesting in the cultural stratification of Japan that the appearance of bronze and iron is almost synchronous in the archaeological findings. Both metals arrived through China and Korea. The head armor of the war horses is also a characteristic feature of the high level of metallurgy from the 6th century AD. Hungarians appreciate specially the beautiful sword blades in the National History Museum of Tokyo. Such blades survived since the 9‐10th century and a samurai sword from the Fujivara period (the age of the Árpád House of Hungary) is not considered as rarity. Our Attila‐sword could survive only in Vienna, because of the bloody centuries of Turkish wars in the 16‐17th centuries in Hungary. The island position of Japan was benefitial for the survival of these treasuries over so long a historical period.

Since the 9th century the Fujivara family gave the empress to the Japanese royal house. This period lasted till the times of Béla III in Hungary. At the end of the 12th century two generals had fought heavily for the emperor’s seat in Japan: the Heike and the Genji genera. After three decades of ruling the Heike genera had lost the final battle at Danno Ura in 1185. The Genjis founded the Kamakura Shogunate.
Fig. 5. The Himeji castle from the period of the three military leaders:
Oda Nobunaga, Hideyosi Toyotomi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu.
At the beginning of Hungarians’ wars with the Turks, after the death of King Matthias, in Japan a long period of uncertainty ruled and the endless fights among local warlords weakened the country. In the second half of the 16th century three important shoguns, (the palatinus may be considered a similar position in Hungary) Oda Nobunaga, Hideyosi Toyotomi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu reorganized and strengthened the central government and founded a strong state again. The period of these three military leaders is the famous period of the construction of the Japanese castles. In our booklet the Himeji castle can be seen from this period. The reorganization of Japan can be easily understood by Hungarian readers because it is synchronous in time with the Bocskai Independence War in Hungary (1604‐1606), which

strengthened the Transylvanian Principality of Hungary. In Japan, the famous battle at Sekigahara took place in 1600. There it had been decided for a long period who organized and controlled the state in Japan. The battle was won by Tokugawa Ieyasu, and after him the Tokugawa family gave the shogun for almost 300 years. Tokugawa shoguns moved the administrative center to the eastern capital of Edo (Tokyo), although the emperor’s seat remained in Kyoto. Later, the Meiji reform moved the emperor’s seat to Tokyo, too. Edo fitted better than the ancient Kyoto as the geometric center of Japan.

Our coloring booklet flashes several artistic products with impressions and experiences from the Japanese art. The figures try to follow the historical sequence. We close our series of artistic forms with the funny and beautiful, and also illuminating animal drawings of the drawing‐roll: Choju‐Giga. Four rolls survived, although – unfortunately – without text. But we can imagine that the twist of the age had been expressed by the acting animals: frogs, rabbits, monkeys and boars probably show human characters in stories, which were placed in ironic situations.
Fig. 8. Four rolled books of drawing art are named Choju‐Giga, which display stories about the human twist of the 12th century. The stories have symbolic actors: frogs, rabbits, monkeys and boars probably showing human characters.

Visiting Japan the people we meet are unknown relatives of Hungarians. They are relatives both for their eyes, their ears, and for their souls, too. It is a magic world to which this booklet could contribute by directing the readers’ attention. If this is the first guide to the visitor, he/she can be an active fellow author by coloring the drawings. In life we are fellow travellers, from cradle till tomb. If we meet unknown relatives, Hungarians the Japanese, even if only in artistic products, our heart opens and we forget the troubles of the everyday world. We invite to such a travel any art‐enthusiast reader and we thank the old masters who made possible the crafting of our tours.
Fig. 10. The extended Eurasian animal fight representation can be found also in Japanese art. In this sequence the Avarian belt‐buckle from the Carpathian Basin, the bottle carving from the Ancient Crete, is followed by the saber handle goldsmith work on the Izumo Cavalier (Izumo Museum, Fig. 4.) and finally the Xiongnu‐Hun belt buckle. In the first two images the deer is attacked by two predators. The two last images show the fight of the dragon, the characteristic animal fight of Eastern Asia.

Eastern References to the White Croats
Abstract
The White Croats are a medieval people of Slavic stock (in sight), from the north of the Carpathians, who had a kingdom of their own in early medieval. They did not have much influence in regional issues, thus there is no much mention about them in medieval sources. Their relationship with the Balkan Croats and contribution to formation of the latter are the issues increasing historical importance of this people. However, their ethnic affiliation or ethnic origins of their nation‐makers seems to be non‐Slavic, as intimated by contemporary sources. The century‐long debates for the Balkan Croats’ Eastern origins are equally crucial for their northern relatives, too. This essay contains some new proposals for some mysterious people (Mrvât, Belye Ugry, etc.) attesting in medieval Islamic and Rus’ books, for whom scholarship still looks for certain identities. They are related to the White Ogur realm, an early medieval tribal union of Turkic stock in western Eurasian steppes, from which the (proto) Croats derived. They were assimilated among the surrounding Slavic multitude, by changing their Oguro‐Turkic language to Slavic, but by keeping their national name, as in the Danubian Bulgar case.
Keywords: White Croats, Croats, Ogurs, Mrvât, Bulgars, Western Turks, Magyars, Rus’, Moravians, Byzantium.
Povest’ and DAI Passing to Each Other
The Russian Primary Chronicle, known as Povest’, completed at the beginning of the XII century by blending the data from contemporary Byzantine histories and local poorly remembered traditions (for the first two centuries of its content, the IX and X), tells that Slavs for a long time lived north of the Carpathians and then started to spread all around, by the way changing their names in accordance with the places they went to. Examples are the Moravians and the Czech. Povest’ counts also the White Croats, Serbians and Xorutans (Carantanians, ancestors of the Slovene) (Povest’: 207).1 Together with the below mentioned Lech (Polonian) people, these can be accepted then (ca 850 AD) formed Slavic nations. The denomination “White Croat” is of great interest at this point. The Chronicle goes on by mentioning the “only” Croats among the Poland‐related Slavic tribes (Poljani, Drevljani, Radimiči and Vjatiči), all of
1 Here is clearly a Balkan context, but the author better knows about Galician White Croats, thus refer to them, and not the Balkanic ones, who never became ‘White’, but partly ‘Red’. On the origins and migrations of these Croats, see Mayorov 2006.

which used to live in peace with each other (Povest’: 210), likely in the area between Kiev and Krakow. In 992 these Croats were attacked by Vladimir of Kiev, who was attacked in return home near Perejaslavl’ by the Pečenegs (Povest’: 283), who used to constantly plunder the White Croats, according to Constantine Porphyrogenitus (DAI: 153).
Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (mid X century) also mentions the White Croats in a Slavic context: “But the Croats at that time were dwelling beyond Bavaria, where the Belocroats are now... The rest of the Croats stayed over against Francia, and are now called Belocroats, that is, White Croats, and have their own prince...” (DAI: 143) “The Croats who now live in the region of Dalmatia are descended from the unbaptized Croats, also called ‘white’, who live beyond Turkey (Hungary) and next to Francia...” (DAI: 147). The usage of the Slavic belo “white”, at first glance, consolidates the so‐called Slavic identity claimed for this people, and backs the Russian chronicle.
The Byzantine emperor Constantine goes on telling the story of these same Croats who “arrived to claim the protection of the emperor of the Romans Heraclius before the Serbs claimed the protection of the same emperor Heraclius... And so, by command of the emperor Heraclius these same Croats defeated and expelled the Avars from those parts, and by mandate of Heraclius the emperor they settled down in that same country of the Avars, where they now dwell.” (DAI: 147, 149) These are the days when Byzantium fought in two fronts with the Avars and Persians. We have greater details of this quarrel, especially in the Persian front with Xosroe II and his famous commander Šahrbaraz in Byzantine sources, especially Nikephoros and Theophanes. The Russian Primary Chronicle also seems to relate these happenings. After the Bulgars, who persecuted the Slavs, there came the White Ugors (Belye Ugry), and inherited domination over the Slavic lands. These White Ogurs went to Heraclius, who was at war with the Persian shah Xosroe (Xozdroe) in those days, like the Avars (Obry), who used to disturb both Heraclius and the Slavs (Povest’: 210).2 This is exactly what the Croats in DAI did.
In Povest’, the term Ugor is reserved for the Hungarians, hereinafter Magyars, but their coming to the Central Europe in the VII century is out of question. The only newcomers in those days were the Oguric and Bulgaric tribes of Turkic stock, especially in the VI and VII centuries, besides the Avars. The White Croats of DAI and White Ugors of Povest’, having the same ‘colour’, do the same things at the same time in the same environment, thus the both sources should be speaking of one and same people. In the IX century, the conquering Magyars and relatively native White Croats were in extremely good relations: They “intermarry and are friendly with” each other (DAI: 143).3 (cf. account of Hudud below) Although Constantine tells at the end of the Part 31 that the former constantly plundered the latter (DAI: 153), this stress of love should be regarded seriously. Thus, our both sources seem to say about some common roots of the Magyars and Croats, beyond their Pannonnian neighbourhood. Povest’ frankly claims this by calling the Croats as “White Ugors” and the Magyars as “Black Ugors”: “After these Avars, Pečenegs, and then Black Ugors came and passed before Kiev in the days of Oleg.” (Povest’: 210). In another entry with exact time (the year 898) it repeats the story of the Magyar march to the Carpathians in more detail, now naming only Ugors without colour (Povest’: 217).
2 Chronological setting here makes it impossible to estimate an Khazar = White Ogur equality, for instance, offered by Macartney (1930: 175), since the Western steppes were under Bulgar domination for a long time after even Herakleios or Xosroe, and Khazarian westward expansion towards the Slavic lands was out of question before the end of the VII century.
3 Croats of the Drava‐Sava mesopotamia cannot be ruled out in this term.

Ugor/Ogurs, Magyars and the Rest
Magyars are called Ugors for their Oguric connection (Róna‐Tas 1996: 284).4 Their cooperation and coexistence with the Onogurs, a branch of the broader Ogur confederation of Turkic tribes, who migrated to Eastern Europe in 463, brought about calling the Magyars as Onogurs (from which was born today’s widespread designation Hungar/Venger and resembling forms). So, can we match the Black Ogurs with the Onogurs? This should be done; even there had not been testimony of the Russian Primary Chronicle. Priscus, who gives first accounts of the coming of the Ogurs in 463, accounts these tribes: Σαράγουροι, Οΰρωγοι, Ονόγουροι (Priskos: 158). The second one seems to contain a metathesis and is to be corrected as Ogur. The other two contains this element and easy to read in Turkic respectively: White Ogurs and Ten Ogurs (Golden 1992: 93). Both of them prove to save the most elementary ways of ethnical denomination particular to Turkic world: (Con)federations are divided into two as ‘white’ and ‘black’, or ‘inner’ and ‘outer’; in the second stage, they or their greater parts are called according to number of the member tribes: Three Qarluks, Nine Oguz, Thirty Tatars, etc.
If there is the ‘White’, then there should be the ‘Black’, too. This reflects a tradition and method in organizing people and tribal unions among the Turks and other Eurasian people taking state traditions from the Turks. Not geography, but people are essential in administrative organization, since the Eurasian geography is usually monotonous and hardly has physical boundaries within it. There are no ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ lands, even directions are not usable because of the very mobility of tribes. Thus, there are ‘black’ and ‘white’ (in necessity, also ‘red’) branches of the same kind of people, as well as ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ ones. In almost all cases, the former ones, ‘white’ and ‘inner’, refer to the superior/ruling group, whose population was naturally lesser than the common folk = black nation (Turk. kara budun, Mong. xara ulus). In the cases when political superiority was out of question, white was to be the lesser and smaller group. Almost all steppe polities and people of Turkic origin used this appellation: Huns, Bulgars, Khazars, Türgiš, Uigurs, Kumans, Tatars, etc. (Kafesoğlu 2001: 242‐245, 271272).5 Thus, the Ogurs living in the form of pure tribal unions also would have this appellation.
4 No need, however, to think (in Slavic terms) Onoguri > Ongri > Ungri, and with disappearance of the nasal element > Ugri, as offered lastly, among others, by Róna‐Tas (1996: 286). Slavs directly took the simple form Ogur/Ugor. The Onogur form is preserved in Wenger, Hungar, Ungar, etc.
5 Kafesoğlu also adds the usages ‘left’ and ‘right’, but these are political and military appelations; people were hardly called so. In his research on the origin of the name “White Russia”, Nicholas P. Vakar fails in producing an all‐Eurasian connection, although he was aware of “some of” these kinds of appelations. His problem seems to be with chronology, which does not permit for pre‐XIV century usage of the form Belorus. He should, at least, have better analized the White Croat case, which frankly shows the very consolidation of this tradition of organizing/dividing people from early medieval days on in Eastern Europe. If the Rus’ had qagan as their rulers from the IX century on, then they would be expected to have black and white, too. Vakar tends to look for the case within the semantic relation of liberty and white, which is not uncommon in Central Asia. For instance, the Bulak tribe was called Alka Bulak (“White Bulak”) after it gained independence (Kaşgarlı Mahmut: 379). See also Traian (1994: 147‐149) for a good evaluation of the ‘colorful’ appelations, including in his search Romanians and Albanians, with doubtful results. He, however, in my opinion, fails by reconstructing new White Croatia and Serbia. Peoples took these names after they split off, and not from the very beginning. Besides, the tripartition obserwed in the region has nothing to do with the natives.

In Priscus, Ogur is common name of the other two: Saragurs and Onogurs. Thus, the Onogurs are obligatorily the Black Ogurs, having ten member tribes within their federation. And these Black and White Ogurs are the same people as the Beli and Černi Ugry of the Russian chronicle. The White Ogurs, who attacked on the Acatziri on the mid‐Don region, and then interfered in Caucasian affairs in the south (Priscus: 161), disappear from sources together with the coming of the Avars.6 Sources do not tell about their encounter with the Avars, although we now well about the latter’s relations with the Alans, Onogurs and Kutrigurs, tribes living in the same region, on the migratory route of the Avars. It seems, the White Ogurs withdrew before the outrageous Avars to the north of the Carpathians, and became core of the future Croats. These northern (white) Croats preserved some Turkic features, at least during the first century, in their new home. This contains personal names of the Croatian elite,7 as well as the ethnonym Croat itself.8 Thus, the White Ogurs of the Oguric confederacy (not necessarily to be associated with the Bulgaric Turks) were the founder fathers of the Croatian state/nation.9
The author of the Povest’, bishop Nestor, was unable to connect his current knowledge and old local traditions, plus narrations of Byzantine sources: The first one tells of a purely Slavic people just west to Kiev, and the second one narrates about a nation then non‐existing. The second case is, however, full of problems. Nestor, who was much confused even with the chronology of the pre‐Svjatoslav era, could hardly know about events of the Heraclius age. In our case, he does not use the Byzantine terminology, which never uses the terms White and Black Ogur, as far as we know, except the carelessly taken Saraguri of Priscus. Besides, Byzantine sources do not seem to be aware of the ethnical structure of the Ogur community. Thus, this knowledge can not be of Byzantine sources, as well as Slavic, since Kievan traditions were not sure of even Oleg and Igor’s time, as stated. Povest’ is, on the other hand, the only source deciphering the Oguric ethnic organization. There should be some ‘insider’ sources providing Nestor with the necessary data and horizons for those old days, and this or these sources can be Bulgaric with a great possibility. Volga Bulgar is justly candidate for this, as there was a flourishing literature there, and Bolgar, their capital, was a more illuminated cultural centre than Kiev. Close interaction between the two are well known and no need to describe its details, especially in the XII century.
Róna‐Tas is quite right by giving chance to the possibility that he established in explaining the name Yugra occurring in medieval sources for a people between the Volga Bulgar and Urals: Bulgars used to
6 They are counted only in the list of Zacharias Rhetor (c.555), who in turn received the name likely from Priscus (Czeglédy 1971: 133‐148).
7 “From them (White Croats) split off a family of five brothers, Kloukas and Lobelos and Kosentzis and Mouchlo and Chrobatos, and two sisters, Touga and Bouga, who came with their folk to Dalmatia and found the Avars in possession of that land.” (DAI: 143). Mikkola (1927: 158‐160), solved these names, which have no any meaning in any language except Turkic, respectively as Külük, Alpel, Kösenci, Mügel, Korvat, Tugay and Buga. See also Rásony (1988: 84); Karatay (2003: 92‐94).
8 “Croats in the Slav tongue means ‘those who occupy much territory’.” (DAI: 147). Slavic languages do not have such a word, dead or alive. There is a Turkic word occurring, for instance, in the Orxon inscriptions of the beginning of the VIII century, contemporary to those “founding Croats”: “İlgerü, qurıġaru sülep tirmiş qubratmış” [By sending forces to east, west, he gathered (people around him)]. Kül Tigin Insc. East 12 (Ergin, 1980: 69). I’m not, however, for the idea that the homonym and ethnonym Khorvat (> Croat) comes from this Turkish word/verb; instead, kür + bat “mighty prince” seems more possible, regarding the popularity of ‐bat ending names among the Ogurs and Bulgars, and that the consonant r is always before b/v in early versions of the name.
9 For this theory see Karatay (2002: 555‐558); (2003: 65‐96).

call the east (Bashkirian) and west (proper) Magyars as Ogri (Róna‐Tas 1996: 435). Early medieval Islamic sources might have learned this name, even existence of this people, from the Bulgar Muslims of mid‐Volga. The Rus’ also did so, as they did not pass beyond the Bulgar khanate in those days, but took accounts about the east and easterners in Bolgar from the Bulgars.
Volga Bulgars were by no means Ogurs or Ono
gurs, and they were never called so.
10
However, they knew well who the Ogurs were. When the Arabic sources recorded the Yura country, the western Magyars were about to leave their land on the Don (likely Dentümoger). Thus, when they lived there, just west of the Volga Bulgar, habitants of the latter country called them Ogurs by referring to the Onogur component in the Magyar union. This name was later applied to the eastern co‐nationals of Magyars, too. The very renowned Hungaro‐Bashkirian relation makes this case fate of these people. Magyars are called (western, European) Bashkirs in many medieval sources, and, in turn, Bashkirs are called (eastern) Magyars by another group of sources. This is very normal and very illuminating; Volga Bulgars also did the same, however by calling the both groups only Ogur. But in their case, there was no any oriental essential Ogurs; this is just a Bulgaric invention. Thus we should not search for them in Siberia, as Róna‐Tas offers. The Kimek or Irtish Yigur tribe might be an offspring or diaspora of the wider Uyguric domain, but they are not necessarily related with the West Uralic Ugra people, whose name was likely only an attribution.
Masudî and Idrisî
Masudî in his Murûj al‐Dhahab, written in mid‐X century, tells about Slavic countries and their rulers in an excerpt likely taken from Jarmî, who wrote exactly one century ago than him. This provides us with the opportunity of learning about the mid‐IX century. The date is secured with his reference to Dir as the first Slavic king (Mesudi: 189). He is mentioned, together with his brother Askold, as the first conqueror of Kiev in the name of the Rus’ in the mid‐IX century (Povest’: 215). For Central Europe he defines respectively these people: Namcins with their king Garand, Menabins with their king Ratimir, Serbins, the Murave people, and the Harvatins (then the Sasin) (Mesudi: 189). The first is the Karantanians (Slovene ancestors) then under Frank (Nemac) rule. Namcin refers to the Franks and Garand to themselves. The third one is clearly warlike Serbs, as defined by the author. Between them we should look for the Balkan Croats. It is easy to see هرابت , a false pronunciation of Hrobat, in the Arabic form منابت . Not a later copier, but the author himself or an earlier copier of the source‐book, who was confused with two Croatias, was responsible for this mistake. It is possible also that this mistake was produced from a different spelling then accepted thoroughly: Xrobat for the Dalmatian ones and Xorbat for the TransCarpathian ones. Ratimir was the formers’ knez between 829‐838. After that we find the Moravians, and then the (White) Croats. Their neighbourhood to Saxony consolidates this probability. Unfortunately, there is no more detail about them.
10
In contrast, the Dabunian Bulgars were called W.n.n.d.r (Onogundur) in the widespread Jayhânî tradition of Islamic geography (Zimony 1992: 41, 155).

Idrîsî mentions Galicia, but do not tell anything about the White Croats living there. He does not name also a country in such a name. It is perhaps for they lost their importance as a people in those days (mid‐XII century), estimated that their state disappeared on the turn the new millennium. غرمسيه , counted among the Bohemian cities (Idrîsî: 375), can be rightly turned to غرعسيه , reflecting a latinized or Dalmatian form, close to what it is today, and similar to what is reserved for the Balkan Croatia: جراسيه (Idrîsî: 266). قاروقيا of the Outer Bashkirs (Idrîsî: 406, 408) would also be related to the Khorvats.
The Mrvât of Hudûd al
c
Âlam
Anonymous Hudûd al
c
Âlam, written in 982‐3 in Afghanistan, regularly records a certain Mrvât people in Eastern Europe.
11
That he mentions this people four times in various (and every) occasion, and counts among the 51 inhabited lands of the world (Hudud 1937: 83; 1962: 59), displays the very emphasis by the author on this people. After several tests on other possibilities, Minorsky tended to identify them with the Moravians (Hudud 1937: 441). Accounts go such: “(Black Sea’s) eastern limit is formed by the confines of the Alâns; its northern limit is formed by the places (occupied by) the Pečenegs, the Xazars, the Mirvâts ( مروات ), the Inner Bulgars, and the Saqlâbs, its western limit is the country of the Burjâns; on its southern limit lies the country of Rûm.” (Hudud 1937: 53; 1962: 14).
Part 46 in the discussion of the inhabited lands is reserved for them: “East of it (Mrvât land) are some mountains, and some of the Khazarian Pečenegs; south of it, some of the Khazarian Pečenegs and the Gurz Sea; west of it, some parts of the latter, and the inner Bulgârs; north of it, some of the latter and the W.n.n.d.r mountains. They are Christians and speak two languages: Arabic and Rûmî (Byzantine Greek?). They dress like the Arabs. They are on friendly terms with the Turks and the Rûm. They own tents and felt‐huts.” (Hudud 1937: 160; 1962: 190).
One may rightly search for some local people along the Don‐Volga basin for the Mrvât. However the author does not mention the Burtas, about whom he knows well and allocated a part in the book, and who lived between the Khazars and Volga Bulgars, among those living north of the Black Sea. There were no in those days any significant local people apart from the Burtâs, as far as we know. Neither is helpful order of these nations in the text. The Pečenegs here are the Khazarian Pečenegs in the author’s terms, so they are west of the Khazars. This means the Magyars were far off the region.
12
After the Pečenegs, westward were the Kievan Rus’ (represented here by the Saqlâb), White Croatia, Hungary, and Bulgaria. The latter is called Burjân, a denomination transferred from the Caucasus. Magyars are called with their own names and the new Magyar lands are well known by the author (for ex. “another river is the Rûtâ, which rises from a mountain situated on the frontier between the Pečenegs, the Majgharî, and the Rûs”) (Hudud 1937: 76; 1962: 14). Thus, White Croatia remains as the unique alternative. Hudud defines
11
According to Minorsky (Hudud 1937: 424, the unnamed author’s source was Hârûn b. Yahyâ.
12
There had passed about one century from the Magyar migration from the Don basin to the mid‐Danube, when Hudud was written, but we have to be sure of the information being updated by medieval authors, since they might tell about very past times.

locations of those people according to each other in the parts 45, 46, and 47, dedicated respectively to the Inner Bulgars, Mrvâts and Pečenegs (Hudud 1937: 160; 1962: 189‐190).
The Mrvât people occur also in Gardizî, who says: “The Magyars can see the N.n.d.r, as they live by a river. There is a huge mountain below the N.n.d.r, by the river. There emerges a river from this mountain. A Christian people live on the skirts of this mountain. They are called Mrvât. There is a distance of one day between them and the N.n.d.r. This is a crowded people. Their clothes are turban, shirt and cloak like Arabs...most of their trade is with Arabs.” (Şeşen 1998: 84). Note dressing like Arabs, common in the both sources.
Thus, we can draw such a scheme (only the Magyars are added according to Gardizî):
Rus Mountain Magyar
Inner Bulgar Vnndr Mountains
Saqlabs Inner Bulgar
Mrvât Pečenegs Khazar
Burjân Black Sea Pečenegs Mountain
Alans
Here is only problem with the Inner Bulgar, and the problem is solved if we delete them from the map. It is the Danubian Bulgar. Author of Hudud could not unify the ethnonyms Bulgar and Burjân, and located the former to the north of Danube and the latter to its south.13 However there are chronological problems. Moldovan parts of Bulgaria were lost to Magyars and then Pečenegs some 90 years ago. The author does not know this fact. On the other hand, he is aware of a very actual case: Quarrel between the Danubian Bulgars and the Rus’. Compared to actuality of his geographical knowledge, this is very difficult, since the Bulgaro‐Rus war means only Svjatoslav’s Balkan raid in 968. If the author knew this, then he would know the disappearance of Bulgar or Burjâr from history between the Rus’ and Byzantine just three years later. Thus, he has chronologically baseless, but historically important knowledge. There is another possibility: These Bulgars may be those leaving the Malaja Pereščepina findings in the northeast of Ukraine. Róna‐Tas’ claim that gravity and center of the Great Bulgaria was in the region around where is today Kharkov is not very satisfactory (Róna‐Tas 2000), but once a significant Bulgar presence is almost certain in that region. Especially the ‘upper’ Inner Bulgar in the above scheme well suits to that place. Author of Hudud might have used an old reference to them. In this case, confusion in inner regions of Eastern Europe is very expectable.
Otherwise, we know the very Pečeneg ‐ White Croat quarrel, as refereed by Constantine Porphyrogenitus (see above), which means also close neighborhood. What is interesting is that, as before‐mentioned, our author repeats the story of Constantine about the love affair between Turks/Magyars and White Croats: “They are on friendly terms with the Turks and Rûm” (Hudud 1937: 160; 1962: 190). We should better understand Magyars from his Turks, too, as he classify the former among

Turkic peoples. Their friendship with the Byzantines is a process began from the Constantine Cyril mission on. Last for Hudud, مروات is easy to turn to هروات (Hrvat) by changing only a letter resembling to the other.
Ibn Rusta, Gardizî, Vernadsky and others
Vernadsky sees “quite likely” that the Svjatopluk dynasty of Moravia was of White Croatian (that is, Alanic in his view) origin (Vernadsky 1945: 258). Above accounts and explanations clearly show who the White Croats were. Vernadsky relies on Hauptman (1935: 325‐353), champion of the Iranist ecole of the Croats, but the latter’s theory is by no means convincing, as he tries to solve the question by settling the proto‐Croat case on a Sarmato‐Iranic environment that he imaginarily reconstructed, and by not using reliable historical proofs. Zdenko Vinski, another source of Vernadsky, reconstructs ethnical processes in the milieu what he calls ‘Outer Iran’, where was an intensive cultural interaction from Galicia to the Altai, in accordance with his acceptances, and not any proof (Vinski 1940).
14
Iranic origins are not much visible for Croats or any other Central European people.
15
Vernadsky, in evaluating accounts of Ibn Rusta and Gardizi about the White Croats, uses even the word kumys “mare’s milk” to claim that Moravian rulers were of nomadic, that is Alanic origin. Nomadism of the Alans is subject to debate, it seems they were migratory, and not nomadic.
16
Alans and nomadism should not necessarily associate with each other, and, the most important, the Alans are not known with their kumys drinking costume. After two years Vernadsky published a note on this cited essay: “Note on Zhupan” (vernadsky 1947: 62). In that note he corrects the reading subanj (from Xwolson on, to be explained as South Slavic župan, a
14
Vinski says, for instance, that the Croats were indeed Alans, and the Kasegs were croaticized Circassians; the both groups fled to Visla before the Huns (1940: 21). But, according to which source(s), apart from the so‐called “Iranic environment”? What we need in general is an elaborative study on to much degree and to what speed identities changed or exchanged in Eurasia. This is not Gaul; this is Eurasia, which is very strange to the concept ‘native’. Almost everybody is newcomer or returnee in this region. The stereotypical ethnic mechanism in Eurasia is that a tribal or political group X becomes dominant in a tribal union Y and spreads its name to all over the member tribes as a superior identity. The factual process is usually so, and it does not matter what we call the case: A dramatic population growth among the X tribesmen, invasion of the region and people (of the union) by the tribe X, change of self‐denomination towards X among the union members, change of identity, change of language, etc. (For a brief and abbreviated definition of these ethnical processes, see Golden (1992: 1‐14, 379‐382). In these circumstances, not people but little groups, cores or bands used to change their identities in exact sense. This is what we lack in our studies on Eurasian ethnic history.
15
See a critique of the current theories on Croatian origins in Karatay (2003: 9‐18).
16
This is not suitable place to discuss whether the Alans were nomadic or migratory. I’ll refer only to a pair of sources: Am. Marcellinus and Jordanes. The former depicts the steppe, though his very ‘military intelligence’, in a Herodotian way, including the Alans (who were formerly known as Massagetae), among those living in carts (Alemany 2000: 33, 36). An account of Lucianus informing that the Scythians and Alans had common traits, except some differences like hair length, can also be added to this argument carts (Alemany 2000: 94). Only these two, among about 200 authors mentioning the Alans, define their sight as nomadic. Otherwise, it seems, they were nomads as much as the Goths or Vandals were nomads. Marcellinus’ accounts are very general and speak on all of the Eurasian steppe people, counting all of them together with the professional wanderers. On the other hand, Jordanes, who would naturally best know about the Alans than any of those 200 authors, says that Huns and Alans had only bravery in common, and were greatly different in nature, lifestyle and looks (Alemany 2000: 132). Nomad should resemble nomad, but the Alans did not look like the Huns, true nomads...

remnant of the Avar age

) in Ibn Rusta, and records the true version offered by N. N. Martinovich: subaj. He writes down its meaning also as “army chief”, but does not interrogate in which language it means army chief. Thus, he makes a greater mistake while he was apologizing. Because, if the reading subaj (< subašı “head of army”, widely used even by the Ottomans) is true, then this contributes to only our knowledge about Turkic origins of the White Croats. Though I’m not inclined to a southerner Moravia centred in the Drava‐Sava mesopotamia, as offered by Boba, but o northern one as in general acceptance,
18
I’m not in a position to speak on origins of the Moravian rulers; thus I abstain from any White Croatian connection, too, except unknown possibilities.
Ibn Rusta says: “Their king is Subanj, to whom they give their allegiance, and from whom they take orders, and his dwelling is in the middle of the country, and the most distinguished man known to them is one who is called king of the kings whom they name Sviat Malik and he is more important than Subanj, and Subanj is his deputy, and the king has riding animals. He does not eat any food except mare’s milk. He has excellent coats of mail, strong and precious, and the city in which he lives is called جرواب .”
19
Account of Gardizî is that “their leaders put a crown on his head. All of them obey him and submit. Their grand ruler is called Svît Malik. His deputy is called Sûbenj ( سوبنج ). Their capital city is Jarâvt ( )جراوت ” (Gardizî: 276; Şeşen 1998: 86).
We should add Aufî of the XIII century to this list with his same content: “They have a chief, who is accepted as king among them. They call him سويت . And they have also a regent, who is called سونج . And they have a city, which is called .حرران ” (Şeşen 1998: 94).
And Hudud: “The Saqlâb king is called S.mût‐swyt (or Bsmût‐swyt). The food of their king is milk. They dress mostly in linen stuffs... They possess two towns: (1) Vâbnît is the first town on the east of the Saqlâb and some (of its habitants) resemble the Rûs. (2) خرداب , a large town and the seat of the king.” (Hudud 1937: 159; 1962: 188).
20
17
Minorsky (1937: 431), offers even the *shûbâng? Form, again not leaving the župan connection. This title is difficult to set here, firstly, as it referred to a (sub)regional leader likely assigned by the Avar center in the Balkans. According to Klaić (1990: 15‐16), župan organization was established as autonomous Slavic administrative units only in the lands, where the Avars were in hegemony. Secondly, we do not know whether this inferior title became a superior one, the highgest after the king (associating with the dual kingdoms of the Khazars and Magyars) among the central European Slavs.
18
Moravia is accepted to be the proto‐state of today’s Slovakia. It is west to the traditional White Croatia, thus any interaction between them was always on the agenda. This state is indebted to Rastislav, mid‐IX century king, who invited the missionary brothers Constantine Cyrill and Methodius to Christianize his own people, for very scholarly interest in historiography. Imre Boba in his Moravia’s History Reconsidered, however, relocated this state in what is the ancient Sirmium and what are today Croatia’s eastern provinces. That the Russian Primary Chronicle recounts the Moravians and Czech together in one sentence and the other three (‐White‐ Croats, Serbians and Carantanians) in another ‐Balkanic‐ context, prevent me from thinking of a southern Moravia. But perhaps a Moravian southward expansion was in question in the absence of the Avar power, and Frank annals inspiriting Boba and his followers to look for a North Balkan Moravia should be speaking of these regions. See for evaluation of Boba’s theory: Bowlus 1987.
19
Translation taken from Vernadsky (1945: 258), who copies Macartney (1930: 211), but ignores his reading Suwayyat Balk, which would easily go to Svjatopluk. Y. Z. Yörükân, contemporary to Macartney, reads likewise Seviyyet Belk (2004: 295). Cairo edition of Ibn Rusta reads and corrects it as Swialpolk (Ibn Rusteh: 162), which is unnnecessary.

Cf. Anonymous Mujmal al‐Tawârîh of the XII century: “... Ruler of the Slavs is called سويت and سوينه .” (Şeşen 1998: 35).
Ibn Rusta is primary, of course, compared to Gardizi, being half a century earlier than the latter, but, neither Gardizi’s forms are negligible. Ibn Rusta might have taken majority of his nordic knowledge from Jarmî, but not name of the Slavic grand ruler, for Svjatopluk was a contemporary of Ibn Rusta, if another one with the same name did not live in the first half of the IX century.
21
and (2) no source quoting Jarmî gives the ruler’s and capital’s names, except Hudud’s above quoted parts. The form in Hudûd may be a test of writing Svjatoslav, whose very fame in the steppe should have gone to the anonymous author, contemporary of the Russian qagan.
22
If so, we may confidently say that Jarmî did not have any Svjato‐; thus Masudî has no him, too; Ibn Rusta added name of the Moravian Svjatopluk, as true Slavic ruler (to separate from the Rus and South Slav kings); Gardizî (followed by Aufî) borrowed from him and repeated the same forms. As for the (capital) city: Place of the letter alf would be helpful in analysis.
Ibn Rusta Gardizî Hudud Aufî
حرران خرداب جراوت جرواب
All of the four consonants in the four forms above resemble to each other in respective order. Aufî’s form can be excused for its remoteness from Ibn Rusta and the common source, Jarmî. Hudud makes o good copy with Swyt, milk, dressing, et
c., of Ibn Rusta, trying to add its own information, as well as ب at the end. Gardizî’s alf in the mid reflects his accelerated and condensed style, though estimating a Hrâvat form is plausible (cf. above Menâbit of Masudî). On the other hand, Gardizî might have saved the true letter at the end: ت. In any way, we should look for a Horvat here, as the White Croats were significant at the beginning of the tradition, in Jarmî’s time. This is the most reasonable and plausible unification of the above four forms, all of whom speak of the same thing, and none of whom agree with each other.
Though Islamic accounts on Eastern Europe were studied in a very satisfactory level, it seems we may find more of them than what is available to us currently. They are likely hidden in very details. Their search might even lead to new inventions or enlightenment of obscure dates and cases in history of the region. For instance, the East Slavic Λενζανήνοι tribe mentioned by Constantine (DAI: 59) and never mentioned by any other source
23
is probably لوزانه of Masudî (Mesudî: 75; Şeşen 1998: 49), owing that a later copier changed the second letter ن with و. Thus, we should pay more attention to those accounts.
21
This is even possible. See Masudî’s data above, reflecting the scene before the mid‐IX century, with Dir and Ratimir. But absence of a Svjato‐ in Masudî is troublesome.
22
Montgomery’s note that Ibn Rusta and Hudud do not share the same source in terms of the Rus’ (Montgomery 2001: 84) can be applied here, too, though I never agree with him on weakness of the former’s scientific value (literary value or form is out of our scope here).
23
Obolensky associates them with Polonians through Hungrain Lengyel, Lithuan Lenkai “Polonian” (DAI 1962: 34‐35). Cf. also Lav.zâ.âne of Masudî (Mesudî 2004: 75; Şeşen 1998: 49) and Lwznw, the Khazar’s enemy mentioned by the Schechter Docemnt (Schechter 1912: 219; Golb & Pritsak 1982: 121).

An endnote: the two earliest Hungarian chronicles, the Anonymous Gesta Hungarorum (ca. 1205) and the Getsa Hungarorum of Simon Kézai (ca.1285) gives the name ‘Morout’ (Hung. pronunciation ‘Marót’), as a Morivan king.24 The manuscripts are frank in meaning a personal name, but one may claim here a connection with the concerning nation’s name, and thus this form may represent a Latin version of the Arabic ‘Mrvât’. This would remain as an association, since there is no any other clue that Marót is linked with the denomination of the Moravians by the early Hungarians.25

BATSUREN, Barangas : On Tribe Alliances of Mengü Shiwei, Da Shiwei and Ulohou
From the early medieval Chinese sources Mongolian researchers try to determine those tribes and tribe alliances, which can be connected to ancient Mongolian people. During the 6‐9th centuries, after the collapse of the Juanjuan Khaganate and Turkic period of Inner Asia, several big tribe alliances existed in Eastern‐Inner Asia like the Mengü shiwei, Da shiwei and Ulohou.

How Euphonic Is the Finnish Language?
Abstract
There are many languages in the world but every language has its own sound picture. We are interested to investigate the euphony in the Finnish language. The euphony of the sound picture in Finnish may have the peculiar features or, on the contrary, only which are common to other Finno‐Ugric or world languages. By the sound picture of a language we mean the distribution of its speech sounds in the speech sound chain. It is very interesting to find the languages which are more euphonic than Finnish, i.e. sound nice and which are not so much euphonic. Euphony is the total of the vowels and sonorant consonants in the speech sound chain of a language. The vowels and sonorants make the speech sound chain sound nice to ear. It is also possible to call the total the vocalo‐sonorant quotient. Thus, the degree of euphony (melodicity) is the value of this quotient.
Vowels and sonorant consonants constitute the vocalo‐sonorant structure of the sound picture of any language, in this case Finnish. We take into consideration the basic features of sound classes and groups. The basic features consist of the frequency of occurrence of vowels and sonorant consonants in the speech chain. These basic features may be found in any world language. This is why, euphony (melodicity) is one more language universal. Analysing the value of euphony (melodicity), one can construct the typology of distribution of language taxa according to this universal characteristic.
In the speech sound chain of the Finnish language there are 49% and 23.32% of sonorants. Thus, the degree of euphony is 72.85%. It means that Finnish has the greatest degree of euphony among the 20 Finno‐Ugric languages taken for this study (Tab.1). Its degree of euphony is greater than that of the Samoedic, Turkic and other world languages.
In 32 American Indian languages taken for this study (Tab.2) the mean concentration of vowels is 44.06%. The least concentration of vowels is in Kadiweu — 35.73%. The major concentration of vowels is in Iquito — 58.84%. One can compare the use of vowels in some other world languages (Tab.2 ‐21).
In the English language vowels constitute 38.49% of the speech sound chain (Tambovtsev, 2001‐a). It is less than in any of the calculated Germanic languages. Thus, in Sweden it is 38.60%; in Dutch — 38.66%; German — 38.72%; Danish — 40.00%; Norwegian — 44.70%. We can compare these data to any other world language taken at random. For instance, Chinese speech sounds are rather different from English, but the concentration of vowels in the speech sound chain is not too different, at least not by the order, not in several times.
In Chinese vowels comprise 44.41% of the speech chain. It is more than in Tibetan (34.17%), Thai (39.71%), or Dungan (43.63%), but it is a bit less than in Burmese (44.66%). Thus, the concentration of vowels in Chinese is quite high (Tambovtsev, 2001).

Austronesian languages have a great concentration of vowels in the speech sound chain (e.g. maximum ‐ 65.24% in Hawaiian and 69.75% in Samoan).
Now, if we add the value of the concentration of sonorant consonants in the speech chain, we receive the degree of euphony. In the 32 languages of American Indians the mean concentration of vowels and sonorants in the speech sound chain is 65.09%. One can see the value of euphony, i.e. vocalo‐sonorant quotient, in some other world languages.
The mean of the vocalo‐sonorant quotient turned out to be bigger in the following language taxa: SinoTibetan family (Burmese ‐ 75.67%), Bantu (Swahili ‐ 76.29%), Afro‐Asian family (Neo‐Aramaic‐ 81.47%), Austronesian family (Hawaiian‐ 83.29%), languages of Australian aboriginals‐ Nunggubuyu‐ 85.14%). It means that 85.14% of the Nunggubuyu speech sound chain consists of vowels and sonorant consonants.
In fact, the concentration of vowels in Finnish is 49.53%. On the other hand, some of the world languages have the minimum of the concentration of vowels. So, in the Itelmen language (Paleo‐Asiatic family) vowels comprise only 32.61% while the sonorants — 26.91%. Thus, Itelmanʹs euphony is rather low — 59.52%. It is very close to the absolute minimum. The minimum of the vocalo‐sonorant quotient happens to be in the Adygian language (Caucasian family). It reaches only 54.07%.
It should be mentioned that on the average the Caucasian language family has a rather low vocalosonorant quotient — 61.66%. It is much less than in the American Indian languages, which is 65.09%. Now let us see what place they take among the other world languages. The ordered series of the average of the vocalo‐sonorant quotient in different language taxa is the following: Baltic group of Indo‐European family — 62.76%; Iranian group of the Indo‐European family — 63.95%); Slavonic group — 64.64%; Germanic — 64.78%; Samoyedic family — 65.16%; Finno‐Ugric family — 65.57%; Mongolic family 66.06%; Balkan language unity — 66.18%; Indic group of the Indo‐European family — 66.77%; Turkic family — 66.99%; Paleo‐Asiatic family — 67.58%; Sino‐Tibetan family — 67.63%; Roman group of I‐E family — 68.57%; Afro‐Asiatic family — 68.96%; Manchu‐Tungusic family — 69.54%; Austronesian family — 73.16%; Bantu — 73.40%; Languages of Australian aboriginals — 80.51%.
Euphony, i.e. the total of vowels and sonorant consonants, may be considered a phonetic universal.
Key words: euphony, vocalo‐sonorant quotient, maximum and minimum value of euphony, melodicity, language group, language family, language taxa, genetic classification, typological classification, under‐exploit vowels and sonorant consonants, over‐exploit, the probable theoretical frequency, the actual mean frequency of euphony, ordered series, coefficient of variation, world languages, a phonetic universal.

There are many languages in the world but every language has its own sound picture. By the sound picture of a language we mean the distribution of its speech sounds in the speech sound chain. It is very interesting to find the languages which are more euphonic, i.e. melodic, than Finnish and which are not.

By the degree of euphony we mean the total of the frequency of occurrence of the vowels and sonorant consonants in the language speech sound chain.
The goal of this paper is to compare the value of euphony (or melodicity) of the Finnish language in comparison to different world languages. It is important to find the maximum and minimum of euphony in the 226 world languages taken for this study to see what place the Finnish language takes among them. World languages are united in various language taxa. So, first of all, we consider the Finno‐Ugric and Samoyedic taxa to state the place of Finnish among them by the degree of euphony in Finnish. Therefore, after computing Finnish we received the concentration of vowels (49.53%), while the concentration of the sonorant consonants in its sound chain is 23.32%. The details on the Finnish material can be found in our monograph [Tambovtsev, 2001: 40 — 42]. It means that Finnish has the greatest degree of euphony among the Finno‐Ugric languages (Tab.1). It is more euphonic than any Samoyedic language (Tab.2). The degree of Finnish euphony is greater than in Italian (69.52%), though Italian is recognized as a very euphonic language.
As a matter of fact, one can estimate the degree of the euphony of this or that language taxa by its mean.
Here by American Indian languages we consider a sample of 32 Indian languages of North, Central and South America. They enter different language branches and families but their classification is still controversial since their origins and interrelationships are unclear. In fact, their classification is not genetic but geographical. One has to admit that they are usually described with reference to the main geographical areas involved (Crystal, 1992: 17). David Crystal correctly points out that the classification of this family is still controversial because they are classified by different linguists differently (Crystal, 1992: 18). Our data can show if the degree of the euphony of the speech sound chain of its members is similar.
It is also possible to call euphony as the vocalo‐sonorant quotient. Thus, the degree of melodicity or euphony is the value of this quotient.
Vowels and sonorant consonants constitute the vocalo‐sonorant structure of the sound picture of any language. We take into consideration the basic features of sound classes and groups. The basic features consist of the frequency of occurrence of vowels and sonorant consonants in the speech chain. These basic features may be found in any world language. This is why, euphony (melodicity) is one more language universal. It is possible to call it a language universal since a language universal is a property claimed to be characteristic of all languages (Crystal, 1992: 405). Analysing the value of euphony, one can construct the typology of distribution of language taxa according to this universal phonetic characteristic. We analysed the euphony in nearly all language groups and families of world languages. Language subgroups, groups, unities or phyla can be in general called language taxa. Let us mention the examined language taxa in the alphabetic order: Afro‐Asiatic family; American Indian taxon, Austronesian family; Balkan language union; Baltic group of the Indo‐European family; Caucasian family; Finno‐Ugric family; Germanic group of the Indo‐European family; Indic group of the Indo‐European family; Iranian group of the Indo‐European family; Manchu‐Tungusic family; Paleo‐Asiatic family; Romance group of the IndoEuropean family; Samoyedic family; Sino‐Tibetan family; Turkic; set of American Indian languages; set of Australian aboriginal languages; set of Bantu and some other African languages; Slavonic group of the Indo‐European family; some isolated languages

Euphony is close to the notion of euphony in poetry (Tambovtsev, 1979). In poetry, usually, euphony of a speech sound chain means the degree of beauty it bears. However, until now nobody tried to measure the degree of euphony of a language speech sound chain in the exact numbers by one and the same method. We proposed to measure the degree of euphony (melodicity) of a language on the basis of the most melodical elements of the sound speech chain, that is, vowels and sonorant consonants long ago (Tambovtsev, 1977). Usually, when a euphonic language comes to mind, Italian is named. Our measurements showed that Italian is not a world champion in the degree of euphony since its value is 69.53%. However, it is not even the champion in its own group of Romance languages. In fact, its degree of euphony is less than that of Romanian — 69.91% in the group of the Romance group of Indo‐European family, not to speak of many others in other language taxa (see Tab.1 ‐ 21).
We can calculate the theoretical expected frequency of euphony in a language. If we follow the way a great American mathematician G. Polya proposed, we must find the theoretical expected frequency of a linguistic element. If we juxtapose it to the speech chain, then we must know the number of the elements or groups of this chain. When G. Polya wanted to know the theoretical expected frequency of a letter, he divided 100% by 26, because there were 26 letters in the letter inventory (Polya, 1954: 316‐317). Now let us apply his reasoning to our case. Since euphony consists of the frequency of vowels, we must reserve 50% for vowels. The rest 50% out of 100%, we reserve for consonants. Now let us calculate the number of our elements which are, in fact, groups of consonants. We have 3 groups of consonants defined from the point of view of the manner of articulation: sonorant, occlusive and fricative. Therefore, we must divide 50% by 3. In this way we obtain 16.67%. Thus, we reserve 16.67% for the sonorant consonants as the probable theoretical frequency in a language speech sound chain. Consequently, the theoretical euphony (melodicity) in any language is equal to 50%+16.67%= 66.75%. We can reason in the following way: if the value of the euphony of some language is greater than 66.75%, then the language in question over‐uses the vowels and sonorant consonants in its speech sound chain. It means that this language puts too great a load on vowels and sonorants. So, vowels and sonorants overrun the limits of the theoretical frequency, i.e. probability of occurrence. We can claim that they are over‐exploited.
In the American Indian languages taken for this study (Tab.1) the mean degree of euphony is equal to 65.09%. It is less than the theoretical degree of euphony in a language. It means that American Indian languages in general under‐exploit vowels ans sonorant consonants in their speech sound chain (c.f. 65.09% and 66.75%. Nevertheless, some American Indian languages like Guarani (74.89%) or Iquito (76.85%), surely over‐exploit the use of vowels and sonorants (Tab.3). The Kekchi language (64.90%) is very close to the mean of euphony in these 32 American Indian languages.
In other language families it is different. So, in the ordered series of the Turkic languages (Tab.5) Kirgiz is in the middle with the frequency of occurrence of 66.68%. It means that Chuvash, Jakut and the other Turkic language (Tab.5) overload their speech sound chains. It is possible to call these languages melodical or euphonic from the point of view of Turkic languages. However, to understand what the euphony is in general, one should take into account the mean degree of euphony in world languages. We found this euphonic mean in 226 world languages to be 67.03%. It is very close to the theoretical value 66.67%. To a human ear in general the languages with the euphony greater than 67.03% should sound beautifully (see Tab 1‐21). Consequently, Kirgiz with its vocalo‐sonorant quotient (66.68%) cannot be recognised as a euphonic language from the point of view of world languages.

Why should we bother to spend so much time and energy to obtain the mean value of euphony in world languages? It is as simple as that: theoretical probability may be much greater or much lower than the real euphonic probability. It this case, the theoretical probability is rather close to the actual probability of euphony. It is just a lucky chance. Nevertheless, one can suppose that any human language tend to use enough of vowels and sonorant since it is easier to hear them in the conditions of bad communication.
However, we agree to those linguists who object that theoretical probability of linguistic elements are too abstract to say anything about real world languages. This is why, a linguist must spend much time and effort to count the actual phonemic frequencies of occurrence in different languages to draw some solid conclusions about languages. Therefore, we had to calculate the empirical mean of the melodicity of 226 world languages which turned to be equal to 67.03% of the speech sound chain. We repeat this value because it is very important. It shows how a human language works. It is advisable to use the value of this characteristic to find out the melodic or euphonic languages in the mass of world languages. So, here we can state that the degree of euphony in Finnish (72.85%) is greater than in a language in general (67.03%).
For instance, the mean degree of euphony in American Indian languages is less than this number (c.f. 65.09% and 67.03%). It indicates that American Indian languages in general do not use as many vowels and sonorant consonants as the other world languages. Nahuatl (Aztecan) has the degree of euphony (67.27%) close to the mean degree of euphony in the world languages, i.e. 67.03%.
The mean degree of euphony of the 26 Turkic languages (Tab.5) is a bit less than 67.03%. It is 66.99%. It means that on the average Turkic languages are not very melodical. However, the mean melodicity of Mongolian language family (66.06%) is even less than 67.03%. Thus, Mongolian languages under‐use vowels and sonorant consonants in their speech sound chain (Tab.2). Now let us consider what language taxa do not use enough euphonic elements in their speech sound chain. In fact, Caucasian (Tab.12 61,66%), Finno‐Ugric (Tab.1 — 65.57%), Samoyedic (Tab.2 — 65.16%) American Indian languages (Tab.3 — 65.09%), Indic (Tab.13 ‐ 66.77%) also under‐exploit vowels and sonorant consonants. This is just an example. One can see in detail which language taxa under‐exploit in the ordered series of the means of euphony. We discuss it in detail later.
On the other hand, one can find individual languages in whose speech sound chain the vowels and sonorant consonants do not occur as often as 67.03%. One can analyse the ordered series of the Turkic languages taken for the study. Such languages as Tofalar, Kazah and the other Turkic languages whose vocalo‐sonorant quotient is less than the threshold, under‐exploit (under‐use) vowels and sonorants. Thus, their vowels and sonorants do not occupy the speech sound chain in great numbers. It is possible to look through our tables (Tab.1 — 21) in order to see the euphonic languages and those which cannot be called the euphonic languages by our classification.
The other important question is how close the euphonic values are crowded around the mean in this or that language taxa. That is, how high is the quotient of its compactness. It can be measured by the coefficient of variance or the coefficient of variation (Herdan, 1966: 93‐94). The less this coefficient, the tighter the values around its mean. If the coefficient of variation is great, then the values of euphony are distributed sparsely. Christopher Butler is correct to warn linguists that it is not possible to compare two

or more means of different samples without testing for homogeneity of variance (Butler, 1985: 127). If the coefficient of variation is too great, then we can say that there is no homogeneity of data. Therefore, the samples cannot be compared. Studying many languages we can come to a conclusion that if the coefficient of variation is greater than 33%, than there is no homogeneity (Tambovtsev, 2003: 12 — 16).
Let us consider the value of the coefficient of variation in different language taxa. It is possible to construct the following ordered series: Romance (1.53%); Mongolic (1.83%); Samoyedic (1.98%); Bantu (2.28%); Iranian (2.25%); Indic (2.29%) Manchu‐Tungusic (2.66%); Baltic (3.06%); Turkic (3.36%); Germanic (3.81%); Australian Aboriginal (3.90%); Slavonic (4.24%); Finno‐Ugric (5.02%); Caucasian (7.01%); PaleoAsiatic (7.28%); Austronesian (8.02%); American Indian (8.13%); Afro‐Asian (9.61%); Sino‐Tibetan (10.29%). One can see that all the language taxa have the values of the coefficient of variation which are much less than 33%. Nevertheless, the American Indian languages cannot be called a very compact taxon by this parameter (8.13%).
Conclusion:
1) Finnish is a very euphonic language (72.82%). One can see from Tab.1 that it has the greatest degree of euphony among 20 Finno‐Ugric languages. Its degree of euphony is also greater than among Samoyedic languages (Tab.2). In fact, the rest of the tables of other language taxa indicate that its euphony is really high. It is possible to compare Finnish (72.85%) to the mean degree of euphony in the Finno‐Ugric taxon (65.57%). The peculiarities of the distribution of sonorants (23.32%) and vowels in Finnish (49.53%) vividly shows its place among world languages. The mean concentration of vowels in the taxon of American Indian languages is 44.06%. It is much less than in the Austronesian languages which have a great concentration of vowels in the speech sound chain ‐ 53.40%. American Indian languages have the maximum of melodicity in Odjibwe — 64.32%. It is much less than in Samoan ‐ 69.75%.
2) Let us compare the total of the distribution of vowels and sonorants in Finnish to the maximum and minimum value of euphony in all the language taxa under investigation. The maximum of the euphony is in the Australian Aboriginal language of Nunggubuyu (85.14%), the minimum — in the Caucasian language of Adygian (54.07%). In American Indian languages this span is not so great: maximum in Iquito (76.85%) and minimum in Kadiweu — 55.23%.
Let us consider the maximum value of euphony in different language taxa. It is possible to put the maximum values of the quotient of euphony, that is, vocalo‐sonorant quotient in the ordered series: Latvian (Baltic of Indo‐European) — 64.11%; Kurdish (Iranian of Indo‐European) — 65.79%; Georgean (Caucasian) — 66.25%; Nenets (Samoyedic) — 66.38%; Buriat (Mongolic) — 66.84%; Norwegian (Germanic of Indo‐European) — 67.80%; Marathi (Indic of Indo‐European) — 68.59%; Romanian (Romance of Indo‐European) — 69.91%; Serbian (Slavonic of Indo‐European) — 70.19%; Salarian of the Turkic family — 71.75%; Evenk (Manchu‐Tungusic) — 71.98%; Choockchee (Paleo‐Asiatic) — 72.84%; Finnish (Finno‐Ugric) — 72.85%; Burmese ((Sino‐Tibetan) — 75.67%; Swahili (Bantu) — 76.29%; NeoAramaic Afro‐Asiatic) — 81.47%; Hawaiian (Austronesian) — 83.29%; Nunggubuyu (Autralian Aboriginal) — 85.14%.

Thus, one can see that the vocalo‐sonorant quotient turned out to be bigger in five language taxa. May be, there is something special in the phonetic systems of Finnish as well as the following languages of different language taxa: Burmese ‐ 75.67%, Swahili‐ 76.29%, Neo‐Aramaic‐ 81.47%, Hawaiian‐ 83.29%, Nunggubuyu‐ 85.14%. It means that the greater part of Finnish (72.85%) as well as that (85.14%) of the Nunggubuyu speech sound chain consists of vowels and sonorant consonants. Therefore, one can see that Finnish is in the cohort of the euphonic champions. It is more so if we consider the minimum values in the world language taxa.
3) In fact, some of the world languages have the minimum of the concentration of vowels. So, in the Itelmen language (Paleo‐Asiatic family) vowels comprise only 32.61%. In Finnish it is much greater 49.53%.
4) Let us consider the minimum of the vocalo‐sonorant quotient in different language taxa. Thus, in the Adygian language (Caucasian family) this quotient reaches only 54.07%. Therefore, the ordered series of the vocalo‐sonorant quotient of the languages in different language taxa is the following: Kadeweu (American Indian) — 55.23%; Tibetan (Sino‐Tibetan) — 56.50%; Itelʹmen (Paleo‐Asiatic) — 59.52%; Sokotrian (Afro‐Asiatic) — 60.32%; Belorussian (Slavonic of Indo‐European) — 60.66%; English (Germanic of Indo‐European) — 61.08%; Vepsian (Finno‐Ugric) — 61.34%; Lithuanian (Baltic of IndoEuropean) — 61.40%; Tadjic (Iranian of Indo‐European) — 61.60%; Chalkan (Turkic) — 62.83%; Selʹkup (Samoyedic) — 63.34%; Kalmyk (Mongolic) — 64.66%; Gujarati (Indic of Indo‐European) — 65.14; Indonesian (Austronesian) — 66.01%; Oroch (Manch‐Tungusic) — 66.09%; Romanian (Romance of IndoEuropean) — 67.37; Moore (Bantu) — 70.90%; Ngandi (Australian Aboriginal) — 76.84%.
In the American Indian languages it is rather low — 55.23% in Kadeweu, which is second to the world euphonic minimum.
5) Let us consider the average value of euphony in different language taxa. It should be mentioned that on the average the Caucasian language family has a rather low vocalo‐sonorant quotient — 61.66%. The ordered series of the average of the vocalo‐sonorant quotient in different language taxa is the following: Baltic group of Indo‐European family — 62.76%; Iranian group of the Indo‐European family — 63.95%); Slavonic group — 64.64%; Germanic — 64.78%; American Indian languages — 65.09%; Samoyedic family — 65.16%; Finno‐Ugric family — 65.57%; Mongolic family — 66.06%; Balkan language unity — 66.18%; Indic group of the Indo‐European family — 66.77%; Turkic family — 66.99%; Paleo‐Asiatic family 67.58%; Sino‐Tibetan family — 67.63%; Roman group of I‐E family — 68.57%; Afro‐Asiatic family 68.96%; Manchu‐Tungusic family — 69.54%; Austronesian family — 73.16%; Bantu — 73.40%; Languages of Australian aboriginals — 80.51%.
6) Euphony, i.e. the total of vowels and sonorant consonants in the speech sound chain, may be considered a new phonetic universal. This is why, it is possible to compare Finnish euphony to that in the other languages.

BADALOV, Ulugbek
Vingt ans après : Nostalgie de la grande URSS en Asie centrale
Il était une fois un pays qui s’appelait l’Union soviétique. La vie y était plus facile et heureuse, les gens étaient contents de leurs conditions de vie, de travail... Une amitié les reliait à travers des pays unis autour d’une idéologie fameuse, le communisme. Cette belle époque s’est muée aujourd’hui en un conte qu’on a envie de raconter aux jeunes générations qui ne connaîtront jamais, selon les personnes plus âgées, la “douce éducation soviétique” (доброе советское воспитание – en russe). Plus de vingt ans se sont écoulés depuis l’effondrement de l’URSS et, par delà des indépendances, les transformations, les économies de marché et les privatisations, la période sous le joug soviétique demeure toujours considérée sous un jour positif et bienveillant par beaucoup de citoyens exsoviétiques (Badalov, Ulugbek. 2011).
En effet, l’image de ce passé dans la mémoire collective que ce soit en Russie, au Caucase ou en Asie centrale, est essentiellement associée à une époque où les gens vivaient dans des conditions similaires, sans grande différenciation sociale, avec des relations humaines appréciées comme l’amitié, la solidarité et des liens de bon voisinage. C’est encore aussi, pour beaucoup de gens, la nostalgie de leur propre jeunesse, avec son cortège de rêves et d’illusions, à présent définitivement envolés. C’était l’époque d’une jeunesse où chacun participait à un projet collectif, la “construction du grand socialisme”, avec obligation de grandir en appartenant à des mouvements de jeunesse comme les pionniers, les komsomols, d’entrer au parti, de faire des études afin d’obtenir un emploi garantissant, en fin de vie, une retraite assurée et pleinement sécurisée. Presque toute la population âgée en Asie centrale, ayant connu le communisme, préférerait le retour de ce régime “protecteur” dans tous les domaines plutôt que pérenniser le système actuel générateur de déceptions pour des raisons aisément perceptibles. Les personnes âgées ayant vécu la période précédente en parlent souvent avec fierté et même avec des larmes aux yeux. C’était une fierté d’appartenir à un pays puissant dont l’autorité était reconnue dans le monde tant au niveau militaire que scientifique alors qu’aujourd’hui, leurs pays se retrouvent dans une situation de détresse. Les personnes que je présente ici sont toutes originaires d’Asie centrale et vivent encore dans la nostalgie de cette “inoubliable période soviétique” (незабываемые советские времена ‐ en russe).1
1 Les témoignages sont récoltés lors de mon enquête de terrain pour une thèse de doctorat réalisée entre les périodes 2007 et 2011 à l’EHESS.

Anvar de l’Ouzbékistan
Agé de soixantaine d’années, Anvar est un homme de petite taille, au regard profond et portant des dents en or, très courantes dans les sociétés centrasiatiques comme d’ailleurs dans toute l’ex‐URSS. Reconverti à l’Islam depuis les années 1991, comme beaucoup dans la société ouzbékistanaise, celui‐ci ne mange pas du porc, accepte néanmoins de boire de l’alcool pour se souvenir de cette belle période du communisme à jamais révolue. Fier d’appartenir à la génération de l’époque soviétique qui lui a donné une des meilleures éducations du monde, Anvar est diplômé de l’Université des langues étrangères de Tachkent où il a fait presque toute sa carrière comme enseignant de français. Comme ses collègues du travail, il regrette l’époque soviétique dont tous ne gardent que de bons souvenirs, dit‐il, en relatant avec tristesse ce qu’il y avait alors vécu.
“Tu sais, on a perdu beaucoup de choses avec la disparation de l’URSS qui nous a laissés dans une situation lamentable. Je suis professeur et je peux te dire que les effets des changements pèsent vraiment sur des professions de services publiques. On touche des revenus minimaux qui ne suffisent même pas à subvenir aux besoins élémentaires du foyer. Mon salaire équivaut à une somme de 300 dollars par mois que je dépense tout de suite pour la nourriture de deux semaines de la famille. Heureusement, ma femme travaille aussi, ce qui nous permet de payer les deux autres semaines du mois. Elle est professeur de français, mais elle a abandonné son métier justement en raison du salaire médiocre qu’elle touchait à l’Université. Cela fait une dizaine d’années qu’elle travaille comme femme de ménage dans une famille d’expatriés français à Tachkent. Son salaire mensuel est de 450 dollars par mois. Nous avons une fille de 15 ans. Auparavant, à l’époque soviétique, la vie était tout‐à‐fait différente. On avait des salaires corrects qui nous permettaient de vivre raisonnablement ; on pouvait acheter des appareils ménagers, une voiture, se payer des loisirs culturels et sportifs, une datcha, un voyage dans un autre pays de l’URSS, etc. Certains mois où il y avait des primes et moins de dépenses, on pouvait même épargner nos salaires. Tandis qu’aujourd’hui on est content de pouvoir simplement acheter de la nourriture et payer le gaz et l’électricité. Le matin, tu te lèves et tu te demandes comment gagner de l’argent... Croyez‐moi, si vous demandez à un professeur quand il est allé au théâtre pour la dernière fois, je suis sûr qu’il répondrait qu’il n’a pas ni le moyen ni le temps. A l’époque soviétique, tout le monde respectait notre métier au point que les jeunes répondaient souvent qu’ils souhaiteraient l’exercer lorsqu’on les interrogeait sur leur avenir. On avait vraiment envie de travailler car les valeurs étaient alors autres. On avait une certaine notoriété. Alors qu’aujourd’hui avec tous les changements que nous vivons, le métier d’enseignant est devenu honteux. Si tu demandes aux jeunes ce qu’ils souhaitent faire à l’avenir, rares sont ceux qui évoqueraient le possible métier d’enseignant. Ils répondent qu’ils envisagent de travailler comme avocat, banquier, businessman, etc. Bien sûr, qui voudrait exercer un tel métier qui ne te permet même pas de subvenir à tes besoins les plus élémentaires ? C’est devenu honteux et déshonoré, au point que beaucoup de professeurs sont contraints de céder à la corruption en raison de ce manque d’argent : ils demandent aux élèves des pots de vin en échange des notes fictives. De leur côté, les élèves sachant qu’ils peuvent acheter leurs notes, manquent des cours et vont jusqu’à obtenir leurs diplômes de cette façon. Ils ne veulent pas étudier et ne pensent qu’à se procurer de l’argent facile. Leur culture générale est pauvre, sans parler de leur connaissance dans leur discipline de formation, aussi peu brillante. Tu te demandes où on va avec un tel système. Je n’imaginais jamais qu’un jour je me retrouverais dans une

situation pareille avec mon métier d’enseignant. Je voulais que ma fille fasse mon métier, mais la dernière fois lorsque je l’ai questionnée sur son avenir, elle m’a répondu qu’elle voudrait devenir médecin. Elle a peut être raison.”
Le sentiment de paupérisation ressenti par ce professeur dont le statut a perdu toute autorité et toute dignité, démontre à quel point demeure ancrée la nostalgie d’un confort passé, garanti par l’État, offrant des conditions de vie meilleures. Quels que soient leur âge et les expériences qu’ils ont vécues sous l’URSS, les “professeurs ex‐soviétiques” retiennent essentiellement les bons côtés de cette période. Ces avantages, souvent devenus inaccessibles aujourd’hui (comme voyager, avoir une vie culturelle, etc.) enjolivent les souvenirs de nombreuses personnes et font naître dʹamers regrets. Le travail auquel ils dédiaient leur existence pour la construction du communisme ne rapporte plus autant qu’à l’ère soviétique et les plonge dans une misère à la fois sociale et morale qui les accompagne dans leur quotidien en soulignant les dysfonctionnements à l’œuvre dans les structures de services publics. Ce sentiment de pauvreté chez beaucoup de gens nʹest donc pas une construction imaginaire et envieuse, mais bien le résultat de la confrontation dʹun quotidien précaire et de lʹimage idéalisée dʹune existence antérieure meilleure, dont l’État soviétique était le garant et le protecteur.
Cette nostalgie de l’époque soviétique est quasi omniprésente dans les conversations des populations centrasiatiques. Ce sentiment mélancolique de la perte d’un passé glorieux a fait son apparition en Asie centrale, tout comme dans l’ensemble de l’ex‐URSS, vers le milieu des années 1990. Il se traduit par un grand désarroi alors que s’installe dans les pays de la région une profonde crise sociale et économique depuis l’écroulement du système communiste. Ce regret du passé accompagne désormais le quotidien de la majeure partie des populations, à l’exception d’une petite classe sociale enrichie lors de la pérestroïka, réduite à l’indigence et dépourvue de toute sécurité sociale. Le glorieux avenir promis par les États indépendants se perd dans un avenir de plus en plus éloigné et impossible à atteindre. Cette nostalgie est omniprésente dans des vieux films soviétiques, dans des chansons de l’époque, tandis qu’elle est se voit également dans la tenue vestimentaire de certains jeunes comme des insignes de toutes sortes, des T‐shirts marqués de l’inscription CCCP (URSS), un foulard rouge porté de façon un peu extravagante, quasi provocatrice. Même certains lieux de rencontres habituels comme les cafés et les restaurants portent encore des noms évocateurs de l’époque révolue : Zvezda (étoile, rouge bien évidemment), Brigada (brigade), etc. principalement au Kirghizstan et au Kazakhstan. À ce titre, les propos de Sacha de Bichkek sont pertinents.
Sacha du Kirghizstan
Agé de 68 ans, Sacha est un Kirghiz d’origine russe. Il est arrivé à Bichkek dans les années 70 pour travailler dans une usine métallurgique, il a vécu toute sa vie, avec sa femme, dans un foyer collectif de l’usine situé dans une des banlieues de la capitale kirghize. Leur enfant unique, Nadia, vit en Russie où elle travaille comme coiffeuse. Retraité aujourd’hui avec une pension minime, il me raconte à une voix tremblante l’époque soviétique qu’il a connue tant en Russie qu’au Kirghizstan.
“Lorsque je suis entré à l’usine métallurgique de Tcheliabinsk, après avoir servi dans l’armée en Sibérie, l’administration envoyait des ouvriers en Asie centrale. C’est comme ça que je suis arrivé à

Bichkek où j’avais déjà des amis connus à l’armée. J’ai été responsable d’une équipe dans l’usine. J’aimais bien mon travail. Il y avait des primes si tu travaillais bien, il y avait des fêtes, des clubs culturels et sportifs. J’y ai rencontré ma femme, une Russe née au Kirghizstan. Eh bien, cette époque‐là, elle ne reviendra jamais. Vous savez : ces parades et ces défilés à l’occasion du 8 mai et du 23 février, les voyages au Kremlin, tout ça est devenu un rêve. Vous n’avez pas connu cette époque, demandez à vos parents, ils te le diront : c’était beau. Tout était alors en ordre avec un logement, un travail, un salaire suffisant, les soins étaient gratuits, les week‐ends, on allait au cinéma, au parc ou à la montagne en été. La vie était belle. Aujourd’hui, tu ne penses plus qu’à la façon de remplir ton ventre. Heureusement, on a nos pensions et un abri. Sinon, je ne sais pas comment on survivrait... Quand j’étais jeune, je n’aurais jamais imaginé que je vivrais les dernières années de ma vie à Bichkek. Je me disais qu’un jour je retournerais enfin en Russie où, d’ailleurs, il n’y a plus personne de ma famille. Je me souviens de ma jeunesse passée là‐bas, j’ai des photos de mes amis de l’école où j’étais pionnier et komsomol. Je portais le drapeau soviétique...”
Le témoignage de Sacha est, un parmi beaucoup d’autres, et tous les Russes s’expriment, peu ou prou, dans les mêmes termes chez les Russes dans cette Asie centrale où ils se sentent à présent plus ou moins étrangers depuis la fin de l’URSS. Il est important d’ailleurs de rappeler que les politiques d’ethnocratisation des États centrasiatiques ont, depuis l’indépendance, motivé le départ de la minorité russe qui avait bénéficié d’un statut privilégié pendant toute la période soviétique. Si de nombreux jeunes russes sont partis en Russie, les personnes âgées sont encore restées dans ces républiques où beaucoup d’entre eux vivaient depuis deux, voire trois générations (Jean Marie, Thiébaud. 2004). En effet, la chute du régime soviétique, qui offrait le sentiment rassurant dʹune prise en charge globale pour tous, et où, dès leur naissance, les individus mettaient leur existence entre les mains du système social en place (jardins dʹenfants, komsomols, écoles, universités, entreprises, collectifs de travail, centres de vacances, sanatoriums, parti communiste...) a laissé chacun face à lui‐même, dans un sentiment d’insécurité et lʹappréhension du lendemain. La responsabilité de ce changement est rejetée sur les États désormais devenus indépendants. Les propos d’Almaz, du Kazakhstan, sont éloquents à ce sujet :
Almaz, du Kazakhstan
Almaz, un Kazakh de cinquantaine d’années, est un ancien ingénieur vivant actuellement en France, dans la région parisienne. Originaire du sud du Kazakhstan, il a fait son service militaire en Pologne dont il garde de bons souvenirs tout comme d’autres images de l’époque soviétique. Lorsque l’URSS s’est effondrée, l’usine où il travaillait a été privatisée dans le cadre de la politique du nouveau gouvernement kazakh. Il a continué à y travailler mais son salaire ne suffisait pas à nourrir sa famille de quatre personnes ; lui, sa femme et leurs deux enfants. Quelques années plus tard, les choses empirèrent et il partit pour la Russie où il a travaillé pendant quatre ans sur des chantiers de construction avec des hommes de sa région. Quand il est rentré chez lui, il s’est retrouvé dans la misère : pas de boulot et sa famille l’avait quitté en vendant son appartement. Il a alors décidé de partir pour l’étranger et, plus particulièrement, en Europe. Il séjourna d’abord en République Tchèque ce qui lui permit de passer ensuite en Italie puis en France où il vit dans une situation irrégulière. Comme beaucoup de personnes de sa génération, il se souvient avec tristesse de l’époque soviétique.

“Dans l’armée, on était tous unis comme des frères, car c’était le communisme qui nous réunissait quelle que soit notre nationalité. Il y avait de tout : des Russes, des Caucasiens, des Centrasiatiques, des Baltes, des Coréens, etc., mais tous avec, un point commun : on était tous des Soviétiques (cоветские ‐ en russe). C’était vraiment une ambiance internationale. Nous étions alors fiers d’appartenir à la première puissance scientifique mondiale, inventrice de la première fusée spatiale, détentrice d’une formidable puissance militaire, etc. Même au travail, quelles que fussent les républiques fédérées d’origine, proches ou lointaines, tu pouvais avoir comme collègues des personnes de différentes nationalités (национальность ‐ en russe), toutes maîtrisant le russe, notre langue commune. Imaginez‐vous dans l’usine où j’exerçais mon métier d’ingénieur à l’époque dans une petite ville du Kazakhstan, il y avait des Coréens, des Polonais, des Ukrainiens, des Russes, etc. Je me souviens, notre usine avait une équipe de football qui était la meilleure de la région, la championne des compétitions régionales organisées avec des équipes venues d’usines similaires. La vie était belle et facile : on avait une éducation, un travail, une famille. On touchait son salaire à la fin de chaque mois, ce qui n’a plus été pas le cas après la chute de l’URSS. Privatisation, économie de marché, business, tout est devenu un vrai bordel. Tout ne fonctionne plus qu’avec l’argent, toujours l’argent ! Si tu en as aujourd’hui au Kazakhstan, tu as des amis, une voiture, un travail, si tu n’en as pas, tu seras comme moi un émigré en Europe. Quand on évoque le Kazakhstan, on se représente Almaty, Astana, le gaz, le pétrole et l’uranium du pays, en ignorant les facettes cachées de la réalité ; la pauvreté, les inégalités sociales, la corruption, etc.”
Ces trois témoignages proviennent de trois républiques d’Asie centrale, Ouzbékistan, Kirghizstan et Kazakhstan. Les situations semblent les mêmes dans les pays voisins, le Turkménistan et le Tadjikistan, dans la mesure où le premier est un pays plus fermé (pour des raisons politiques) et où le second demeure le pays le plus pauvre, économiquement parlant de la région (Laruelle, Marlène et Peyrouse, Sébastian. 2010). Les groupes de discussion formés par des migrants de ces deux républiques centrasiatiques sur le site odnoklassni.ru constituent un des plus grands “réseaux sociaux numériques” dans le monde, créé en mars 2006 en Russie par Albert Polkov (né le 25 septembre 1975, vivant actuellement à Londres), ingénieur de formation. Signifiant “Camarades de classe” en russe, odnoklassniki équivaut, dans son contenu initial, à “classmates” aux États‐Unis ou “copains d’avant” en France. Son objectif : permettre à ses utilisateurs de retrouver les anciens amis d’école ou d’université. Il compte aujourd’hui plus de 45 000 membres, regroupés par établissements scolaires ou universitaires, lieux de naissance ou de résidence actuelle, par centres d’intérêt, et il recense plus de 10 millions de visiteurs par jour à travers le monde (Badalov, Ulugbek. 2011).
Si, au départ, le site était destiné exclusivement à des amis de classe ou d’université, aujourd’hui, il attire de nombreuses personnes qui s’y inscrivent pour diverses raisons, mais surtout pour se retrouver entre elles. C’est ainsi, par exemple, que les expatriés issus des anciennes républiques soviétiques s’y retrouvent en groupes afin de garder des liens avec leurs pays d’origine. Pour ce qui est des expatriés en provenance du Turkménistan et du Tadjikistan, ils ont leurs propres groupes de discussions sur lesquels on peut éventuellement trouver des forums où ceux‐ci expriment leur nostalgie à la fois pour leur patrie et pour la période soviétique dans laquelle la plupart d’entre eux ont grandi. Ils y participent et y interviennent avec leurs propres ressentis en contexte migratoire, accompagnés de photographies. Les membres partagent leurs expériences personnelles à tonalité “mélancolique”, et jugent insatisfaisante leur situation présente en retournant dans l’imaginaire du passé où tout paraissait meilleur

qu’aujourd’hui : “L’éducation était meilleure à l’époque de l’URSS”, “Je suis triste quand j’écoute de la musique patriotique soviétique”, “Les belles années de l’armée soviétique”, etc. Ils évaluent le présent par rapport à un passé qu’ils ne retrouveront jamais. Une sorte de “paradis perdu”...
D’une manière générale, les Centre‐Asiatiques, comme beaucoup d’autres ex‐citoyens soviétiques sont passés dʹun système de certitude collective à un système dʹincertitude individualisée : à la société soviétique déterministe a succédé une société probabiliste. Dans les politiques des régimes actuels, qui proclament une période de transition et de réformes économiques où les salariés sont témoins directs et acteurs passifs des changements, la conséquence d’une “confrontation” des deux systèmes touche directement les fonctionnaires, leur manière d’être, de penser et leurs conditions de vie. La protection sociale et le plein emploi qu’assurait l’État soviétique ont disparu, ce qui développe une forte méfiance des populations à l’égard des États actuels en Asie centrale d’où ils cherchent à partir en quête d’une vie meilleure dans un ailleurs.
Ainsi, les personnes ayant connu l’époque soviétique, indépendamment de leur âge, manifestent une grande incertitude quant à leur existence, ce qui les conduit à n’envisager la vie qu’au jour le jour. Cette incertitude est flagrante chez les personnes âgées, gagnées par la crainte obsessionnelle de ce qui pourrait advenir dans leurs pays. Dans une telle situation, où les politiques des gouvernements continuent de creuser cette fracture sociale qui déchire les sociétés centrasiatiques, il paraît difficile d’imaginer que la tendance puisse s’inverser dans un futur proche.

BADALOV, Ulugbek : Twenty Years later : Nostalgia for the Great USSR in Central Asia
Once upon a time, during the era of the Soviet Union, life was easier and happier, people were happy with their living conditions and work ... they gathered in friendship around the famous ideology of communism. This golden age has been transformed today into a story older people want to tell the younger generations who will never know of the ʺsoft Soviet educationʺ (доброе советское воспитание ‐ in Russian). More than twenty years have passed since the collapse of the USSR. And beyond independence, transformations, market economies and privatizations, the period under Soviet rule remains a positive and benevolent image for many former Soviet citizens. This article shows the nostalgia for the Soviet Union period among the people from Central Asia which was part of USSR for more than 75 years.

Macaristan, Dış Politika
17 aralık tarihinde Avrupa Parlamentosu’nda yapılan tartışma sonucunda, Macaristan’ın anayasası ve ekonomik durumu hakkında çok şey öğrenebildik. İlk olarak göze çarpan Batı Avrupalı politikacıların hazırlıksızlığı ve eksik ahlaki duruşudur. Avrupalı politikacıların ağızından Viktor Orbán lafı ustalıkla çıkarttı. Bununla ilgili Olanda milli radyosunun (NOS) Brüssel muhabiri, Chris Ostendorf’un, bu kötü hatıralı tartışmanın sonucunda yaptığı röportajdan aktarmak çok faydalı olacaktır: “Macaristan’ın başbakanı Avrupa Parlamentosu’nda istenmeyen kişidir. Orada az arkadaşı vardı, ona bağırdılar, neredeyse yüzüne tükürdüler”. Röportajın sonunda Ostendorf bunun bir “göstermelik duruşma” gibi olduğuna dikkat çeker.
30 yıldan beri, Avrupa Parlamentosu hakkında yapılan bir röportajda böyle kelimeler hiç duymamıştım. Ostendorf haklıdır: bu görüntü Batı demokrasiye ciddiyetle inananları gerçekten şoke ediyor. Avrupa parlamentocuları yetkinlik, kültürlülük, medeni davranış ve demokratik yöntemlerle seçilen, efendice davranan ve soğukkanlı, ikna edici şekilde konuşan bir başbakana gösterilen saygı bakımından sınıfta kaldılar. Maalesef bu Schumann’ın ve Monnet’nin Avrupası olmaktan çıktı, ama Kohl ile Mitterand’ınki bile değildir. Bu, adi biçimde konuşan ve politika yapan Sovyet stili komiserlerin Avrupasıdır.
Bunlara tanık olduktan sonra, Avrupa Parlamentosu’ndaki kadife koltuklarında oturan Cohn‐Bendit ile arkadaşlarının maşası olmak için, uzaktaki savaş alanlara asker göndermenin acaba ne anlamı var? Bu ahlaki bakımından batan dünyada, bir üye ülkenin başbakanına en asgari saygıyı bile göstermeyen bu insanlara, onların tiyatro piyeslerinin oynamalarına yardım etmek için acaba uzaktaki savaş alanında Macar kanının akıtılmasının anlamı var mı?
Bu “tartışma” Macaristan için faydalı olabilir, çünkü bu ülke böylece 21. yüzyılın ve yeni dünya düzeninin sunduğu imkanlardan yararlanabilir. Multivektöriel denilen, çok yönlü politikayı uygulamanın zamanı geldi. Artık tek yönlü Euro‐Atlantik dış politika sürdüremeyiz, çünkü bu bizim için zararlıdır. Bu ibreti Strassbourg’daki o “tartışma”nın sonucunda aldık. Dış politikanın aynı zamanda gerçekçi bir politika olması gerektiğini anlıyorum, ama dış ilişkileri karşılıklı saygı, onur ve sevgisiz yürütmek mümkün değildir.
Bugün Avrupa Birliği artık bir iflas masasıdır. Onun girdiği bunalım sadece derin, çözümsüz mali bir kriz değil, aynı zamanda daha da derin bir ahlaki buhrandır, ve bunu 50’nci yıllarının Stalinist davalarına benzeyen Strassbourg’daki göstermelik duruşma en iyi biçimde gösterdi.
Avrupa’nın çöküşü geri döndürülemez, bu krizden çıkacağına inananlar ham hayallerle avunurlar. Almanların dış politikaları da şunu gösteriyor ki Avrupa Birliği artık onlar için hiç bir şey ifade etmiyor. Bu birlik artık “kimsenin birliği”dir, sahibi yoktur, ve bir mali, ideolojik savaş alanına döndü. Eğer çıkmak mümkün değilse, o zaman köstek olarak kalalım içinde, İngilizlerin yaptığı gibi.

Avrupa henüz 20 yüzyıldadır, halbuki 21 yüzyıl çoktan başlamıştı. Bu yüzyılda şüphesiz ki Batı, Dünya üzerindeki hakimiyetini kaybedecektir. Belki de bunun bir göstergesi solcu ve liberal koalisyonunun mali manipülasiyonlarını küçücük Macaristan’a bile zorla kabul ettiremedikleridir. Şunu da öğrendik ki, yeniden doğmuş olan Macaristan’ın bu savaşta arkadaşları da vardır. Polonya Macaristan için bütün yardımını gösterdi. Polonyalı Donald Tusk, Avrupa’nın şimdilik tek muhakeme kabiliyeti olan başbakanıdır. Bundan anlaşılır ki Polonyalı‐Macar ittifakını güçlendirmek lazım, çünkü bu Macaristan’ın NATO politikasında da önemli bir unsurdur. Geçen yıl Çin ile yapılan anlaşma da yeni multivektöriel dış politikayı başlatmak için önemli bir adımdır, ancak yine de yeterli değildir. Bugünkü, 21. yüzyıldaki küresel değişimler, istifade edilecek birçok önemli imkan sunarlar. Macaristan’ın özgürce hareket etmesi, ve küresel politika çapında sesini duyurması için çok imkan vardır. 1848‐1849 ve 1956’daki devrimlerinin olumsuz hatıralarına rağmen, Rusya ile anlaşmak lazım. Macaristan‐Polonya ittifakı da bunda bize yardımcı olabilir. Vladimir Putin Rusya başkanı seçildiği halde, bu konuda büyük ilerlemeler kaydedilebilir. Ama görüşmeleri eski, uşaklar gibi davranan Moskovitlerle değil, genç diplomatlarla yürütmek lazım. Bunun dışında Macaristan’ın Türk dünyası ile de ilişkiler kurması gerek. Türk dünyası bizi saygı ile seviyor, ama akraba olarak da bilir bizi. Türkiye, Azerbeycan, Kırgıstan, Kazakstan gibi ülkeler, gelecek on yıllarda ekonomik ve ahlaki bakımdan da dünyanın önemli ögeleri haline gelecekler.
Evet 21. yüzyıl başladı artık. Milli bir anayasa çıkarttıktan, yurt dışındaki Macarları ile de ilişkisini de düzelttikten sonra, Macaristan’ın artık dünya çapında da aktif olması, ve bunun ona sunduğu imkanları kullanması lazım.
MARÁCZ, László : Hungary, Foreign Policy
The political situation has been discussed in the European of Parliament on January 20, 2012. The Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has participated in the EP debate as well. The debate was actually a shameful show trial and reminded observers of the practice of Stalinism. The debate has demonstrated that Europe is morally bankrupt. The 21th century has started but Europe is stuck in the 20th century. For Hungary, however, a number of new opportunities will arise outside Europe. The connections with related nations in the Turkic world are going to play an important role with the repositioning of Hungary in the global arena.

BADALOV, Ulugbek
National Identity Claiming on the Internet by Kyrgyz Expatriates
Previously, the immigrant was seen as an individual who left his home by breaking links with his or her family, social group, and environment. His departure represented a radical rupture with the country of origin where he hoped always to return once installed in the host country. Today, with the gradual evolution of means of transportation and ICT (Information and communication technologies), this conception of the phenomenon has changed its face. We observe thus, in place of the uprooted migrant, a connected migrant able to maintain, despite the physical and geographical distance, relations of proximity with his territory of origin (Diminescu, Dana. 2005).
These new digital technologies (computer connected to Internet with different forms of communications: Mail, Messenger, Skype, Blogs, Facebook, discussion boards and mobile phone) are the continuation of increased communications known as classical (postal mail, messages or audiovisual tapes, etc.). The latter were used by the immigrants of the past to maintain links with their country of origin, allowing migrants to stay connected and reachable anywhere, at any time, with their family at home or emigrated elsewhere. It is easier today for a migrant to obtain daily news of close ones thanks to this “radical change of technologies” or, to use the more fashionable term “rupture” with the past, in which he was seen as an uprooted individual. Despite the geographical distance, the current migrant, between here and there, uses means of ICT as an individual (e‐mail or private page on a social network) or as part of a collective (associations, group of discussions, etc.).
The Internet is perceived as the greatest invention of the millennium, a major innovation comparable to those of printing and telephone. Everything seems possible in cyberspace, the best and the worst. The computer connected to networks via the Internet offers more and more new means of communication at the global level. These means produce new forms of individual and collective links and socio‐cultural regroupings in constant progress and influence all of society at economic, political, cultural and relational levels. Countless websites and personal pages, very diversified in their characteristics and their purposes, continue to stand out with the ability to communicate through the Internet. All cultures and all national or nationalistic ethnic communities, associative and individual representations gather around the “digital network” to express or to claim their collective interest and identity. All of these means of communication are collected under the generic term “social networking”, a new field of research for geography, sociology, anthropology and the sciences of information and communication. And this progressive rise of the Internet arouses in researchers a new attention to the migrant populations who knit complex links with the ICT. It is true today that Google searches of the term “ Diaspora” give numerous results such as : “Chinese Diaspora”, “African Diaspora”, and “Jewish Diaspora”, etc., all claiming “diasporic identity” through cyberspace. The ownership of the Internet by the general public, which allows people to claim their culture, religion and national identity, attracts the interest of international researchers from different disciplines to study the use of new technologies by them. Many studies already argue that large websites created by or for immigrant populations can serve as an input for and an instrument of national

propaganda and identity without any worry if one’s words are heard. As with other migrants, Kyrgyz expatriates in Europe that I studied in my PhD thesis have also created a discussion group on a Russianspeaking website where members of the community are involved on various topics. We cannot, however, describe this group as a Kyrgyz Diaspora due to the recent migration of its members, whose number is numerically not large (i.e., the group does not correspond to essential elements of Diaspora, with factors of powerful uprooting, time factors, etc.).
First, let’s study the website Odnoklassniki, (http://www.odnoklassniki.ru/) one of the largest “social network sites” in the world, created in March 2006 in Russia by an engineer, Polkov Albert (born in September 25, 1975, now living in London). Meaning “Friends of school” in Russian, Odnoklassniki is equivalent in its original content to “Classmates” in the Unites States or “Friends of the past” in France. Its objective: to allow users to find old friends from school or university. The website counts today over 45,000000 members, grouped by school or university, place of birth or current residence, or interests, with more than 10 million visitors per day worldwide. In the early years of its existence, the network was free, with services that allowed its members to create personal pages, post photos, chat and play online. In August 2010, the registration has become paying, the candidate wishing to register has to send a SMS to the server which in turn assigns a secret code to create a personal page (with date and place of birth, current residence, frequented schools, interests, photos, friends list and discussion groups) via phone operators from place of residence. Despite this financial barrier, the number of members is increasing day by day and expanding its audience beyond the post‐Soviet borders.
If, initially, the site was intended solely for classmates or friends from university, today it attracts many people who sign up for various reasons, but essentially to meet or to find themselves. Thus, Kyrgyz expatriates that I studied created their own discussion groups in order to maintain links with their country of origin or compatriots who have moved elsewhere around the world. One of them my research focused on was established on 1 May 2008 by a Kyrgyz woman, 25 years old (its founder and moderator). She had studied for two years in France before returning to Bishkek, where she works today in the private sector. She managed the group alone for about a year (until mid 2009), when another Kyrgyz expatriate (man in his 30s) in Turkey joined her as a second moderator. Since then, they are only two: one at home and another abroad. Their function is to recruit members, to modify or close a discussion, to sanction a participant, etc. As “guardians “ of the quality of exchanges, they continuously monitor the site by removing the “rebels”, erasing insulting or defamatory messages and photos not corresponding to the charter of group.
The group is called “Unity of all Kyrgyz” (Кыргызстанцы в единстве – in Russian). According to the moderators, it is open to all people born in Kyrgyzstan: “All born In Kyrgyzstan, working for the good of our homeland. Join us! Forward Kyrgyzstan!”. In regard becoming a member, a candidate must submit his personal page with information on his place of birth, current residence and frequented schools that moderators review before accepting him.

Logo of the group
As the title indicates, ʺUnity of all Kyrgyzstan,ʺ the groupʹs objective is to gather all Kyrgyz migrants or ones returning home after an experience abroad. That’s why there are members living in Russia, the United States, China, Turkey, etc. This allows a comparative view on their feelings vis‐à‐vis the discussions topics and based on their experiences in different host societies, each with its own culture. For participants, the discussion groups include a number of pages on the news of the country and the members’ reactions to its political, economic and social situations. It is a kind of ʺvirtual freedomʺ space or ʺpublic arenaʺ (Tarby, Fabien. 2009) allowing members to converse freely online about various topics.
In January 2012, the group had 2442 members, 33 personal photo albums and 115 topics of discussion on various topics. Over 40% of participants are abroad for various reasons: studies, jobs, political refuge or illegal immigration (the latter reason is never mentioned in the chat rooms and can be established only when the confidence is established via personal e‐mail messages outside the group). While some are still in the country but would like to move abroad, others are already back after some experiences in different countries. Members, who wish to move, sign up in order to obtain information from other expatriates. The discussion group of has several sections on migration topics (the trip, experiences, administrative formalities, the foreign reality etc.) thus allowing members to collect answers to various questions.
In terms of site structure, the photographic albums posted by members have photographs of towns and villages of birth, place of current residence, friends, school and university, holidays and parties held abroad, events taking place in Kyrgyzstan, etc. The topics of discussion are varied: from the meaning of a simple word in the national language to “conflicting” political or cultural problems.

about their experiences abroad and information for new candidates wishing to emigrate, to study or to work abroad, mutual support in migration, etc. First of all, as explained by its moderators, the primary objective of the group is to gather all Kyrgyz expatriates from around the world, to call them to patriotism and to promote the ʺnational identityʺ in all its cultural, traditional, and religious aspects through the interactions on the Internet. These forums of discussion seem to be the living place of the group from which emerge a common knowledge and collective memory as a privileged expression of Kyrgyzstan from Kyrgyzstan and from abroad. The space remains for some (expatiates) a “second life” of the society of origin found again in the virtual and an opportunity for others (candidates for migration) to imagine this better world “elsewhere”. To study the interactions and social relationships that develop in this group, I propose to expose here two discussion forums on politics, culture and migration. These seem relevant to understanding how Kyrgyz expatriates perceive the meeting of their endogenous social norms with the exogenous norms of host society. They are entitled “Women, marriage, divorce in Kyrgyz society” and “My country, my homeland and your future”, and are more important in the number of participants that in their content.
The first forum, ʺWomen, Marriage and Society in Kyrgyzstanʺ was launched February 10, 2009 by the moderator himself living in Turkey. It lasted until July 21, 2009 with over 40 participants from around the world including five living in France. The objective of the forum was to share views on these subjects and to correlate with observations made in the host country. The author of this forum launched the discussion by questioning the causes of critical issues surrounding these subjects in today’s Kyrgyz society. He started by citing the example of divorced women, migrant in Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey where they live in prostitution, some being with their children while others prefer to leave them in the home country. He accused them of giving a bad image of the ʺKyrgyz womanʺ, who would normally respect the ʺsacred valuesʺ of his culture. These examples resulted in the rise of a strong reaction among the group’s members. Many participants in the forum agree that these problems were nonexistent during the Soviet period and emerged and increased in Kyrgyzstan since independence. They blame then the collapse of the Soviet Union, open borders and globalization, all of which have affected their society in all areas. They also believe that with unemployment and the disastrous economic situation of Kyrgyzstan, most of the population has reached the limits of its patience and ha begun looking for a thoughtless life, much to the detriment of “human valuesʺ specific to the Kyrgyz people for whom the family and parents are top priorities in life. Men, the majority on this forum, consider that the question concerns only the woman who envies her neighbor working abroad and has brought back a lot of money every six months. They consider that the concept of family is losing its value and that priority is now given to all that is material. They then remember the image and role of women in Kyrgyz society during Soviet era, when they were graduating with degrees in higher education, and for whom family, work and contribution to the development of the country were the meaning of life. Soviet society, they say, harmonized the Eastern traditions, namely Kyrgyz (importance of family, respect for elders, etc.) with the ʺvaluesʺ of communism (education, work, equal rights, etc.). For some time, the forum lacked womenʹs responses to those comments, until certain women, married to foreigners residing in Europe, Australia and the U.S., decided to intervene. These, almost all from the Soviet generation, recount their personal experiences while living in Kyrgyzstan and in the host country. They argue that unemployment and poverty remain the major source of problems shaking the Kyrgyz society. In criticizing the traditions now back in full force in society in Kyrgyzstan, they then defend the women fleeing family and social pressures, taking a

decidedly feminist position, and call the other women to emancipation. To support their new convictions, they cite examples from the host societies and encourage the comparison with examples from the society of origin. In host societies, they say, the woman is a fully recognized member of society. With freedom of choice, she is equal to men in all areas and enjoys the protection of the State supports, even in cases of divorce, prostitution or drug use, thanks to social assistance or through associations. While in Kyrgyzstan, as in other countries in the Central Asian region, a woman – they complain on the forum ‐ remains the subject of man and is repudiated by her family and rejected by society if her marriage, often arranged, ends in divorce. They start to condemn the customs that, they believe, have no place in todayʹs society that must live in the context of globalization. ʺCastrate men kidnapping their girlfriends!” Go ahead, support individualism!” they launch on the forum. They conclude their discussion by explaining the shame they feel abroad when their country is stigmatized and considered a backward civilization because of the persistence of ancient traditions and ancestral customs.
These words provoked strong reactions from other group members (men or women) who find them unacceptable to the Kyrgyz culture. They begin by dissecting the term ʺemancipation,ʺ which they believe is a purely Western concept in opposition to their own mentality (биздин менталитет – in Kyrgyz language). They also express the idea that it is impossible to apply social norms and the way of life of others in Kyrgyzstan, like the transporting of ʺWestern democracyʺ into many countries, for reasons of cultural difference (Badalov, Ulugbek. 2011). To support their words, they cite the example of ʺcolor revolutionsʺ through which the West has tried to confront the post‐Soviet world in which Russia still has a special place that it will not yield easily to other powers. Here we see a contradiction in the vision of the other foreign participants among the group to which Russia is still another relative. This is almost the general opinion, going as it does in the same direction as that of the state of Kyrgyzstan, which considers that their country depends always on Russia in all areas. As the central country of the former Soviet Union, Russia is considered by the group as ʺbig brotherʺ whose ideology and social norms are acceptable and applicable in Kyrgyz society, as was the case during the communist regime that ruled for over 75 years. The members do not accuse Russia of having emancipated Kyrgyz women; on the contrary, they thank Communists for giving them one of the best educations in the world. The West, by contrast, is presented as a ʺtraitorʺ, an enemy of long standing influencing Kyrgyz society with its supposedly universal standards that hide in reality purely economic and political interests. The United States and some European countries like France, Germany and Great Britain are the targets in this collective complaint for promulgating their ʺWestern valuesʺ that go against public morality in many societies in the world. In the dialogue, emancipation is criticized as a concept unique to Western lifestyle and evidently inadequate to that of Kyrgyz women.
Many men then start to advise feminist groups to remain faithful to traditions of native culture that could serve them at any time, as shown by this response: ʺYou talk about emancipation of women in the West, where they participate in active life as well as men. From this point of view, things are like in Kyrgyzstan, women in Kyrgyzstan have an educational level higher than in some Third World countries. The difference is that our women are oriental, and western cultures are not comparable with ours. Therefore, it is not necessary to apply to our people the ʺvaluesʺ of others to survive in globalization; it would be as if we would disguise ourselves with the dress of the neighbor. Why deny one’s culture of origin, why be ashamed to face others? Do you think Japanese women expatriates in Europe as you opt

for the culture of the host society? Never, they remain loyal to the Japanese lifestyle and culture of their country and, even in the way of arranging their hair. Why should our women still in the country, not to mention those who have emigrated, accept such a Western cultural concept? Why do you stand on this concept, tell us about other values of the West such as individualism. A concept that is conceived as the basic unit of society in those countries where the parents die in the absence of their children in isolated houses! You know well that you can not apply individualism in Kyrgyzstan; itʹs like your famous emancipation. Let’s remain as we are! ʺ
These worlds are of course embellished and accompanied by photos posted on the forum that show the ʺrealʺ women of Kyrgyzstan in traditional dress. A kind of appeal addressed to respect traditions and identity that everyone must perpetuate and practice abroad. The forum went out with the final unanimous conclusion of all saying that Kyrgyz women are the most beautiful in all Central Asia.
The following discussion entitled, ʺMy country, my country and your future,ʺ was launched by a Kyrgyz migrant (man, 43 years old), living in Russia today. Graduated from Medicine University of Moscow, he is considered as the best patriot of the group. The topics discussed between the members are on the political and economic situation of Kyrgyzstan and its future. This forum seems the most interesting because opinions of members are often expressed in a confrontational mode, but still under the required supervision of the moderators.
Indeed, the dialogue that opposes the two groups might be called anti‐government versus progovernment. If some do not hesitate to criticize the current Prime Minister, the opinion of others composing the major part of the group is more subjective. Participants can release their emotions by expressing them in a “neutral place”, considering that they have never met and never will perhaps. Thus, in this ʺpublic arenaʺ some become ʺtraitorsʺ because of their opinions contrary to the ʺHomeland,ʺ while others gain the status of ʺpatriot heroʺ for their patriotic position. Many of these, students in Europe or the United States, show not only their nationalistic feelings, but also they publish their personal photos adorned with national symbols of Kyrgyzstan as the ʺwarm heartʺ of a love sent to the motherland from abroad.
The general opinion of the two parties on the situation of the country is generally negative and they explain that economics and politics in Kyrgyzstan have been a major reason for their emigration. To discuss the issue, members evoke unemployment, poverty, inequality in society since independence, mentioning that these phenomena did not exist during the Soviet era. Participants who lived during the Soviet period consider that these problems existed under the communist regime, but in other forms. They said that these subjects were politicized and taboo in a society shaped and conditioned not to listen to them. If some members consider the countryʹs current situation as comparable to that of African poor countries, that is “mockeryʺ and ʺsadnessʺ for Soviets; others are surprised and contest this view, saying that the average level of education and training of Kyrgyzstan is much higher than that of Africans. Misery, in their eyes, is even less understandable. Discussions then take a form of conflict between members who want to talk about the current situation of the country and not its past when the Soviet regime offered everyone a free and high education, which is not the case currently in Kyrgyzstan. If the discussions grow acrimonious, if the comments become offensive, the moderators intervene to calm the game down, mentioning the charter of the forum which requires a minimum of courtesy and restraint.

In regard to the future of Kyrgyzstan, the anti‐government views cause many reactions. Considered as the pessimists of the group, they feel that their country will soon disappear from the map of world. Coveted by Russia, China and the United States for its strategic and geopolitical role in the region and not for its natural resources as are its neighbors, Kyrgyzstan should, they say, choose a good single partner to ensure its future and its sustainability, and quickly. They believe that if things continue to go in the same direction, the Kyrgyz will have a society without ʺhuman valuesʺ. Only money and pecuniary interests will exist. They note that this is already often the case and that they feel as guilty as westerners who are only interested in profit.
The ʺpatriotsʺ of the group are not so sure and suggest imagining Kyrgyzstan in the place of Israel, as a country where the ideologies of these great powers could freely confront, demonstrating a profound ignorance of politics in the Middle East. These ʺoptimistsʺ see Kyrgyzstan in the future as a country shining with joy, glorious words similar to those pronounced by the authorities of the country. First, they consider the current situation of Kyrgyzstan as a transitional period that each state had to undergo during its history: when they refer to Europe or the United States, they note that these countries have achieved their current development across difficult times and in several stages. They add that the country needs its children to ensure future success. They call other members of the group to join them to help the country and contribute to its development with their experiences acquired abroad. As part of their ʺactivismʺ on the Internet, beyond their nationalist opinions expressed on forums, they principally mobilize on the eve of the presidential elections or referendums in their country, Kyrgyzstan. They call other members to vote for a particular candidate or for a ʺreal partyʺ selected according to their personal views. For example, in the last presidential elections in Kyrgyzstan, the moderators published information on their favorite candidates and created special forums on the subject by inviting compatriots to vote for them. Indeed these ʺpatriotsʺ do not work for a party or a candidate and, if they choose to present their program on the forum, they just consider them better than other parties or candidates. This mode of operation implements a kind of ʺvirtual democracyʺ offered by the ʺfantasy worldʺ‐Internet to the Kyrgyz activist expatriate whose actions cannot be applied effectively on the ground. In fact, the conflict between the two parties (anti‐ and pro‐government) results in a reconciliation through a game of ʺimaginary negotiationʺ for the future of the country of origin around a common idea, the love of country.
This ʺnationalist fantasyʺ to return one day to Ate‐maken (the fatherland in Kyrgyz), which migrants hope to realize one day and to contribute to its eventual development, almost always is accompanied by a real nostalgia tinged with melancholy. Nostalgia was first studied in psychology as ʺhomesicknessʺ (nostos ‐ return and algos ‐ sadness, pain in Greek). And the concept has been incorporated into the image of the emigrant often dreaming memories of childhood places where he constantly hopes one day to return. Today, other social science disciplines are interested in its various dimensions and define it as a desire to return to a past. It is characterized by a sense of loss of objects of a time conceived as ideal and that the individual feels continuously and almost obsessively. For Kyrgyz expatriates of this forum, this nostalgic feeling is expressed through symbolic cultural markers: traditional houses inhabited during childhood, schools, national dress, food, etc. If, in general, nostalgia refers to the past and things that don’t exist anymore in the present of an individual, the study of discussions of the group is in accordance with the analysis of this significance and underlines the sense of a ʺlackʺ of things they cannot find in the host societies. They express it in discussion forums entitled ʺNostalgia for the homeland,ʺ ʺMy childhood in

the USSRʺ, ʺCinema, music, food made in Kyrgyzstanʺ, ʺKyrgyz mentality ‐ more human contextʺ, etc. Participants involve their own feelings in the migratory context with photos. Members there share their personal ʺmelancholicʺ experiences and consider their current situation unsatisfying by returning to the imagination of the past where everything seemed better than today: ʺEducation was better at the time of the USSRʺ, ʺI cry when I listen to our national music,ʺ etc. They evaluate the present with the past that they never find as a kind of ʺLost Paradiseʺ ... This nostalgic feeling for the coveted past and such a distant today differs for each generation. For the ʺgeneration of the Soviet eraʺ, it is mainly due to the time of the Soviet Union where they have lived their childhood in a ʺsoft education.ʺ While for the generation of the ʺtransition or independenceʺ, it is rather accompanied by a purely nationalist sentiment found through phrases such as ʺKyrgyzstan is the best land,ʺ ʺOur customs are the bestʺ, etc.
Through this group discussion of Kyrgyz expatriates in different parts of the world, I try to show that the Internet remains a place for the imaginary claims and identity assertion of the actors. In sum, this population, in a context of migration, found in the Internet a means to claim and to assert their identity. The identification of topics in the group constitutes a factor of (re) production of this vocation and of the collective expression of the willingness of members to defend their aspirations and their common interests around the imaginary love of the ʺmotherlandʺ. This space that could be called ʺvirtual freedom”, generated by this technology where group members meet in a distant relationship characterized by the lack of territory, contributes to the creation of collective national imagination. This imaginary situation, exacerbated by migration, is a place of representation of identity where participants seek a symbolic rapprochement, as attested to by the name of the group: ʺUnity of all Kyrgyz.ʺ The internet echoes this collective expression and offers a showcase characterized by the different ways to ʺfeel Kirghizʺ abroad. The study of the discussion forums shows that through an imaginary world on the Internet, expatriates have not only an opportunity to give continuity to their project of identity but also the opportunity to build the desired identity, a national identity claimed at a distance, characterized by a country, nation, culture, language and even a national dish, as we have seen in the different interactions.

Once Upon a Time in Anatolia
Once Upon a Time in Anatolia is an award winning motion picture directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan, co‐written by Ercan Kesal and Ebru Ceylan. The film was awarded with the Grand Prix at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. It has also been selected as Turkeyʹs nominee to the 84th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film.
Once Upon a Time in Anatolia is an impressive drama and police procedural that also serves to highlight the complexities of human character. Its story unfolds slowly and obliquely.
What we are watching is a criminal investigation around the apparent murder of a local civilian. Several police officers, a public prosecutor, a doctor and a couple of diggers, under the direction of a pair of confessed murderers, are in search of a buried body into the night‐shrouded Anatolian steppes. The cars carrying the killers, police officers and the prosecutor are searching at the site of the murder. It is night and the killers canʹt remember where they committed the crime and buried the body. They stop at several places and we witness the most dramatic and powerful part of the movie: the verbal interplay between the characters. The search continues until dawn. The first suspect has already signed a confession, but is having trouble remembering where the body was buried because he was drunk at the time. The second suspect seems incapable of remembering anything. Though all of them know the local countryside, it now looks to them completely uniform; one well for livestock looks like another, and what does the first suspect mean by a ʺround treeʺ? The headlights blaze through the landscape as they wind around the tiny roads. Kenan (first killer) is looking for a place with a field, a fountain, and a round tree.
Nuri Bilge Ceylan provides no motive or explanation for this seemingly random killing, instead he prefers to focus on the interaction between the assisting Doctor Cemal, Prosecutor Nusret, Commissar Naci and the other men. We are witnessing the indifferent chatter of the characters, focusing on their daily, personal and irrelevant matters. Ceylan draws a subtle sketch of the society as these men pass their time with random conversation including women, love, marriage, death, sick children, smoking and health matters. And through the individual stories of this group of men, we get a deeper understanding of the characters and their particular problems. The night is filled with the barks of dogs. A little story is told about a very beautiful woman who predicted the day of her death and died on schedule. Rain clouds are drawing in front of the moon. Obviously, a storm approaches.
After some time, a local mayor is awakened and offers them tea and food. The mayor has a beautiful daughter. The men feel sad since they think she will not find the life she deserves. The mayor complains that he cannot get funds for a new morgue. The young people all leave the town and move to the cities. When the old people die, the young come home to see them at last, but because of the bad conditions of the old morgue, the bodies start to smell.

The dormant wilderness of the Anatolian Steppes is greatly analogous to the secrets that lay hidden in the hearts of the deeply complicated characters. The intentionally slow pace of the movie adds to the plot, preparing the way for character development.
Once Upon a Time in Anatolia acquaints the viewer with the dark side of human psyche. The absolute beauty contrasting with the pain ‐ which the characters experienced in their lives— robbed their inner peace and beauty and made them brutal.
Each man has his own story. The multi‐layered characters are stuck in the middle of nowhere, waiting desperately for their eventual fate. But on the other hand, someone has been killed. The bureaucratic procedure of a criminal investigation has to be followed. The body is dug up and taken for autopsy at another morgue, in the centre of a village, where the coroner complains about the need for more powerful and new equipment. The doctor, who has just reviewed his past, looks out of the window and sees something that inspires him to give false comments about the autopsy. The prosecutor confesses something about his life, just before the autopsy. Hence, in this final part, we discover how that single night has affected them all.
The film includes long lingering shots that draw attention to the characters themselves. Furthermore, it offers exceptional views on the Anatolian landscape, especially in the night scenes, where only the pale light of the moon and the two headlamps shine.
There are no big actions or big dramatic moments in the film. Rather, it motivates us to watch and rethink our own lives and discover sad truths or mysteries in our personal stories.
One of the most dramatic and fascinating scenes is the one in which the local mayor’s seraphic daughter serves tea to the guests with her pure, charming beauty, creating strong emotions in all the guests. The heavenly shining of her angelic face under the lamp light recalls the beauty of innocence in their minds and they all feel deeply touched. Even Kenan (the killer) begins to cry.
“Life in a small town is like journeying in the middle of the Anatolian steppes: the feeling that ʹsomething new and differentʹ could spring from behind every hill, which look always perfectly similar, with monotonously lingering roads.”1
Once Upon a Time in Anatolia is a very successful combination of crime, suspense, and drama that offers a deep insight into the human psychology and emotions. The movie has a deep understanding of human nature through its clever script, perfect acting and very successful cinematography.
Its outstanding beauty originates in the storyline; the perfect musical and pictorial harmony of the pieces, the deep meaning of the scenes, the perfect and pure dialogues, recalling Chekov and our ordinary lives at the same time, the physical and emotional/spiritual wounds, the darkness we witness through the film and the intriguing obscurities the movie leaves in us at the end.

TAPON, Francis
Poland—More Than Just a Source of Polish Jokes
So there’s these two Polish guys who rent a boat to go fishing in a lake. They catch so many fish that one says to the other, “We’ll gotta come back here tomorrow!”
The other asks, “But how will we remember where this spot is?”
The first guy spray paints an X on the bottom of the boat, and says, “We’ll just look for this X tomorrow!”
The other Polish guy says, “You stupid idiot! How do you know we’ll get the same boat?!”
Unlike the Baltic countries, the typical American has heard of Poland, but besides that, it’s one big mystery. The French, Italians, Spaniards, and British usually don’t know much either, except that Poles are “stealing our jobs.” In my case, all I knew were a bunch of silly Polish jokes. All this is rather embarrassing considering that Poland has 38 million people and is Europe’s ninth biggest country (it’s a bit smaller than New Mexico). We all ought to know a bit more about the land of the Poles. As my train creaked to a stop into Warsaw, Poland’s capital, I wasn’t sure what to expect.
Coming from Belarus, there were two obvious differences. First, people were in a hurry. Capitalism values time more than communism, so things moved quickly. People were walking and talking fast, making me feel like I was going to Warsaw’s Old Town in slow motion. Second, when I arrived in the Old Town, I was overwhelmed by something I hadn’t seen since Helsinki: tourists. It was August 2004, just four months after Poland joined the EU, and EU citizens were taking advantage of the new borderfree area. Unlike many tourists, seeing hordes of tourists doesn’t bother me. When exploring a place, it always feels hypocritical to complain about “all the damn tourists!”
EUROPE’S “OLD BUILDINGS” MYTH
Warsaw’s Old Town is impressive and lovely. The Plac Zamkowy (Castle Square) has intricate details on every building. Adorning their structures are painted facades, carved statues, and a multitude of colors. Everything looks so perfect. Too perfect. It made me suspicious. It all smelled too new. After a bit of investigation, Europe’s biggest scam became clear.
To notice the scam you have to remember that WWII utterly leveled Warsaw. Warsaw got nailed three times during WWII. Germany started WWII on September 1, 1939 by attacking Poland. They took just one week to get within 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Warsaw, and then gave it its first pounding. Five years later, the Armia Krajowa (Polish Home Army) led the Warsaw Uprising, which damaged the city again. Although the Poles initially controlled two‐thirds of the city, the ferocious Nazi response forced the rebels to retreat into the sewers, where the Germans systematically hunted them down. Half of its residents, about 700,000 people, died during WWII, and many of those perished in the final titanic battle between the Red Army and the Germans, who destroyed the remaining buildings out of spite.

Over 85 percent of Warsaw lay in ruins. Looking at the photos of Warsaw in 1945, you might think an atomic bomb had been dropped there.
This leads us to Europe’s biggest scam: its “old towns” aren’t that old. All the “old” buildings in Warsaw are younger than Disneyland! Warsaw’s Old Town didn’t just get a face‐lift, it was rebuilt from scratch, starting with the cornerstone. The “thirteenth‐century” Royal Castle that overlooks the Old Town was rebuilt from the ground up just a few decades ago. What a rip‐off!
Yes, the Poles were meticulous at reproducing the old buildings and they recycled some of the original material, but most of it is brand new. It’s hard to tell nowadays, but just 65 years ago most European cities (except Paris, Prague, Rome, Venice, and a few others) were blown to smithereens. Nevertheless, Europeans have created this myth that they’ve got old buildings. American tourists dutifully stare with their mouths open, believing that they’re looking deep into European history, but what they’re really looking at is something that is younger than many American homes. Meanwhile, Europeans come to America, look at our buildings and sniff, “You Americans have no history.”
When Europeans build phony old buildings, we gush at how beautiful and marvelous they are. Even UNESCO named Warsaw’s Old Town a World Heritage Site. However, when Americans build fake old buildings, we criticize it as kitschy bad taste. Las Vegas has reproduced some of the famous buildings of Venice, Paris, and Rome. (OK, the talking robotic Zeus fountain in the Roman Forum isn’t very authentic, but hey, it’s Vegas.) Vegas’s Venetian hotel, for example, has gigantic paintings that can make you think they were ripped straight off of the Louvre’s walls. Sneak those same paintings into Versailles or the Vatican and few tourists would think that they were out of place. But no, only Europeans are allowed to scam the public into thinking they have old stuff.
In fairness, Warsaw is a fine city. It has Europe’s largest square: Parade Square. The capital is clean and attractive. Nevertheless, the “historical buildings” scam bothered me. I posed for a few cheesy photos next to Warsaw’s newest‐old‐looking buildings while flashing my phony American smile. And then I stormed out of Warsaw in disgust faster than a retreating German.
One of the few places to see some authentically old Polish buildings is in Poland’s most enchanting city: Kraków. Kraków is the crown jewel of the Małopolska region. Małopolska literally means “Lesser Poland,” but most tourists consider it the greatest part of Poland. Like Warsaw, Kraków lies on the Wisła (Vistula) River. Until 1596, Kraków was Poland’s capital. Today, it’s Poland’s intellectual capital, being home to Uniwersytet Jagielloński. Founded in 1364, it’s Eastern Europe’s second‐oldest university (the Czech Republic’s Charles University is older). WWII hardly touched Kraków’s marvelous buildings. Its Wawel Cathedral and Castle, soaring over the Old Town, beckons you to visit them. In the Old Town’s core is the immense Rynek Główny (Main Market Square), which is Europe’s largest medieval square. At the square’s epicenter is the Cloth Hall, which is doesn’t sell cloth, but rather souvenirs. Encircling the square is the marvelous St. Mary’s Church and the fifteenth‐century Town Hall Tower. It’s fun to lose yourself in the various side streets, and it’s even more fun to just let yourself fall in love with Kraków and its truly old buildings.

WIELICZKA SALT MINE
Head 15 kilometers southeast of Kraków and you’ll run into the Wieliczka (vyeh‐leech‐kah) Salt Mine. This UNESCO site is one of Eastern Europe’s most original places. It began 900 years ago when Poles tunneled into the earth to extract salt. Over time, bored miners carved religious altars and statues for fun. Eventually, they became more creative, making whimsical gnomes and hardy dwarfs who seem to lead you into the underworld. It’s an out‐of‐this‐world experience.
For two hours, you can explore a subterranean world of labyrinthine passages, giant caverns, and underground lakes. An eerie light and its mysterious echoing chambers make it a fantasy lover’s dream. Haunting figures stare at you in the semi‐darkness. What’s remarkable is that everything you see is made all out of salt! Lick things to confirm.
The most unforgettable room is the Chapel of Saint Kinga. The Poles started excavating this salt‐filled room in 1895. More than 30 years later (and 20,000 tons of salt), the Poles finished and ended with a vast cavern. Dangling from its 12‐meter‐high (40 ft) ceiling is an ornate salt chandelier, whose light casts a magical glow on all the religious artifacts. All the richly ornamented sculptures are made of crystalline salt. One well‐traveled eighteenth‐century Frenchman observed that Krakow’s Wieliczka Salt Mine was no less magnificent than Egypt’s pyramids. But what the hell do the French know anyway? See it for yourself.
From utter whimsy and fun, I headed to the most infamous, depressing place in the world: Oświęcim. If Oświęcim (Osh‐fyen‐cheem) doesn’t ring a bell, perhaps its German name will: Auschwitz.
THE ULTIMATE HUMAN DEATH FACTORY
Hitler had a problem. He believed Europe, especially Eastern Europe, had too many untermenschen (sub‐humans). The untermenschen weren’t just Jews, but were also Slavs and Roma (gypsies). Given that most Eastern Europeans were either Slavs, Roma, or Jews, this meant that Hitler had a really big problem. For example, when Hitler took over Germany, it had about 500,000 Jews, while Poland had nearly three million. He wondered what to do with them. Fortunately, about half of them fled abroad. Hitler resolved to put the remaining Jews in ghettos, which acted as a type of prison. However, once the war got started, managing these ghettos became a nuisance. Hitler toyed with the idea of sending the Jews to Madagascar. Imagine if he had done that: assuming that some would have stayed there after the war, today there would be perhaps a million Jews living side by side with the Africans of Madagascar. However, because Germany didn’t have control of the sea passage to Madagascar, he abandoned that idea.
Instead, by the end of 1941, Hitler decided to solve the “Jewish question” with the Endlösung (The Final Solution). To do this, he established the Einsatzgruppe, a security police in charge of exterminating “sub‐humans” in the occupied territories. Leading the way would be Hitler’s Schützstaffel, an elite arm of the Nazi Party, which cruelly punished any resistance; the Schützstaffel became known as the SS. In the end, the SS and the Einsatzgruppe managed to find and kill almost all of Poland’s three million Jews.

Today, even after two generations of reproducing, Poland has only about 20,000 Jews. The story of how the Nazis committed this genocide is best told in Auschwitz.
Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities. — Voltaire, 1759
Germans are über‐efficient. This is great when they’re making cars, dishwashers, and beer, but not so good when they’re killing Jews. The Auschwitz complex was the most horrible concentration camp the Nazis ever made. German efficiency comes out in this ghastly killing machine. A train‐load of tightly packed Jews (and other victims) pulled directly into the Auschwitz camp. The Nazis quickly selected the fittest 25 percent to work to death for 11 hours a day on 1,500 calories. The average man lasted about three months before dying from starvation, exposure, or weakness.
Meanwhile, the weakest 75 percent (including all the elderly, women, and children) were immediately executed. Firing squads were too slow and consumed valuable ammunition. The efficient Germans devised a faster way to kill them. Victims were led to a chamber, told to undress, remove all jewelry, shave, and take a shower for disinfection. The chambers had fake shower fixtures. The Nazis locked the doors and pumped in gas to exterminate 2,000 Jews in a few minutes. In most concentration camps, that gas was carbon monoxide. At Auschwitz, however, the Germans used the lethal pesticide agent Zyklon‐B. Then, as if it were a Mercedes Benz assembly line, an electric lift would raise the entire chamber to a vast crematorium.
While the 2,000 bodies were being cremated, the Nazis would process their belongings. Clothes, eyeglasses, shoes, suitcases, and even hair would all be used towards the Nazi war effort. Jewish men would have to quickly clean out the grizzly remains of their fellow cremated Jews, while the Nazis would bring in the next batch of 2,000 victims. On September 11, 2001, about 3,000 innocent Americans died. Imagine September 11 happening several times per day. Then imagine waking up the next day and having September 11 repeat again, and again, and again.
It is hard to grasp the sheer size of the Auschwitz complex. Today, most visitors spend their time in the sprawling Auschwitz I, but the biggest death factory was Auschwitz II, just three kilometers away. The Nazis called it Birkenau and it’s simply enormous. Imagine a small city, with over 300 prison barracks, capable of holding up to 200,000 inmates at a time. Its four gas chambers (capable of holding 2,000 persons each) were constantly busy. The Germans murdered hundreds of thousands of Roma and up to a million Jews in Auschwitz alone. Monowitz, a few kilometers to the west, also processed innocents. When these three death factories were in operation, they extinguished 1.5 million souls (about 90 percent were Jews). The Germans were expanding the dead camps when the Red Army finally arrived.
It’s hard enough to imagine the Germans killing 5.7 million Jews, but the Nazis also killed nearly nine million non‐Jews in an equally cruel and systematic way. Germans murdered three million non‐Jewish Poles, one million Serbs, hundreds of thousands of Roma, hundreds of thousands of slave laborers, and over 100,000 “mentally ill or physically retarded” Germans and Poles. Moreover, Germans killed up to four million Soviet prisoners of war, some in Auschwitz, but many locked in field camps without medical care or food. In sum, Germany murdered nearly 15 million people in their camps.1

The Nazi concentration camps changed Poland’s demographics. For centuries, Poland had been a melting pot of ethnicities. Germans, Jews, Roma, Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Poles all lived together. After WWII, Germans who had been living for generations in Poland fled to Germany to avoid violent Polish retributions. Today, ethnic Germans make up less than 0.5 percent of Poland. Similarly, Ukrainians and Belarusians retreated to the USSR. As a result, today Poland is homogeneous: 97 percent are Polish. It’s obvious on the streets. For instance, before WWII, 30 percent of Kraków was Jewish; today, good luck finding a Jew outside the historical Jewish ghetto. Although Auschwitz is emotionally draining and depressing, it’s a tragic part of human history that we should never forget.
What good fortune for those in power that people do not think. — Adolf Hitler
It was mid‐August 2004 and I would leave Poland and enter Slovakia. I had only five months to see all 25 Eastern European countries and I had spent two months seeing just five. So I had to boogie. Kraków is near Zakopane, which is the gateway to Poland’s magnificent High Tatras mountain range that form a natural border with Slovakia. I wanted to stand on Poland’s tallest mountain, Mt. Rysy, to be 2,500 meters (8,200 ft) above sea level; however, I would climb the High Tatras from the Slovakian side later. Although I regretted rushing through Poland in 2004, I knew I would return five years later. In 2009, I would see other parts of Poland, but more importantly, I would do what I love most about traveling—meeting the locals.
POLAND REVISITED: GDAŃSK
It was February 19, 2009 and I was freezing my ass off. It was 10:00 p.m. in the Gdańsk train station and I was scanning all the bundled people trying to recognize my 24‐year‐old couchsurfing host, Emilia Łoś. I had seen her smiling photo on her couchsurfing profile, but people don’t always look like their photos, especially when they’re wearing 17 layers.
Suddenly, Emilia appeared with a big, warm smile and she gave me a hug. I’m not sure if she hugged me because she felt comfortable with me or because she was also freezing. Despite all her clothes, it was obvious that she was skinny, so it’s probably because she was cold. Emilia exuded simplicity: her clothes were plain, her soft brown eyes had no makeup, and her straight brown hair was short enough to be manageable, yet feminine. She had a gray birthmark on her right cheek that was easy to get accustomed to. Her most obvious feature, however, was her positive spirit. She giggled and bounced around in a pleasant and endearing way. By the time we arrived to her apartment, I had already concluded, “It’s impossible not to love Emilia.”
She shared her Gdańsk apartment with two other students. I would be sleeping in the living room on the couch that converts into a bed. From the moment we met, our interaction felt like I was catching up with a long friend that I hadn’t seen for a few years. Although it was late, we ended up chatting until 2:00 a.m. We hugged each other goodnight, and then I crashed on the couch and fell asleep in seconds.
The next morning, Emilia, who was getting a masters degree in biotechnology, had a lab session in Gdańsk’s Old Town. She suggested we walk there together via a scenic route. She led me across the snow‐filled Góra Gradowa (Hail Mountain), by the Fort Grodzisko, along an old defensive wall that now

has open‐air history exhibits. We climbed up to a hilltop, where we could look down on the Old Town and the famous Gdańsk shipyards.

THE MUSTACHED HERO
I was about 10 years old when I first heard about the Gdańsk shipyards. The news on TV were often reporting about some Polish guy with a bushy mustache leading strikes in the Gdańsk shipyards. The video clips showed protesting Poles carrying a white banner with red scripted letters that said “Solidarność,” which I assumed meant “Solidarity” since the newscaster kept saying that word. I was too young to have any idea what this all meant, but I remember it clearly. I just knew that such protests didn’t normally happen in those backward communist countries, so this mustached man must have had some serious balls.
That mustached man was Lech Wałęsa. He’s an interesting guy. He was born in a poor family in Popowo, Poland in 1943—not one of Poland’s better years. He didn’t like how workers were treated at the Lenin Shipyards of Gdańsk, so he organized several strikes, which didn’t go over too well with the communists. The last time the Poles tried to protest, the communists sprayed them with machine guns, killing dozens and injuring over 1,000. This time, however, they just threw Wałęsa in jail and enforced martial law. Being a good Roman Catholic, Wałęsa had faith that it would soon all work out. He was right: Time Magazine named him “Man of the Year,” he won the Nobel Peace Prize, he overthrew the communists, and he still managed to find the time to father eight children.
What’s remarkable is that he did not receive his 1983 Nobel Prize in person because he feared the Polish government wouldn’t let him back in. That’s right, he preferred to stay in crappy communist Poland than move his family to the free world where he could reap the benefits of his Nobel award. A true patriot. In 1990, the Poles elected him as President. Suddenly, after 20 years of complaining about the system, he had to fix it.
It’s easy to turn an aquarium into a fish soup. — Lech Wałęsa, Poland’s first freely elected postwar President, meant that it’s easy to destroy an economy, but hard to build one.
Unfortunately, Lech Wałęsa was no George Washington. Wałęsa was brilliant at leading the revolution, but he didn’t know how to govern. He liberalized parts of the economy, but he maintained wage controls. That’s like someone telling you to cook a fish soup with one arm tied behind your back. Inflation exploded and Poland’s currency, the złoty, became worthless. Wałęsa’s governing style was chaotic, often sacking political leaders just one year into their job. As a result, when he ran for re‐election in 1995, he lost. When he tried again in the following election (2000), he got one percent of the vote. At least Gdańsk still loves him. In 2004, it renamed its airport the Gdańsk Lech Wałęsa Airport.
EXPLORING GDAŃSK’S OLD TOWN
After admiring the shipyards and the Old Town from above, Emilia shouted with smile, “C’mon! Let’s go!” She joyfully bounded downhill through the deep powdery snow like a deer. I tried to keep up with her. We eventually arrived in the Old Town, stomped the snow off our shoes, and walked under the Golden Gate. Being from San Francisco, it’s clear that Gdańsk’s Golden Gate is a bit different from the Golden Gate I grew up with. Their version is a medieval gate a few meters wide that leads you into the walled city. On the other hand, there’s one thing the two gates have in common: neither is golden.

Emilia suggested visiting the three other city gates: the Green Gate, the Upland Gate, and St. Mary’s Gate. Walking to each one makes you crisscross the town so that you see it all. We agreed to meet under the Golden Gate in two hours when her lab would be over. After Emilia left, I spun 360 degrees to look around. There is no doubt, Gdańsk’s Old Town is simply magical.
Like Warsaw, Gdańsk was bombed into the Stone Age. However, at least they’re honest about it. Right at the Golden Gate’s entrance, there are two large black‐and‐white aerial photographs of Gdańsk in 1945. It looked like a city‐sized elephant sat on the Old Town, flattening it out. It’s nice that they put these two photos right up front—it’s honest. It’s their way of saying, “What you are about to see in the ‘Old Town’ was all built after 1945. Have a nice day.”
I strolled down the wide pedestrian street, arching my neck to see an enormous cathedral stretch to the heavens. Adorable shops and cozy cafés lined the street. One of the most beautiful sites is Neptune’s Fountain. Originally built in 1633, this ornate fountain is surrounded by colorful buildings with paintings and drawings on the exterior of the buildings—every house is a work of art. It’s easy to see how Europeans get snobby: their old towns are far more beautiful than the typical American town. When I eventually reunited with Emilia, I told her, “Wow! You Polish people really know how to make a marvelous and aesthetically pleasing town! It’s absolutely incredible!”
She laughed and said, “Thanks, but we didn’t build it! The Germans built it!”
“Huh? What were they doing way out here?”
Then Emilia explained Gdańsk’s deep German roots. She said that a few times in history Germany stretched across most or all of what is now Northern Poland. Poland often had just a thin corridor to the Baltic Sea, but sometimes it was completely cut off. I had forgotten about the period when the Germans wrapped around the entire Baltic coast, all the way to Tallinn (and built that charming Old Town too, by the way).
Following Gdańsk’s history is like following a yo‐yo. First, the Poles settled around Gdańsk because it’s at the delta of their beloved Vistula River (which flows by Warsaw and Kraków). Then the Teutonic Knights (who were basically Germans) grabbed Gdańsk in 1308 and controlled it for about 150 years, until the Poles grabbed it back. Next, the Prussians (who were also basically Germans) snagged it back in 1793. They made it a special region of Prussia, kind of like a big Tax‐Free store that you see at airports. It became even more special when it became the Free City of Danzig—an autonomous city like the Vatican. And just like Hong Kong become a vast commercial hub thanks to its special status in the twentieth century, Danzig (Gdańsk) flourished during its German period. Then Poland got it back after WWI. Finally, the Nazis (who were, yes, you guessed it, basically Germans) snatched it again, until a bunch of fighting left their masterpiece of a town in a heap of rubble.
After every war someone has to tidy up. — Wislawa Szymborska, Polish poet
Emilia and I walked back to her flat to have a late obiad (lunch). She cooked up a classic Polish dish: gołąbki (cabbage leaves stuffed with rice and minced meat). It was Friday and she would be going to Olsztyn (Ol‐shtin), her hometown, to stay with her parents over the weekend. She wanted to catch the next train, so she could make it in time for kolacja (dinner). She invited me to come along and stay there. I

had planned to stay a night in Poznań, but the chance to stay with a Polish family was irresistible. We packed up our stuff and raced to the train station.
As the train rumbled to Olsztyn, we passed many streams in the flat landscape. Emilia described some of her camping trips at the nearby Great Masurian Lakes, which are the remains of ancient glaciers. Unfortunately, we didn’t have time to go and it was a bit cold anyway. Then suddenly, in the distance, loomed an enormous structure. I said, “Holy shit! What the hell is that thing!?”
“Oh, that’s Malbork Castle,” Emilia said. “It’s the largest Gothic castle in Europe.”
“No kidding. It’s huge! It sure looks dramatic in the sunset.” We passed right next to it. Its monumental towers, high stone walls, long parapets, and wide moat made it a picture‐perfect castle. I half expected to see Gandalf riding his white horse on the ramparts.
“Oh, and the Germans built that too!” Emilia giggled.
I mumbled, “Ah yes . . . those industrious little Germans . . . ”
“And they destroyed it too!” she laughed. She’s basically right, the Teutonic Knights built it over 700 years ago and a Nazi‐Soviet battle blew it to pieces in WWII.
The Łoś family in Olsztyn
We hopped on a bus to Emilia’s parents’ house. When her parents opened the door, they embraced Emilia as if they hadn’t seen her for a year, even though they saw each other last week. Her parents, Janusz and Elżbieta, were exactly like I imagined Polish parents to be: medium‐sized, simple, unpretentious, humble, and generous. I shook their hands and said, “Cześć,” which is a bit too informal of a salutation to use with parents, but they smiled and seemed happy to meet an American who knew one Polish word.
The apartment had three compact bedrooms and everything was simple, yet functional. In one of the bedrooms was Emilia’s 19‐year‐old sister, Paulina, who was hanging out with her friend, Karolina Bróździak. The girls were friendly, but shy when they spoke English, even though they spoke it well. In fact, Karolina also spoke excellent Spanish, but when I started talking with her in Spanish, she turned bright red and giggled nervously. We all laughed and then I left them to join Emilia and her parents at the kitchen table. Since I had to take an early train the next day, Emilia suggested we eat a snack and skip dinner so we could see Olsztyn’s center before it got too late. I agreed, but first I wanted to talk to her parents because I knew they would have some interesting stories.
Elżbieta offered some food to snack on. There was the choice of meat, meat, or meat. Oh, there was some bread and cheese too. If you like heavy, meaty food, Poland is paradise. You can sample such culinary delights such as a żurek (sour soup with eggs and sausage), schab pieczony (roasted pork loin with herbs and prunes), and golonka (pig’s knuckle with horseradish). Elżbieta saw that I was barely picking at the meat, so she opened her fridge, and pulled out jellied herring.
Now don’t think that people who live near the Baltic Sea don’t know what a vegetable is. Although at times it may seem that way, it’s better than before. In 1518, for instance, Poles hardly knew any veggies beyond a beet. Who saved the day? Europe’s culinary maestros: the Italians. After King Sigismund I of

Poland married his second wife, the Italian queen Bona Sforza, she screamed to him, “Bastardo! Voglio la cucina Italiana per favore! Basta with your crappy food!”
The Italian queen imported an army of Italian chefs to Poland, who had to make do with what they could grow in Poland. The Italians introduced many Poles to lettuce, leeks, celery, carrots, and cabbage. Today, Poles call these veggies włoszczyzna, in honor of Włochy, the Polish name for Italy. I asked Elżbieta, “Has Polish food changed much since the communist days?”
She struggled with English and had a nervous look in her eyes when she spoke. She said that home food hadn’t changed much, but restaurants had. The communists nationalized all the restaurants, set the prices at levels well above what the common person could afford, and eventually closed most of them down. The only affordable place to eat out were the lunch rooms or milk bars, which served cheap soups, noodle dishes, and pierogi (dumplings stuffed with mushrooms and cabbage). Today, Poland’s restaurants offer many more choices, and if you look hard enough, you can even find a few establishments that offer something other than meat, pork, and sausage.
Our conversation touched many subjects, but eventually the mother and daughter got up to have their girl‐talk, while Emilia’s dad and I sat behind to talk about manly stuff like wars, history, and politics.
THE POLISH ACCORDION
Poles know European history better than most Europeans. Janusz was no exception. Books covered nearly all the walls of their compact apartment. He pulled out one thick tome, dropped it on the table with a thud, and flipped through the pages until he found a series of maps depicting Poland over the centuries. Over time, all European countries are like accordions, expanding and contracting constantly as they conquer and get conquered. No European country is a wilder accordion than Poland. It helps that Poland is centrally located in Europe and that 95 percent of its lands are as flat as a Polish pancake. This makes it tempting for anyone with an army to roll right through it. And so, many have.
The first to roll into it after the Roman Empire collapsed were the Polanie, a Slavic tribe, which settled in the low plains between the Oder and Vistula rivers. Today, this region is still Poland’s heart and soul. Hundreds of years later, in 966, the Polanie would give up their pagan ways, adopt Christianity, and create a nation called Polska. When the Germans shoved their way into Poland in 1038, Poles moved the capital from Poznań to Kraków. In the 1200s, invaders rolled in from both sides. The Tatars attacked from the south, while Germans squeezed in from the west. Although the Polish accordion contracted, soon it would expand to its greatest size.
The Jagiełłonian Dynasty was the beginning of Poland’s golden age. It led to the Union of Lublin and the birth of the Rzeczpospolita, the Lithuanian‐Polish Commonwealth, which we learned about in the Lithuania chapter. When Poland and Lithuania united in 1569, they moved the capital from Kraków to Warsaw, where they ruled what would become Europe’s largest country, stretching to the Black Sea. Janusz wanted to talk all night about this fabulous period, but I was more interested in how the whole accordion collapsed again.

He grunted, flipped a few pages, and pointed out three maps, each showing the three partitions of Poland, and then told the short story behind each one. By the 1700s, the Lithuanian‐Polish alliance had soured. While Catherine the Great of Russia used covert and overt means to chip away at Poland, the Germanic people worried about her expanding empire. So did the Germans stop Russia by helping the Poles? Not exactly. Instead, Austria and Prussia whispered to Catherine, “Listen Cathy, whaddaya say ‘bout the idea that we each grab a piece of Poland, eh?” Catherine agreed and bribed several Polish politicians to seal the deal. In 1772, a quarter of Poland was doled out to Austria, Prussia, and Russia. That was the first of three partitions.
The next two were ugly. Patriotic Poles worked with Prussians to secure more rights, while Catherine worked with not‐so‐patriotic Poles to undo those rights. You can guess what happened next—war. Prussia abandoned the Poles and occupied western Poland, while Russia held eastern Poland. This was the second partition—Poland was shrinking fast.
Then in 1794, Tadeusz Kościuszko, who fought alongside Americans during the American Revolutionary War, figured he could repeat the same victory in his motherland. Although he started strong, Russia is a lot closer to Poland than Britain is to the United States. And it didn’t help that Prussia and Austria teamed up with Russia to beat the last bit of life out of Poland. Hence, by 1797, Poland suffered its third and final partition—Poland ceased to exist. The accordion had vanished.
POLAND’S PAINFUL REBIRTH
For the next 123 years, Poland’s story is tragically simple: Russia tried to convert Poles into Russians, Germanic people tried to convert Poles into Germans, and Poles tried to resist them all. In 1812, Napoleon gave the Poles a bit of hope when he promised he would reestablish Poland if the Poles would join his crusade against Russia. The Poles enthusiastically joined his doomed campaign and died for nothing.
Alexander I, Russia’s Emperor, tried to play nice and give Poles a bit of wiggle room. However, by 1830, the dissatisfied Poles wanted more and screamed the refrain, “Give me liberty or give me death!” Like Darth Vader, Russia’s Emperor replied, “As you wish,” and gave them death. Russia shredded the Polish constitution, abolished the Polish government, crushed the Polish army, robbed Polish art and literary treasures, repealed their civil liberties, hampered their Roman Catholic Church, and forced them to learn Russian. Meanwhile, on the German side of Poland, things weren’t much better. The Germans twisted Polish arms, screaming into their ear, “You’re going to speak German, you’re going to act German, and you’re going to like it!”
Janusz raised his voice as he recounted this tragic part of Polish history, gesticulating like an Italian who had just spilled his pasta sauce. His exclamations attracted Emilia’s attention—she stuck her head in the room, raised an eyebrow, and gave us a look that said, “Are you boys finished?”
“Just give us two more minutes,” I begged. “And then we’ll go to Olsztyn. I promise.”
Emilia nodded and went away. I turned to her father with my notepad in hand and asked him what happened next. He took a deep breath, looked at his maps, and said softly, “Then it became very ugly.”

He said that although Poland would return to the world map in the twentieth century, that period would be Poland’s darkest hour. After WWI, Poland crawled back on European maps in the shape of a tattered accordion. Much Polish blood had been spilled to fight Russia and win back Vilnius (now the capital of Lithuania) and Lviv (now in Ukraine). At the dawn of WWII, Russia and Germany became the vise that would once again conspire to squeeze Poland’s fragile accordion.
I belong to a nation which over the past centuries has experienced many hardships and reverses. The world reacted with silence or with mere sympathy when Polish frontiers were crossed by invading armies and the sovereign state had to succumb to brutal force. — Lech Wałęsa
After conquering Poland in less than one month, Hitler gave the Poles three choices: be Germanized, be enslaved, or be eradicated. Jews only had the eradication option. Germany wanted to erase everything Polish from this planet. Nazis shut down Polish cabarets, cinemas, theaters, radio, newspapers, and schools. They burned Polish‐language books. They gave Polish intellectuals a one‐way ticket to a concentration camp. They destroyed nearly half of the educational infrastructure and scientific institutions. They fired Polish teachers, both figuratively and literally. As Nazi leader Heinrich Himmler wrote, “The sole purpose of this schooling is to teach them simple arithmetic, nothing above the number 500; how to write one’s name; and the doctrine that it is divine law to obey the Germans. . . . I do not regard a knowledge of reading as desirable.” When asked how Eastern Europeans should be educated, Hitler replied, “Instruction in geography can be restricted to a single sentence: the capital of the Reich is Berlin.”
I married a German. Every night I dress up as Poland and he invades me. — Bette Midler
To be über‐efficient, the Nazis pitted different ethnicities within Poland against each other, hoping that they would kill each other. For example, they forced Jews to destroy the statue of a Polish hero, filmed the act, and then released the video to the public. Later, the Germans burned a Jewish synagogue, filming Polish bystanders, and released the footage with the caption, “The Vengeful Mob!”
When the Nazis tried to put forth a good face, it came out crooked. For example, the only Polish cultural activities that Germany allowed were “primitive” ones that were crude or pornographic. That way they could not only show the world that they were letting Poles express themselves, but they could also “prove” that Poles were untermenschen (sub‐human), who are only capable of producing vile art. They even invited neutral countries to see “Polish” performances that were either vulgar sex acts or deliberately boring. At the end, the Nazi propaganda official would turn to his guest and say, “Zee, zis is Polish culture! Horrible, no? Zis is exactly vat ve are saying: ze Polish people are untermenschen!”
In every tragedy, an element of comedy is preserved. Comedy is just tragedy reversed. — Wislawa Szymborska, Polish poet
Life in the Soviet‐occupied part of Poland was also no fun. Imagine being in the Polish army, sandwiched between Stalin’s Red Army and Hitler’s Nazi Army. Who would you surrender to? Poles chose the Germans, figuring that the Soviets would be even more brutal. Their instincts may have been right. The Soviets deported over one million Poles to Gulag concentration camps in Siberia. In the Katyn Forest near Smolensk, Russia, the Soviets massacred about 22,000 Polish military officers. In 2010, many of Poland’s highest leaders, who were coming to Russia to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the

massacre, perished in a plane crash near the mass grave. The bitter irony of that accident was impossible to ignore.
Like the Nazis, the Soviets also imposed their language on the Poles. When WWII started, many Jews initially fled east (into the Soviet‐occupied zone), but after a few months of Soviet hospitality, they concluded, “Shit, this sucks even more! I’d rather be in the Nazi‐occupied Poland!”
If you lived in Poland in 1939, one in six people you knew were dead just six years later. Indeed, Poland lost over 16 percent of its population during WWII—that’s more than any other nation (Belarus lost 33 percent, but it was part of the USSR at the time, which lost 14 percent of its overall population). In all, six million Poles (half of whom were Jews) died. Those who survived were traumatized. And you thought you had a tough life.
THE WAR‐IS‐GOOD‐FOR‐ECONOMY MYTH
It’s time for a quick aside. There’s a widespread belief that war is all about money and that war is good for business. Many argue that America attacked Iraq only to get access to cheap oil, even though the US was already buying Iraq’s oil before the war and it became more expensive to buy that same oil after the war. America attacked Panama for the money received from controlling the Panama Canal, which, come to think of it, the US was already getting (and would give up a few years later, as promised). America went into Somalia because, well, we’re not sure why, maybe sand is valuable. America attacked the tiny Caribbean island of Grenada because, well, there must be some vast economic interest there too.
The point is that nations go to war for many reasons. Money usually is a major reason, but it’s often not the only reason or even the main reason. Sometimes we go to war for moral reasons (to stop a genocide or some other grave injustice), but there are many other factors too, such as religion, ethnic hatred, language issues, settling an ancient score, having a disproportionate number of unemployed young men in a society (i.e., a youth bulge), the “he‐hit‐me‐first” excuse, getting back territory “that was historically ours,” and, of course, having politicians with big egos and small penises.
“Never mind!” cry the cynics! “War is still good for business!” Really? Great! So let’s drop a few atomic bombs on Spain to help their economy. Let’s help out France by carpet bombing them. Oh, wait, they say it’s great only for the winner’s economy? Oh, OK. Poland and Belarus were victorious in WWII. By the end, they were mostly rubble and up to a third of their people were killed. France also won the war, but lost nearly half of its national wealth. The victorious USSR saw 1,700 towns and 70,000 villages utterly destroyed. Sounds like that really helped those winners out, doesn’t it?
Oh, wait, they say it’s just good for the victor’s economy who is untouched by war. America was spending 90 percent of its federal budget on its war effort and going massively in debt during WWII (compared to 20 percent today). What do you think would have been a better use of that money: building things that go boom and then disappear after one use, or building something that lasts and can be used for many years? A war is an extremely inefficient way to stimulate an economy. If wars helped economies, then Africa would have most of the world’s leading economies.

The truth is that wars do not help the economy: they devastate economies. That’s why the stock market collapses when there are signs of war. That’s why investments halt. That’s why people stop spending money and start stuffing money and gold under their mattresses. That’s why businesses lay off employees and stop giving raises. All this kills the economy and business.
Yes, there is one little sector of the economy, the defense industry, which is better off during wartheir stock prices go up. Some may say, “The US spent $685 billion on the military in 2010! How the hell is that a ‘little sector’?” Just put that $0.68 trillion into the perspective of America’s $15 trillion GDP and you’ll see that military spending is just 4.5 percent of the US economy—hardly a dominant sector.
Therefore, given that the vast majority of lobbyists and campaign donors are not involved with the military, politicians would be fools to embark on a war, since most politicians are usually re‐elected only if the economy is going well. Franklin Roosevelt knew this, which is one reason he wanted to stay neutral during WWII. War is the worst way to energize an economy. It’s far better to sell stuff to the idiots who are killing each other than to be one of the idiots in the fight. That’s why Argentina, during WWII, became one of the richest countries in the world: it sold goods to the countries that were spending their national wealth to kill people.
Therefore, next time someone tells you that “war is good for business and helps the economy,” slap him with this book and say, “No, you dimwit, (1) wars hurt economies, (2) we don’t fight wars just for money, (3) wars only benefit a small minority who are making weapons, and (4) the biggest beneficiaries are countries that are not in the war, but are supplying the warring nations.”
Stupidity is also a gift of God, but one mustn’t misuse it. — Pope John Paul II

I got acquainted with Francis Tapon almost two years ago, when he contacted me and offered pieces of his new book under preparation to be published in the Journal of Eurasian Studies. Since the JulySeptember 2010 issue of our journal his writings can be read, the first couple of chapters unabridged.
I have not met Francis in person yet, but I immediately felt a deep connection. His deep humanity, sharp wit, and open mindness are characteristics that make him instantly a very likeable person and an ideal author. Next to that, his life is pretty much an open book. In his first book, ‘Hike Your Own Hike 7 Life Lessons from Backpacking Across America’, published in 2006, he formulates his life‐vision in very practical terms using the completion of the Appalachian Trail as background. ‘Hike Your Own Hike’ is not only an interesting mountaineering guide but rather a book full with life management advices.
Francis Tapon takes the theory distilled in his first book and eats his own cookies. He lives his own life according to his ‘sermons’. And the product this time is a book on Eastern Europe, ‘The Hidden Europe What Eastern Europeans Can Teach Us’, based on a several years of traveling through every country of that part of the world. A voluminous book that you cannot put down once you commenced reading it. In it the

author takes the reader to a journey through each country of Eastern Europe (25 in total), mingling personal experiences with his understanding of the region’s recent and past history, reflections on human nature in general, and drawn conclusions from all of these factors. As with his each writing the volume is soaked with humanity, wit, and (self‐)criticism.
‘The Hidden Europe’ is a buoyant travelogue written by an intelligent, sharp and open‐minded American. By definition it is personal, hence subjective. But it is written with a deep sense of humility and that makes it a celebration of human cultures, humanism, and history. It can be interesting for both Eastern Europeans and people from outside of that region. For ‘armchair’ travelers as well as for real‐life tourists. For first time visitors as well as returning ‘veterans’.
Since its publication I have recommended it to all of my friends. Every one of them told me that they could not put it down. Therefore I can recommend it to everyone from the bottom of my heart. Please purchase it for yourself, family members, friends, and colleagues. As a birthday present, or as a gift at any other anniversary. Buying the book provides you or the other readers with endless joy and reading fun and it will also help Francis Tapon organize and execute the next challenge of his life: visiting every country in Africa and writing a book about his encounters. Your action will definitely support the publishing of further interesting travel accounts in the years to come!

VÁMBÉRY, Ármin
In Samarkand
Ármin Vámbéry (1832‐1913) was a Hungarian orientalist and traveller. Based on his extensive linguistic and other studies, travels and other experience, he strongly advocated the theory of a close Turkish‐Hungarian linguistic relationship.
Between 1861 and 1864 he travelled from Constantinople, disguised as a Sunnite dervish, through Persia and Central Asia. During his travel he visited among others Trebizond, Tabriz, Zanjan, Kazvin, Shiraz, Ispahan, Khiva, Bokhara, Samarkand, and Herat. This was the first journey of its kind undertaken by a European. He then paid a visit to London, where he was treated as a celebrity because of his daring adventures and knowledge of languages. We present here a chapter on Samarkand from his book ‘His Life and Adventures’ published by T. Fisher Unwin (London, 1889).
***
The Tadjiks maintain to this day that Samarkand, this ancient city of Central Asia, is the centre of the world. And it does, in truth, excel all the other cities of Central Asia, in its ancient monuments as well as in the splendour of its mosques, its grand tombs and new structures. We put up at a large caravansary where hadjis are provided with free quarters, but having been invited on the day of our arrival to establish my quarters as a guest in a private house near the tomb of Timur, I readily accepted the invitation and left the caravansary. I was agreeably surprised to find in my host an officer of the Emir who was charged with the superintendence of the Emirʹs palace at Samarkand. The return of the Emir, who was about to terminate a successful campaign at Kokhand, having been announced to take place in a few days, my fellow‐travellers determined to oblige me by putting off their departure from Samarkand until I had an opportunity to see the Emir and find suitable companions for my return journey. I employed my time, in the meanwhile, in looking at the remarkable sights in the city, of which a greater variety is offered here than in any city in Central Asia. Being a hadji I had, of course, to begin with the saints. There are here about a hundred holy places to be visited, and the pilgrims do their visiting by a certain established rote, according to the superior claims of persons and places to sanctity. I would not deviate from the observance of this routine, and looked at everything, in its proper turn, down to the smallest object, with the zeal and devotion becoming the character I was acting. Amongst the many, I will mention in passing only the mosque of Timur; that castle in one of the halls of which the celebrated Kök‐Tach (i.e., green stone) is still to be seen upon which the great Emir had his throne erected, when its hall was crowded with vassals who hied from all the quarters of the world to do him homage; at that time when three messengers on horseback were always standing ready in the precincts of the

amphitheatrically constructed hall to blazon forth the edicts of the conqueror of the world to the remotest corner of it. The tomb of Timur, and its many brilliant medresses are worth mentioning too. Only a portion of the latter are used as dwelling‐places, and many of them are threatened with decay. The medresse of Hanim, once so grand, is in ruins now, and in vain did I search within mouldering walls for even a trace of the renowned Armenian and Greek library which Timur is alleged to have brought to Samarkand to form one of the ornaments of his capital.
Whilst I was in Samarkand crowds were always thronging in the bazaars as well as in the public places and streets, to which the soldiers returning from the war contributed, to a great extent. The number of its regular population hardly exceeds fifteen to twenty thousand inhabitants, two‐thirds of whom are Uzbegs, and one‐third Tadjiks. The Emir, whose seat of government is properly speaking in Bokhara, used to spend two or three months during the summer in Samarkand, owing to its more elevated position and more genial climate.
I had now passed eight days in Samarkand, and I finally came to the conclusion to return to the West by way of Herat, taking the route I have mentioned before. Hadji Bilal still insisted on taking me with him to Aksu, promising to send me safely to Mecca by way of Yarkend, Thibet and Cashmere, or, if favoured by luck, to Peking by the way of Komul. But Hadji Salih was opposed to the plan, laying stress on the great distance and the scantiness of my means. ʺAs far as Aksu, and even Komul,ʺ he said, ʺthou wouldst experience no difficulty, for Mussulmans and brothers are living along the road, and they would have regard for you as a dervish from Roum; but beyond thou wilt meet unbelievers only, who, it is true, will not hurt thee, but will not give you anything either. Therefore be advised, and return to Teheran by way of Herat, with the men we have selected for your travelling companions.
There was a struggle going on within me for a while. To have travelled by land to Peking, through the ancient fastnesses of the Tartars, Khirgizes, Mongols, and Chinese, where even Marco Polo would not have dared to place his feet — would have been indeed a feat without a parallel! The voice of moderation prevailed with me after all. I reflected that it would be a pity to risk losing the fruits of the experiences hitherto gathered, however trifling they might be, by embarking in an enterprise of great uncertainty and undoubted danger. And putting off was not giving up; I was only thirty‐one years old, and what I could not well do to‐day I might accomphsh at some future day. I made up my mind to return.
My preparations for the journey had advanced considerably when the Emir made his triumphal entry into Samarkand. Its taking place had been announced for some days past, and a great multitude had collected on the righistan (principal public place), to witness the show, but I cannot say that any special pomp was displayed in the pageant. The procession was headed by two hundred sherbazes, wearing over the uncouth Bokhara costume some sort of overall of skin, to which piece of additional dress they were indebted for their being called regular troops. They were followed by horsemen with banners and kettledrums, and behind these, at some distance, came Emir Mozaffar ed‐din, surrounded by his higher officers and chief men. The Emir was forty‐two years old, of middle size, rather stout, but very pleasant in appearance, with fine black eyes and a thin beard. After the Emir came Kiptchaks — rude, martial warriors with features nearly Mongolian, armed with bows and arrows and shields.

The Emir caused a feast to be arranged for the people on the day of his arrival, several gigantic cauldrons being erected, on that occasion, on the righistan, in which the princely pilar was being cooked. Into each of these cauldrons was thrown a sack of rice, three sheep chopped up, a large pan of mutton fat, enough to make five pounds of tallow candles, and a small sack of carrots. Then ensued a scene of eating and drinking beggaring all description.
An arz, that is a day for public audiences, was proclaimed for the following day. I took advantage of this occasion to present myself in the company of my friends to the Emir. As we were entering the interior of the city, we were startled to find ourselves stopped by a Mehrem, who gave us to understand that his Badevlet (majesty) wished to see me alone, without my companions. My friends were this time of my opinion, that this message boded ill to me. But what was to be done but to follow the Mehrem to the palace. After being made to wait for about an hour I was conducted into a room where I found the Emir reclining on a mattress of red cloth, amidst books and papers lying about. I recited a short Sura, accompanying it with the usual prayer for the welfare of the governing prince, and after saying amen, to which the Emir responded, I sat down in close vicinity to him without having first received his invitation to do so. The Emir was struck by my bold behaviour, which was in fact in perfect keeping with the character of a dervish. He fixed his eyes severely on mine as if wishing to embarrass me, and said:
ʺHadji! I hear thou hast come from Roum to visit the graves of Baha‐ed‐din and the other holy men of Turkestan?ʺ
ʺYes, takhsir (sir)! and, besides, to be edified by thy blessed beauty.ʺ
ʺStrange; and hast thou no other object in coming here from such distant lands?ʺ
ʺNo, takhsir! It has ever been the warmest wish of my heart to visit noble Bokhara and enchanting Samarkand, upon whose sacred ground, as is justly observed by Sheikh Djelal, men should walk with their heads rather than their feet. Besides, this is my only vocation, and I having been roaming now through the world for many a day as a djihanghesteʺ (a wanderer through the world).
ʺHow is this, a djihangheste with thy lame foot? This is very strange indeed.ʺ
ʺLet me be thy victim, takhsir! (This phrase answers our ʺI beg your pardon, sir.ʺ) Thy glorious ancester Timur — may he rest in peace — was afflicted in the same way, and yet he became a djihanghirʺ (a conqueror of the world).
Having bantered me in this preliminary conversation, the Emir inquired what sort of impression Bokhara and Samarkand had made upon me. My answers, which I took occasion to interlard with copious citations of Persian poetry, seemed to make a favourable impression upon the Emir, who was a mollah himself and spoke Arabic pretty well; but I was not altogether sure yet of my success with him. After the audience had lasted for a quarter of an hour he summoned a servant, and telling him something in a cautious undertone he bade me follow the servant.
I quickly rose from my sitting posture and followed as I had been bid. The servant led me through a number of yards and halls, whilst my mind was at the time cruelly agitated by fears and misgivings as to my fate; my perplexed imagination conjuring up pictures of horror and seeing myself already travelling on the road to the rack and that dreadful death which was ever present to my mind. My guide showed me, after a good deal of wandering about, into a dark room, conveying to me by a sign that I should

expect him here. I stood still, in what state of mind any one can guess. I counted the moments with feverish excitement — when the door opened again. A few seconds yet of suspense and the servant approached at last, and by the light of the opening door I saw him holding in his hand, instead of the frightful instruments of the executioner, a parcel carefully folded up. In it I found a highly ornamental suit of clothing, and an amount of money destined for my onward journey, sent to me as a present by the Emir.
As soon as I obtained possession of the parcel I hastened away to my companions, wild with joy at my escape. They were quite as glad of my success as I myself had been. I subsequently learned that Rahmet‐Bi had sent the Emir an equivocating report about me, in consequence of which I was received with diffidence at first by the Emir, but succeeded in dissipating his mistrust, thanks to the glibness of my tongue.
My fellow‐hadjis now advised me to leave Samarkand at once, and not even to sojourn at Karshi, but to cross over as quickly as possible to the other side of the Oxus, and await there in the midst of the hospitable Ersari‐Turkomans the arrival of the caravan bound for Herat. I took their advice. The hour of parting was at hand. I feel my pen is too feeble to give an adequate picture of the parting scene. For six months we had been sharing in all the dangers connected with travelling in the desert; we had in common defied robbers, borne the raging elements, and braved hunger and thirst. No wonder then that the barriers of position, age and nationality were all broken down, and that we had come to look on ourselves as one family. It may be easily imagined with what heavy hearts we looked foward to the sad moment when we should have to separate. There is hardly anything more painful to the heart of a true man than to see those ties severed which common hardships, the exchange of mutual acts of friendship and devotion, have firmly knit together. And mine, especially, I own it, nearly broke at the thought of the double‐dealing I had to practise upon these friends of mine — the best I had in the world, who had preserved my life — even in these last moments leaving them in the dark as to my identity. But those who know the fanaticism of the Moslems, and the danger I should have exposed myself to by divulging the truth even at the moment of farewell, will surely find no fault with my reserve.

Czuczor‐Fogarasi Conference

Call for Speakers and Papers
Appointed by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Gergely Czuczor and János Fogarasi compiled the Hungarian Dictionary, which is the first academic monolingual dictionary of the Hungarian language. The collection was published in six volumes between 1862 and 1874. We are organising a conference in honour of the 150th anniversary of the first volume. The conference commemorates the work of Czuczor and Fogarasi, presents the linguistic theory they formulated and highlights not only the current points of connection between cognitive science and linguistics, but also the opportunities for further scientific study and practical application.
Topics of the Conference
1. The theory of roots formulated by Cuczor and Fogarasi, actually consists of three parts: the study of sounds, the analysis of the roots and their system and the system of derivation affixes.
2. Research on the theory of roots in the 19th century, history of sciences overview. Politics and sciences policy in the 19th century at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and in the academic life of the time.
3. The theory of roots from the viewpoint of cognitive science including cognitive linguistics. Sound symbolism studies. The functions and development of language from the point of view of the theory of roots. Current perspectives and trends in the scientific application and development of the theory of roots.
4. The appearance and application of the theory of roots in the research on agglutinative languages. The study of these languages based on the theory of roots. Sound symbolism in agglutinative languages. Parallels between the research of the Hungarian root system and that of other agglutinative languages like Turkish and Japanese.
5. The theory and practice of roots appearing in art. Conscious and unconscious literary and poetic applications.
6. The application of the theory of roots, cognitive science and sound symbolism in teaching and education. Practical teaching methods and the results of application.
7. Language protection, language cultivation and language renewal from the point of view of theory of roots.
8. The mathematical and informatical study of Czuczor and Fogarasi’s work and the theory of roots, parallels in natural sciences.
9. The personality, life and individual work of Gergely Czuczor and János Fogarasi.

OUR AUTHORS
BADALOV, Ulugbek
A native of Uzbekistan, Ulugbek Badalov received his PhD in political anthropology from the School for Advanced Studies in Social Sciences (EHESS) in Paris (2011).
