Introduction
The aim of this book is to enable you to read and enjuy the hieroglyphs
and the language of ancient Egypt. It is chiefly aimed at those who have
had no previous experience of reading hieroglyphs, but should also ben
efit others who would like to improve their knowledge in line with con
temporary research. Above all, this is a practical guide: from the very
beginning you will be introduced to genuine hieroglyphic texts, with full
supporting explanations and study aids. In order to do lhis, we have con
centrated on monuments in the British Museum. in particular the stclac
(or lunerary inscriptions) of Egyptian officials, as well as coffins, 10mb
scenes, and the famous Abydos King-list of Ramess.s 11. Each chapter
introduces you to a new feature of the hieroglyphic script or the language.
and ends with copies of inscriptions on which you can practise your skills.
We believe this approach has a number of advamages.
First. by reading genuine ancient inscriptions from the first lesson,
you can build up your familiarity with the tricks of the trade: everything
here (from individual signs to whole inscriptions) is typical of the kind of
monuments displayed, not just in the British Museum. but in museums
throughout the world. Secondly, by reading these rnonuments, we hope
you will feci a real sense of achievement at each stage of the book.
Thirdly, concentrating on a coherent group of monuments will allow liS
to rai se some important topics - such as the role of Osiris, god of the dead.
and the Mysteries celebrated at his cult centre, Abydos - which will help
you to understand the cultural background of these monuments.
Rather than cramming in unnecessary detail. wc will give you
plenty of practice in reading hieroglyphs, and introduce you to the most
common features of the ancient Egyptian language as it appears on these
monuments. This will give you a firm basis on wruch to build, if you laler
move on to study other genres of the wealth of texts which survives from
ancient Egypt - literature, religious wisdom, royal decrees, or whatever.
This book has develo~)ed out of a course which wc have been teach
ing since 1992. Jt was clear to us back then that the existing introductions
10 ancient Egyptian were either too brief or too detailed, and that there
was a need for an up-ta-date course adapted 10 the needs of beginners

studying at home. We have taught the course in various guises [or sever
al groups and institutions: the University of London Centre for Extra
Mural Smdit's, thl:" Egypl Exploration SOc1t"ty. the University of Glasgow,
the Workers Educational Assodation. the Sussex Egyptology Society and
the Thames Valley Egyptological Society at the University of Reading. At
the Bloomsbury Summer School in particular. we have had the chance to
introduce people to hieroglyphs in the hot-house of a single, concentrat
ed week of study. This book owes a great deal to the constructive feedback
of the students at a1l these venues, who have helped us (sometimes forced
us!) to refine and clarify the text. and as a result it is much clearer and
more accessible. Although it would be impossible to acknowledge so
many by name, we are immensely grateful to each and every one of them
for their enthusiasm and feedback, and for encouraging us in our belief
that this book - and the approach it embodies - is a worthwhile project.
In developing this project into book form. we have had the good for
tune to be able to draw on the knowledge and support of many people.
At the British Museum, Vivian Davies. Keeper of Egyptian Antiquities,
first brought the project to the attention of British Museum Press, and
encouraged us to make use of Richard Parkinson's expertise in copying
hieroglyphic monuments; Stephen Quirke freely shared his considerable
knowledge of Middle Kingdom officialdom, as well as encouragement and
the first round of drinks; as noted. we are especially grateful to Richard
Parkinson for his outstanding line drawings. At Bloomsbury Summer
School. we would like to thank the Director. Christopher Coleman. who
allowed us carte blanche to develop language courses, and also his
admirable staff for diligently keeping us all (tutors and students) alive.
Several colleagues have helped us to teach hieroglyphs at the School:
Ludwig Morenz. Toby Wilkinson. and espedally Jose-Ramon Perez
Accino. who is now a regular partner in our teaching. At the University
of London Centre for Extra-Mural Studies. our grateful thanks are due to
Tony Legge and Lesley Hannigan. who allowed us the freedom to devel
op the course as we saw fit, and also to Louise Lambe. Mark drafted his
contributions to the book while a resident Fellow at All Souls College,
Oxford. and completed them after his appointment to the School of
Archaeology, Classics and Oriental Studies, University of Liverpool; he
would like to acknowledge the support of both these institutions. His
work on the language sections of the book has developed in tandem with
his comprehensive undergraduate grammar course, Introduction to Middle
Egyptian, which will be published separately.
We are grateful to the staff of the British Museum Press, not least for
agreeing to take on such a complex book; above all our editor. Carolyn
Jones, for her dedication and good humour in dealing with such a

Hieroglyphs
§l Introduction
HicrogJyphs are pictures used as signs in writing. Many depict living crea
tures or objects (or their parts):
~ owl 1ft seated man ~ mouth ~ watt"f-pol
And , as you might expect. some signs represent th e objeCl they depk1. So,
for example. the mouth-sign = is used 10 write the word fur mouth , usu
ally in <.:ombination with a stroke-sign (see § 13 below for this sign):
=I r mouth
However, very few words are actually wrilten in this way. Instead, hiero
glyphic picture-signs are used to convey the sound (and meaning) of the
ancient Egyptian language. just as the letters of our own alphabet convey
the sounds of English. So. for example. the hieroglyphs above the figure
roasting the goose do not read 'reed, chick, man, fa ce ' etc. , which makes no
sense; rather. they convey the sounds of various words in Egyptian which
together have the following meaning:
'I have been roa sting since the
beginning of time -I have never
seen the like 01 tlus goose'
(Meir 1lI. pI. 23)
The purpose of this book is to show you just how this is done.



2 How to read [:gyp/iall hicrv:Jlypils
§2 Reading hieroglyphs
How then can hieroglyphs be read to show us something of the sound of an
dlKi<:llt cgyptian word? The ea >ie>t way tu 'CL this is thruugh lookillg dt a
real example. The sign LJ depicts a schematic house (in plan) and is used to
write the word for 'house' as follows (I is the stroke-sign already noted
above):
LJ pr house
I
As it happens, this word is based on the two consonants p and r combined
to give pr. We shall discuss the way the ancient Egyptian word is put into our
own writing system - how it is transliterated - in §§3 and 4 below. Now, there
is another word which makes use of the same sound combination p and r,
the word for 'go out', 'Ieavc'. In hieroglyphs this is written as:
n.f'j pr go out, leave
< ,.
In this word, n is no longer being used to dcpict a house, but rather to
'picturc' the sound combination pr (this is discussed in Chapter 2). Put more
formally, n is being used as a sound-sign or phonogram. This is ter",ed the
rebus prindple; it is as if we were to write the English word belief with a pic
turc of a bee and a leaf as ~ . On this basis hieroglyphs can be used to
indicate sounds rather than and can thus be used in words quite unre
lated in meaning to the objects they depict.
The word;:::.f'j pr, 'go out', also displays another two signs whose use
will be explained more fully later. The mouth-sign < > reads r as it did in < •
r 'mouth', although it has nothing to do with 'mouth' here, being us~d
instead to complement or clarify the reading of n pr (this is discussed in
Chapter 2) . The walking legs.f'j are used as a determinative, a sign sometimes
placed at the end of a word to give a general idea of its meaning, here of
motion (see §6 below).
§3 Transliteration
In the last section we rendered "? into our writing system as pr. It is the
not mal practice among Egyptologists to transliterate the sounds of a hiero
glyphic word in this way. It is a very good discipline to get used to this right
from the beginning and we encourage you always to transliterate when
reading. The only real oddity about this is that hieroglyphs are not used to
write vowels (a, e, i. o. u), only consonants; aJtpough this will seem a bit
strange at first, you should soon get used to it.
§4 I-consonant signs
It is now time to get you started reading hieroglyphs for yourself. The most
important hieroglyphs are the I-consonant signs, where each hieroglyph

contributes a single sound towards the reading of a word, rather like the let·

We shall concentrate here on the reading of these signs. If you wish to iden
tify the objects the signs depict. consult the full sign-list beginning on p. 129.
The proper value of each sign is the transliteration value given in the
second column; the third column simply gives a way in which we. as English
speakers, can vocalise these signs for our own convenience.
Most of these sounds resemble their English counterparts and can be
transliterated directly into familiar letters from our own alphabet. However,
some I-consonant signs are used to represent sounds not present in spoken
or written English, and these require spedally adapted transliteration sym
bols of their own:

Each I-consonant sign represents a distinct sound in the ancient Egyptian
language and so each needs its own transliteration symbol. It is important to



4 How 10 read b'gyprionirierog/yphs
include all the various dots and dashes when transliterating - they are not
optional. In transliteration you should use the proper symbol given in the
second column ot the table on p. 3. This is Hue even it we tind it ditticult to
tell the difference between two sounds. For example, "and k are quite dif
ferent sounds in Egyptian, even though distinguishing between them is
rather difficult for us as English speakers.
There is no need to try and pronounce ancient Egyptian words exactly
(in any case this is impossible, since the vowels are not written out for us).
However, it is useful to be able to read out your transliterations and vocalise
whole words, rather than spelling them out sign by sign. So, a purely con
ventional pronunciation, entirely for our convenience, is usually adopted.
These are the renderings given in the third column in the table on p. 3.
Many signs have values similar to letters of our own alphabet and present
no problem, whereas the more unusual ones are usually given a convenient
English approximation. We also need to add vowels. The convention nor
mally adopted is to insert an 'c' between each consonant, except in the cases
of I and r, where 'a' is used, and w, where 'u' is sometimes used because they
are easier to pronounce. Once again, these pronunciations are purely a prac
tical convenience and are not intended to bear any relation to spokcn
Egyptian. For example, the following is the word for 'birds', lpdw (a writing
discussed in §8), given with its transliteration and its English meaning:
~. 0, } ~ 'pdw birds
Purely for our own convenience we could pronounce this 'apedu'.
§5 Arrangement of signs
It may already have struck you, from looking at the examples discussed so
far, that hieroglyphs arc not arranged one after the other as in our own
alphabetic system, but in balanced groups or 'blocks' arranged to fill the
available space. In particular, some signs are placed over others in order to
fill the space in a more pleasing manner. As an example, here is the name of
the official Senbi (snbi) from Exercise 1.8 on p. 13:
2"
[- -4
"3
The name is written from left to right, starting "'ith the s (I). But notice that
the signs making up the name are grouped together, so that the n (2), as a
long thin sign, is placed above both the tall thin signs for b (3) and i (4),
fOIming a block. The rule for such arrangements is quite simple: when you
meet a block of hierog\yphs, read the top one(s) before the bottom one(s)
•
•
Hierog/yphs 5
and then carry on as normal. You will see a number of examples of grouping
throughout the rest of this chapter. You may wish to read this paragraph
again when r~ading §7 on the direniun uf writing.
At this point, you may wish to attempt Exercises 1.1 and 1.2 on pp. 10-1 I.
§6 Determinatives: meaning-signs
So far we have studied words written out with sound-signs alone. However,
in hieroglyphic writing words are sometimes written with meaning-signs, or
decerminatives, placed at the end of the word after the sound-signs. The fol
lowing are examples of some common determinatives and words written
"'itll t11C111:
man and his occupations
gud, king
o
SUIl, light, Lime
motion
small bird used for bad. weak or little things
@ Lawn, village
itr s man
skr (the god) Soker
<IU,}0 hrw day
send
I n.......
~3i:' bin bad, evil
!;Is Qis (place-name)
Determinatives do not contribute to the sounds of the word and so are not
transliterated. From our point of view, they simply help us to get some gen
eral idea of the meaning of a word. A large number of signs can be used as
determinatives, but for two reasons this fad should not get in your way.
First, as already mentioned, we do not transliterate determinatives, so they
do not need to be at the centre of your attention, especially early on in your
studies. Secondly, in the inscriptions you will be reading in this book deter
minatives are quite frequently omitted. However, if you are bothered by a
particular determinalive, consult the full sign-list beginning on p. 129.
Two other common determinatives require a little more description.
JTh (not to be confused with ~ 'man') is the meaning-sign used with words
for what can be taken in or expelled through the mouth, either literally (eat
ing, speaking) or metaphorically (emotions, attitudes, thinking) as well as
the relevant adivities conneded with these, for example:
Q"~~ nls call out. summon



6 How 10 read Egyplian hieroglyphs
The most common determinative. however. is ' . the papyrus roll. used for
abstract words or concepts. Although such words could not easily be repre
sented by a piclUre. they could be wriuen down. for example on papyrus.
thus acquiring a tangible physical for Ill. This written form could then be
depicted in the shape of the rolled-up papyrus sheet:
WJ ~ snb heallh. healthy
r
<€IJ sIJr counsel. plan. conduct. manner
One important word often written with the papyrus roll determinative is:
€I
01 I I iJ! thing( s)
The word ht is often written with the plural strokes I I I (see §8 below).

although it is not itself a plural word. Notice that. for reasons of spacing. the
papyrus roll can be positioned either horizontally or vertically - you will find
that a number of long thin signs can be arranged like this.
Sometimes a word can have more than one determinative:
:;..;n<;>....... d individual. ordinary man. person
11'.B'>.ff nos ([rum ruot meaning ·Iittle. small' )
Having a detel minative thus gives us a second way of gelling at a word
- a general clue as to its meaning. This has the advantage that we can distin
guish between two words written with the same sound-signs:
Q1.Jt 6l ilW old. the old Q~} 1 ilW adoration. praise
As we shall see in Chapter 2. there arc other features of the hieroglyphic
script which tend to ensure that different words are written differently even
when they share the same sounds.
•
In practice. however. as on the monumental inscriptions we shall be
studying in this book. determinatives are often omitted. For example. in
Exerdse 1.2 you are asked to transliterate the following words (from the
roasting scene in §l) without determinatives. They are shown here along
side examples with a determinative:
~ . Ll0 or ~ _Llnu, roast ••• } or <' .}~ goose
At this point. you may wish to attempt Exercise 1.3 on p. 11 .
§7 Direction of writing
So far. we have ordered the hieroglyphs following our own system of writ
ing. i.e. writing them in lines from left to right. However. hieroglyphs were
used in a more decorative manner than leners in our writing system; in par
Hieroglyphs 7
ticular. they often form ed a fundamental part of the aesthetic scheme of a
monument. Although we shall continue to present the hieroglyphs in left
to-right orJer wilhill the tell.to! thi> uouk. whc" you >luuy ft:d l t:lI.dllll'lt-> uf
inscriptions. these may well be organised from right to left (this is in fact the
more usual direction) and possibly in columns. Fortunately. there is a very
simple trick to reading hieroglyphs in the right order:
Read into the front or faces of the various signs, and from above to below.
Put another way. signs normally look towards the beginning of the text.
So, if we look at th e following scene. the hieroglyphs are to be read in
the order numbered. Notice that the orientation of a figure helps. particu
larly when there are not many signs with a clear 'front':
IC:::::JI El 0
/ I\

,,/5
/",7
/8
11
Offering scene from the
tomb of Senbi at Meir
(read from right to left)
(Iyl.eir I. pI. 9)
.'
In this case. the inscription is fitted into the space surrounding the figure.
The overall direction of writing is indicated best by the foot-sign (10): to read
into the front of this sign we need to read from right to left. the direction we
would also need to look into the face of the accompanying figure. Vertically.
we always read from top to bottom (see §5 above). so the text begins at the
top right. The first three signs read horizontally above the top of the foreleg
of beef carried by the figure. The remaining signs then read down the col
umn. but still from right to left within each block. as indicated by nos 4-13.
You may well recognise the name of Senbi discussed in §5 above. Compare
the right-to-left writing of this name (nos 8-11) with the left-to-right order
ing given in §5 (taken from another inscription in Senbi's tomb) . To increase
your confidence in this skill. a full vocabulary for this inscription is provided
at the end of this chapter. so that you can practise reading it for yourself.
As an example reading from left to right. we ca n look once more at the
inscription we used to introduce this book. shown on p. 8 with the order of
the signs of the first line.

In this example. there are two rows of inscriptions, an upper one
which is read first and a lower one, read second. Notice. once again, that the
hieroglyphs have been fitted around the figure. So, Line 1 reads from left to
right horizontally (reading into the face of the chick, the seated man. the owl
and the bird in flight) and then at the end turns the corner, as it were, drop
ping down to finish in a column with nos 13-15. As with our writing system.
we then return to the start of the next line and read along once more (into
the face of signs such as the seated man and the chick).
As these examples also indicate. hieroglyphic signs were placed in a
continuous sequence without any punctuation marks or word spacings. No
doubt this will seem quite intimidating at first, but we hope to show you by
example that, as you become familiar with the script and gain a grasp of
useful words, this is nothing like as bad as it might seem. Exercise l.8 (see
pp. 13-14) will give you further practice in this skill.
§8 q/ and }. w and plurals
Hieroglyphic writing is quite economical. Along with vowels, the conso
nants qt and}. ware often omitted in writing, except at the beginning of
words. This is particularly true for grammatical endings. For example, the
plural is indicated by a -wending (just as it is typically indicated in English
by adding '-s', as in 'bird', 'birds'); this is sometimes fully written out, but
more often the -w is omitted. The word for 'bird' (singular) is:
~!--, ~ Jpd bird, fowl
For our convenience this word can be sounded 'aped'.
This is made plural by adding on a -wo A plural determinative of three
strokes I I I is also usually added. Since the determinative I I I suffices to
HieroBlyplu 9

transliterated in brackets). leaving a more compact group of hieroglyphs:

§9 Nouns
Learning to read hieroglyphs is. however, only one part of reading a hiero
glyphic inscription, especially if you aspire to making real progress with your
studies. Since hieroglyphs were used by the ancient Egyptians to write down
their own language, it is necessary to build up a familiarity with how words
are put together in Egyptian. Throughout this book, we will introduce you
step by step to the most common features of ancient Egyptian which you are
likely to meet in the sort of inscriptions studied here. Some of the ways
Egyptian works are rather like English. and so will seem quite normal to
you. but some of its features are not as we would expect from English. and
will need a little more discussion and thought.
As a starting point. it is useful to know something about nouns in
Egyptian (nouns are the words typically used to refer to people. objects.
living things and the like). In Egyptian. all nouns are treated as being either
masculine or feminine, even if there is no obvious reason (to us) why this
should be the case; you may be familiar with a similar convention in French.
Fortunately, this distinction is very easy to spot in ancient Egyptian. since
feminine nouns almost always end in eo. -to whereas masculine nouns rarely
do. For example: i-tl s man c-.~ si woman
Also there are no special words for 'the' or 'a' in classical Egyptian and so
i-t I S 'man' can mean either 'a man' or 'the man' (although one or the other
often suggests itself in translation into English).
One feature of Egyptian which is rather like English is the use of prep
ositions (words which are 'pre-posed', or put before, others) to indicate
locations ('in'), directions ('towards'), times ('during'), accompaniment
{'with') and how things are done ('by'). As in English, the simplest
prepositions tend to be very short words and are written with I-consonant

§lO Adjectives
An adjective is a word used to describe a noun, to give it a particular prop
erty or quality (e.g. 'a stupid man', 'a clever woman'). The distinctive
feature about adjectives in Egyptian is that they follow their nouns and also
they agree with the noun - if the noun is feminine and ends in -t, then so
does the adjective:
it IJ qi: .I bin the/an evil man o'JJJ q~ si hint thdan evil woman
The word for 'this' behaves in a similar manner:
o pn this (masc.) tn this (!cm.)
"'I,,VA,
Like adjectives, pn and In follow their noun and agree with it. An example
of this occurs in the inscription used at the beginning of this book, where the
text ends with the phrase 'this goose':
•>}: ,.~.. srw pn this goose
Exercises
1.1 Kings' names
You are now in a position to read the names of several Old Kingdom kings.
First, here is the name of the famous builder of the Great Pyramid of Giza,
who is usually known by a Greek adaptation of his name as 'Cheops'. In
hieroglyphs his name is written as follows (we have given you a conven
tional rendering in English afterwards to guide you in your transliteration;
for the use of the name-ring or cartouche sce p. 20):
~}. -.~ ... .. Khufu
Here are two further names of Old Kingdom kings. The first is one of
two names of a 5th dynasty king, Djedkare Isesi. Which is given here? The
second is a name shared by two kings of the 6th dynasty:

1.2 Words from the roasting scene
In the roasting scene used in our introduction, some words are written out
with I·consonant signs. Transliterate the following and see if you can isolate
the words in the original scene in § I:
roast . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . goose
· . .-.. . . -......
1.3 Gods' names
The names of certain gods are typically written with I-consonant signs.
Transliterate the following. Once again, the traditional English rendering
will help to guide you in most cases (although 'Anubis' is derived from a
Greek version of the god's name - 'Inpu' or 'Anpu' might be a more conven
tional rendering into English). Remember to use the proper transliteration
symbols from the second column in the table in §4. Any unfamilar sign
(such as the seated dog) is a determinative and so not to be transliterated:
q~"}:~
~l
c: ,.
_ DG
·.... . . . . .
• • • • •• • • • •
·... .-. . . .
Anubis Heket
· . . .. . . . . .
Ptah Sebek or Sobek
• •• ••••• ••
Ra or Re Seker or Soker
· . . .-.. . ..
... ...
'Sobek' and 'Soker' arc usually rendered with an '0' because of the Greek
forms of these names. There is nothing of importance in this traditional
practice.
Many readers of this book will be familiar with the famous pharaoh
Akhenaten, his wife Nefertiti, and Akhenaten's innovative religious pro
gramme centred on the solar disc. the Aten. In hieroglyphs, the Aten is
written as follows. Once again, try to transliterate:
q.p.
. "..
(0) Aten
. . . . . .... .. .
'Aten', like 'Anubis', shows the alternative conventional use of 'a' for initial
I ('Iten' would be the other way of pronouncing this word in English).
lA Transliterating words
Transliterate the following words written with I-consonant signs and deter
minatives (any sign which is not a I-consonant sign is a determinative and
need not be transliterated):

Hieroglyphs I 3
The scene on p. 12 was used to illustrate the use of hieroglyphs written in
right-to-Ieft order in §7 above. Have a go at translating th e caption with the
help of the vocabulary provided and the ordering of the signs given ill §7.
(The context of the scene is that the figure is offering the foreleg of a slaugh
tered bull to the tomb owner Senbi; the inscription relates his speech.) This
exercise is useful in illustrating a couple of other points as well. First. these
are drawings of real hieroglyphs found on the wall of the tomb of Senbi and
not the standard hieroglyphs of a font such as that used in this book (recall
how English written letters differ a little from standard type fonts). This is
really just a matter of getting used to variability, panicularly in the infill of
signs - use the vocabulary provided to see the standard hieroglyphs. Sec
ondly, the inscription contains words wrinen in other ways than with 1
consonant signs which you will not be able to read through at present.
Instead, use a 'cut-and-paste' approach, relying on us to isolate the correct
groups of hieroglyphs in the vocabulary and to give their correct reading and
meaning. You should just 'cut-and-paste' the relevant groups into your
translations. By the end of the next chapter, even these words should be
clear to you.

Chapter 2
More uses of hieroglyphs
The aim of this chapter is to introduce you to the 2-consonant and 3-consonant signs,
which provide much ofthe subtlety and flexibility ofthe hieroglyphic script. It will also
supply you with the information needed 10 read Ihe names ofvarious famous kings of
ancient Egypl, including the names on the Abydos king·list in the British Museum.
§II 2-consonant signs
The second major group of signs are the 2-consonanL signs, which contrib
ute two consonants to the reading of a word. We have already seen an
example in the use of the 2-consonant sign LJ pr in the word LJ .f) pr 'go
... 0>
(out)'. The 2-consonant signs are rather common - over eighty are used in
this book - and becoming familiar with them represents the major hurdle to
be overcome in reading hieroglyphs. The sign-list on p. 128 gives a table of
the most common 2-consonant signs used in the inscriptions studied, and
we shall also introduce several at a time in the vocabularies to the various
exercises to allow you to become familiar with them in convenient num
bers. The following are some common examples of 2-consonant signs to get
you started, along with some common words in which they occur (including
pT again so that you can see bow the table works):

eXAMPLE
:t...~

Consider the word bJk 'servant'. In its most basic form, the word is built up
through using the 2-consonant sign]:.. bJ followed by the I-consonant sign
='"' k, which together give the reading of the word as bJk (it may also be fin
ished off by a scated man determinative - see §6 above - showing us that



16 How 10 r<ad l;!Jypliall hiero!Jlyphs
the word refers to a person). Notice how this gives a more visually distinctive
writing for the word than if it were simply wrilten out with 1-consonant
signs. Although w" mighl vit:w Ih" Bumu"r uf 2-cUIlSUlldllt siglls dS rdther
forbidding, it is nothing compared to the enormous number of words which
any language contains. By having a mixed system in which they can be writ
ten with differing combinations of hieroglyphs, words take on more
distinctive and memorable writings than if they were simply written out in
an alphabet-like system (think of the difficulties of English spelling!).
The second noticeable point in the writing of some of these words is
that I-consonant signs often occur as sound complements fleshing out the
reading of a 2-consonant sign, helping to jog the memory, as it were, abolll
its reading. There is a simple rule about this: if a I-consonant sign shares the
same value as an accompanying 2-consonant sign, then this I-consonant
sign is not read as a separate sound. So, if we look at n ./J again, we read pr
<,
and not prr even though it is written with n pr + . . r, because < • r jogs
our memory about the r of pr.
If, however, the I-consonant sign has a different value from the
sounds of an accompanying 2-consonant sign, then it should be read as a
separate sound. So, if we look at the word 3r-if bJk, then the I-consonant
sign <:> k must be read separately, since the sign 3r- only reads bl on its
own. So read bJk.
From our point of view, this might seem an unnecessarily complex
way to go about writing words, but there are a number of advantages. For
example, such a system provides the flexibility to be able to write words in
blocks as noted in §5. More importantly, it allows a good deal of flexibility
in the actual choice of signs used; this was particularly useful in view of the
fact that most hieroglyphic inscriptions were written on fixed and inflexible
surfaces such as stone.
Suppose that we have two inscriptions, each with a different-sized
space left at the end of a line, and we wish to write the word bJk 'servant' in
each of these spaces. The hieroglyphic system allows us a convenient and
elegant way out of our problem. In the smaller space we can write bJk as it
is written in the table above: 3r- i . In the larger space, wc could include a
sound-complement ~ fleshing out the J of the bJ-sign and thus fill the
slightly larger space: i .
The two words ust the same, they are just 'spelt out' slightly dif
ferently. Words in hieroglyphic writing, therefore, do not have one single
correct spelling but are rather 'elastic' and can be contracted or expanded
through, for example, the inclusion or omission of sound-complements.
Fortunately, we can leave it to the ancient Egyptians to do all the spelling for
us - the important point for us is just to be aware of the flexibility of the
script and observe it in action.

§12 3-consonant signs
The final major group of sound-Signs are the 3-consonant signs, which con
triuule three cOIlSUlldllb tu the n:Jding of J word. 3-consonant signs arc also
often accompanied by one or two I-consonant signs as sound complements
helping to flesh out the reading of the sign. There are far fewer of these signs
and also many of them are emblematic - they are used only in certain words
and arc often conneLted 10, or come to be emblems for, the words in which
they are used. Perhaps the most famous example of these signs is sr 'nb,
'ankh', used in the word for ' life':

manner to our R.l.P. (> is a 2-consonant sign reading nu):
~<@. !~ nW-iJrw true of voice, justified
You have encountered this in more condensed writings. (See further § 14 on
p. 18 below.)
§13 Ideograms: sound-meaning signs
The final signs to be looked at in this chapter are the sound-meaning signs
(ideograms) which combine sound and meaning and which come closest to
our own preconceptions of how a picture-script should work:
V' Ib hean
I
0 0 , arm
I
n pr housr
I

oI

As the examples indicate, these signs are olten followed by I which helps to
highlight the ideogram usage, as well as noting that only one 'hean' etc. is

meant; it also serves as a space filler to give a convenient grouping of the
signs. A fuller list of ideograms is given on pp. 128-129.

This usage of signs illustrates an important point for using this book.
Although you may be able to 'spell out' a couple of the words given in this
section, most of them will not be immediately readable (you should, ho w
ever, rapidly grow used to reading Cl as w(b, for example). Therefore we
encourage you to focus on words as a whole, rather than trying to puzzle
through the use of every single sign from first prindpies. We will do the
work for you by supplying you with words in the format used in the table
above: hieroglyphic writing followed by transliteration and translation. If
you concentrate on whole words as opposed to single signs, you should find
that you make faster progress in reading.
§14 Variant writings
Hieroglyphs are written in groups, accommodating aesthetic considerations
and the limits of physical space by using differing combinations of signs. For
these reasons, words can be written in a number of different ways. For
example, we have already encountered the phrase ml"Urw 'true of voice' or
'justified' in a number of different writings:
,
As already noted, we can safely leave it [0 the ancient Egyptians to show us
how it should be done . We need only be aware that variant spelling is a per
fectly normal featUTe of hieroglyphic writing.
However, it is worth noting that 'spelling' is constrained by convention
and tradition within fairly strict limits. So, even though ml(-or w is written
out in a number of different ways, there are usually distinctive and recog
nisable elements to the phrase (in this case, . and ~ ). Furthermore, by
tradition, m,( is never ' found written out with I-consonant signs as
* ~~. n ml' (* is the symbol for 'not found'); rathe r the range of 'spell
ing' of m,( concerns whether, . rn,( was written along with > n71 as a
sound complement (often combined into ); ), and perhaps also with other
sound complements in differing combinations, [0 suit aesthetic and physical
considerations.

§15 Writing the plural (see also Reference table on p. 149)
The most common way of writing the plural has already been discussed in
§8 aiJ"vL'. IL j, tYl-'kally written with I-'lural stroke, (I 1 I) and Illay or lllay not
show a -w sound-sign (in the latter case, a w is added 10 the transliteration
in brackets for convenience):
U ~} ,T. or U~ ~ i1bswor i1bs(w) clothes
Another way of writing the plural is for a sign to be repeated three times:
,,' II(W) lands
This method is rarer in practice, although it is favoured for certain words,
such as tJ(w) ·lands'.
Egyptian also shows a restricted use of a dual ending: msc. ~ \\ -wy and
fern . c \\ -ty (indicating two of som ething), but this is common only with
things which tend 10 come in pairs:
: I [J ~\ t"wy arm s " tHvy the two lands (Egypt: Delta and Valley)
"
ITIT
tlwy is written by repeating rwo signs, like the second plural method noted
above.
§16 = nb 'all, every, any' and => nb 'lord, master'
There arc two important words which can be written alike. The first is the
word for 'al1', 'every' or 'any':
= nb all, every, any
<= nb 'all. every, any', behaves rather like an adjective (see §IO): it follows
the noun it goes with and, like an adjective, agrees with it:
L I I Cl J;t nbt everything
=> also occurs in another common word, the word nb meaning 'lord' or
'master', which , in its most abbreviated form , is written simply:
'=' nb lord, master
Fortunately, when nb means 'lord' or 'master' it comes first in expressions:
= YJ ~ nb Jb!!w lord of Abydos
(See Exerdse 2.2 for lbdw 'Abydos'. )
So the rule is quite simple: when nb comes second in its phrase (and
agrees with the first noun) then it is th e word nb 'all, every, any'; whe n it
comes first in its phrase, it is the word nb 'lord, master'.

§17 Royal names and titles
One of the principal goals 01 this chapter is to equip you to read the names
of the kings 01 Egypl. In the next lew paragraphs. we will Jeal wiLh SOlue 01
the background about royal names, focusing on the titles, epithets and the
dating furmula. In the Exercises to this chapler, we shall set you loose on the
names of the kings themselves.
The king in ancient Egypt had an elaborate tirulary made up 01 his
names, titles and epithets. From the Old Kingdom onwards, each king had
five names, of which three are particularly commun on monuments (the
other two - the 'two ladies' and the 'golden Hurus' names - arc used less
uften). The three common names are the Horus name and the names con
tained in cartouches - the praenumen and the nomen.
The Horns name designates the king as the god Hurus, the son and suc
cessor of Osiris (Ior whom, see pp. 40-42). The name is introduced by the
falcon ~ br. As an example the Horus name of Senwosret I is:
~ Sfffi ~ !Ir 'n!l-mswr the Hurus AnkhmesUl
The other two common names are written in cartouches (name-rings). The
praenomen, or first cartouche-name (a name assigned on the king's acces
sion). follows the r~ nsw-bUy title 'king of the dualities', 'dual king' - i.e.
the king as ruler of the dualities which composed the Egyptian world: Upper
and Lower Egypt; desert and cultivation; the human and the divine. It has
been traditional tu focus on the division of Egypt into the Nile Valley and the
Delta and to translate this title as 'king of Upper and Lower Egypt'. The
praenomen of Senwosret r is:
the king 01 Upper and Lower Egypt Kheperkare
The 110men, or second cartouche-name, is the king's own birth name and
might be common to other members of the dynasty. IL is also the name by
which scholars nowadays refer tu the kings: hence we have Senwosret I
ll, and III in the 12th dynasty. The numbers are a modern convention and
do not occur in the ancient names. The numen is typically introduced by
the ~ SI r' title 'sun uf Re' - i.e. the king as the heir 01 the sun-god Re on
earth. The nomen of Scnwosret I is:
(See Exercise 2.7 on pp. 26-27 for the readings of the cartouche names
themselves, and the ordering of the signs.)

A couple of other titles of the king (typically accompanying the praenomen)
are:
1~ niT nfT the perk(t gud ,.. nb tHVy lord 01 the two lands
'u
§18 Royal epithets
The king's name and titles are usually associated with a number of epithets.
Among the most. common are epithets connected with life:
Sf ~l. 'nb ill living enduringly
often extended:
&Sf dl'l1b given life
0~ mi T' like Re enduringly and repeatedly
(Ior ever and eternity)
On the written order of the phrase ml r' 'like Re', you may wish to look
ahead to §22 in the next chapter.
§19 Dating
Dates were recorded in ancient Egypt according to the regnal year of the
reigning king and not by some absolute dating system like BelAD. The dating
fOt mula has a fixed and regular form based around the following words,
along with the names, titles and epithets of the king and the number of years
of his reign:
f~ rnpHp regnal year @ IJr under
••
~I hm person ••u • • •
n ... " n 01
/:Im is used to refer indirectly to the king.
Egyptian numbering is decimal, broken up into tens and units. The
tens are reckoned by repetition of the sign n (so nnn = 30) and the units by
repetition of I (so 1111 = 4). Consider the following example (here year 28 of
king Nimaatre Amenemhet TTT) which shows how the formula is put
together and how the numbering system works:

Nimaatre was omitted in the original.)

Since both of these common words rely on a single 2-consonant sign, it is
not at all unusual to find them written at their briefest with just the 2-con
sonant sign.

The names of these gods can be written with or without the determinative
for gods: tJ (A3).
2.3 Variant writings
In § 14 in the text, you were introduced to the notion of variant writings,
which allow a word to be stretched or compressed to fit space. The example
used was the phrase ml<-brw 'justified' or 'true of voice', used as an epithet
of the blessed dead. The variants given in previous examples are repeated
here. Work through the writings, identifying the various signs, and satisfy
ing yourself that despite the differences, they all yield the same trans
literation: ml<-hrw.

2.5 Words
Some very common words are written with otherwise uncommon signs and
with some idiosyncracies of their own. Copy out the following and read the
accompanying notes:
~~~ Jk or::: it
IL seems that 2:\ is an obscure determinative here; lather however, the common phrase It~f'his father' is probably influential too (cl. §§33, 36).

The following are examples of dates from British Museum stelae. It is per
haps better to do this exercise after the study exercises on pp. 26-30, when
you will be able to read the kings' names more easily.

2.7 Study exercise: Middle Kingdom kings of the 12th dynasty
It is now time for you to read through the cartouche names of various kings
of Egypt. The kings we have selected come from the some of the most cele
brated dynasties of ancient Egypt: the 12th dynasty in the Middle Kingdom,
and the 18th, 19th and 20th dynasties in the New Kingdom. You can either
piece their names together from the sign resources provided below or you
can go further and refer back to Chapters 1 and 2 (as well as making use of
the sign-tables at the end of the book) to improve your familiarity with the
•
SIgns.
The·two most common names of the king - the praenomen and nomen
- are written in cartouches and are thus easy to spot. However, the way that
the names themselves are written is actually surprisingly complex, playing
with the various resources of the script for aesthetic and spacing reasons.
The one factor we have not covered so far (because it finds a more appropri
ate place in Chapter 3) is that elements drawing on divine names are written
first, regardless of the order in which they are read. For example, the sun
disc r' (the name of the Slln god) regularly appears first in the praenomen
but is read last (as the transliteration values and Anglicisation of the names
below show). For the purposes of this exercise, we would ask you to follow
the reading order we give below, but you may wish to look forward to §22
in Chapter 3 for an account of this peculiarity.
Fill in the first cartouche names from the list below into the proper
place in the following table (the first one is done for you). Notice, once
again, that the element r' is written before the other elements of the name
(similarly with wsrt in s-n-wsrt), although it is not read first:

Many of these elements have proper meaning as words on their own, which
we indicate here. However, there is no need to try and translate the names.
2.8 Study exercise: New Kingdom kings
Transliterate both the cartouche names for each of the following New King
dom kings, using the aids provided. A complicating factor is that, during the
New Kingdom, it is not at all uncommon to find epithets included within
royal cartouches. Some of the names below contain such epithets (for exam
ple that of the ruling queen Hatshepsut, which regularly includes the epithet
bnmt-imn - 'joined with (the god) Amun'). If the epithet contains the name
of a god, this divine element may be written at the front of the cartouche,
even if it is not read first. Follow the lead given in the Anglicised versions of
the names below:

2.9 Study exercise: BM EA 117 (the Abydos king-list of Rame.sse.s ll)
The 'king-list' of Ramesses IT shown on p. 31 originally came from his temple
at Abydos. Modelled on a similar list in his father Seti 1'5 mortuary temple
nearby, the list forms part of an elahorate offering formula (I)tp-di-nsw; see
Chapter 3) for the cult of previous kings. Originally, there were 78 car
touches in the upper registers (the 76 found in the Sdi I list plus the two
cartouche names of Ramesses H). This number probably reflects cultic tradi
tion, the space available on the wall, and possibly the 76 forms of the sun
god enumerated in the religious text known as the Litany of Re. The kings
are identified by praenomen beneath which are determinatives of seated
kings alternately wearing the white (} and red '1crowns. The names of
Ramesses II (alternating between nomen and praenomen) are repeated in
the bottom register and show a range of variant writings for the nomen.
Reconstructing the top line from the Seti I king-list. the overall format is as
follows:
[An offering which the king gives before Ptah-Sokar-Osiris ... a thousand
bread and beer, etc.] to king X as a gift of Ramesses 11:
t'P n nslV
"" • n m dd
~A Ij
for the king
as a gift of (literally, in the giving of)
The word nsw is written using ?f which is also a variant for •._" common in
the New Kingdom (compare the more usual spelling of nsw in §23).
The king-list shows some interesting gaps between the Middle and New
Kingdom (between the fourth and fifth cartouches of the second surviving
register) and within the 18th dynasty. Use the royal names listed in the pre
vious Exercises and the chart of royal dynasties on p. 22 to identify the
missing kings and dynasties for yourself.

Chapter 3
In this chapter we introduce you to a number of special wriliniJs: abbreviations,
chaniJes in the order ofsiiJns and defective writiniJs. Since all of these aTe rather com
mon, particularly in the renderiniJ of titles and epithets, a knowledge of them is
essential for successful monument reading in a museum. You are also introduced to
the offeriniJ formula, probably the most common form of hieroiJlyphic inscription to
be found on funerary monuments surviving from ancient Egypt. This chapter should
also serve as a convenient reference resource to which you can return when studying
various monuments later on in the book.
§20 Abbreviations
Abbreviated Writings are common in the writing of titles and epithets:
~ ~ /.zlly_r governor, mayor l fillJ bry-hbl lector priest
Jpty_r (literally, 'foremost of position') is written with the ideogram ~ Jpt
(front part of lion) over, 0 r (arm); hry-J;bt (literally, 'the carrier of the book
of ritual') is written with abbreviated writings of both bry and J;bt (without
sound complements or determinatives). There is also graphic transposition,
~
with the two tall signs placed either side of fill br(y) (see §21 below). Clearly
such writings cannot be read sign by sign with any ease. Even after more
than a century and a half of study, the exact reading of some words remains
contentious among Egyptologists! Hence we strongly recommend that you
follow our general advice of concentrating on whole words rather than get
ting bogged down in the study of individual signs.
As we have already seen, abbreviated writings of the epithet usually
bestowed on the blessed dead are common:
written in full as: ~ < @,!} ~ true of voice, justified
•I
,•
§21 Change of order: spacing
The second feature is the switching of the order of signs to enable them to
fit into the available space in a more satisfactory manner (termed more for
mally graphic transposition):
~ ";'} instead of ~ '}@ lidw Djedu
,I,
I
I,
•
Special wrilin9~ 33
Graphic transposition also occurs in vertical columns:
c,
I ~I
= IT
4dw Djedu, instead of tl
@
Sometimes graphic transposition is a regular feature of the writing of a word:
.,J;:. ~~ mJJ see, look at
This is regularly written with the determinative to> placed under the 2-con
sonant sign y mJ.
§22 Change of order: prestige
For reasons of prestige, names for gods and kings and related words some
times precede closely connected words, although they are actually read
afterwards (this is termed more formally honorific transposition). Honorific
transposition is particularly common in epithets and titles:
rh nsw
"
king's advisor, royal intimate
mry Imn beloved of Amun
(Notice that abbreviated writings are also common.)
hm-nlr
••
rni rr
servant of the god, priest
like Re
You have already encountered this phenomenon in the writing of royal
names in Exercises 2.7 and 2.8. A rather dramatic illustration of this point is
the following writing of the nomen of Ramesses II (Ramesse-meryamun,
'Ramesses beloved of Amun'):
Here the two divine elements (Ra of the name Ramesses and Amun of the
epithet 'beloved of Amun') have been written as seated gods and placed at
the top of the cartouche facing each other, creating a vertical division. The
low flat sign of mr(y) ('beloved') has been placed in the middle of the car
touche, creating a horizontal division. The vertical division is mirrored in the
bottom half of the cartouche (giving the ms-sw or 'messe' part of Ramesses)
where the three-pronged ms-sign stands in the centre between two tall thin
signs (the sw and the s) both of which bend away at the top from the central
•
ms-sIgn.

§24 Titles
Office-holding played a central role in the dite culture of aneient Egypt,
locating the individual within society, most notably in relation to the king
(see also pp. 101-104). Titles come in two forms: official or administrative
titles and conventional titles connected with status and authority. Abbrevi
ated writings are common to both.
a. Conventional titles of status and authority
The two most common conventional titles are:
~ !iu lJtmty blty seal-bearer of the king nQ~ ':: smr wrt(y) sole companion
I' I 0 I
(The reading of lJtmty-blty is unsure: other possibilities are lJtmw-bity and
s«Jwty-bity; for blty 'king', see p. 102.) These two titles often occur together.
b. Titles of office
Titles of office can be divided into secular and religious titles:
Secular titles
governor,
mayor overseer of the
chamber
A number of titles are composed with the element ~ m-r (fully Imy-r)
'overseer':
steward. overseer
m-r pr of the estate ~ ~ I v overseer of
~ I m-rmsr
= I the army
m-r probably means literally 'the one in whom is the word' (i.e. the one who
has the authority to issue orders). On the basis of a graphic pun around r
(which means both 'mouth' and 'word'), it is occasionally written with \
B44 tongue (the tongue being 'the one in the mouth'):

It is not at all uncommon for titles to be written without determinatives.
§25 Epithets
Egyptian texts abound with epithets of gods, kings and officials. Here are a
couple of related epithets particularly common on stelae:
fmllJy or fmllJw
nb fml vh
venerable one, revered one, honourable one
possessor of veneration/reverence
and other variants based on the fuller writings such as: Q~1llf\ 'reverence',
'veneration'.
These epithets are primarily applied to the blessed dead. After a life of
official duty and ethical behaviour, the blessed dead were revered by the
living (who perpetuate their memory on earth, particularly through offer
ings) and honoured before the gods (with whom they exist beyond death as
transfigured spirits). The latter is often expressed in the following way:
Q"'Q Q<G, i fmllJy lJr Isfr the revered one before Osiris
§26 The offering formula
Formulae comprise relatively fixed combinations of words and so can be
read without a detailed understanding of their internal grammar. The most
common example, the offering formula, is a ubiquitous feature of the hier
oglyphic monuments found in museums throughout the world. By working
through, and becoming familiar with, the elements of the formula discussed
below, you will gain access to a vast number of hieroglyphic inscriptions.
The offering formula merges two related functions: official and per
sonal. In official tenns, the status of the deceased as one of the blessed dead
was linked to the successful performance of official functions in royal service
and ethical behaviour in life. This success was instrumental in qualifying the
deceased for access to the means of commemoration in terms of memorial
inscriptions and funerary monuments. One purpose of the offering formula
was to allow the deceased to partake uf the offerings presented to the deities
in the major cult temples in the name of the king, particularly un festival
occasions. This reversion of offerings displays the importance of official life,



36 How to read Egyptian hieroglyph~
particularly in terms of the person of the king, in the relationship between
the living and the dead.
The secund, persunal, fUIll:tiull relates mure tu the private family-based
aspects of the funerary cult of the deceased. The private offerings to the dead
could be either physical (the offering of food, drink and goods) or verbal
(through the utterance of the offering formula); furthermore, these offer
ings could be perpetuated in pictorial and verbal form (through art and
writing). In this way, the offerings made at the burial could be perpetuated
by family members (particularly the son and heir), or by people visiting the
tomb or passing by the stela.
First of all, here is an example of the offering formula, which you may
wish to refer back to as you read over the discussion below:
The offering formula from BM EA 558:

alabaster, linen, everything good and pure on which a god lives for the ka of the revered one Key
The most common form of the offering formula is composed of three parts,
which can be divided according to the characteristic Egyptian expression
found in each:
a. +, ~ ,/i:J /:ltp-dl-nsw an offering which the king gives
b. prt-fJrw a voice offering
.......
.-"'...
c. UI nkin for the ka of
We shall take you through each of these parts in turn, assembling here the
material you need to be able to read the standard Osiris offering formula. If
you return to this section when reading stelae such as BM EA 587 on p. 46
at the end of this chapter, you should find all the help you need. As you
study the various stelae in this book, you will no doubt gain more and more
familiarity with the various parts of the offering formula.

Special writinHs 37

A from
I I i • '..--.,::)
LO ]
00 /:lIp offering

(For the writing of the verb 'give', see Exercise 3.5.)
The expression /:ltp-di-nsw is often used to refer generally to the offer
ing formula and its associated offering rites (and might less literally be
translated as 'the offering rite'). The actual rendering of this stereotypical
phrase is notoriously obscure and still exercises the minds of scholars. What
ever its original form, it is clear that by the Middle Kingdom the phrase had
come to be treated as a fixed, compound expression. Here we have adopted
a standard rendering which we encourage you to follow, rather than trying
to work out its meaning from the individual signs.
The name, title and epithets of the Hod(s)
The name of the god then follows. The god most commonly named in the
offering formula (as in the example above) is Osiris and we shall concentrate
on him in this chapter. For the other cOl1ll1lon divine recipient of the offering
formula, Anubis, see BM EA 1783 in Chapter 5, and for an example with a
number of gods, see BM EA 584 in Chapter 8. The standard names and titles
of Osiris are introduced separately in the notes on funerary deities at the end
of this chapter.
b. The offerings are passed on to the deceased
The voice ojJerinH
This section of the offering formula centres around the following expression:
56i prt-fJrw a voice offering
The standard writing of prt-l:Jrw contains the following elements:
from [ ] p, prt a going fonh
.. ,.
from {Jrw •
vOice
o from GI I I I bread
from hnkt beer
••



38 How to read bg yptian hieroglyphs
The term prt-IJrw is regularly written with the bread and beer signs, even
when the voice offering itself is intended without any reference to the bread
and beer. They an: depit:lnj whether vrcad and vcer are IIlcllliuncd
separately in the subsequent inventory of offerings or not (in which case they
may have been thought of as being included within the writing of prt-IJrw).
By the Middle Kingdom prt-IJrw had become a fixed expression used
as a cover term for the offerings themselves (and might be loosely translated
as 'the ritual offerings'). As a fixed expression, prt-IJrw can even be written
with a determinative for the whole phrase, such as , • , 'loaf for offering':
!5Ui' • , prt-!Jrw a voice offering
The second part of the offering formula either starts off with prt-IJrw imme
diately or marks the passing over of the offerings from the god by the use of:
• n CfJ dl-f prt-hrw so that he may g.ive a voice ollering
"'= 0015 •
di-4is again a form of the verb rdi 'to give' (see Exercise 3.5). Once again, at
this stage we advise you to follow our suggested translation (see Chapter 8
for an explanation).
prt-IJrw alone is typical of 11 th-dynasty stelae. di f prt-IJrw is more
typical from the mid-12th dynasty onwards (prt-IJrw alone being rare by
then). During the early part of the 12th dynasty a mixture of both usages is
found.
The inventory ofofferings:
The offerings are usually enumerated via a standard list of items, usually
written with abbreviated writings (given here alongside fuller writings):
oor Cl' 0 I t bread l~tl
GI tl or
I I hnkt beer
••
It or .l{~ kl ox 11 or~: , ~ Ipd fowl
'r4 ss alabaster ("''')@
6 or , 11 or _",;,.oil mnht linen
•
Often the offerings are numbered with I IJI 'thousand' or 11\ 'a thousand
of/in'.
The voice offering from the stela ofTjeti:
BM EA 614, Column 1:

prl-!Jrw !J! I !:znif,t !J! kI !pd !J! ss mn!Jt
A voice offering (of) a thousand bread and beer, a thousand ox and fowl, a thousand alabaster and linen
(prt-IJrw is here written with bread and beer signs but simply read prt-IJrw;
contrast with BM EA 558 on p. 36.)
Spl!Cial writings 39
Other offerings sometimes occur (particularly in later 12th- and 13th
dynasty stelae) and are usually more fully written out:
"'l ° 1 mrht oil, unguent 1 ~~oi •
snlr lI1cense
< > fl: •
A • I0I ~
!:ztp or !:ztpt offerings 4f(lw) • •
• ,or , , provISIons
oD oD= 1 I I
The inventory is wrapped up:
As well as listing a standard set of offerings, the offering formula also usually
includes a more generic and all-embracing phrase:
~~ a !Jt nb(t) nfr(t) wrb(t) everything good and pure
You have already studied this expression in Exercise 2.4. It is often qualified
by the following fixed expression:
f,::1 ~1\ rn!Jt nlr im on which a god lives
Since this is a fixed expression, you should read and translate it as a whole
for now, without worrying about its internal grammar (which will be
explained in Chapter 7).
c. The recipient of the offering
The deceased recipient of the offering is introduced by one or both of the fol
lowing phrases:
UI n kI n for the ka of iml!J(w) the revered one
,,,.-.
In the 11 th dynasty and into the early 12th dynasty (after which it dies out),
we usually find imIIJ(w) on its own. The combined usage n kI n imIIJ(w)
begins in the early 12th dynasty and reaches its peak in the mid-12th
dynasty. The use of n kI n on its own is rare in the early 12th dynasty, but
becomes the most common form from the later 12th dynasty onwards.
Once you have reached this point, then you will find the name of the
deceased, usually with a title, and ending with the COIIlmon epithet:
=,=, m!r-!Jrw the justified
-'
§27 The genitive
The genitive 'of' (as in 'the king of Egypt') occurs in two forms:
a. Direct genitive
The two nouns are put together without any linking word. This construction
is only common between closely connected words or in fixed expressions:

It also occurs in certain cumpound expressions, such as those compounded
with Ib 'heart':

b. Indirect genitive
The two nouns are linked by forms of the 'genitival adjective' n. This
behaves like an adjective and agrees with the preceding noun, taking the fol
lowing for illS:

Mm 'of' is written in exactly the same way as the preposition _ n 'to', 'for'.
However, in translating into English, one or other of these usually suggests
itseU (cl. 'for the ka of'). Also there is a tendency for n to be used for aU num
bers and genders, as in /:Imt~fn st-ib=f'his wife of his affection' in Exercise 4.6.
Excursus: Egyptian funerary deities
Osiris
Osiris (lslr) was a central figure in the funerary cults of the ancient Egyp
tians. As noted in Chapter 2, his name is written in an idiosyncratic manner
and cannot easily be broken down sign by sign. Indeed there is still some dis

The writing of Osiris' name (and the number and nature of his epithets)
altered at different periods of Egyptian history, as follows:

<U>
Osiris writlen without determinative (written with determinative in the
11th dynasty)
Alternative writing from the late 12th dynasty
As a 'great god' (nlr 'I), the cult of Osiris was celebrated at many shrines, the
most impurtant uf which are reflected in his titles 'lord of Djedu' and 'lord
of Abydos', the writings of which you studied in Exercise 2.2. In BM EA 587
(see Exercise 3.8 below) they are written as follows:
nb Ijdw lord of Djedu (written with graphic transposition, see §21)
niT 'J great god '=' ~ J~ nb Jbgw lord of Abydos
These three together represent the classic Middle Kingdom combination of ·
epithets, particularly common in the early 12th dynasty.
The writing of Djedu itself changes over time (as well as sometimes dis
playing graphic transposition):

The pre-eminence of Osiris is reflected in his other name, Khentyimentu
(bnty-Imntw), 'the one who is foremost of the westerners' (i.e. the dead
gathered in the realm of the setting sun); the name evokes his subjects (the
dead spirits) arrayed before his throne:
~~ ~~ !Jnty-imntw Khentyimentu
As will become clear from a number of the sleiae which you will study in
this book, the name Khentyimentu is uften included in the offering formula
amongst the epithets of Osiris (again typical of the early 12th dynasty) .
In mythology, Osiris had been a living king at the beginning of history,
but was murdered and dismembered by his ambitious brother, Seth. Osiris'
remains were magically restored by Isis (1st) - his sister - who was then able
to cunceive his child, Horus; Horus grew up to defeat Seth and inherit his
father'S throne in kgitimate fashion. Osiris is represented as a deceased king,

The passion of Osiris is also reflected in the name Wenennefer (wnn-nfr),
which means 'the one who continues to be perfect' and hints at his myste
rious post mortem potency:
g;~ ~ wnn-nfr Wenennefer
Wepwawet and Anubis
Funerary stelae from Abydos and elsewhere often invoke Wepwawet and
Anubis alongside Osiris. Represented as a dog or jackal. Wepwawet (wp
Wiwt) was an ancient god of Abydos and an active participant in the cult of
Osiris: the annual passion-play at Abydos began with the procession of Wep
wawet 'to protect his father', Osiris. More generally, Wepwawet ·was
associated with cemeteries and funerals, as reflected in his title 'lord of the
sacred land' (nb ti 4sr), where 'sacred land' means thc cemetery. Even the
name Wepwawet (literally, 'the one who opens the ways', see p. 96) recalls
the untrodden paths over the desert along which he guided the souls of the
newly deceased to the kingdom of Osiris.
The other major funerary deity was Anubis, whose iconography is
dose..to that of Wepwawet; he also appears in canine form and bears the title
'lord of the sacred land'; his other titles are more obscure. Nevertheless, the
funerary gods have distinct roles, apparent in the mythology of the funeral:
Anubis embalmed the body of the deceased and conducted the burial cere
monies; Wepwawet led the deceased from this world to the next; and Osiris,
king of the dead, represented arrival and rejuvenation in the next life.

Scenes an captions
The first part of this book was dedicated primarily to building up your knowledge oJ
the hieroglyphic signs needed to equip you for the twin goals oJ reading the names of
the kings and the offering formula. In this part ofthe book we will move on to broaden
your knowledge of the ancient Egyptian language and how it works, equipping you
to read a wider range ofMiddle Kingdom stelae in the British Museum and elsewhere,
and also supplying you with a firm foundation Jor moving on to study the wealth of
surviving ancient Egyptian writings.
§28 Captions: the infinitive
Verbs typically label actions or events such as 'do', or 'kick', though some
verbs label states or conditions such as 'remain'. A major topic to be dealt
with in reading hieroglyphs is how to get the right translation of verbs
according to whether they refer to actions in the past, present or future.
Over the next few chapters we will equip you to bring this degree of accu
racy to your translations.
A good place to start is with scenes and captions. Scenes are often
accompanied by captions which very conveniently label the action:
r~r;l spt sm/:! Binding a skjff (Meir IT, pI. 4)
(In captions, words are often written without determinatives, since the
image itself pictures the meaning.)



50 How to read c.gyptian i1iero.qiypi1s
In English the -ing form of the verb translates rather well here,
whereas using the simple English past 'bound a skiff' seems a little incom
plete and unsatisfactory. Exactly the same is true in Egyptian. In such
captions, Egyptian uses a particular form o[ the verb which, as you will see
in the next chapter. differs markedly [rom the form for expressing the past.
In Egyptian the equivalent o[ the -ing form in this usage is termed the infin
itive (see §31 below [or its forms).
Before we progress further, there is one general comment we would
like to make. The terms for the various Egyptian verb-forms are now rather
traditional; they arc not always very clear in their meaning, nor do they
always agree with the use of the same term in describing the grammar of
English. So the term 'infinitive' and its meaning is not really important - it
will, however, serve as a convenient label by which we can readily refer to
the verb-form.
When the actor is mentioned in an Egyptian caption, this is usually
introduced by ~ ,.....M In 'by':
Before the figure ofthe owner is a lengthy adoration caption, the bare bones of which
are:

Kissing the ground to Khentyimentu in the great pro((:ssiun ... by the overseer of the provisioning areas Amenemhet
For the vocabulary, see the next section and the excursus on titles, p. 103.
§29 Adoration
The owner of a stela often expressed a wish to participate in certain impor
tant festivals beyond death, particularly the Osiris Mysteries (for which see
pp. 54-56). He either wished to participate in them directly - through seeing
(mn ~~~ ), adoring (dwl *1 ), kissing the ground (sn tl ~ 6~ n: I)' or
giving praise (dlt Ilw 4~ ~1) to the god - or through having offerings
made to him at such times. For example:
The vertical columns ofstela BM EA 580 comprise a hymn to Osiris which begins:
BM EA 580,
Lines 1-2: dlt IIW n Islr sn tl n WP -WIWt
Giving praise to Osiris, kissing the ground to Wepwawet
§30 Verb classes and the infinitive
So how does this all work? The first and most basic point is that when
deciding on the exact translation to be adopted (for example, should we
I
I
•
I
•
Scenes and captions 51
translate 'kissing' in the example above as opposed to 'kissed' or 'will kiss'?).
two points should be borne in mind:
i what help does the writing 01 the verb give us? (lhe question ofform)
ii how does the verb fit in the context of the inscription? (the question of
function)
As you will see, since hieroglyphs only write consonants and not vow
els, the hieroglyphic writing alone will not always direct us to the exact
form. However, once we take into account how the verb seems to be being
used in the inscription, then we can usually get good sense out of it. The first
'tool of the trade' that we need to introduce you to is the topic of verb
classes. All the verbs in ancient Egyptian can be gathered into a small
number of groups, which, when considered as a whole (or parad~qm) , usu
ally allow us to sce each form somewhat more clearly. The following are the
standard verb classes with a convenient example for each class:

Notes
EXAMPLE AND DESCRIPTION
sdm to hear
mJJ tu see
mr(l) to love
rd(l) to give
stem does not usually show an y alteration
sIem ends in a double consonant
stem ends with a 'weak' consonant, usually -I
chiefly verbs with two or three weak consonants
i With weak verbs, the final -I is usually omitted in writing and therefore
in transliteration. For practical reasons, however, we will transliterate
the extra weak verb 'to give' as rdi or dl.
ii Extra weak verbs behave like ordinary weak verbs, but sometimes
show additional features.
The stem of a strong verb is not usually that helpful since it rarely shows any
differences. As you will see below, the infinitive of strong verbs gives us little
written clue. Doubling verbs have a root which ends with the same conso
nant repeated twice. In writing, some forms of these verbs show only one of
these consonants (e.g. ml) and in other forms show two (e.g. mll) and this
can help in distinguishing certain forms. Weak and extra weak verbs, whose
roots end in a 'weak consonant' (-I or -w), are the most interesting because
they show a wider range of variation in different verb-forms, which can be
most useful in spotting a particular form (we shall sce that weak verb infin
itives are rather more easy [() spot than strong verb infinitives).



52 How to read b'gyptian hieroglyphs
One important point to note about weak verbs is that the -I and -w
with which their root or dictionary forms end do not usually appear in
writing and so need not be transliterated. However. so (hat you can see read
ily whether a verb is a weak verb or not, the -/ or -w of weak verbs will be
added in brackets (as in the table above) in the vocabularies in this book.
§31 The forms of the infinitive
So let's turn to the infinitive and see how all this works Ollt. The infinitive
in Egyptian has the following form:
STRONG VERBS
- no change
DOUBliNG VERBS
- doubling
WEAK VERBS

The most noticeable feature of the table is that the form of the infinitive of
weak verbs ends in a -to Consider again the scene and caption with which
we introduced this chapter (repeated on p. 53).
If you look at the vocabulary at the end of the book, you will find the
following word listed: r~ sp(l) bind (together)

r;;r0 spt sml:z Binding a skiff
Just like English dictionaries, dictionaries and word-lists of ancient Egyptian
just give you a standard citation form (the root), here sp(i) 'bind (together)"
and do not ~ell whether you need 'binding', 'bound' or whatever in your
actual translation. All the citation form tells us is that sp(/) is a weak verb.
But if we look at the actual example we find the following form, showing an
extra -t:
r;; spl binding
and also, of course, it is being used in a caption. Together this information
allows us to decide that spl is an example of the Egyptian infinitive and can
be translated well into English as 'bind-ing'.
We advise you at this stage to follow our example here in adhering to
a small number of suggested translation schemes for the various forms we will
introduce you to, since this will help you to get good sense out of the hier
oglyphic inscriptions you will read in this book. At first, it is better to refrain
from trying to be more imaginative or to 'guestimate' the meaning. So our
first translation scheme is for the infinitive (simply substitute the necessary
verb for 'do'):
infinitive translation scheme doing or to do
In the examples in this chapter 'doing' will be the right choice, but on other
occasions 'to do' will fit better. If the range of meaning seems a bit loose,
compare the English 'To study hieroglyphs is interesting' with 'Studying
hieroglyphs is interesting' where the English 'to do' and 'doing' forms have
a similar usage.



54 How 10 read h~qyplian hierv.q/yphs
Now, of course, infinitives of strong and doubling verbs do not offer us
much help in their writing. But the context and sometimes other parallel
exampks call help uut. As all exampk, we can cUIlSider again the fishing
and fowling scene from the tomb of Senbi which you studied in edited form
in Chapter 1 and which you can study in its original. complete form as Exer
cise 4.6. The two edited labels were:
a. Scene ofspearing fish:
rw ""~·······r'"J···~>· '~
p_r~
III = 0
Meir I, pI. 2: sll rm(w) in snhi mr-brw
Spearing fish by Senbi, the justified
b. Scene of throwing the throw-stick at the birds:
Meir T, pI. 2: rmrl r lpd(w) in snhi ml'-brw
Throwing at the birds by Senbi. the justified
st(l) 'spear' is a weak verb, hence the infinitive stt 'spearing'. 'm'l, however,
is a strong verb and does not provide a particularly helpful writing. Yet the
context of the caption and the parallel with the other caption showing us stt
'spearing' urge us to consider the infinitive and the translation 'throwing'.
Notice also how using the suggested translation scheme helps us to draw
together a decent English translation of the whole: 'throwing at the birds by
Senbi the justified', whereas reasonable alternatives such as 'throws at the
birds' do not: 'throws at the birds hy Senbi the justified' is not particularly
good English.
Excursus: The cult of Osiris at Abydos
The heart of the cult of Osiris at Abydos was the annual festival at which his
cult-statue was brought, in a ritual boat carried aloft by priests, in procession
from his temple to his supposed tomb at Umm el-Qa'ab ('mother of pots').
The festival procession had two fundamental components - a public section
during which the divine image passed through the cemetery abutting the
temple's western side, and a private section out in the desert where the
secret rites concerning the mysteries and passion of Osiris were performed.
During the Middk Kingdom at Abydos, members of the elite dedicated
stelae, or erected offering chapelS as cenotaphs, hoping to ensure their con
tinued participation in the festiva.l after their own death. The cemetery at
Abydos was therefore a veritable city of the dead with a wealth of monu
ments, and, as you will see, Abydene stelae form an important body of the
Middle Kingdom monuments stUdied in this book.

The starting point of the festival procession was the Osiris Temple
(1Q":;:" 1 r~J1), housing the statue of the god. As you will see for your
self in Exercise 6.5, there were actually two outward processions - the
'procession of Wepwawet' (Q.fJ V£;;:'!:~) and then the 'great procession'
of Osiris (F-:J,.fJ< '). Stelae w~re con~~~trated near the western entrance to
aa
the temple, in an area of high ground known as the 'terrace of the great god'
(~ : ~'~H'I~)' so that the deceased could look upon the emergence and
return of the gods (hence the references tu 'kissing the ground' and 'giving
praise' as the images of the gods pass by - the cult images of the gods are
often referred to as their *** nfrw ·splendour'). The procession crossed the
terrace before descending into a wadi (the sacred land, U[VV]). The god
then proceeded out into the desert on the God's boat-journey (I ~ a '&7)

4.7 Study exercise: The coffin of Nakhtanklt (BM EA 35285)
Although in this book we concentrate on stelae in the Eritish Museum. the
material that you are working through also puts you in a position to study
inscriptions on other kinds of museum objects. particularly where they
include the offering formula. In this exercise you will study the inscriptions
on the outside of a Middle Kingdom coffin (BM EA 35285. the coffin of
Nakhtankh) .
We shall concentrate on the two exterior sides of the coffin. omitting
the inscriptions on the head and foot ends. The inscriptions are aligned on
the coffin as follows:
w.... ·N
S~<:II E

The body was laid on its left side. facing towards the east. in order to be able
to look out through the eyes on the eastern side towards the newly rejuve
nated sun at sunrise. Hence the inscriptions run from the head at the
northern end towards the feet at the southern end. This represents the typ
ical arrangement of a Middle Kingdom rectangular coffin. On the eastern
side (the side with the eyes looking out towards the sunrise). the main
inscription is an offering formula to Osiris. On the western side is an offering
formula to Anubis. At the corners. the inscriptions invoke the four sons of
Horus. protectjve deities for the body of the deceased (with the classic
Middle Kingdom arrangement of Imseli and Duamutef on the east side and
Hapy and Qebehsenuef on the west). The central columns invoke deities
closely linked to Osiris: Shu and Geb on the east side and their female con
sorts Telnet and Nut on the west.

Chapter 5
Description
In the next two chapters, we will introduce you to the past tense, concentrating on
inscriptions in which the deceased reflects back upon, and describes. his official life. We
will also introduce you to the ancient Egyptian pronouns.
§32 Introduction: description
In a typical type of funerary inscription - which we can term self-presentation
- the owner presents himself (rarely, herself) according to the ethical values
of Middle Kingdom elite society and in terms of success and achievement.
particularly in royal service. In order to describe the activities which the official
participated in, the tasks he accomplished, and his ethical behaviour, the past
tense is generally used.
The official Intef son of Senet proclaims his ethical behaviour:
BM EA 562, Line 10: iw ~rs.n=1 il(W)
I buried the old
This construction comprises the past form of the verb eLl> ~ = "rs + ,_.• .n;
cf. English 'bury' + '-ed' - see §33 below) followed by the subject ('1') and
other elements; the sentence begins with an auxiliary~} iw which is not
translated into English (see §34 below).
§33 The past: sdm.n(=f)
The past form is termed the .fJ ~;- sdm.n(=f) (pronounced 'sedjcmencf')
'he heard', using the verb s!im 'to hear' in the 'he' form ('he heard') as the
standard example. In this form, an affix '"'' ". .n '-ed'. is added to the verb
stem (written after the determinative). As a standard convention, in trans
literation the .n is usua 11y separated from the stem of the verb by a dot - this
just makes it easier to spot. The forms of the sdm.n( f) for the verb classes
(§30 above) are:

When there is a pronoun subject (c.g. 'r heard', 'he heard'), the SUffix pro·
nouns are used (sce §36 below); the pronouns for T and 'he' are given here
(compare with the example above):
SUfnx PROl\'OUNS sgm .n(-fi
I =f If) ),")jr sglll.n=i I heard
Hellt -[ ), ......
.---'-
If) Ko sgm.n=[ be heard
The suffix pronouns (sce the reference tables on p. 148 for a full list) attach
to the verb; this is indicated in transliteration by the ~ymbol '='. Once again
this has the practical value of making the suffix pronouns easy to spot in
transliteration: sgm.n-fis much easier to read (sam 'hear' +.n '·d' + ['he')
than samnf
With an ordinary noun subject (e.g'- the man heard'), the noun follows
the verb, but does not fix onto it (hence there is no '=' in Iransliteration):
Hekaib records an inspection ofhis property by the ruler:
BM EA 167, Line 10:

"i..lt"i . •. 1$t.Jil" 1 I I
IIV ip .n /:Il>l fWI(w)(=I)
The ruler inspected my cattle
(For the omission of =1 in Iw/(w)=1 'my cattle', see §35 below; see p. 73 for
vocabula ry.)
§34 Auxiliaries
The sgm .n(=!) is usually preceded by an auxiliary such as Q} Iw. In stela
inscriptions Iw sgm.n(=J) often translates well as a simple past ('someone did
something') :
••
•I,
•I•I
II
•)
,,,
I

illhurelnakhl eXlols his proper conduct as a responsible official:
BM EA 1783.
Line 4 : fw rdf.n(=f) ( n Mr !lbsw n ftlJ
Dnaiplioll 67
I gave bread to the hungry and clothes to the naked
(There is no word for 'and' in Egyptian; for vocabulary, sce Exercise 5.4.)
There is no simple English equivalent for Iw and ~o it is left untrans
lated. It invokes a sense of involvement in the assessment or presentation of
what is said/written. In self· presentation inscriptions, Iw sam .n(=!) gives a
sense of looking back over one's life. In other contexts the perfect ('someone
has done something') also suits, particularly in recorded speech.
§35 Omission of the first person suffix pronoun
The first person suffix pronoun ('I-me-my') is sometimes omitted in writing,
particularly in texts where a figure of the person is present (e.g. stdae and
tomb inscriptions) or strongly implied (e.g. where the text is all about that
person):

ii Repeated consonants arc sometimes omitted: here only one m is writ·
ten in m m!JllI(-I) 'in my ferry'.
iii ds is used for the emphatic reflexive '(my/him)seif' or ·own' .
§36 Suffix pronouns
Although, as wc shall see, there are different sets of pronouns in Egyptian
with different usages. they do not correspond to the difference between '1·
me-my' or 'he-him-his' in English. The Egyptian pronouns translate by
whatever happens to be the most appropriate English form of pronoun. The
suffix pronouns are used:
a. As the subjects o[verbs ('1', 'he')

§37 The past relative form: sdmt.n(=f)
The following paragraph discusses a more advanced point which some of
you may wish to work through at this stage in order to gain the maximum
understanding of the inscriptions read as study exercises to this chapter.
Others may consider these points a little abstruse at this stage and may
prefer to return to this paragraph later on.
. As well as being described ('someone did something'), events can also
be characterised (treated as a 'thing whkh someone did': 'what/which some
one did'). Egyptian has a special way of characterising an event - by using
the relative forms - which is quite different from English and is often seen as
one of the more difficult aspects of ancient Egyptian. However, the use of
the relative forms is extremely common and will crop up in a number of
examples, and so we will attempt to open up this area of Egyptian for YOll
by the use of our notion of a translation scheme. The difference between
description and characterisation can be seen in the following example:
The selfpresentation of lnhuretnakht ends:

Description 69
In Egyptian, the described event 'I assembled 100 bulls' is expressed by using
the srim.n(=j) form ir.n(=/). However, the characterised event 'what I did
myself' is expressed by using another verb-form - the past relative form:
irt.n(=i). In this usage, there is no separate word for 'what' or 'which', rather
the verb-form shows a -t in its writing, so irt.n(=i) in itself means 'what I did'
without needing extra words. Notice that missing out a word such as 'what'
in translation leaves the sentence with poor sense: 'I assembled a hundred
bulls through I did myself'. You will often find this to be the case: the relative
forms (and their cousins, the participles introduced in Chapter 7) scream out
for the inclusion of an English word such as 'what' or 'which' in translation.
The same stela provides another similar example:
Between the figures oflnhuretnakht and Hui, the following dedication label about the
stela appears:
BM EA 1783: 1rt./1 ./1 f SJ f smsw f mry f dbl
What his eldest and beloved son Debi made lor him
Notes
i -n f precedes Si f smsw=f mry f in word order.
ii In Si fsmsw=fmry fboth smsw and mry share the following fand the
phrase means literally 'his son, his eldest, his beloved'.
In this book we shall focus on the relative form only when it shows the extra
-to In this way we can isolate the following convenient translation schemes
for the past sdm.n(~j) form and the past relative form s4mt.n(~j) discussed in
this chapter:
PAST TENSE ir.n-f he did
PAST RELATlVE FORM a ,«0._ Irl.n4 what he did
Excursus: Names and kinship terms
Names and family relationships play an important role on funerary stelae.
We preseI1l here a number of the names to be found on the monuments
studied in this book, and the kinship terms used, for you to refer to. As the
section on names indicates, many Egyptian names (like our own) have a
meaning. Nevertheless, in translaTing Egyptian monuments, it is better to
stick to the name itself, rather than trying to translate the name into English.
Names
Names referring to personal condition
In a society with high infant mortality, it is not surprising that many names
reflect anxiety aboul new-born children or wishes for their future health:

The birth names of the kings themselves accord with the standard naming
conventions. Hence Amenemhet means' Amun is in front', i.e. Amun is
guiding the child's fortunes (compare with Senwosret above).
Kinship terms
Stelae emphasise family relationships by naming members of the deceased's
family and household (often including servants and dependants). The living
members are usually shown presenting offerings to the offering-table, thus
eternalising the offering cult to the deceased owner in stone. By including the
Ut'scripliol1 71
various relatives and dependants on the monument of the deceased. these
too enjoyed the benefits of being commemorated by figure and by name.
Access to such monuments as funerary stelae was rather limited, mostly to
those holding some form of elite position. The crucial relationship was that
between the father and the eldest son: in social terms, this was the route of
inheritance, providing family continuity; in cult terms, the eldest son was the
chief celebrant for his father (as Horus was for Osiris).

The parentage of the owner is usually introduced by one of the two
following phrases:

Literally, Ir-n means 'whom X made' and ms-n means 'whom X bore'.
Usually ir·n is lIsed of both the father and mother, whereas ms-n is used of
the mother alone. When the person this phrase is applied to is feminine,
both, as usuaL show a CO> ·1 (before __". n).

5.4 Study exercise: BM BA 1783
73
In this exercise, you can make a start on studying a more complex stela in
the British Museum: BM EA 1783, the stela of the governor fnhuretnakht
and his wife Hui from Nag' ed-Deir. The stela is shown on p. 74.
a. Transliterate and nanslate the offering formula at the top of the stela
(Lines 1-2 ending with the word qd just before the end of Line 2) , using the
notes given.
h. Transliterate and translate the section starting at the beginning of Line 4
(we shall return to the section from the end of Line 2 to the end of Line 3 in
Chapter 7).
The cemetery of Nag' ed-Deir, opposite modem Girga, was the ceme
tery for Thinis (:.. :~@ tni), the capital of the 8th Upper Egyptian nome
(which also includes Abydos) ; In -/:lrt (Inhuret or Onuris) was its principal
deity. Nag' ed-Deir was an important cemetery centre from Predynastic
times 10 the 11 th dynasty and the start of the Middle Kingdom, at which
time Thinis seems to have been eclipsed by Abydos.

BM EA 1783
(carved and painted limestone; H. 66cm)
Description 75
BM EA 1783 dates from the First Intermediate Period and is a classic
example of the regional Nagr ed-Deir style of that period, both in terms of its
artwork and the conventional phraseology of the inscription, which is ori
entated around the family and ethical behaviour.
Notes
i ' , is a determinative of prt-fJrw. See §26, p. 38
ii See Chapter 3 for the various titles of Inhuretnakht and the use of
ImJhw 'the revered one'. Be careful with the title at the start of line 2.
v
iii Self-presentation inscriptions are usually cast as a speech, and are intro
duced by r;!d 'who says' or dd~f'he says'.
iv See §35 for the omission of the first person pronoun.
v r;!s(=I) is used as the emphatic reflexive (as in 'I shall do that myself' or
'my own house').
vi Before mant the preposition m 'in' has been omitted.
vii Ir(l) ' do, make ' is u sed here in the sense of 'acquire' or possibly 'raise'.

Chapter 6
Further aspects of description
In this chapter; we will look at how complex descriptions are presented, in particular
continuing to the next point and noting other things going 011 atlha/time.
Now is a good lime for you to start using the Egyptian-English vocabulary
(starting on p. 151), when reading the examples in the text.
§38 Continuation
Descriptions are often presented as a series of connected episodes. In past
descriptions, as we saw in Chapter 5, the first episode is introduced by an
auxiliary such as lw, then described by a verb in the past tense made up of
the sdm.n( f) form. A past description is continued on simply by carrying on
with the sdm.n( f) without any funher introductory auxiliary. In translating
such a series, it is useful to translate the following sdm.n(-f)s with 'and .. .'
(there is no separate word for 'and' in Egyptian), or to use commas or semi
colons, depending on English style:
The official Intefson of Senet proclaims his ethical behaviour in general terms:
BM EA 562,
Lines 10-11:
iw J,rs.n=i I,(w) /:lbs.n=i h,y
J buried the old and 1clothed the naked
Here the second past tense form ~Jr::: ~ j:zbs.n=i 'I clothed' carries on the
description of Intet's ethical behaviour, rather than starting a new point.
Notice how this gives a sense of shape and connection to episodes; for a clear
example of the use of auxiliaries and sdm.n(=f)s to give shape to description,
see Exercise 6.5 below.
Sometimes elements are shared, just as in the English translation:
Inhuretnakht is extolling his proper conduct as a responsible official:
BM EA 1783,
Line 4: Iw rdi.n(=I) t 11 hkr
/:lbs 11 hlY
FIIJ'lila ,/sprds vjJt'saiplill/l 81
I gave bread to the hungry and clothes 10 the naked
; ..}('ID') rdi.n(=i) 'I gave' is shared: 'I gave bread to the hungry and (\ gave)
clothes to the naked'.
Ity notes his success and achievement:
BM EA 586,
Line 2:
Notes
Iw w/1II1.n( I) /:lst Ur nsw
.1'1 ib(=I) r itw(=i) !Jprw r-J:lit=1
1 repeated favour before the king and advanced my heart further than my forefathers who existed before me
i ' i .n(=i) '[ .. -(e)d' is shared: 'I repeated favour ... and (I) advance(d)
my heart'.
ii r 'to, in relation to' sometimes has the sense of 'more than'.
iii bprw 'who existed' is a participle (sce Chapter 7).
§39 Negation
The negative of the past ('I did not do that') is made up of the negative word
-'- 11 followed by sdm( f) (il is not, as we might expect. formed by n
s!lm.ll( f)!):
FollowinH on immediately from his statement oJ positive ethical virtues (see above),
Intef adds:
BM EA 562, I.ine 11: n tr(;i) iwit r rm{
I did not do wrong against people (or: I did no \,vrollg .. ")
This negation also occurred in the opening scene to this book (notice the
slightly stronger translation with 'never'):
Above the man roasting a goose:
Meir Ill, pI. 23:
. "'" 0Q • "" D
-Jo- ~ 1tf ~ \\ c _ > Jt ."......,
n m3=i mi(v snv pn
I have never seen the like of this goose
Sometimes the negatioIl is written (rather confusingly!) with ,.,."' .



82 How to read Egyptian hi~ro9Iyph;'
The official Key notes his ethical virtues:
~}~lit:re
BM EA 558, Line 5: " dws(=I) s n Itry-tp f
Tdid not denounce a cnaIl tu his superior
Negations with ".A.. do not go with auxiliaries and so the pattern can either
be used to stan up or to carry on a series of connected episodes without any
obvious written mark,
§40 Making someone do something (for use with Exercise 6,5)
Causation, the notion of 'making someone do something', is expressed in
the following way in Egyptian: the verb rdl 'give, place' is used with the
sense of 'causing' and is followed by another verb, rdi appears in whatever
fonn is suitable (in the example below it appears in the past tense sdm.n(-f)
fOlm) whilst the other verb appears in a fixed form (as it happens, the other
verb appears in the future sdm( f), for which see Chapter 8; however, this is
not important at this point):
After the festivities are over, Ikhernofret has the image of the god placed back in the
bark (see Exercise 65 for the general context of this example):
di.n=1 Wdl f r-hnw wrl
Berlin 1204,
Lines 21-22: [ had him proceed inside the great bark (literally, '[ caused that he proceed inside the great bark')
It may help to think of this as 'placing someone in the position to do some
thing' or 'giving someone the opportunity to do something'; hence the
example would mean: 'I put him (in the position) to proceed inside the great
bark' or 'I facilitated his proceeding into the great bark' _The precise meaning
can range from nuances of compulsion ('make someone do something') to
permission ('allow/let someone to do something') and guidance ('have
someone do something').
§4I Dependent pronouns
The second set of pronouns are the dependent pronouns (see Reference table, p. 149):
[ } ~ or} -wi or -w(i)
you ~ ,} or o.}. -(w or -tw
he/it t } or t ~ -sw
she/it r" or ~ -slY)
The major usage of the dependent pronouns are as the objects of verbs (typ
ically the person or thing to which the verbal action is applied):
•
,
-
Further aspects of description
Tietii records that, after Imef 11 died, he served the new king Intef 1Tl:
BM EA 614,
Line 13: Iw sms.,,(=I) -sw r .,(w)t4 nbl nfrt nl sljmlj-Ih
I followed him to all his places of the hean-s delight
(i.e. wherever the king wanted to go)
83
Notice that the suffix pronouns serve as subjects of the verb (see §§33 and
36) and dependent pronouns as objects of the verb,
The dependent pronouns display an important feature of word order
ing: the dependent pronouns attach to and directly follow the verb and so
precede any nouns:
The official Semti refers to his early favour at court:
BM EA 574,
Lines 2- 3: iw dl.n -wi I,zm fr rdwy fm nljnt(=ij
His person (i.e. the king) placed me at his feet in my youth
If you look carefully at this example, then -wl is a dependent pronoun and
therefore should be the object of the verb (someone must have placed me)
and so the sentence must mean that the king placed me at his feet, despite
the order of the words_ This sentence cannot mean: 'r placed the king at his
feet in my youth' (for T to be the subject, this would req uire the suffix pro
noun =1) and in any case such a sentence scarcely makes much sense,
§42 The present tense
The monuments discussed in this book do not include many inscriptions cast
in the present tense. However, for your information, and to allow us to cover
one inscription we would otherwise have shown you but not equipped you
to read, we will brief!y note the present tense forms.
Middle Kingdom Egyptian distinguishes, just as English does, between
a general present (usually expressing habit - She goes to visit her friend every
week' - or things which just generally are - 'two and two make four') and
a specific or ongoing present (,She is leaving right now'), In Middle Egyptian
these have the following form (using sdm to label the fOlm and the weak
verb ir(i) to exemplify it):
GENERAL PRESENT
sdm f SPECIFJC PRESENT
Itr sdm
9 =- !Ir irt (he) is doing
la
In the spedfic present, the verb appears after I,zr in the infinitive form discussed
in Chapter 4. For a fuUllst of forms, see the Reference tables on p. 145,
Both tenses have a fondness for the auxiliary Q) tw introduced in §34
as illustrated by the examples below, They also share the same intricacies of



84 How to read EHyptian hieroHiyphs
usage as their English equivalents (for example, in Egyptian, as in English,
verbs of state and condition prefer the general present to the specific present
even when referring to things going on now: '1 know the answer now', not
'1 am knowing the answer now'):
a. 5I1m(=j)
To the left of the main offerinH formula inscription on BM EA 587:
BM EA 587: Iw web /1J m t hnkt mlr mrht
y •• - •
The thousand(s) of bread, beer, incense and oil are pure
b. hr sdm
.
An example of this construction occurred in the first inscription shown to
you in this book:
Above the man roasting a goose:
~} iti' ~ .Lln}Cl, oh{, 9,
Meir III, pI. 23: Iw=1 itr 'l1'k ejr pit
I have been roasting since the beginning of time
Egyptian, like many languages, concentrates on the fact that the subject is
continuing to roast despite the long time he has been doing it: 'I am still
roasting and have been since the beginning of time'.
§43 Other things going on (advanced notes for use with Exercise 6.5)
However, there is one use of the present tense which will be useful when you
study Exercise 6.5. In past description, as we have seen, the past events are
described by using the past tense sdm.n( j) for Ill. By stringing together a
present sdm(-j) fom1 or 1;r sdm form after a past sdm.n(~j), Egyptian expresses
the notion of something else going on at the same time as that event expressed
by the sl1m.n(- j) form (something else current or present at that time):
lkhernofret relates his activities during the performance of the Mysteries of Osiris:
Berlin 1204,
Line 17:
Notes
iw ir.n=1 pr! Wp-WJwt wdJ=[ r Ild It l'

conducting.
ii r nd preposition + infinitive 'to protect'.
•
I·,
I ',
,
,
...~
,,
Further aspects of description 115
Notice that there is no Egyptian word for 'when', 'while', 'as' in these usages,
although the appropriate English word may be needed in translation. [n
English, the notion of 'going on at the same time' is expressed by connecting
words such as 'as', 'whilst', 'when'. In Egyptian it is the verb itself which
expresses this by appearing in a present tense form (present or going on at
that time). Indeed, you may have noticed that whereas in English connec
tions are shown by words such as 'and' and 'as', in Egyptian the same
meaning is achieved by stringing together different tenses such as sl1m.n( j)
and sdm( j) and letting the verbs do the work.

The celebration of the Mysteries of Osiris at Abydos was clearly one of the
major festivals of Middle Kingdom Egypt. The festival centred around the
burial and rejuvenation of Osiris. with its promise of burial and rejuvenation
for the blessed dead. Indeed, as discussed in Chapter 4, a number of the elite
erected stelae or cenotaphs in the area bordering the route to ensure their
eternal participation in the rites.
The festival itself seems to have comprised five parts:
I The first procession led by Wepwawet and culminating in combat
against the enemies of Osiris. This seems to have been a celebration of
kingship with the repelling of the forces of chaos and disorder (possibly
reflecting the threat of disorder at the death of the old king Osiris - see
p. 41 for the mythological account).
2 The great procession of Osiris himsell. This seems to have been the start
of the burial procession of Osiris as the dead king, when he was
equipped and prepared for burial. Osiris here appeared in his form of
Khentyimentu 'the one who is foremost of the westerners' and was
taken out from the temple through the surrounding cemetery site.
3 The god's boat-journey to Poker. The god was conveyed in the great
bark out into the desert to his supposed tomb at Poker (probably the
tomb of King Djer of the First Dynasty at Umm el-Qa'ab).
4 A night of vigil in which the god was rejuvenated as Wenennefer (see
p. 42), including the Haker-festivities and a slaughter of the enemies of
Osiris at Nedyet (the mythological place of his death). Unfortunately,
this remains the most secretive and elusive part of the mysteries,
though later accounts mention that Osiris was crowned with the crown
of justification ( ~ .!!}~ mJ'· l]rw) and transfigured or enspirited
(r~. ~. SII]).
5 The return journey to Abydos among general rejoidng and the rc-entry
of the god into his temple.
The stela of the Treasurer Ikhernofret, now in Berlin, is one of the prin
cipal sources for the Osiris Mysteries. Ikhernofret was sent to Abydos by



88 How TO read b~qyprian hierog/yp/zs
Senwosret III to repair the image of the god and to perform the necessary
ritual acts. He subsequently erected a stela in which he recounts how he
organised the festival (an account which draws on previous versions given
by earlier generations of offidals sent by the Middle Kingdom kings to
Abydos).
a. Transliterate and translate the following sections from the stela of
Ikhernofret:
~} 4T>.it LJ < • ~ it1 .Il

bark and put the proper regalia on the god, then:

The stela is unfortunately silent on the most mysterious features of the festivities such
as the night of vigil and the Haker-festivities (compare with BM EA 567 in Study
Exercise 8.3). There follows a descriprion ofthe rejoicing along the route back, ending
with the boat arriving at Abydos, then:

i r nd preposition + infinitive, translate 'to protect'. On the writing of It,
'father', see Exercise 2.5: read here It~f'his father'.
ii You may find §43 helpful in translating wdJ- f and sms=i.
ill You may find §27 on the direct and indirect genitive helpful.
iv asr as an adjective means 'sacred' (in t! <isr 'sacred land') and as a verb
means 'to clear (something) out'; in this text the verb is deliberately
chosen to mark the transition of the festival from the public view to the
hidden mysteries to take place at the tomb, and this happens once the
procession has passed through U dsr.
v See §40 on di.n=i followed by a verb to express causation.
vi hrw pf'that day', translate '(on) that day .. :
vii The bark of Osiris is called the Neshmet-bark (nImt) or else is simply
referred to as the great bark (wrt); both are feminine words and are ref
ered to by the feminine pronoun =s 'it' in In.n =s 'it brought' (for in(l)
'bring', see p.44). See the reference table on suffix pronouns on p. 148.

b. Look at the episodes in this section from the stela of Ikhernofret and
examine how Iw and the past tense sdm.n(=f) form are used to give shape to
the passage. As a guide, note that in most instances, the auxiliary Iw is fol
lowed not by one but by two or three past-tense verbs; only in the sentence
beginning iw dsr.n=i is iw followed by a single verb. How does your gram
matical account correlate with the different sections of the festival?

a. The stela on p. 90 is by no means an easy text, but with the help of the
following notes, have a go at transliterating and translating the top section
of this stela or use the key on p. 170 to work through it.
Notes
i On dating and the titles of the king, see §§ 17-19. The king's cartouche
is surmounted by the sky hieroglyph, which is not read.
ii w~m ~st 'to repeat favour' with w~m in the sdm.n( f) form. On the
omission of =1 '1', see §35.
iii S'l 'to advance' (one's position, here 'heart') literally, 'to make great'.
The full form would have been s'l.n=l, see §38 on coordination and
sharing. r has the sense here of 'more than'.
iv bprw 'who existed' is a participle (see Chapter 7 for discussion).
v The section beginning Iw IS.n is another example of coordination, here
dealing with the king's gift of a great seal (btm 'l) and a staff (Jryt) to lty.
Is(i) lit. 'to tie on', is used for the seal which the king tied around Ity's
neck, but this precise meaning does not really go with the decorated
staff which lty was also given, so translate 'assign (to)'.
vi ml sps-nsw nb 'just like any dignitary of the king' (which you might
wish to put in brackets) goes with the first gift (the seal), and contrasts
with the special gift of the staff (with which Ity is depicted in the lower
scene) . sps-nsw is a conventional designation.
vii sw'bt is a participle with feminine agreement with lryt 'staff', translate
'(which was) decorated'. See Chapter 7.
viii it-nlr 'god's father'. In the Middle Kingdom, this seems to have been a
title bestowing high rank and favour on an official, typically for per
forming special commissions for the king to do with the cult of the
gods, and also legitimating him for this task. Perhaps here the title is
directly connected to the episode of the king's assignment of the great
seal and a staff to Ity.
ix The text ends abruptly with the names of Ity and Iuri. The wife's name
is separated off by a vertical bar.

Characterisation
This chapter concentrates on the elaborate epithets which abound on stelae, particu
larly epithets characterising the owner as having lived all ethical life or having
performed well in royal service. This will also allow us to introduce you to another
extremely common Egyptian verb-form - the participle. To start with, however, we
need 10 return to adjeclives.
§44 Adjectives
You have already been introduced to adjectives in §lO. In Egyptian, these
follow and agree with the noun they describe. If the noun is feminine and
ends in -t, the adjective will also end in -I. To wrap up this topic properly, the
full list of endings arc:
SG. MSC. no special ending nfr
SG. FEM. -I nfrl
PLo MSC. -w or 0 ~~:(}) nfr(w)
PLo FEN\. -t nfrt
(The plural can be written with or without the plural strokes 1 1 I; moreover,
the ·w of the masculine plural agreement is often omitted in writing, leaving
no ending at all- this is indicated by the symbol 0 in the table above.)
Compare the following examples showing feminine singular agree
ment and masculine plural agreement:

§45 Adjectives used as nouns
Adjectives are typically used to describe other words, but they can be used
on their own to mean 'a person/people with that particular quality'. For
example, in English 'I am an Egyptian', means 'I am an Egyptian person'
(not a soldier, or a donkey, or anything else!); compare also English expres
sions such as the 'the rich' and 'the poor'. In Egyptian this is rather common:
The official Intet son of Senet, proc/aims his ethical behaviour in general terms:
BM EA 562,
Lines 10-11: iw rrs.n=i /J(w) hbs.n=1 !IlY
I buried the old and I clothed the naked
However, in Egyptian, the adjective can be singular with the meaning 'a rich
one/ (some)one rich', whereas English prefers to add a rather general word
such as 'someone' (so (BY probably means more accurately 'someone naked'
or 'the naked one').
If the idea is indefinite, abstract or general: 'anything good' or 'what is
goud', the feminine foltn of the adjective is used:
nfrt
blnt
good (n.) 'what is good'
evil (n.) 'what is bad'

Key proclaims his own ethical behaviour:

Notes
i For ink, see §49 below.
ii rid is a participle meaning'one who said', see §§48 and 49.
The meaning of the feminine f0l1l1 of the adjective as 'what is good' is similar
to the meaning of the relative form mentioned in §37.
§46 Participles
The participles are special furms of the verb which have many of the quali
ties of an adjective, particularly because they can be used to qualify nouns.

Characterisarion 95
There are two groups of participles: the present participle has the meaning
'(one) who does something'; the past participle has the meaning '(one) who
did something'. The forms of the participles in different verb classes are as
follows:
STRO-.G
DOUBLING
WEAK
EXTRA
WEAK
PRESENT OR INCOMPLETE
" f!
, (!
mrr
dd
(no r)
(one) who hears
(onc)
who sees
(one) who loves
(une) who gives
(Participles also sometimes have a -wending.)
PAST OR CO.\1PLETE
mr
rdl
(with r)
(one) who heard
(one) who saw
(one) whu luved
(one)
who gave
Basically, any verb other than a strong verb has a doubled consonaIll in the
present participle but not in the past participle. In the case of stTOng verbs,
however, it is not possible to tell the two apart on the basis of their fonns
alone. As you will see in the examples below, there is no need in Egyptian
for a separate word meaning 'who' (or 'which' or 'what') since this is an
integral part of the meaning of the Egyptian participle verb-form.
§47 Participles and epithets
Since a participle behaves a lot like an adjective, it is olten used to qualify a
noun. For example, participles are commonly used in the epithets charac
terising an official:
The ste/a ofAmeny identifies his subordinate, Sahathor. with the epithet:
BM EA 162,
Central column:
5r-::">~ ;~(:' :-:Hfr~'
bJk f mJC n sl-lh f
irr J;sst f rC nb
His true servant of his affection. who does what he favours every day
(!zsst-f'what he favours' is a present relative 101 111, see §52 below.)
In the first part of this example both >', ; mJ' 'true' and Jj~x n st-ib=f
'of his affection' help to characte!e ~,:=' bJk f'his servant'. Similarly in
the second half of the example, _ • irr is the present participle ('who does')
and is also used to elaborate the character of Sr.::=' bJk=f'his servant'.



96 How to read E~qyptian hieroglyphs
Just like an adjective, a participle must agree with the noun it describes
and so will end with", -t if the noun is feminine:
Before the figure ofMedehu, the Wife ofAmeny:
BM EA 162,
Left column:
tJn~7>g60 I
~ . e c ~!<.L . 'C7
hmt f mTt [ Irrt IJSS! f r' nb
His wile, beloved of him, who does what he favours every day
In this example, ::: irrt ('who does') agrees with ~ !:zmt 'wife'; for ~ mrt
'beloved', see §50, below.
Alternatively, a participle may show an extra } -w with masculine
plurals:
fty asserts that he advanced himselfmore than:
BM EA 586,
Line 2: it(w)=i !Jprw T-IJI!=i
my (Iore- )fathers who existed before me
§48 Participles as nouns
Again, like adjectives, participles can be used on their own to mean 'a person
who does something' or more succinctly 'one who does something'. For
example, BM EA 614 (the stela of Tjetji) introduces Tjetji himself with a long
list of his titles and epithets, induding:
e ~S)lIn.ll l ~;g" I I
c a l ! ~I' =fJt!~'C7
BM EA 614, rb brt-ib nb [
Line 1: sms -sw T nmtt [nb
one who knows the desire of his lord, one who follows him at all his journeys
(For vocabulary, see p. 106.)
In this example, rb and ~ r.ll sms are participles used on their own to
mean '(a person) who knows' and '(a person) who follows'.
Incidentally, the participle is the form used in the name of Wepwawet,
'the one who opens the ways' (compare this with his role in the Osiris Mys
teries studied in Exercise 6.5):
V~I~ WP-Wlwt Wepwawet
(Participles used on their own sometimes translate well as an English agen
tive noun ending in '-er', here 'the opener of the ways'.)
§49 Characterisation with 0 Ink

This construction is typically used to characterise someone as the type of

person with certain qualities or attributes; in effect, it answers the question
'what was I like?', 'who was I?', focusing on ethical behaviour and success
and achievement:
The self-presentation section of the stela of Hekaib begins in the following way:
BM EA 1671,
Line I: ink nds i~T
I was an astute individual
Ink is the T -form (first person) of a third and last type of pronoun, called the
independent pronoun because it can come at the beginning of a statement:
Ink I Independent pronoun, written with the
D33 pot, read here as In.
Notice that in this example there is no word for 'was' in this construction
(the statement could also be translated in the present tense, i.e. 'J am an
astute individual', but here the past tense seems appropriate to the idea of
an official looking back over a life presented as now ended).
Tt is not unusual to find the use of qualifying expressions such as
participles:
The self-presentation of Hekaib continues:
BM EA 1671,
Line I:
o -n ..... n Ll ....... ~' >
'=" 'il'~l!f~< .=(jil(o, I .
ink nlis ikr
4dmr [
I was an astute individual,
who spoke with his (own) mouth
The owner is referred to the second time in the third person: • f moving
from the specific individual to a generalized social characterisation by char
acterising the first person T (specific individual) in generalized third person
terms ('one who spoke with his own mouth').
In this example, the adjective (~<Ll> Ii>r' astute') and the participle (~
dd 'who spoke') both qualify t.;r~:it nds. Often, however, ink is followed
by a participle used on its own, to create a statement which means 'I was
someone who did' (when using the past participle):
The official Key makes a common statement about appropriate behaviour:
BMEA 558,
Line 4: ink dd nfTt
J was one who said what is good



98 How to read b~qyptial1 hierog/yphs
This characterisation construction tells us about what he was like. 11 does
not mean '[ said what is good ' - this would be a description, using the past
tense sgm.n(=!) form, and would tell us about what he did, rather than what
he was like:
A made-up example to illustrate the point il1 the text:
iw dd.lt=i n!rt
I said what is good
The two constructions differ clearly in form and also in meaning, just as their
English translations do.
§50 Passive participles
Participles can either be active ('one who loved') or passive (,one who was
(be)loved' ). Unfortunately, the passive participles do not uSllally have a dis
tinctive writing in Egyptian. However, the most common examples in our
inscriptions concern the verbs ,"': ~ mr(i) 'luve' and 2~ J:zs(i) 'favour'
which, as weak verbs, in the past passive participle do sometimes show a dis
tinctive ~~ -y ending in the past passive participle. Since this is a rather
common usage, we will discllss the point in some detail:
Tnhuretnakht declares his status within his family:
BM EA 1783,
Lincs 2- 3: Ink mry n ic-f T was one beloved of his father
•
In such a usage, the passive participle is often followed by the genitive 'of',
either the indirect genitive (as in the last example) ur the dire~1 genitive:
Tjerji declares his status in relation to the king:
BM EA 614,
Line 3:
o\~ ~:::."
Ink mry nb !
I was one beloved of his lord
The passive participle may even be followed by a suffix pronoun:

Cha racterisation
and favoured of him (or, 'his favoured onc') in the coursc of cvcry day
99
In expressions of familial affection, <~ ~ mr(i) sometimes occurs in the
present/incomplete participle form ~: :} mrrw. The reasun for this is still
much discussed and may have to do with the presence of the following
plural genitive expression. However, a much easier way to understand this
in the next example is to note that that the previous generati on (the owner's
mother and father) take the past passive participle, whereas his siblings (Le.
the present generation from his point of view) take the present passive
participle:
Inhuremakht 's full dedaralion of his status within his family (this completes Study
Exerdse 5.4):
BM EA 1783,
lines 2-3: Ink mry n II=!tIsy n mwc=! mrrw snw f snwt-! Im(J) n Jbc=!
I was onc beloved of his father, praised of his mother, beloved of his siblings, and one gracious oflto his household
As an alternative, mrrw might be translated as a masculin e relative furm
see §52 below - and the translation reshaped: 'one whom his siblings love
and one gracious to his household'.
Finally, you have already encountered the past passive usage on a
number of occasiuns in various labels of filiation. A particularly good exam
ple occurs on BM EA 584, to be studied in Chapter 8:
Label before one ofthe sons of Khuenbik offering fOWl:
BM EA 584: SJ4 mry=!ptf/-tIcp
His son, his belov~d, Ptahholep
Often, though, we find a more abbreviated writing:
Label before the first sons in the third row ofBM EA 571.
BM EA 571: SJ-f mry=f ImPlY
His son, his beloved, Am~ny
(In idiomatic English we might prefer 'his bt'loved son'.)



100 How to read Egyptian hit'roglyplls
§51 In + noun + participle
The participles arc also used in a construction introduced by qM",', In : in +
noun + participle 'it is so-and-so who did' , Like its English equivalent. this
construction highlights the person who performs an action. It occurs quite
commonly in a dedication formula which identifies the donor of a stela:
The label above Niptahkau on the ste/a dedicated to his father Khuenbik (see Chapler
8, pp, 122-3):
:?:' r5f-~u: ~I}j]"ol u

BM EA 584: 111 sl=/s'ni; rn-/m-r l~dlV n-prh-klw
It is his son who made his name live (on) . the overseer of builders Niplahkau
§52 Relative forms again
In §37 above wc introduced you to the past relative form . The relative form
is in fact similar in usage to the participle. First of all, here is a table of the
forms of the relative forms in the present and the past. As with the previous
section on the relative form §37, we shall exhibit the form with a -/
(although, as you will see, this is actually the -/ of feminine agreement):
PRESENT OR INCO MPLETE
STRONG samt=/ what he hears
DOUBUNG mill=! what he sees
WEAK mrrl-/ what he' loves
EXTRA WEAK a (j ddt=/ what he gives
PAST UR COMPLETE

DOUBLING ,~ D
ffl. ~;;.•• 1I1",n4 what he saw
WEAK mrt.n4 what he loved
EXTRA WEAK rdll ,n=/ what he gave
(Compare with the forms of the participles in §46 above.)
In particular, like participles, rdative forms display certain adjectival
qualities. Thus they agree with the noun they accompany, for example
taking a -t when going with feminine words. A good example occurs in the
offering formula:
•
,
••
,
,
•
•,
The offering formula in BM EA 558:
BM EA 558.
Line 2: tu -nbt n/r(t) w' b(t) 'n!!1 1J!r IIn
C11<1 ra cterisa tiOlI
everything good and pure on which a god lives
101
Also, just like adjectives, the relative forms show this helpful extra C'> -(
when used on their own with the meaning 'what someone does/did':
The stela ofAmeny identifies his subordinate, Sahathor, with the epithet:
BM EA 162, blk=/ 1nl' n s/ ·lb4
Central column: irr !Jsst=/ r' nb
His lrue servant of his affection. who does what he favours every day
Masculine rdative forms do not show such a '" -t and thus are harder to
spot. Fortunately they are also fairly uncommon and need not concern us in
this book. As noted in Chapter 5, p. 71, the filiation expressions for males Ir
nand ms-n may well be examples of masculine relative forms.
Excursus: Middle Kingdom titles
In Chapter 3, various titles were introduced to provide you with a resource
for your reading. In these notes, the titles are gathered together according to
their function, to provide anOther convenient reference resource (the list
includes some titles from other stelae in the British Museum).
General tenns
Generic terms for office holding and status amongst the elite include the
following:
~ ~'"'f or 'f 7 ill office sr official
3r- i blk servant ;:;r~~ nils inwvidual
The term ~ J&D 'f Ilt is the general term for a regular office or function.
Such an office brought status, position and power, and also wealth through
its attached estate (~ pr). The term 3r- i blk 'servant' was often used as
a means of stressing the dependent relationship of one person on another
and could be used of people who otherwise had high status. 'I~~~ n!ls
'individual' was often used, particularly in the First intellnediate Period. [or
someone of high status who did not hold an official position.



102 How to read Egyptian hieroglyphs
The palace and the king
The 'palace' was an itinerant community gathered round the king, who, as
well as residing at a central residential and administrative complex, also
moved about the country in order to celebrate the festivals of Egypt's many
gods. Officials would regularly visit the palace in order to renew their
attendance on the king, before returning to the various regions to exercise
their delegated authority.

rank, the title indicated that the holder was authorised to use the royal seal.

The title (~~ m-r 'hnwty was originally more general. In origin it prob

However, by the Middle Kingdom the title had become split between a
number of different branches of the administration. A particularly common

Although we have divided secular and religious titles for convenience here,
in praaice these were intertwined in elite Middle Kingdom society, where
the same person could hold bOlh secular and religious titles at once. BM EA

Titles of women

In general women were not included in the formalisation of elite society
through office holding, which tended to be a male preserve (you may
already have noted that most women depicted on the stelae in this book are
usually referred to by their family relationship with the male owner). How
ever, some women are shown bearing a certain range of titles which usually
accord with the status of their menfolk. Of particular note for the stelae
studied in this book are those of high status:

Another common title of elite women associates them with the run·
ning of the estate. It appears on stelae from the late 12th dynasty onwards:

iv This stela shows a number of features which place its date rather late in
the sequence of stelae studied in this book. The word for Ojedu is writ
ten with two dd-signs, suggesting a date of at least the late 12th
dynasty. This is confirmed by the use of n kJ n withoutlmJO(w) (see
§26) and by the use of the ddt pt-formula. It is thought that the 'breath
of-life' formula only came into use in the 13th dynasty; if so, this would
suggest a date in the early 13th dynasty for this stela.

Chapter 8
The future
In this final chapter. we will introduce you to the 'appeal to the living' formula in
which the deceased calls upon future generations to maintain his funerary cult. We
will also look at the future tense used particularly to express wishes and expectations.
§53 The sgmty.fy form
In expressing the future, the place of the participle is taken by the sdmty.fy
form : '(someone) who will/may do something'. This form has the same uses
as the participles, but has its own particular endings. In its fullest writings
the sdmty.fy form displays the following forms:
MASCULINE FEMININE
4J),~\ 4J),~~\\
sdmlY·fy si!mly.sy
PLURAL (BOTH GENDERS)
~ e n·....•·
4J ~ \\ I', , ,
sdmty.sn
Often, however, the \\ -y of the endings is omitted:
The stela of Mentjuhotep in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, has an appeal to
the living which begins:
Fitz.E9.1922,
Line I: I 'n yw tpw tJ SWJt(y).sn /.Ir Is pn
o the living upon the earth who may pass by this tomb
(See §54 below for the form of the appeal to the living and its vocabulary.)
As with participles, the sdmty.fy form can be used with a noun (in this
example, SWJt(y).sn 'who may pass' goes with 'the living') or on its own
('someone who will do something').
§54 The appeal to the living
The appeal to the living formula is found on many stelae. A simple example is:
The appeal to the living of the chamberlain Minnefer (year 29 ofAmenemhet Il) :
BM EA 829, Lines 4-5:



112 How 10 read l'gyp/ian hieroglyphs
'd i~"I"'~I g~ ~ ~~ 1i71~'~ ~ . ,
i 'nyw Ipw I! /:Im(v.-)-n/r /:Im(w)l -n!r w'bw nw r·pr pn
<fd~!n yJ 1 "n"l kl Jpd n ImJU(w) m-r 'hnwty mnw-n!r m,'-yrw
o living ones upon the eanh, the !Tm-priesls and !Tm-priestesses, and the w'b-priests of this temple, may you say, 'A thousand (of) bread, beer, ox and fowl for the revered one, the overseer of the chamber Minnefer, the justified'
(See the Reference table on p. 148 for the suffix pronoun =in 'you'.)
The appeal to the living is composed of two basic elements plus a fur
ther, optional element:
a. Hailing the visitor
The owner of the memorial addresses the passers-by; the visitors are
hailed, typically in the I'onn:
As we saw above, the ste/a ofMenljuhotep begins with an appeal to the living:
Fitz.E9.1922, line 1: I 'nyw tpw 11 ...
o the living upon the eanh ...
This is composed of the following words:
o
rnhw
• the living
(On the form of tpw 'upon', see §60 below.)
tpw (who are) upon
I, the eanh
There may follow an enumeration of the people likely to pass by - such
as temple staff and scribes - who are often hailed in passing the monumenl:
The stela ofMentjuhotep continues:
Fitz.E9.1922,
Line 1: t 'nuw tpw tl sWlt(y).sn !Tr Is pn
o the living upon the earth who may pass by this tomb
As in this example, in hailing the visitor, the verb SWJ 'to pass' (or 'by') is typ
ically used in the s4mty.JY fOIlI1: SWily.sn '(they) who shall pass'. SWJ can be
written in the following ways:
FULLER WRITINGS ABBREVIATED WRITINGS
SWJ pass (by)

b, The offering request
The owner requests that offerings or prayers be made or said for him:
From BM EA 829:
dd~ tn II' 1 /:In"l kl JPd n j''''iJ(w) m-r ·hnwty mnw-nj'r mJ'-yrw
BM EA 829,
Line 5: May you say, 'A thousand bread, beer, ox and fowl for the revered one, the overseer 01 the chamber Minnefer, the justified'
The request for saying the offering fonnula uses the future sdm( Jj form dis
cussed below in §55.
c. The appeal to goodwill or piety
The appeal to the living is often augmented by a third elemenl- an invoca
tion 01 the goodwill or piety of the visitors, or a declaration of the benefits
visitors will gain if they make the offering. Sometimes this is included in
hailing the visitors in the form of partidples:
The appeal to the living of the priest Mencuhotep:

~ n~ :::!i i;lJ rm~ \h@ C.~ '(,., '0

and who love life and who hate death.
may you say, "May Osiris Khentyirnenlll lransngure Mentjuholep'
(d} mrrwand ffi'll} msddw arc both participles; see §46 above.)
Often, however, the appeal to the goodwill or piety of the visitor takes
the form of a separate clause (here beginning
leading on to the request to say the offering:
~b...=y 0 )
~ \: <:::>("i"i m + mrr=ln
The appeal to the living of the overseer of builders Khuenbik:

o living ones who may pass by this cenotaph in going north or in going sOLlth. as you wish to follow Wepwawet at his journeys. may you say, 'Bread and heer ...'
Grammatically, the first clause is sometimes introduced by ~ m 'as' and the
request clause sometimes by ~ ~ ml ('just as ..., so you should say .. :)
§55 Wishes, expectations and requests: the future sdm(=f)
The faun used to express wishes, requests, expectations and the like is the
future sdm( f). In the appeal to the living, you have already, in fact. encoun
tered the future sdm(~j) form of ~J dd ('say'):
The appeal to the living ofthe chamberlain Minl1efer once more:

and the web-priests of this temple, may you say, 'A thousand (of) bread, beer, ox and fowl for the revered one, the overseer of the chamber Minnder. the justified'
The future s4m(=j) is a form distinct from the present s4m( j) noted in §42
above (although the two can be difficult to distinguish by the writings
alone). The future sdm( j), for example, is not used with auxiliaries such as
•
Iw.lts full forms are given in §59 below (you may wish to compare the writ
ings of the two forms in the reference tables on pp. 145 and 146).
§56 The Abydos formula
The Abydos formula is a fairly standardised set of afterlife wishes. The
mature version belongs to the first half of the 12th dynasty with earlier (less
standardised) versions occurring in the IIth dynasty. The full formula has
twenty elements (as in BM EA 567), but many texts contain a selection:
A brief version of the Abydosformula occurs on BM EA 162:

done by someone').
You will be studying this formula in the Exercises to this chapter.
§57 Purpose and causation
a, Purpose/result clauses
The future sdm(~j) is also used to express purpose or resull ('so that', 'in
order that'). This is the form used in the ollering formula:

We have already noted the use of the verb rdi to express causation when fol
lowed by another verb with the sense of 'to cause/havelletlallow someone
to do something' (see §40). This other verb goes in the future sdm( j) form:
Ikhernofret's description of the great procession of Osiris:

§58 Negation
The future sdm( f) in its main usage is negated by ~ nn + future sgm(=f):
,..........
'you will/may not do that':

§60 Adjectives in -y
When used with nouns, a special adjective form of the preposition is used:
The stela ofMentjuhotep:
FilZ.E9.1922,
Line I : i 'niJw Ipw IJ ...
o the living (who are) upon the earth ...
Here If} /pw is an adjective derived from the preposition III I Ip ('upon').
As an adjective If} IpW agrees with the noun Sf-} lit! cnbw (both show
the plural -w). This fOlIll is termed the adjective in -y (the -y o nly occurs in
the masculine Singular fOlln ), Some prepOSitions display a distinctive writing
in the adjective in -y:
P R E P O S ITIOI<

ADJECTIV E IN -y
~ +~\ IlIly (which/who is) in
Iry (which/who is) at, toward s, relating tu
H or III tpy (which /who is) upon
C 0\\ •
Adjectives in -y agree with their nouns in number and gender:

master of secrets (literally. the one upon secrets)
IJry
hbl
•
lector priest (literally, the one carrying the lector book)
(hry is derived from the preposition hr 'under', which is also used with the
sense of 'carrying'.)
Like other adjectives, the adjectives in -y ca n be used on their own
('the one who .. .', 'the thing which ...' ). A particular example is the name of
Khenlyimentu 'the foremost of the westerners':
The stela of Khuenbik begins wilh an offering formula invoking Osiris:

an adjective in -y, derived from the noun imni 'the west' and means 'the

Notes
•
i See notes to Exerdse 7.8 for the writing of the determinative of 4dw
and Ibdw.
ii Wepwawet has the epithet bnty Ibdw 'the one at the front/head of
Abydos' (see §60 above for fJnty).
iii The names of Heket and Khnum are written with their frog and ram
detelIninatives respectively.
iv fJt -nbt n[r(t) pr(r)t m-bib nlr rl 'everything good which goes before the
great god'. pr(r)t is a participle.
v In Line 5 the Abydos formula begins with ms.t(w) -n4 rwy br ... 'May
arms be presented to him carrying .. : The two groups of the venerated
dead noted are smsw n Islr 'the followers of Osiris' and tp_ r fJprw hr-bit
'the ancestors who existed before'.
vi In Line 5 -tw is the dependent pronoun 'you' (the owner Amenemhet

ix Translate nsmt wrt r nmtt=s as 'when the great nsmt-bark is at its jour
neys ' .
x In Line 10 tl-wr, the name containing Abydos, here refers to the inhab
itant of the name, hence it can have a 'mouth'.
xi Insert 'at' in your translation before hlkr in Line 10.
xii The vigil of Horus-sn or Horus the fighter remains one of the most
elusive aspects of the Osiris mysteries, although it probably refers to
part of the rites concerned with the reanimation of the dead Osiris.
When you have finished both Exercises 8.3 and 8.5, you may wish to com
pare the Abydos formulae on the two stelae.

Once you have read this stela, it will no doubt strike you that the
owner himself is actually missing from the figures shown. This is because,
like a number of stelae from Abydos, BM EA 162 belongs to a group dedi
cated in an offering-chapel at the site. Unfortunately, Abydos was cleared of
many of its Middle Kingdom monuments by collectors and early archaeolo
gists in the nineteenth century without a proper record being made of the
find-sites. It is only through the work of scholars scouring the museum col
lections of the world and sifting through the sparse archaeological record
that original groups of stelae are gradually being reassembled.
Fortunately, BM EA 162 has been allocated to a group now known
conventionally as Abydos North Offering Chapel (ANOC) 2. It has a com
panion, now in the Egyptian Museum, Cairo (CCG 20546), which shows the
same style and phraseology: the two were clearly made in the same work
shop as a pair. It too lacks a figure of Ameny himself; instead it depicts
further relatives and dependants looking from left to right (whereas in BM
EA 162 they look from right to left). This pair of stelae no doubt framed a
central stela depicting Ameny himself; one piece which has been proposed
is in the Musee du Louvre, Paris (C35).

The cover shows a detail of an inscribed ritual tool used in the rite
of 'opening the mouth' - an obscure ceremony designed to breathe
life into an embalmed corpse, a statue or an inscribed image. The
text records a dedication from Senwosret I to his celebrated prede
cessor (here termed it '(fore)father'), Mentjuhotep II of the 11th
Dynasty, who is here identified by his praenomen Nebhepetre,
MMA 24.21: ntr nfr nb l;wy s·n·wsrt
ir.n-fm mnw=f n It f nb-iJpt·r' ml'-I;rw
The perlect god, the lord of the twin lands, Senwosret: he has made a dedication for his [alher, Nebhepetre, the justified.
mnw 'dedication' refers here to the opening of the mouth implement
itself and the rites associated with it. mnw is often translated as 'monu
ment' in dictionaries, but actually refers more generally to royal
dedications, here for a celebrated royal predecessor.
The appearance of an extra m before the object mnw is a standard part
of this dedication formula, although the reason for it is still disputed by
scholars (as indeed are the intricacies of the grammar'of the formula)
so you certainly should not worry too much about it. According to one
suggestion, it indicates that it is the dedication of the object itself which
is seen as the focal-point of the formula , focusing on Senwosret's per
formance of the commemorative functions of kingship through
supplying the opening of the mouth implement for the animation of stat
ues of his celebrated predecessor.

What follows is a complete list of signs appearing in this book, with an expla
nation of the different ways in which each one has been used to write words.
Since this is a practical list designed to help you find an unfamiliar sign
quickly, more recognisable signs have been grouped into three broad cate
gories (humans, animals, nature), whilst others have been grouped by shape
(small, tall, broad). The signs are given here in a standardised font. but it
should be remembered that there will be some variation in their forms as
they appear on monuments; in particular, the details of a sign will be
alfected by whether it is painted (as on a coffin) or inscribed (as on a stela).
Readers who continue their study of andent Egyptian will eventually
need to become familiar with the systematic sign-list of Gardiner's Egyptian
Grammar (see p. 176). Since Gardiner lIsed many more categories than we
have, there is no correspondence between his list and ours in the way a par
ticular sign is classified. Here, we have used the following abbreviations: le.,
one-consonant sign; 2c., two-consonant sign; 3c., three-consonant
ideo., ideogram; corn.. sign combined with other elements.

Reference tables
Verb forms
The focus of this book is OIl reading actual monuments, rather than strug
gling through a morass of grammar. Nevertheless, a sizeable area of Egyptian
grammar has also been covered. The reference tables provided here cover
the grammar as presented in this book and are for quick reference and

companson.
Verb dasses (§30)
Middle Egyptian verb-forms show differences in their writing according to
the type of the verb. The following are the four basic verb classes:
STRONG VERBS e.g.
DOUBLING VERBS e.g. ~JhJh
WEAK VERBS e.g. ~
EXTRA WEAK VERBS e.g. • ,
Notes
sdm hear
mu see
1I1r(l) love
rd( /) •
give
stem does not usually
show any alteration
stem ends in a double consonant
stem ends with a 'weak' consonant, usually -I
chiefly verbs with two or three weak consonants
•
i With weak verbs, the final -I is usually omitted in writing and therefore
in transliteration, though for practicaI reasons we normally transliterale
'give' as rdi.
ii Extra weak verbs behave like ordinary weak verbs, but sometim es
show additional features.

Egyptian-English vocabulary
Here, as in other Egyptian dictionaries, words are listed alphabetically in
transliteration following the order set Ollt in List 1 (the only exception being
that the feminine ending -I is ignored, e.g. s 'man' and sI 'woman' arc listed
together)_ In other words, the particular hieroglyphs used to write a word
do not determine where it is listed. So to find a word, you need to know its
reading in transliteration: if necessary. consult the various Sign-lists. For
example. imagine you come across the word 4- ~ but do not recognise
its constituent signs. There are two stages in tracking down its meaning: (I)
If you turn to List V beginning on p. 129, you will find 4- (862) has the
reading llsf whilst ~ (F49) is not a sound-sign but a determinative for 'sail
upstream'; so the reading of the whole word is llsf (2) Returning TO this
vocabulary, you will find in the section headed h that there arc two words
"
read llsf: 'repel' and 'travel upstream' (see p. 158). Of course, the determi
native indicates that the second of these is the correct meaning, although.
more often than not. the context in which the word occurs will also help
you decide which of the two is COfrect. Although the hieroglyphic writings
given in this list are representative of what you may find. it is not possible
to list all of the ways in which a word could be written (see § 14 again, if you
are not yet sure about this). The following abbreviations have been used
here: (a.) adjective; (n.) noun; (v.) strong verb; (w.v_) weak verb; (f.) femi
nine; (pI.) plural.
A } JIV (a. ) long; joyful
~ J':',lf(~ Jbl (n.) family. household

Bibliography and further reading
The following bibliography is highly selective and aimed at works which will
supplement this book and aid you in further reading and study. We have
tried to concentrate on books which are still in print and available through
major stockists. However, some works of particular relevance for the topics
covered in this book will probably on Iy be found in speCialist librari es and
these are prefixed with *.
Hieroglyphs
On hieroglyphs, two books in particular can be recommended to comple
ment the early part of this book:
w.v. Davies, Egyptian Hieroglyphs, Reading the Past series, British
Museum Press, London 1987.
J . Malek, ABC of Egyptian Hieroglyphs, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford
1994.
Kings' names
A fuller list of the cartouches of the kings of Egypt can be found in:
S.J. Quirke, Who were the Pharaohs? A History oftheir Names with a List of
their Cartouches, British Museum Press, London 1990.
Stelae
If you are interested in extending your reading of stelae and coffins, then
examples for study are on display in most major museums. In the UK. the
following museums have particularly suitable collections (the list is not
exhaustive and a number of other museums and private collections also
have Middle Kingdom stelae and coffins on display):
Southern England: British Museum, London; Ashmolean Museum,
Oxford; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.
Northern England: Merseyside County Museum, Liverpool; The
Manchester Museum; The Oriental Museum, Durham.
Scotland: Royal Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh; Kelvingrove Art Gal
lery and Museum, Glasgow.
However, if you ha ve access to a good specialist library (such as the library of
the Egypt Exploration Society, open to members of the society) then the fol
lOwing two works contain a number of interesting stelae for study:
Bibliography and fUr/her readin8 175
The most convenient collection of Abydos stelae remains:
* W.K. Simpson, The Terrace ofthe Great God at Abydos: The Offering Chap
els of Dynasties 12 and 13., Publications of the Pennsylvania-Yale
Expedition to Egypt No. 5, Peabody Museum of Natural Hislory
and The University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania,
New Haven and Philadelphia 1974.
(This book contains photographs of a number of Abydene Middle Kingdom
stelae from museum collections around the world, including some of the
stelae studied here, reassembled by Simpson into the original groups of
monuments found at Abydos.)
The following title contains a number of stelae from Nag' ed-Deir of a similar
kind to BM EA 1783 (p. 74) :
* D. Dunham, Naga-ed-Der stelae ofthe First Intermeditate Period, Museum
of Fine Arts, Boston 1937.
Coffins
A convenient introduction 10 coffins and their development is:
J .H. Taylor, Egyptian Coffins, Shire Publications, Aylesbury 1989.
A more detailed discussion of Middle Kingdom coffins can be found in:
* H.O. Willems, Chests of Life: A Study of the Typology and Conceptual
Development of Middle Kingdom Standard Class Coffins, Orientaliste,
Leuven 1988.
Religion: Osiris and the afterlife
A convenient recent account is provided in:
S.J. Quirke, Ancient Egyptian Religion, British Museum Press, London
1992 (espedally Chapters 2 and 5).
Titles
There is no readily available general work on titles to aid you in your read
ing. However, a convenient listing of titles by function can be found in:
* S.J. Quirke, 'The regular titles of the late Middle Kingdom', Revue
d'Egyptologie 37 (1986), pp. 107-30.
Otherwise, the major listing of Middle Kingdom titles with hieroglyphs,
transliteration and translation is:
* W.A. Ward, Index of Egyptian Administrative and Religious Titles of the
Middle Kingdom. with a Glossary of Words and Phrases Used, Ameri
can University in Beirut Press, Beirut 1982 .
Translations
The most convenient set of translations for Middle Kingdom stelae (which
includes a number of, but far from all, the examples in this book) is:



•

* M. Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Autobiographies chiefly of the Middle
Kingdom: A Study and an Anthology, Orbis Biblicus er Orientalis 84,
Universitatsverlag, Freiburg and Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, Got
tingen 1988.
Some stelae are also included in Lichtheim's earlier and more readily avail
able book:
M. Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature, l: The Old and Middle KinHdoms,
University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles 1973.
A more recent anthology of translations from a variety of Middle Kingdom
texts, including stelae, is:
R.B. Parkinson, Voices from Ancient EHypt. An AntholoHY ofMiddle KinHdom
Writings, British Museum Press, London 1991.
Dictionaries and sign-lists
The most convenient dictionary in English remains:
R.O. Faulkner, A Concise Dictionary ofMiddle EHyptian, Griffith Institute,
Oxford 1962.
A more comprehensive sign-list with an extensive discussion of the use of
signs is included at the end of:
A.H. Gardiner, EHyptian Grammar, Being an Introduction to the Study of
HieroHlyphs. 3rd edition, Griffith Institute, Oxford 1957.
Both of these works are still in print and readily available.
Grammar
Gardiner's EHyptian Grammar also remains the most comprehensive treat
ment of ancient Egyptian in English, although a number of the sections on
the verb (occupying the second half of the book) are now rather dated.
Our book is not intended as a grammar book, but lying behind the
presentation of the language is the particular 'verbalist' approach developed
by Mark Collier in a number of specialist papers. A similar 'verbalist'
approach is conveniently presented in;
A. Loprieno, Ancient Egyptian: A LinHuistic Introduction, Cambridge
University Press, Cambridge 1995.
This book also provides a concise account of the historical development of
ancient Egyptian language and scripts.
