Mohenjo-daro Great bath, Dholavira, Lothal reservoirs
were called taḍāga 'reservoirs' used by artificer guilds
-- used in industrial scale operations with a large number of circular platforms evidenced in Harappa
--used by ताडघः tāḍagha 'artificers, smiths' (Pāṇini 3-2,55) & textile-dye artificers, शौल्बिकः
'coppersmiths'; the word ताडघः tāḍagha is attested in a Brāhmī inscription on an Indus Script Anthropomorph
--I submit that the word taḍāga 'reservoirs' is cognate/associated with ताडघः tāḍagha 'artificers, smiths'
--I submit that the circular worker platforms were phaḍa, paṭṭaḍe, 'metals manufactory' with the central region holding the ? paṇ anvil (Kota) or dyers' vats: paṭṭaṟai anvil, smithy, forge. Ka. paṭṭaḍe, paṭṭaḍi anvil, workshop.

śulba or śulva ‘copper’; ‘vicinity of water’ (Monier-Williams); 'proximity of water, a place near it' (Apte).
I submit that the workplace of शौल्बि कः or ṭhö̃ṭhar ठााँ॑ठर् or ṭhö̃ṭhur ठााँ॑ठु र् 'brassworkers,
coppersmiths' artisans is near the water reservoirs. The ancient artisans were called ताडघः tāḍagha 'artificers, smiths', as evidenced by the Anthropomorph with Brāhmī inscription overlay.
These water reservoirs were also used by textile dyers as surmised by Jonathan M Kenoyer.

samjñā 'symbol, sign' kī ma jhi tha 'of Majhitha'
Sha (ta?) Da Ya (Gha?) Line 3 is read as taDagha. The word attested by Pāṇini is tāḍagha m. a kind of artificer (blacksmith?), Pāṇini 3-2,55. Thus, the later-day holder of the professional calling card (a possible descendant from the days of Sindhu-Sarasvati Civilization) proclaims himself as Majhitha tāḍagha 'Textile dyer, goldsmith'
The water reservoirs of Mohenjo-daro, Dholavira and Lothal thus served not only irrigation purposes but also the needs of smiths who have to situate their workplaces in the proximity of water. Thus, taḍāga 'reservoirs' were used by ताडघः tāḍagha 'artificers, smiths', शौल्बिकः 'coppersmiths'.
"The "great bath" is without doubt the earliest public water tank in the ancient world. The tank itself measures approximately 12 meters north-south and 7 meters wide, with a maximum depth of 2.4 meters. Two wide staircases lead down into the tank from the north and south and small sockets at the edges of the stairs are thought to have held wooden planks or treads. At the foot of the stairs is a small ledge with a brick edging that extends the entire width of the pool. People coming down the stairs could move along this ledge without actually stepping into the pool itself.The floor of the tank is water tight due to finely fitted bricks laid on edge with gypsum plaster and the side walls were constructed in a similar manner. To make the tank even more water tight, a thick layer of bitumen (natural tar) was laid along the sides of the tank and presumably also beneath the floor. Brick colonnades were discovered on the eastern, northern and southern edges. The preserved columns have stepped edges that may have held wooden screens or window frames. Two large doors lead into the complex from the south and other access was from the north and east. A series of rooms are located along the eastern edge of the building and in one room is a well that may have supplied some of the water needed to fill the tank. Rainwater also may have been collected for this purposes, but no inlet drains have been found.Most scholars agree that this tank would have been used for special religious functions where water was used to purify and renew the well being of the bathers." -- JM Kenoyer https://www.harappa.com/slide/great-bath-mohenjo-daro-0

This reservoir is seen close to the citadel and is smaller in size than the other reservoirs found around the city. The Manhar river channel on the east filled up the Citadel reservoirs first. https://www.harappa.com/slide/smallreservoir-dholavira
Aerial view of Dholavira.The Citadel is seen on the southern side with reservoir on the east. The major reservoirs are seen on the north and west side of the picture. [Which sides, top or bottom?]
North Wall Reservoir Dholavira A large
reservoir located on the northern
periphery of the city. According to town
planning and location of middle and
lower town, large reservoirs were used for
industrial purposes.-- Sagar Bhenderi

A large reservoir with a storm water drain on from the Southern end. This is a part of a series of reservoirs found on the south, west and north of the built-up area. A feeding drain can be seen emerging from the south of the reservoir. The rectangular shape of the reservoir was 73 meters North – South and 30 meters east – west. The reservoir was provided with 30 steps each.-- Sagar

An inlet channel 1.7 meters above the bottom level of the 4.26 meter deep tank allowed excess water to escape. Other inlets prevented siltation of the tanks and erosion of the banks. After a ship would have unloaded its cargo, the gates would have opened and allowed it to return to the Arabian sea waters in the Gulf of Combay.
Archaeological finds from the excavations testify to trade with ancient Egypt and Mespotamia. The hydraulic knowledge of the ancient Harappans can be judged by the fact that boats could dock at Lothal in the 1850's. In 1942 timber was brought from Baruch to nearby Sagarwala. It is said that then the dockyard could hold 30 ships of 60 tons each or 60 ships of 30 tons each. This would be comparable to the modern docks at Vishakapatnam.-Dinesh Shukla
