As protector of the universe, restoring order whenever the world falls out of balance, Vishnu is ready at a moment’s notice to descend from heaven to earth. In this stele, made for a subsidiary shrine on the wall of a temple, Vishnu sits on his divine mount, Garuda, who is part bird and part man. Vishnu carries a club and discus, weapons he uses to protect cosmic order; a conch shell, whose sound frightens enemies and drives away ignorance; and a small lotus, a symbol of purity and renewal. Near the base, two goddesses associated with Vishnu stand to either side: Lakshmi, goddess of wealth (holding a flywhisk), and Sarasvati, goddess of learning and the arts (holding the vina, a stringed instrument). Above Vishnu, a protective "kirtimukha" face looks outward, safeguarding the temple to which this sculpture once belonged. On the base, kneeling devotees look toward Vishnu, folding their hands in veneration. Mounds of grain offerings are piled behind them; their inclusion in the stele's imagery suggests some of the devotional practices current in northeastern India during the 11th century. https://art.thewalters.org/detail/39194/vishnu-riding-garuda/

Garuda is a popular figure not only in India, but is also highly revered in Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia. The Indonesian official coat of arms has the Garuda in it and the national emblem of Indonesia is known as Garuda Pancasila. The Indian Air Force also has the Garuda in their coat of arms, and their special operations unit is known as Garud Commando Force.

Garuda on the inner side of the middle architrave of the eastern gateway of Sanchi (1st c. BCE)
Garuda with a three hooded Naga on a torana beam from a site in Mathura, plate XXV- chapter VIII), panel sketch by Vincent Smith, 1901In Gandhara art Garuda appears as a large eagle with earrings and wings, often carrying a naga and a nagini in his beak or with his long talons. As per the Vedanta Desika’s Garuda
Panchashath and Garuda Dandaka, “Garuda wears the serpent Adisesha on his left wrist and the serpant Gulika on his right wrist. The serpent Vasuki forms his sacred thread. The cobra



32
Takshaka forms his belt on his hip. The snake Karkotaka is worn as his necklace. The snakes Padma and Mahapadma are his ear rings. The snake Shankachuda adorns his divine hair.”Silparatna and Sritatvanidhi describe Garuda as two armed, but Silparatna also gives a description of Garutman as 8 armed, holding gada, sankha, chakra, sword, kamandala, a snake, and the feet of Vasudeva-Vishnu should be resting on his two front hands. Silparatna names two armed Garuda as Tarksya. According to Visnudharmottara, Garuda should be emerald in colour, with two powerful lustrous wings that are yellow in colour, four arms, a pot belly, two round eyes; and the beak, chest, knees, and legs must look like that of a kite. His two back hands should be carrying a pot of nectar and an umbrella, while his front hands should be in anjali mudra. When carrying Vishnu Garuda should be depicted as bejeweled and pot-bellied, and
supporting his master’s legs instead of carrying the pot and umbrella. While Silparatna depicts
only the 8 armed Garuda as carrying a snake, the Sritatvanidhi says that Garuda is the holder of a snake hood (phaniphanabhrt) and his head is adorned with snakes (phanimanditah). The epics and the Puranas also lay stress on his association with snakes. Sritatvanidhi also gives another description where it says Garuda should be shown kneeling on his left knee and wearing a crown of snakes. His face and body should be that of a human being, but his nose should be pointed and raised like a beak. He should be two armed which must be held in an anjali posture.

a portable Garuda pillar, Bharhut, 100 BCE (Wikipedia)
In early Indian art, Garuda is shown as a huge parrot like bird, as seen in the architrave of the eastern gateway of Sanchi. In front of this parrot like Garuda (with earrings and a bushy tuft) is a five headed snake, the Naga (identified by Grunwedel).
The Suparṇākhyāna, also known as the Suparṇādhyāya (meaning "Chapter of the Bird"), is a short epic poem or cycle of ballads in Sanskrit about the divine bird Garuda, believed to date from the late Vedic period. Considered to be among the "earliest traces of epic poetry in India," the text only survives "in very bad condition,"[3] and remains "little studied."
The subject of the poem is "the legend of Kadrū, the snake-mother, and Vinatā, the bird-mother, and enmity between Garuda and the snakes." It relates the birth of Garuda and his elder brother Aruṇa; Kadru and Vinata's wager about the color of the tail of the divine white horse Uchchaihshravas; Garuda's efforts to obtain freedom for himself and his mother; and his theft of the divine soma from Indra, whose thunderbolt is unable to stop Garuda, but merely causes him to drop a feather. It was the basis for the later, expanded version of the story, which appears in the Āstīka Parva, within the Ādi Parva of the Mahābhārata.
Shout, thunder, reach the clouds; these waters of thine shall be level with the mountain-tops... Undefined, wholly water, the shore shall be: the frog-female shall croak all the night. (The winds) shall milk the cloud (cow) whose trail drips with milk, the wild beast shall come seeking firm land.
— Suparṇākhyāna, ix.3 (conjuring of a storm) ()Maurice Bloomfield (1896), "On the 'Frog
hymn,' Rig-Veda vii.103, together with some remarks on the composition of the Vedic hymns", in Journal of the American Oriental Society, Volume 17, pp. 173–179. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suparṇākhyāna

Gold coin of king Samudragupta (335-375 CE). In many of the gold coins of the Imperial Guptas, Garuda appears as a plump bird with outstretched wings perched as the capital piece of a Garudadhvaja. On the silver coins of Chandragupta II Garuda is seen facing with outstretched wings of a full fledged bird; but on some his copper coins Garuda is shown with outstretched wings and long human arms wearing bracelets; while on few others Garuda is shown with wings, without the human arms, and with a snake in his mouth. On an inscribed terracotta seal of Kumaragupta I the plump bird stands facing a pedestal and the face is that of a human.

Why are dwarfs shown on Begram ivories, Bharhut, Sanchi, Mathura sculptures and stone reliefs? The reason is the Indian sprachbund gloss: kharva which means 'dwarf'. The rebusmetonymy-layered rendering reads: kharva 'a navanidhi, a treasure, wealth' (one of nine nidhis or nine treasures of Kubera). karba, ib 'iron'. The dwarf image is also used to denote gaNa of Siva or Rudra.

Stone palette. Tokyo National Museum. Called Female Triton. Triton (/ˈtraɪtən/; Greek: Τρίτων Tritōn) is a Greek god of the sea, the son of Poseidon and Amphitrite, god and goddess of the sea respectively. Triton lived with his parents, in a golden palace on the bottom of the sea. Later he was often depicted as having a conch shell he would blow like a trumpet.
Triton is usually represented as a merman, with the upper body of a human and the tailed lower body of a fish. At some time during the Greek and Roman era, Triton(s) became a generic term for a merman (mermen) in art and literature. In English literature, Triton is portrayed as the messenger or herald for the god Poseidon.

Gold armband with Triton holding a putto, Greek, 200 BC, Metropolitan Museum of Art. A putto (Italian: [ˈputto]; plural putti [ˈputti]) is a figure in a work of art depicted as a chubby male child, usually naked and sometimes winged. Originally limited to profane passions in symbolism,[2] the putto came to represent the sacred cherub (plural cherubim),[3] and in Baroque art the putto came to represent the omnipresence of God.

Sanchi[edit]
Around 115 BC, the embassy of Heliodorus from king Antialkidas to the court of the Sungas king Bhagabhadra in Vidisha is recorded. In the Sunga capital, Heliodorus established the Heliodorus pillar in a dedication to Vāsudeva. This would indicate that relations between the Indo-Greeks and the Sungas had improved by that time, that people traveled between the two realms, and also that the Indo-Greeks readily followed Indian religions.[5]
Also around the same time, circa 115 BC, it is known that architectural decorations such as decorative reliefs started to be introduced at nearby Sanchi, 6 km away from Vidisha, by craftsmen from the area of Gandhara, a central Indo-Greek region. Typically, the earliest medallions at Sanchi Stupa No.2 are dated to 115 BC, while the more extensive pillar carvings are dated to 80 BC.(Buddhist Landscapes in Central India: Sanchi Hill and Archaeologies of



43
Religious and Social Change, C. Third Century BC to Fifth Century AD, by Julia Shaw, Left Coast Press, 2013 p.90)These early decorative reliefs were apparently the work of craftsmen from the northwest (around the area of Gandhara), since they left mason's marks in Kharoshthi, as opposed to the local Brahmi script. This seems to imply that these foreign workers were responsible for some of the earliest motifs and figures that can be found on the railings of the stupa.(Buddhist Architecture Huu Phuoc Le Grafikol, 2010 p.161) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Buddhist_art
Sena. Sanchi.



44
At Bharhut, the gateways were made by northern (probably Gandharan) masons using Kharosthi marks, while the railings were made by masons exclusively using marks in the local Brahmi script. 150-100 BCE Craftsmen from the Gandhara area, a central region of the Indo-Greek realm, are known to have been involved in the construction of the gateways at Bharhut, which are dated to 100-75 BCE; this is because mason's marks in Kharosthi have been found on several elements of the Bharhut remains, indicating that some of the builders at least came from the north, particularly from Gandhara where the Kharoshti script was in use.

of a London collector, acquired early 1990s. The Atlas motif is among a range of imports from Greek and Persian art - caryatids, Ionic columns, drinking scenes, vines, acanthus leaves, Olympian gods and Dionysian revelries - which give Gandharan sculpture its unique flavour. The figure is derived from representation of the Greek myth of Atlas, whose task it was to uphold the sky; his thickset frame and stocky limbs indicate his ability to support any burden. Many examples of the Atlas figure are modelled with hands raised, or with a flattened upper surface to the head where an architectural feature was placed above, but in the present case the figure appears to be resting; it also does not sport the wings found on may other examples.
