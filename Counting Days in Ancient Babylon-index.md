ABSTRACT
STEVEN JEDAEL. Counting days in ancient Babylon: eclipses, omens, and calendrics during the Old Babylonian period (1750-1600 bce). (Under the direction of DR. JOHN C. REEVES)
Prior to the sixth century BCE, each lunar month of the Babylonian calendar is
believed to have been determined solely by direct observation of the new moon with the
insertion of intercalary months arbitrarily dictated by the king and his advisors. However,
lunar eclipse omens within the divination texts of the Enūma Anu Enlil, some which date
to the second half of the Old Babylonian period (ca. 1750-1600 BCE), clearly indicate a
pattern of lunar eclipses occurring on days 14, 15, 16, 20, and 21 of the lunar month—a
pattern suggesting an early schematic structure. In this study, I argue that observed period
relations between lunar phases, equinoxes, and solstices as well as the invention of the
water clock enabled the Babylonians to become aware of the 8-year lunisolar cycle
(known as the octaeteris in ancient Greece) and develop calendars with standardized
month-lengths and fixed rules of intercalation during the second millennium BCE.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
Chaos is merely order waiting to be deciphered.
—José Saramago, The Double
Within the study of astronomical texts from the ancient Near East and
Mediterranean, there remains a persistent narrative that science, mathematics, and
consequently astronomy did not exist before Thales of Miletus (ca. 624-546 BCE). Prior
to Thales, observations concerning the cosmos are thought to be mired in magic and the
supernatural, relying exclusively on visual confirmations without any broader
understanding of the mathematical relationships between celestial objects. It is Thales
and the pre-Socratic philosophers that followed who are depicted as initiating order to
Western civilization’s knowledge of the cosmos when beforehand there was only chaos.
Based on the knowledge gathered from inscriptional texts, it is clear that observed
cycles of various celestial bodies formed the basis of calendar developments within the
ancient Near East; and similarly, the narrative regarding calendrical innovations has
followed closely with that of astronomy as highlighted above. For example, the octaeteris
or 8-year cycle has an unknown origin but is attributed to Greek astronomers in the sixth
or early fifth centuries BCE. Meton of Athens is credited with discovering an alternative
19-year lunisolar cycle (in which 19 solar years closely equal 235 lunar months),
introducing this “Metonic” cycle to the Attic calendar in 432 BCE. Most scholars now
acknowledge that the Babylonians were aware of both cycles by the beginning of the
Persian Achaemenid period (ca. 541 BCE); nevertheless, the overwhelming consensus is



2
that the Babylonians had neither made use of these fixed cycles nor instituted any fixed
system for month lengths or the insertion of intercalary months prior to the mid-sixth
century BCE—again not until after Thales.1 All Babylonian calendar months before this
period are currently believed to have been determined solely by direct or anticipated
observation of the new moon with the insertion of intercalary months (extra months
inserted periodically into the calendar year in order to harmonize it with the solar year)
left completely to the discretion of the king and his advisors.2 This position, of course, is
not without support. Some of the most sequential lunar observations within Babylonian
astronomical texts date to the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II (ca. 605-562 BCE), yet these
observations at present reveal no discernable preset structure. However, lunar eclipse
omens within the divination texts of the Enūma Anu Enlil, some which date as early as
the second half of the Old Babylonian period (ca. 1750-1600 BCE), clearly indicate a
pattern of lunar eclipses occurring on days 14, 15, 16, 20, and 21 of the lunar month—a
pattern suggesting an early embedded structure to the Babylonian calendar.3
In this study, I argue that calendar developments during the Old Babylonian
period can be best characterized as annual alternations of 29-day or 30-day month lengths
with solstices in relation to the new moon determining when intercalary months were
needed. The advent of the water clock in Babylonia enabled the consistent detection of
cardinal phenomena (i.e. equinoxes and solstices) so that the latter could be used in

tandem with lunar phases to stabilize the summer solstice, autumnal equinox, winter
solstice, and vernal equinox in months III, VI, IX, and XII of the calendar respectively. I
maintain that the goal of Babylonian astrologers was simple: to develop a system of time
reckoning that would satisfy the religious, political, and economic needs of their empire.
My goal is to demonstrate that the Babylonians were aware of the 8-year lunisolar cycle
and employing fixed rules of intercalation more than a thousand years prior to the sixth
century BCE.
1.1. Textual Sources
This study relies on ancient Near Eastern inscriptions from divinatory and
magical omens, astronomical records, administrative correspondences, and the chronicles
of Babylonian and Assyrian rulers. Authorship of these sources can be credited to a class
of individuals known in the Neo-Assyrian period as the ummânu, which consisted of
diviners, magicians, scribes, and other experts tasked with informing the king of all
pertinent matters related to the empire. These individuals and their activities are
collectively referred to as the “protection” (maṣṣartu) within the source material; and it is
in this context that astronomy, omens, and calendrics all intertwine to serve in the day to
day politics and administration of the state.4
1.1.1. Enūma Anu Enlil
The Enūma Anu Enlil is a collection of omens believed to be canonized during the
Kassite period (1595-1157 BCE) and referenced afterwards by astrologers for more than
a millennium. Although the entire omen series has yet to be fully reconstructed by
scholars, the celestial omens pertaining to lunar eclipses, which Francesca Rochberg
4 Lorenzo Verderame, “Astronomy, Divination, and Politics in the Neo-Assyrian Empire,” in Handbook of Archaeoastronomy and Ethnoastronomy, ed. Clive L. N. Ruggles (New York: Springer, 2015), 1849.

translates in Aspects of Babylonian Celestial Divination, provide more than enough
material for this study. All omens in the Enūma Anu Enlil consist of a basic if-then
conditional such that if one event occurs or has occurred, then a second event will also
occur. The dependent clause or protasis of the omen contains a direct observation of the
physical world such as, “if the (lunar) eclipse occurred on day x of month y and fraction z
of the moon was covered....” The main clause or apodosis of the omen contains a
prediction of a future event, either favorable (e.g., military victory and economic
prosperity) or unfavorable (e.g., plague and famine), that would impact the king, empire,
or surrounding nations.
Modern scholarship holds that the Babylonians perceived the linkage between
protases and apodoses to be correlational as opposed to causal; but one should definitely
not assume this linkage is the result of simultaneous or sequential observations. Rochberg
presents several cases in which protases and apodoses in celestial omens are completely
formulaic, with even linguistic or conceptual associations organized into specific
schemata. Consequently, the observations of the Enūma Anu Enlil are generally ignored
as sources of datable astronomical phenomena.5 What distinguishes this study from other
projects regarding Babylonian calendrics is that I have focused on the protases of lunar
eclipse omens in the Enūma Anu Enlil not as sources of datable material but as indicators
of the structure of Babylonian time-reckoning schemata.
1.1.2. MUL.APIN
The MUL.APIN, named after its incipit constellation—“the plough”, consists of
more than 200 astronomical observations written in cuneiform on a pair of clay tablets.

The earliest known copy dates to 686 BCE; however, Hermann Hunger and David
Pingree argue that the text was finalized circa 1000 BCE.6 While the first tablet focuses
primarily on the rising and setting of various constellations and planets, the second tablet
is of particular interest for this study because it illustrates the use of equinoxes and
solstices to stabilize the Babylonian calendar as well as the water clock and gnomon to
measure the lengths of day and night for each astronomical event.
1.1.3. Astronomical Diaries
The Astronomical Diaries are a collection of cuneiform tablets which provide
direct evidence that the Babylonians perceived some astronomical phenomena to be
periodic. As a result, they represent a systematic attempt on the part of astrologers to
observe and organize these phenomena within a structured framework. In his
“Classification of the Babylonian Astronomical Tablets,” Abraham Sachs coins the term
“Diaries” for this category of texts because of the daily recordings of lunar and planetary
positions inscribed on the tablets.7 Securely datable tablets range from the mid-seventh to
the mid-first centuries BCE; however, it is evident that diary entries were recorded one
hundred years prior during the reign of Nabonassar (747-734 BCE) given Ptolemy’s
claim in his Almagest (c.a. 150 CE) that the Nabonassar’s reign “is the era beginning
from which the ancient observations are, on the whole, preserved down to our time.”8
Unlike the Enūma Anu Enlil, the Diaries contain very few omens, consisting mainly of
direct observations, predictions, and computations. Hunger and Pingree thus argue that

the Diaries represent the inception of Babylonian sky-watching as a scientific endeavor.9
For this study, I focus on lunar eclipse entries from eight tablets stored at the British
Museum: BM 41985 (LBAT 1413), BM 32238 (LBAT 1414), BM 35115 (LBAT 1415,
1416, 1417), BM 32234 (LBAT 1419), BM 38357, BM 38462 (LBAT 1420), BM 41536
(LBAT 1421), and BM 36879.10 Several entries in the aforementioned tablets record the
actual regnal year, month, and day of the eclipse, making the Diaries indispensable in
deciphering and validating the structure of the Babylonian calendar.
1.1.4. Letters from Assyrian Scholars
Additional omens and astronomical observations can be found in a collection of
letters and reports addressed to the Neo-Assyrian kings Esarhaddon (ca. 680-669 BCE)
and Assurbanipal (ca. 668-627 BCE). Hunger and Simo Parpola have most recently been
pivotal in translating and organizing this corpus.11 The authors of these tablets are various
members of the literati residing throughout Assyria and Babylonia whose primary
objective no doubt was to obtain or maintain political favor with the king.
Letters differ from reports in that they address the king directly. Favorable omens
from the Enūma Anu Enlil are often cited in the letter introductions followed by proposed
actions that the king should make in gratitude to the gods. Many letters, however, include
unfavorable omens such as those associated with lunar eclipses. In such instances, the
letter is meant to serve both as a warning and prescription for rituals to be performed by

the king to counteract potential evil portents. Reports, on the other hand, are usually
submitted one of the king’s advisors or correspondents and are free of any proposed
actions, in most cases consisting of only an omen understood to be related to a recent
observation.12 Both types of correspondences, nevertheless, are replete with astronomical
observations (whether directly mentioned or implied via cited omen) that permit absolute
dating of the phenomena referenced.
1.2. Theory and Method
This project is grounded in middle-range theories and approaches commonly
applied in the fields of ethnohistory and experimental archaeology, specifically the direct
historical approach. Developed in the United States of America between the 1920s and
1930s, the direct historical approach argues that knowledge related to known historical
periods can be extrapolated (under certain conditions) to earlier times when little or no
historical records exist. Historical data from one context is used to explain data found in
another, providing an analogy to illuminate additional insights. The key requirement of
the direct historical approach is the presence of continuity, whether cultural or
geographical, between two or more contexts.
It is without question that the Babylonian calendar was the most widely used
time-reckoning system of the ancient Near East since the empires of the Assyrians,
Babylonians, Persians, and Seleucids (Hellenistic) all adopted it as their imperial calendar
with subtle variations. Furthermore, most scholars acknowledge that the Metonic cycle of
the fifth century BCE was inspired directly or indirectly by the Babylonian calendar.
Methods for time reckoning in Hellenistic writings such as Hesiod’s Works and Days and

the Hippocratic medical writings bear striking similarities to those in the MUL.APIN,
suggesting that certain calendrical methods had been known and widespread for centuries
throughout the ancient Near East.13 Therefore, the continuity and influence of the
Babylonian calendar in eastern Mediterranean cultures makes it an ideal candidate for
such an approach, with inscriptions of calendric methods from later periods enabling us
to extract remnants of rationale employed in earlier ones.
According to Anthony F. Aveni, researchers in the field of archaeoastronomy
should never forget that “they are dealing with real people, whose astronomy can only be
said to known and understood when its level of practice is commensurate with whatever
we know from the material record of the culture.”14 Experimental archaeology as a form
of actualistic study (the use of observations and practices in the present to understand past
dynamics) excels at uncovering the nuances of ancient practices. For example,
archaeologists engaged in the experimental manufacture and the handling of stone tools
routinely use the debris and examination of wear from such exercises to identify stone
tools within the archaeological record.15 The following chapters and appendices of this
project represent experimental exercises in the enterprise of calendrics. They are the
result of attempts to replicate ancient Mesopotamian time reckoning methods based upon
known technologies from the archaeological record, specifically the use of the
Babylonian water clock and the simple counting of days. Such exercises illuminate the

numerous challenges Babylonian astrologers would have faced in maintaining a calendar
as well as strategies for their resolution.
Dates for lunar phases, lunar eclipses, equinoxes, and solstices have been
reproduced using algorithms developed by Jean Meeus.16 I also have made great effort to
determine the local observability of the astronomical phenomena listed above within the
ancient Near East and have used Delta T (ΔT) adjustments from L. V. Morrison and F. R.
Stephenson as a result.17 Once dates for the phenomena were calculated, I experimented
with various time reckoning schemata, conforming to the guidelines consistently reported
in the lunar eclipse omen texts in order to replicate Babylonian date patterns for lunar
eclipses recorded in the Enūma Anu Enlil and Astronomical Diaries. Finally, schemata
were evaluated against intercalary months attested by inscriptions from chronicles and
administrative correspondences within the periods of study.
1.3. Overview of Study
Chapter 2 contains a brief overview of lunisolar phenomena and calendric issues
that Babylonian astrologers would have faced in reconciling lunar and solar cycles. I also
explain features of the octaeteris and Metonic cycles in order to introduce strategies for
addressing these issues, namely period relations between principal lunar phases and
cardinal phenomena.
In chapter 3, I highlight evidence concerning the use of the Babylonian water
clock in the Enūma Anu Enlil as well as potential clock designs as theorized by modern
16 See Jean Meeus, Astronomical Algorithms, 2nd ed. (Richmond, VA: Willmann-Bell, 2009).
17 Variations in the Earth’s rate of rotation can result in minute changes to the length of day. These changes accumulate over millennia with their net total referred to in astronomy as Delta T (ΔT). The impact of ΔT can be significant for retrospective computations of solar and lunar positions in the first and second millennium BCE. For example, the value of ΔT around 1000 BCE is as much as 7 hours. See L.V. Morrison and F. R. Stephenson, “Historical Errors of the Earth’s Clock Error ΔT and the Calculation of Eclipses,” Journal for the History of Astronomy 35, no. 3 (August 2004): 332.



10
scholars. In addition to addressing the issues of viscosity and capillarity that possibly
impacted the clock’s accuracy, I propose a significantly smaller two-stage design of the
water clock consisting of wooden vessels that are cubic in dimension. The ability of
astrologers to detect and measure equinoxes and solstices via the water clock is also
examined, with special attention given towards lengths of daylight and darkness recorded
in ideal calendar schemes of the Old Babylonian period.
I attempt in chapter 4 to ascertain the circumstances under which month lengths
and intercalary months would have been determined with the goal of establishing a set of
rules for intercalation. Special consideration is given towards Peter J. Huber’s analysis of
the Venus Tablet of Ammi-saduqa for clues into reconstructing Old Babylonian calendar
schemes.
Finally, I conclude this study by summarizing all of its major findings and
detailing potential implications in the synchronization of ancient Near Eastern
chronologies. The question as to whether the birth of astronomy should be credited to
Babylonian astrologers remains a hotly debated topic. As a result, I make final remarks as
to how this project provides additional evidence toward the affirmative.



CHAPTER 2: LUNISOLAR PHENOMENA AND EARLY GREEK LUNISOLAR CYCLES
The Moon travels around the Earth in a near circular orbit, completing one
revolution in an average period of 27.32 days. This is known as a sidereal month. Of
course, the Earth is also traveling around the Sun, completing a revolution after 365.26
days, known as a sidereal year. Because the Earth is speeding along its orbit around the
Sun, it takes the Moon just over two additional days to return to its initial alignment with
the Earth and Sun for a total of 29.53 days, called a synodic month or lunation.
When the aforementioned alignment or syzygy is in the order of Earth-Moon-Sun,
the moon is completely dark, also known as a new moon or conjunction. When the
syzygy is Moon-Earth-Sun, the entire disk of the Moon is illuminated in what is called a
full moon or opposition. New moons and full moons present two of the four principal
lunar phases, the other two known as first quarter and last quarter. Moreover, there are
approximately 7.28 days between each principal phase, with the new moon recognized in
ancient Babylonia as the final phase within each lunation.18 Figure 1 illustrates each
principal phase and its approximate day of occurrence in the synodic month.
One can quickly surmise that the seven-day week has its origins with the interval
between each principal lunar phase. In various Babylonian and Assyrian calendars, days
18 In western culture, four intermediate lunar phases are also recognized: waxing crescent (right side of lunar disk illuminated 1-49%), waxing gibbous (right side of lunar disk illuminated 51-99%), waning gibbous (left side of lunar disk illuminated 51-99%), waning crescent (left side of lunar disk illuminated 1-49%). From the fifth tablet of the Babylonian creation epic, the Enūma Eliš (ca. 18th century BCE), we know that the lunar month was considered by Babylonians to start at the beginning of the waxing crescent.

7, 14, 21, and 28 from the new moon were called uhulgallū and regarded as “evil” or
unfavorable days.19 Consequently, certain activities were prohibited to avoid ill
consequences. The king was not to eat cooked meat or baked bread, to ride out in his
chariot, or to issue any decrees. Priests were not to deliver oracles, and doctors did not
treat the sick.20 Therefore, it appears that evil portents were associated with all principal
lunar phases and not just lunar eclipses.

2.1. Lunar Eclipses
The apodoses related to lunar eclipses in omen texts provided some of the most
ill-fated portents that can be directed against a king or the land. Each quadrant of the
lunar disk corresponded to one of the four quarters of the known world (Amurru, Elam,
Subartu/Assyria, Akkad/Babylonia). An eclipse over one or more quadrants portended a
threat to the corresponding regions whereas a total lunar eclipse signified danger for all
kings of the world. To avert potential calamity, celestial diviners were on constant alert to
prepare specific protection rites in advance. The most notable of these was the “substitute
king ritual” in which an unfortunate individual, usually a prisoner or criminal sentenced
to death, was selected to “rule” temporarily for up to 100 days in the king’s place
(depending on the magnitude of the eclipse) to absorb any perceived evil that was
portended against the king. The individual was then executed so that the evil was carried
with him into the netherworld.21 As a result, considerable attention was placed on being
able to predict lunar eclipses (and other planetary) occurrences so that a substitute king
could be installed beforehand.
From our perspective on Earth, the Sun appears to be moving along a path in the
observable sky known as the ecliptic. The Moon’s path as viewed from Earth intersects
the ecliptic twice during the sidereal month at points called nodes; and the average
interval it takes for the Moon to return to the same node is 27.21 days called a draconic
month. Eclipses can only occur when the Moon is near one of these nodes (every 13.6
days) and in syzygy. If the Moon is near a node during a new moon (conjunction), the
Moon casts a shadow on the earth’s surface, partially or totally obscuring the Sun in a
21 Parpola, LAS, vol. 2, xxii-xxv.



14
solar eclipse. Accordingly, if a full moon (opposition) is close to a node, the Earth casts a
shadow on the Moon, partially or totally obscuring the Moon in a lunar eclipse. The
magnitude of an eclipse, defined as the fraction of the diameter of the eclipsed body that
is shadowed, is determined not only by the Moon’s path but also its distance from the
Earth because of its elliptical orbit. The point where the Moon is closest to the Earth is
known as the perigee, and the interval from perigee to perigee is 27.56 days called an
anomalistic month.
Within ancient Near Eastern studies, scholars such as Otto Neugebauer have long
acknowledged that the Babylonians were aware of lunar eclipses occurring in six-month
and occasionally five-month intervals. Yet, there has always been doubt as to whether
this knowledge developed into a mathematical theory prior to the fifth century BCE.22
Lunar eclipses are visible anywhere on the Earth when the Moon is above the horizon; so
it is fairly easy to detect cycles of occurrence over time. The Saros period in which 38
lunar eclipse possibilities occur within a timeframe of 223 synodic months is thought to
be such a cycle. The Babylonians referred to this period as “18 MU.MEŠ” (18 years)
because of its closeness to 18 sidereal years. Moreover, 223 synodic months are very
close in days to 242 draconic months and 239 anomalistic months, resulting in an eclipse
recurring with a similar magnitude and duration every 18 years.23
From eclipse observations and basic algebra, one can deduce that 33 of the 38
lunar eclipse possibilities occur after six-month intervals, with the remaining five
22 O. Neugebauer, The Exact Sciences in Antiquity (New York: Dover Publications, 1969), 101102.
23 223 synodic months ≈ 18.03 sidereal years ≈ 6585.413 days; 242 draconic months ≈ 6585.304 days; and 239 anomalistic months ≈ 6585.645 days.



15
possibilities occurring after intervals of five months.24 John M. Steele proposes that by
distributing the five-month eclipse intervals evenly throughout the Saros cycle, the 38
eclipse possibilities can be divided into five groups of eight, seven, eight, seven, and
eight occurrences respectively (8-7-8-7-8). The Astronomical Diaries provide numerous
examples of five-month interval eclipses, which are notated with the logogram “5 ITU”
after the month of occurrence; and potential evidence from tablet BM 38462 (LBAT
*1420) suggests that Babylonian astrologers could have been using the 8-7-8-7-8 Saros
distribution scheme to predict lunar eclipses as early as 575 BCE. In addition, Steele and
Lis Brack-Bernsen note that the structure of the scheme appears to be present in
recordings that include the 6 February 747 BCE lunar eclipse:

However, Steele and Brack-Bernsen also admit the possibility of the scheme
being projected back upon these observations in later recensions.26 Backward projection
of the Saros scheme appears to be the most probable scenario, particularly when one
24 Within a 223 month period, x eclipses occur after six months and y eclipses occur after five months for the equation of 6x + 5y = 223. From eclipse observations, six-month eclipse intervals are more than five times likely than five-month eclipse intervals, resulting in x > 5y. The only solution for these two equations is x = 33 and y = 5. 25 BM 41985 (LBAT 1413), Obv.’, lines 1-4; trans. Hunger, Astronomical Diaries, 3.

considers that many of the 38 eclipse possibilities in each Saros would not have been
visible from Mesopotamia. Appendix A contains a table that compares the 8-7-8-7-8
distribution over two Saros periods (747-711 BCE) against actual occurrences of five
month interval eclipses (rows highlighted in bold) as well as a distribution of occurrences
that would have been observable to astrologers. Saros series eclipse numbers are listed
for each of these three distributions in table 1 below:

The 8-7-8-7-8 and observable distributions each successfully predict only one
actual occurrence of a five-month interval eclipse over a 36-year period, both of which
happen to be the first eclipse of the third Saros period. Coincidentally or perhaps as
initially derived by Steele, both schemes predict the exact same distribution of lunar
eclipse numbers 1, 9, 16, 24, and 31 for the first Saros period. When we compare
predictions from these two schemes in the second Saros period, however, we begin to see
numerous and sometimes wide discrepancies. The 8-7-8-7-8 scheme predicts the same
series of eclipse numbers in the second Saros by design; and with the exception of the
first eclipse, discrepancies between its distribution and actual occurrences remain



17
consistent. In the observable distribution, eclipse visibility (or lack thereof) obscures
patterns of eclipse occurrence. For example, the lunar eclipses of 2 August 747 and 12
August 729 BCE both occur second within their respective Saros series as listed in
appendix A. As a result, they are similar in magnitude, having the appearance of total or
near-total eclipses. Yet, the 12 August 729 BCE eclipse was only visible from the Pacific
Ocean; so from the perspective of Babylonian astrologers, this eclipse did not occur.
More importantly, appendix A shows multiple stretches of four to five consecutive
eclipses that would not have been visible from Mesopotamia, many of which include
five-month interval eclipses. Therefore, astrologers could only assume that each
“missing” eclipse occurred six months after the previous one until the next visible eclipse
indicated otherwise by appearing one month early.
Steele states that the 8-7-8-7-8 sequence is arbitrary and that the distribution
scheme could be any permutation of sevens or eights (e.g. 7-8-7-8-8 or 8-7-8-8-7)
depending on when the start of a Saros period is defined.27 Nevertheless, the distribution
of actual occurrences is 7-7-7-8-7 followed by 9-7-7-8-9 while the observable
distribution is 8-7-8-7-11 followed by 6-8-6-8-7, none of which are permissible in
permutations of Steele’s schemes and of which the interval numbers in each sequence of
the latter can potentially change due to lack of visibility. Consequently, as a predictive
tool, the 8-7-8-7-8 Saros scheme would be no more accurate or verifiable than counting
the number of days since the last eclipse. The average time between each eclipse is 177
days (six months of 29.53 days), with a few eclipses occurring after 148 days (five
months of 29.53 days) as illustrated in appendix A. Furthermore, letters to Assyrian kings

indicate that astrologers were interested in predicting eclipse occurrences to the actual
day:
As regards the watch of the Sun about which the king, my lord, wrote to me, it is (indeed) the month for the watch of the Sun. We keep its watch twice, on the 26th of Araḫsamna (and) the 26th of Kislimu. In this way we keep the watch of the Sun for 2 months.
As regards the solar eclipse about which the king spoke, the eclipse did not occur. I shall look again on the 27th (and) write (to the king).
The king, my lord, must have (already) discharged me! In deep anxiety, I have nothing to report.28
The above inscription highlights the stress ancient astrologers experienced while
attempting to predict eclipses accurately. Notice that the solar eclipse was expected to
occur on the 26th of Araḫsamna (Month VIII) or Kislīmu (Month IX) as opposed to the
29/30th of these months when the moon is in conjunction. This suggests that astrologers
would have to accommodate various calendar schemes with variable month lengths and
insertions of intercalary months. The only way for them to predict eclipses (lunar or
solar) to the actual day would be to maintain or to calculate a count of 148 or 177 days.
Therefore, the use of Saros distributions as proposed by Steele and Brack-Bernsen, if in
fact used at all, would best serve as retrospective approximations of five-month interval
eclipses that scribes would use to uncover patterns within large sets of previously
recorded observations.
2.2. Early Greek Lunisolar Cycles
Although the Saros does not appear to have been used to predict eclipses prior to
the sixth century BCE, John P. Britton argues that knowledge of the 18-year period may
28 ABL 687; trans. Parpola, LAS, vol. 1, 29. Parpola dates this inscription to 2 December 670 BCE. A solar eclipse did occur on this date but was not visible from Mesopotamia. For commentary, see Parpola, LAS, vol. 2, 51.

have led to the discovery of the 19-year lunisolar cycle. The length of the lunar year is on
average 354.37 days (12 x 29.53 days), which is 10.87 days shorter than the average
tropical (solar) year of 365.24 days. For this reason, the goal of a lunisolar calendar is to
reconcile this difference in days, known as the epact, so that lunar calendar months
remain consistent with solar seasons primarily for agricultural purposes. The inscriptional
texts provide evidence for several strategies that were used to synchronize lunar and solar
years, namely the insertion of 30-day intercalary months every 2.5 to 3 years. Small
discrepancies often remain after the insertion of an intercalary month, so scribes would
need to recognize certain lunisolar cycles to know when the lunar and solar years were
once again in sync.
One such lunisolar cycle occurs after 19 solar years (6,939.60 days), which is
nearly equal to 235 synodic months (6,939.69 days). The Greek astronomer Meton of
Athens is credited with introducing the 19-year cycle around 432 BCE; yet, evidence of
the cycle’s use can be detected starting from the reign of Darius I (522 BCE).29 This
“Metonic” cycle requires the insertion of seven 30-day intercalary months in years 3, 6,
8, 11, 14, 17, and 19. As shown in table 2, intercalary months are inserted in the cycle to
prevent the epact from exceeding 30 days.
The origins of the 19-year cycle are even a greater mystery, with hypotheses
ranging from the mathematical to the haphazard. It has long been suspected that this
cycle was derived from the less accurate 8-year cycle, popularly known as the octaeteris.
Eight solar years (2,921.94 days) equates approximately to 99 synodic months (2,923.53
days); therefore, the octaeteris requires the insertion of three 30-day intercalary months

in years 3, 5, and 8 or possibly 3, 6, and 8 of the cycle (5 x 354 days + 3 x 384 days =
2,922 days).30 Remnants of the 8-year cycle can be seen in table 2, with intercalary
months in years 8 and potentially 16 removing mathematic discrepancies between lunar
and solar years. Writing in the third century CE, Censorinus reports that the invention of
the 8-year cycle was attributed to Kleostratos towards the end of the sixth century BCE.31
However, Robert Hannah, using George Thomson’s long-held argument that the cycle
30 Ancient societies would be fully aware of simple-fractional days and know that the eight-year cycle would be 99 synodic months or 2,920.5 days (99 x 29.5 days), resulting in a deficit of 1.5 days from their perspective even though there would actually be a surplus of 1.633 days. However, the rounding associated with alternating month lengths between 29 and 30 days mitigates this discrepancy. The years of intercalation are according to Geminos, Introduction to Astronomy 8.33; cited by Robert Hannah, “Early Greek Lunisolar Cycles: The Pythian and Olympic Games,” in Living the Lunar Calendar, ed. Jonathan Ben-Dov, Wayne Horowitz, and John M. Steele (Oxford: Oxbow Books, 2012), 80.

existed beforehand in various forms, argues that the octaeteris could have been used in
Olympia as early as the eighth century BCE.32 Unfortunately, the use of the octaeteris
alone does not provide an astronomical foundation for either lunisolar cycle.
Britton proposes that it was the study of eclipses that led to the introduction of the
19-year cycle, noting that Babylonian astrologers could have easily discovered that
“eclipses separated by 235 synodic months recur in the same place in the sky” to form a
19-year lunistellar cycle.33 One also cannot discount the potential early role of equinoxes
and solstices in uncovering the cycle as evidenced by a text from Uruk (W22801) in
which dates for summer and winter solstices are listed schematically in 19-year intervals
from 626 to 531 BCE.34 Moreover, the MUL.APIN contains two intercalation schemes,
one in which the risings of the Sun, visibility of the Moon, and the constellations are used
to determine equinoxes, solstices, and the need for intercalary months. Nevertheless,
critics contend that the above proposals rely on a flawed assumption that the 19-year
cycle was a scientific discovery resulting from advances in Babylonian mathematical
astronomy and the need for intercalations.35 According to Sacha Stern, “[t]he relationship
between calendar regulation and astronomy has generally been overstated. It is certainly
absurd to argue, as many have done, that the development of Babylonian astronomy itself
was motivated by an urge to regulate the calendar: indeed, planetary and stellar
astronomy, which dominate Babylonian astronomy, have no relevance to the lunar

calendar.”36 In addition, he sees equinoxes and solstices as providing no astronomical
rationale to the Babylonian 19-year cycle, attributing the latter to trial and error on the
part of astrologers with minor use of mathematical astronomy.37
Although I agree with Stern that the paradigm of calendar regulation depending
on advances in mathematical astronomy is problematic, I argue that the 19-year lunisolar
cycle was indeed a scientific discovery of Babylonian astrologers who observed period
relations between lunar phases, equinoxes, and solstices. Tables 3-4 illustrate these
patterns by showing new and full moons occurring on the same evening (or within the
same 24-hour period) as the vernal equinox or the summer solstice respectively every 19
years. This 19-year cycle exists for any lunar phase and equinox/solstice combination.

The octaeteris and 11-year cycle also may have originated from these observed
patterns as shown in the tables below, but each sub-cycle is individually less accurate
than when combined to form the 19-year cycle. For example, in the case of the 8-year
cycle, the new moon occurs 1.627 days after the equinox; and this discrepancy only
increases after successive reiterations of the cycle. In chapter 4, however, I will discuss
how adding an extra day to a 29- day month 3 times over 2 cycles can mitigate this
discrepancy to make the 8-year cycle viable as a basis for Old Babylonian period
calendars. Nevertheless, if the 19-year cycle can be attributed to observations of lunar
phases rather than mathematical astronomy, then it is quite possible that the cycle was in
use much earlier than previously thought. This opens the potential of intercalation being
determined by cardinal phenomena in respect to lunar phases of certain calendar months
rather than arithmetic epacts within a cycle. To support these new hypotheses, we will



24
need to determine if and when Babylonian astrologers had developed technology to
detect equinoxes and solstices within acceptable margins of error.
2.3. Summary
The four principal lunar phases served a pivotal function in ancient Babylonian
calendrics and celestial divination; for not only were they likely the basis of the seven
day week but were also perceived as ominous signs by astrologers. Individuals tasked
with protecting the king and the empire were particularly concerned about lunar eclipses,
developing rudimentary methods of prediction so as to prepare protection rituals in
advance. As a result, modern scholars, such as Britton, have proposed that this
Babylonian concern over eclipse occurrences is in fact what led to the discovery of the
18-year Saros cycle and eventually the 19-year lunisolar cycle, the latter becoming
essential in the development of the calendar.
Although the MUL.APIN contains evidence that the determination of cardinal
phenomena was also linked to determining the need for intercalary months, equinoxes
and solstices are often viewed today as providing no astronomical basis for the
Babylonian 19-year cycle. However, period relations between cardinal phenomena and
the principal lunar phases naturally do occur in cycles of 19 years, with potential sub
cycles of 8 or 11 years. Therefore, it is quite possible that new and full moons observed
in relation to equinoxes and solstices provided Babylonian astrologers with a systematic
but non-arithmetic method for inserting extra months into the calendar year before the
start of the first millennium BCE.



CHAPTER 3: THE BABYLONIAN WATER CLOCK
The observation that days are longer in the summer than they are in the winter is
probably as early as humans have inhabited the Northern Hemisphere. Administrative
texts of the pre-Sargonic period (ca. 2500-2350 BCE) demonstrate that Mesopotamian
scribal culture was already using a 360-day schematic calendar of twelve 30-day months
to facilitate calculations. Sowing and harvest festivals are attested throughout this scheme
during the Ur III period (ca. 2100 BCE), indicating that the latter was structured around
the agricultural seasons. By the Old Babylonian period (ca. 1800-1600 BCE), solstices
and equinoxes are arranged equidistantly on the 15th of months III, VI, IX, and XII of the
360-day calendar to form an “ideal year” as evidenced by Tablet 14 of the Enūma Anu
Enlil.38 The Old Babylonian text BM 17175+17284 provides the earliest explicit
description of this scheme and assigns the values of 2, 3, 4, and 3 to the night watches of
the solstice and equinox schematic dates above.39 These values are listed with no units of
measure and no indications of what they supposedly quantify; however, it is quite clear
from Table C of Tablet 14 that these values represent weights in units known as minas
corresponding to the duration of darkness on the nights of cardinal phenomena.40
Combining the information of Tablet 14 and BM 17175+172184 recreates the “ideal

year” scheme shown in table 5. In addition, three important facts of the Old Babylonian
period can be inferred from these two texts: (1) a device that measured lengths of day and
night was in existence; (2) Babylonian astrologers possessed the ability to detect
equinoxes and solstices; and (3) the astrologers were using a ratio of 2:1 for the longest to
the shortest night of the winter and summer solstices.

3.1. Theoretical Specifications of the Water Clock
Although we find no schematic description of the water clock within the
inscriptional corpus, Old Babylonian mathematical texts provide philological clues as to
how the clock may have functioned. These texts make reference to a device called a
gišdib-dib in Sumerian (dibdibbu in Akkadian) out of which poured a substance that was
probably water but possibly also sand. The Standard Babylonian lexical series Ur5-ra IV
6-10, dating to the first millennium BCE, equates gišdib-dib to several useful terms as
well, namely the word muzibbu in Ur5-ra IV: 7, a possible derivation of the word zâbu
which connotes “dripping.” This suggests that gišdib-dib may also be onomatopoeic,
perhaps reflecting water dripping slowly out of the device. However, Ur5-ra IV: 8 uses
the word mušiḫḫu, meaning “that which grows/increases,” indicating that water may have
been dripping into some measuring device. Via the term maštaktum, gišdib-dib is
indirectly linked to another device called a giški.lá, which relates to the Akkadian word
kalakku that can mean “vessel.” Since ki.lá refers to “weight” or “the act of weighing,”



27
the gišdib-dib may have been understood as a wooden (giš) device that weighed water.
Thus, from the philological evidence, we can construct a general description of the water
clock as a wooden device that measured time corresponding to the weight of water
(measured in minas) that slowly dripped into or out of the device.41
3.1.1. Neugebauer’s Water Clock
Neugebauer’s early work on the water clock has been pivotal in later
interpretations of Old Babylonian time measurements because it incorporated F. X.
Kugler’s earlier observation that these recordings were written in units of weight rather
than units of time. Moreover, it attempts to reconcile the Babylonian 2:1 ratio of longest
night to shortest night with an equally simple 3:2 ratio that is much closer to what is
observed in nature. Decades prior to Neugebauer, E. F. Weidner and L. W. King note that
both ratios are found in the MUL.APIN. Weidner, in particular, makes reference to the
second tablet of the MUL.APIN in which Babylonian astrologers demonstrated
awareness of the 3:2 ratio from their use of sundials to compare the longest and shortest
days. Thus, astrologers would have easily deduced that this ratio could apply to the
longest and shortest nights as well. The 2:1 ratio nevertheless continues to be used for the
longest and shortest nights as inferred from tablet BM 86378.42
Using conservation of energy and Bernoulli laws in which the potential energy of
water stored in a vessel equals the kinetic energy of it flowing out, Neugebauer reasons
that the time t needed for water of height h to completely flow out of a vessel is dictated

28
by the formula t = c√h, where c is a constant depending on the outlet and the cross
sectional area of the vessel. Since the weight w of the water contained in the vessel is
proportional to h, the ratio between two different time intervals of T and t equals the ratio
of the square roots of the corresponding weights of water W and w (i.e. : t = √W: √w ). In
other words, the 3:2 ratio corresponds to a water weight ratio of 9:4. Neugebauer argues
that the Babylonians approximated this latter ratio to 8:4, resulting in the 2:1 ratio
inferred from inscriptions. From the Enūma Anu Enlil, we know that day and night were
divided into three watches each. Neugebauer interprets the day watch and night watch
values in the Old Babylonian “ideal year” scheme above as being applied to each of the
three watches. On the summer solstice, for example, 12 minas would be measured for the
entire day watch and 6 minas for the entire night watch, with an approximate ratio of 3:2
(i.e. 3 x √4
3 x √2 = 2
√2 ≈ 1.414). With these assumptions, Neugebauer concludes that the water
clock consisted of a cylindrical clepsydra with an outlet at its bottom from which a
specified amount of water was expected to drain during each watch.43
Modern scholarship, however, has uncovered numerous problems with
Neugebauer’s model. As stated earlier, Tablet 14 and the MUL.APIN confirm the use of
weights to measure time; but other parts of both texts suggest that astrologers perceived a
proportional rather than square root relationship between daylight and darkness. This fact
is made explicit in Late Babylonian period texts such as BM 29371.44 Therefore, while it
is possible for the structure of the water clock to have changed over the centuries, it is
highly unlikely that the mathematical basis for the device would have changed as well,

particularly since a sexagesimal numeral system poorly handles the fractions that many
square root calculations would introduce.
A second problem is whether or not water from the clock could drip slow enough
so as not to be emptied before the end of the watch. Some researchers interpret the weight
values in the “ideal year” scheme as corresponding to an entire day or night instead of a
watch as proposed by Neugebauer.45 A mina of water weighs approximately 0.5 kg,
which translates in volume to 0.5 liters.46 Thus, whether one interprets 3 minas or 1.5
liters (in the case of an equinox) as dripping for either 4 hours or 12 hours, an outlet with
a very tiny bore is required to achieve such slow discharge rates.
The requirement of a tiny outlet forces us to recognize issues of viscosity and
capillarity concerning the clock’s design. Viscosity in the context of this study is the
resistance of a liquid substance to flow (e.g. molasses has a higher viscosity than water).
This resistance increases as temperature decreases. In the case of the water clock, flow
consistency, which is assumed under Bernoulli law, begins to break down if the flow rate
is too slow or too fast due to (1) the increased friction of squeezing through a tiny
opening and/or increased viscosity during colder seasons and (2) the resulting turbulence
caused by decreased viscosity during hotter seasons. In other words, Bernoulli law is only
applicable at around 20°C or room temperature.
A tiny opening also allows a liquid substance to take advantage of capillarity,
which is the use of surface tension to counteract the force of gravity. A thin film of water,
for example, will stick to surfaces and will require more energy to move the thinner the
film becomes. The corresponding capillary pressure from the surface tension will oppose

the hydrostatic pressure from the water’s weight. As the water level lowers, these two
pressures will eventually reach equilibrium, causing flow to end with a residual layer of
water at the bottom of the vessel. The height hc of this residual layer is determined by the
formula hc = 2λ2
φ where λ is the “capillary length” (≈ 0.27 cm for water) and φ is the
diameter of the opening.47 For a diameter of 1.5 mm, a fairly “large” opening within the
context of this study, hc equals almost a full centimeter. A residual layer of water this
high would have certainly been noticed by the Babylonians and eliminates any model that
requires water in the clock to discharge completely.
3.1.2. Experimental Results
It is clear that numerous physical laws and variables factor into the functionality
of the water clock; therefore, experimentation is needed to eliminate nonviable
parameters and to explore the water clock’s actual capabilities. Stephenson et al. lead this
effort by contributing two very important findings related to lunar eclipse times. First,
they find no evidence that the device slowed down during watches when used to measure
phase intervals of eclipses, meaning that the water’s height in the vessel was kept at a
constant level or head to achieve a constant flow.48 Second, they find no seasonal
variation of accuracy in measurements for eclipse records spanning over 500 years.49
Both of these findings thus strongly suggest that the design of the water clock effectively
resolved issues of viscosity and capillarity.
47 For detailed discussion concerning the issues of viscosity and capillarity, see also C. MichelNozières, “Second Millennium Babylonian Water Clocks: a physical study,” Centaurus 42 (2000): 184199.

Brown et al. hypothesize that the clock was kept inside a building to shield it from
extreme temperatures that would affect the viscosity of water in the device.50 Fermor and
Steele acknowledge that enclosing the device within a structure would not be sufficient to
eliminate seasonal effects entirely, so they also introduce the possibility of the water
clock having a short spout to mitigate temperature effects. Even if we assume an annual
indoor-temperature range of 10-30°C, the viscosity of water can increase by up to 64%,
thereby decreasing the flow rate by as much as 56%. However, tests of various spout
lengths by Fermor and Steele reveal that a spout 1.5 cm in length would reduce the flow
rate discrepancy down to 1.4%.51
Since water in the clock is kept at a constant head, presumably above the height
when capillarity could stop water flow, the only problem left to solve is calibrating the
clock to a desired flow rate. If we are correct in assuming that 3 minas or l.5 liters was
expected to drip from the device during an entire watch or 4 hours on an equinox, then
the required flow rate would equal 0.104 ml/s. One drop of water (gtt Metric) is
equivalent to 0.05 ml. Therefore, the required flow rate would equal two drops of water
per second—about the amount of time it takes to say gišdib-dib.
Achieving a constant drip rate of two drops per second involves careful
calibration between the bore diameter of the outlet and the head. Experiments by C.
Michel-Nozières show that only a range of 0.9-1.3 mm for the bore diameter is
permissible to generate repeatable results while avoiding issues of turbulence.52 In
50 Brown, Fermor, and Walker, “Water Clock in Mesopotamia,” 143.

32
addition, Brown et al. argue that the Babylonians circumvented issues of capillarity by
designing the water clock to have a large head. They propose a supply vessel to be of
such size that the amount of water discharged into a smaller measuring vessel would be
small enough to allow the head to remain near constant. Any discharged water would also
be returned to the supply vessel at watch end to maintain water level.53
The incorporation of a large supply tank into the water clock’s design is
entertained via F. Thureau-Dangin’s interpretation of two Old Babylonian mathematical
texts (BM 85194 and BM 85210) containing four examples that explicitly mention the
water clock (dibdibbu). Both texts contain examples such that (1) a variable ao is
provided, which is often interpreted as the full head for the device in units of šu.si or
“fingers” (1 finger ≈ 1.67 cm); (2) a constant hb is expressed as fraction of 10 fingers,
which possibly represents the change in water level after a sìla (qû) of water (≈ 1 liter)
flows out of the device; and (3) a fraction f is expressed that equals hb/ao. A value of 100
fingers for ao is listed for all three examples found in BM 85194, leading Brown et al. to
conclude that the device was large with an initial head of 167 cm (100 fingers x 1.67
cm).54
According to Michel-Nozières, however, an initial head of 167 cm would result in
an accelerated flow rate that is turbulent and unsteady. Assuming a large bore diameter φ
of 1.3 mm, the clock’s maximum head of ao would have to be less than 30 cm in order to
avoid turbulence under the rule of aoφ2<0.5 cm3. A reinterpretation of the above
mathematical texts by Thureau-Dangin in 1937 yields initial heads that are ten times
53 Brown, Fermor, and Walker, “Water Clock in Mesopotamia,” 137.
54 Ibid., 134.



33
smaller, in line with this rule.55 Because the constant hb is recorded in the BM 85194
examples as a fraction of 10 fingers, it could be that initial heads are recorded as a
fraction of 10 fingers as well for mathematical consistency. Yet, another possibility is
that ao refers not to the initial head but the cross-sectional area of the vessel, with the
initial head understood to be 10 fingers as implied from constant hb. The fraction f in each
example would then equal the change in volume as a fraction of the total cubic volume
under this new interpretation.56 Either way, this translates to a revised initial head of 16.7
cm which becomes extremely attractive as we begin to think about the water clock’s
dimensions.
3.1.3. A Two-Stage Water Clock Design
The mathematical examples of BM 85194 and BM 85210 introduce an additional
puzzle in that they suggest a water clock with a variable head in contradiction to the
findings of Stephenson et al. Resolving this discrepancy requires reimagining the water
clock as a two-stage system with the device consisting of a supply vessel at falling head,
a dripping vessel at constant head, and a measuring vessel of rising head for reading time.
Furthermore, prior designs of the water clock within recent scholarship have typically
depicted the device as a clepsydra or earthenware vessel with an outflowing spout. These
modern proposals, however, deviate from the Sumerian philological evidence. Therefore,
the redesign of the water clock proposed in this study begins by returning to the notion of
the gišdib-dib being a wooden (giš) device.
55 Michel-Nozières, “Second Millennium Babylonian Water Clocks,” 186, 195.
56 Brown, Fermor, and Walker, “Water Clock in Mesopotamia,” 134. The f fractions for all four examples in this source can also be obtained via the formula f = (xhb
√ao × ao)/ao3/2 where x is the in/outflow
in sila (qû).This formula implies f as a fraction of cubic volume.



34
Since an initial head of only 16.7 cm is required for the clock in general practice,
it would not be difficult for a skilled craftsman to carve a box with an inner depth of at
least this height from a single block of wood. If we imagine the inside of this box to have
cubic dimensions, then it quickly becomes apparent that a height ho of 10 fingers is by no
means arbitrary. Such a device would contain 9.32 minas (≈ 4.66 liters) of water—an
amount enough to last an entire day or night watch on an equinox in the “ideal year”
scheme. Furthermore, bow-drills with thorn drilling bits are known to bore consistent
holes of 1-3 mm in diameter, and such a tool could have been used to bore a hole of
desired diameter in the floor of the box.57 A tenth of a finger (≈ 1.7 mm) is probably the
minimum length measured in general practice by ancient Babylonians as evidenced by
constant hb being expressed as a fraction of 10 fingers in the mathematical texts.
However, the mathematical examples and the bow-drill archaeological evidence also
suggest that the absolute minimum length capable of being measured (or at least
approximated) during the Old Babylonian period was 0.05 fingers (≈ 0.9 mm). According
to experiments by Michel-Nozières, the minimum bore diameter for repeatable results is
0.9 mm; and I propose this bore diameter for both the supply and dripping vessels in
order to reduce water flow to the ideal rate of 0.104 ml/s as previously mentioned.58
When water flows from the supply vessel, it will be at a rate that is both variable
and initially ten times faster than desired. As a result, a second dripping vessel is needed
with an overflow mechanism to establish a constant head and flow. The final variable to
determine, of course, is the constant head hd that will allow water to drip at the desired
57 P. R. S. Moorey, Ancient Mesopotamian Materials and Industries: The Archaeological Evidence (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 1999), 107.

35
flow rate. The kinetic energy of the water is equal to the hydrostatic pressure at height hd
minus the capillary pressure from diameter φ. This relationship is represented by the
formula ghd − 2gλ2
φ =1
2 v2 where g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.80 m/s2) and v is
the kinetic velocity. In addition, the kinetic velocity should equal our desired flow rate Q
divided by the cross-sectional area of the outlet (i.e. v = Q/π(φ
2)2). Solving for hd yields
for the dripping vessel a constant head of 1.76 cm or approximately 1.05 fingers.59
Plant reeds (Phragmites australis) have always been abundant in the marshes and
wet regions of Mesopotamia and would serve as an ideal overflow mechanism for the
dripping vessel. The maximum wall thickness for this species of reed is on average 0.8
mm, so a skilled craftsman could easily measure 1 finger from the floor of the dripping
vessel and bore a hole to squeeze such a reed so that it was flush against the vessel’s
inner wall.60 The reed’s natural wall thickness would provide the extra 0.05 fingers
required for the constant head. More importantly, a falling head for the supply vessel
means that capillarity is once again an issue, with water flow stopping once the head
reached a height hc of 1.62 cm based on a 0.09 mm bore diameter. Water flowing through
the reed could be collected in a separate overflow vessel and returned to the supply vessel
when the flow rate of the latter had slowed to a few drips per second. Such replenishment
of the supply vessel would be needed every 2.5 hours on average. All of the above
demonstrates that the Babylonians would have been aware of capillary effects and
59 Q = 0.104 ml/s = 0.104 cm3/s; v = (0.104 cm3/s)/π(0.09 cm/2)2 = 16.3 cm/s; hd = ((16.3 cm/s)2/2
+ 2(980 cm/s2)(0.27 cm)2/0.09 cm)/980 cm/s2 = 1.76 cm.

possibly used capillarity to establish a constant head rather than try to avoid capillarity
effects altogether.
FIGURE 2: Potential design of water clock for Old Babylonian period
However, the use of a constant head and the need to replenish the supply vessel
strongly suggest that the water clock was an inflow device. Thus, the verb maqātu in BM
85210 IV: 11 of the mathematical texts should be interpreted as water falling into a
measuring vessel rather than falling out of a supply vessel.61 Figure 2 contains a potential

37
design of the water clock that attempts to address the issues so far discussed. The
dimensions of 10 fingers cubed for the measuring vessel allow a change of 1 finger in
water level to correspond roughly to 1 mina of water. Steele, Stephenson, and Morrison
note that the average accuracy to which time on the water clock could be read is 8
minutes.62 If we are correct in assuming that a tenth of finger was the smallest unit of
length used in general practice, then the dimensions of the water clock proposed in this
study confirm their observation. A water level change of this height translates to a
volume of 0.09 mina (≈ 0.167 cm x 16.7 cm x 16.7 cm = 46.6 ml), which equates to just
under 7.5 minutes in the “ideal year” scheme. From this, it is reasonable to conclude that
the measuring vessel marked water levels to the nearest tenth finger.
3.2. Reconciling the 2:1 Ratio
Although the proposed two-stage design for the water clock helps us understand
the capabilities and limitations of the device, it does nothing to explain the use of the 2:1
ratio between the lengths of day and night watches on the solstices. To provide some
perspective using the summer solstice as an example, it is as if an astrologer recorded
darkness as lasting for 8 hours when it actually lasted for 9 hours and 43 minutes. This
vast discrepancy has led numerous scholars to believe that celestial interests were strictly
divinatory and not in any sense astronomical prior to the eighth century BCE.
I contend, however, that the roots of 2:1 ratio are far more mundane. In his 1912
work on the first tablet of the MUL.APIN, King provides the following commentary on
text concerning the water clock:
An interesting indication of the practical character of the treatise may be seen in the facts that notes are given as to the payments made to the day and night watch respectively: during the six months from the 15th Tammuz to the 15th Tebet, the
62 Steele, Stephenson, and Morrison, “The Accuracy of Eclipse Times,” 344.



38
day-watch was paid four [minas] and the night-watch two, but during the remainder of the year the payments were reversed, the night-watch receiving twice the pay of the day-watch. The observers who were on duty during the longer and colder nights of winter and the long scorching days of the summer months were naturally more highly recompensed.63
King’s commentary is highly problematic because it suggests remuneration was based on
average summer and winter temperatures, inapplicable during milder seasons, rather than
time spent at labor. Nonetheless, it does introduce the notion that the 2:1 ratio served
more to dictate wages than describe astronomical lengths of time. We must remember
that the vast majority of ancient Mesopotamian labor was situated in the context of sunset
and sunrise, so night and day watches for sentry duty, as an example, would have to be
structured accordingly so that individuals arrived at their posts on time. In cases where
day and night shifts are divided into three watches each, only the first and third watches
of each shift are impacted by daylight and darkness length changes that occur throughout
the year. The second watch of each shift can always remain at 4 hours or 3 minas.
Interpreting the weights of the “ideal year” scheme in this manner results in a far more
accurate 11:7 ratio (i.e. 4+3+4
2+3+2) for the solstices than even the simple 3:2 approximation,
with discrepancies from actual observations being at most 20 minutes instead of nearly 2
hours.
3.2.1. Detecting Equinoxes and Solstices
Tablet 14 of the Enūma Anu Enlil provides a means to test the above assumption
of fixed second-watch lengths of 3 minas in the “ideal year” scheme. Table C of the
tablet also lists the length of daylight and darkness (in mina and šiqlu) for the 15th and
30th day of each month in the Babylonian ideal calendar starting with Month I or
Nissanu. For each half-month, the length of daylight or darkness changes by 10 šiqlu or a
63 Cited in Neugebauer, “The Water Clock in Babylonian Astronomy,” 38.



39
sixth of a mina.64 Table 6 below compares lengths of daylight in the ideal calendar
scheme with actual lengths of daylight observed from Babylon for each half-month in a
tropical year. Since the ideal calendar presumes 12 months of 30 days each, half-months
after the vernal equinox have 16 or 17 days and those after the autumnal equinox have 14
or 15 days in table 6 so as to better conform to a 365-day year.
As table 6 demonstrates, fixing the second watch to 3 minas and altering the first
and third watches according to the Old Babylonian scheme outlined in Tablet 14 results
in an average margin of error of 1.17%. This is extraordinary considering that an average
margin of error of 1.1% stems automatically from the accuracy to which the water clock
could have been read. The greatest margins of error occur around the solstices, primarily
because lengths of daylight and darkness are roughly the same plus or minus 5-6 days for
each solstice. But even these margins average to less than 4% (approximately 25
minutes), which is acceptable for these specific points in the year given both the general
purpose of the water clock and its technological constraints. Nevertheless, an overall
margin of error this small lends strong support to our assumption of fixed-length second
watches. This potentially means that the Babylonians were adequately able to detect and
measure equinoxes and solstices at the latest by 1600 BCE.
The two-stage water clock design proposed in this chapter would have allowed
astrologers to consistently detect of equinoxes and solstices during the Old Babylonian
period. As result, astrologers during this period would have also been able to determine
the length of the solar year with ease and to begin experimenting with month lengths and
intercalary months to reconcile the lunar calendar with the seasons. However, since the
water clock can only assist individuals in measuring observable lengths of daylight and

darkness, the equinox detected by astrologers in Babylon does not correspond to what we
know as the true equinox. This is because days of equal daylight and darkness vary
according to a location’s latitude. Ancient Babylon, with a latitude of 32°32’N,
experiences equal daylight and darkness 3-4 days before the true vernal equinox (March
20th) and 3-4 days after the true autumnal equinox (September 22nd), as table 6
illustrates. This issue is further complicated by the fact that precession, the slow and
continuous movement of Earth’s rotational axis that is similar to a spinning top, causes

41
the equinoxes and solstices to drift through the solar calendar over a 26,000 year period.
Consequently, equinoxes and solstices that we experience at present occur 9-10 days
earlier in the calendar than they did in the eighth century BCE. These final two points are
often overlooked in modern scholarship and will become essential as we begin to explore
the use of equinoxes and solstices in Babylonian calendrics.
3.3. Summary
References to the Babylonian water clock and its ability to detect cardinal
phenomena can be found in numerous texts of the Old Babylonian period. However,
reconstructing the clock in modern times has proved elusive, as scholars have struggled
to propose designs which conform to the laws of fluid mechanics as well as the
inscriptional and philological evidence. Most problematic of course is the “ideal year”
scheme and its representation of a 2:1 ratio between lengths of daylight and darkness on
solstices, the latter presumably measured by the water clock.
Mathematical exercises found in the Old Babylonian texts BM 85194 and
BM85210 provide important clues as to the water clock’s design. When one specific
variable in each exercise is reinterpreted as the cross-sectional area of the clock’s supply
tank rather than its height, it becomes mathematically clear that the water clock employed
cubic dimensions and was much smaller in volume than previously thought. Furthermore,
a second dripping vessel with an overflow mechanism would have been required to
ensure that water dripped at a desired, constant rate of two drops per second.
If we are correct in assuming that the clock measured water levels to the nearest
tenth finger, then the device measured time with an average accuracy of 8 minutes,
harmonizing with the findings of Steele, Stephenson, and Morrison. This level of



42
precision forces us to eliminate the assumption that weights depicted in the “ideal year”
scheme apply to all three watches in every shift. Fixing the second watch of each shift to
3 minas produces far more accurate ratios between lengths of daylight and darkness,
resulting in margins of error that better align with the capabilities of the clock. All of
these factors combined provide strong evidence that astrologers during the Old
Babylonian period were reasonably capable of detecting equinoxes and solstices to
determine when intercalary months needed to be inserted into their calendar.



CHAPTER 4: OLD BABYLONIAN CALENDRICS
Mesopotamian city-states were using numerous calendars as early as the middle
of the third millennium BCE. So many were used in fact that pre-Sargonic period tablets
(ca. 2350 BCE) attest to over 30 different month names, often with the same month name
referring to different months depending on the calendar. As a result, a numbering
convention of Months I-XII was soon established, presumably to alleviate confusion. In
the Sumerian city of Nippur, home of the chief god Enlil, scribes had developed a
calendar that was later adopted by Išbi-erra (ca. 2017-1985 BCE), the first king of the
Dynasty of Isin, and was used throughout southern Mesopotamia for the next two
centuries.66 Sin-muballit of Babylon conquered the city of Isin circa 1793 BCE; and one
year later, his son Hammurabi (ca. 1792-1750 BCE) ascended the throne and began
extending Babylonian control over Mesopotamia.67 By the end of his 42-year reign,
Hammurabi had united all of Mesopotamia, with Amorite and Sumerian calendars being
used in the northern and southern regions respectively.68
The assumption that each month began upon first visibility and sighting of the
new moon crescent is firmly supported by Old Babylonian texts such as the creation epic

of the Enūma Eliš. In Tablet V of the epic, the god Marduk commands the lunar phases
with the full moon occurring at mid-month and the new moon at month’s end:
The Moon he caused to shine, the night (to him) entrusting. He appointed him a creature of the night to signify the days: “Monthly, without cease form designs with a crown. At the month’s very start, rising over the land, Thou shalt have luminous horns to signify six days, On the seventh day reaching a [half]-crown. At full moon stand in opposition in mid-month. When the sun [overtakes] thee at the base of heaven, Diminish thy crown and retrogress in light. [At the time of disappearance] approach thou the course of the sun, And [on the twenty-ninth] thou shalt again stand in opposition to the sun.”69
In addition, we find third millennium instances of intercalations at intervals of 2
and 3 years. Tablet V of the Enūma Eliš also states that Marduk established three
constellations for each of the twelve months, which suggests that misalignment between a
month and its assigned constellations was possibly used as a tool to determine the need
for an intercalary month during this period.70 Yet, there are several instances during the
late third millennium when intervals of intercalation appear to be less consistent. During
the reigns of Ur-III Dynasty kings Amar-sin and Šu-sin (ca. 2045-2028 BCE) for
example, intercalations are attested in 4 successive years.71 Irregularities are also attested
in the second millennium BCE with 4 successive intercalations in years 32, 33, 34, and

35 of Hammurabi and no intercalary months between years 6 and 9 of Ammi-saduqa (ca.
1646-1626 BCE).72
Stern argues that these irregularities suggest that the insertion of an intercalary
month was largely a matter of royal decree; however, successive intercalary years could
be attempts to synchronize calendars from different regions as well.73 The month of
Ajaru, for instance, is the twelfth month in the Amorite calendar but the second month in
the Sumerian calendar.74 Transitioning from the Amorite calendar to the Sumerian
version would require at least 3 successive intercalary years, if the aim was to align
month names between the two systems. In the case of Hammurabi, the 4 successive
intercalary years mentioned above translate to roughly a 2.5 month shift in the start of the
calendar year.75 After Hammurabi’s unification of Mesopotamia, such a transition
appears to have been completed during the reign of his son, Samsuiluna (ca. 1749-1712
BCE). By year 21 of Samsuiluna’s reign, the Amorite calendar is no longer used to date
documents; and we see Sumerian month names becoming logograms to represent the
months of a Standard Mesopotamian calendar that gained wide acceptance over the next
millennium.76
4.1. Calendrics during the Old Babylonian Period
Because celestial omens in the Enūma Anu Enlil are primarily formulaic and not
linked to sequential observations, they are often dismissed as datable sources within

studies of Babylonian calendrics. Eclipse omens within the series nevertheless provide
valuable insights into month lengths and intercalation methods of the Old Babylonian
period. Each omen consists of a dependent clause or protasis that contains an
astronomical phenomenon with potential month and day of occurrence as well as a main
clause or apodosis that predicts an outcome affecting the king, the state, or the
surrounding nations:
If an eclipse occurs on the 14th day of Nisannu, and it begins in the south and [clears in the ...]; it begins in the evening watch and clears in the middle watch. You observe his (the god’s) eclipse and [you bear in mind the south]. The prediction is given for the king of Akkad: The king of Akkad will die. If the eclipse does not affect the king: There will be destruction and famine.
If an eclipse occurs on the 15th day, and it (the god) disappears while it is in eclipse, and a meteor falls: Flood will devastate the land. The economy of the land will diminish.
If an eclipse occurs on the 16th day, ditto, ditto (i.e. «and it disappears while in eclipse and a meteor falls»): The rains in the sky, the flood waters in the source will cease.
If an eclipse occurs on the 20th day, ditto, ditto: King will send messages of hostility to king.
If an eclipse occurs on the 21st day, ditto, ditto: The sea will dry up, the produce of the sea will fail. The grain will diminish in the shipping baskets. Grain will decrease. The economy will diminish.77
The above omen series reflects a structure that is commonly associated with omens of the
Old Babylonian period in which five omens are assigned to days 14, 15, 16, 20, and 21 of
each calendar month. The protasis is identical for all five omens while the apodosis for
each varies depending on the day of occurrence for the lunar eclipse. This scheme is
regarded as the “classical” pattern within celestial omen texts; although, it is important to
mention that some Old Babylonian series occasionally assign omens to days 18 and 19 as
77 Tablet XXI of the Enūma Anu Enlil; for translation, see Rochberg-Halton, ABCD, 233-234.



47
well. Even more peculiar is the complete omission of day 17 omens in series during this
period, with the rationale for such an omission remaining a complete mystery.78
Of course, what immediately stands out in the classical pattern is the possibility of
lunar eclipses occurring on days 20 and 21 of the lunar month. The Babylonians clearly
understand that lunar eclipses can only occur during a full moon, the latter of which they
had early situated at mid-month as evidenced by the Enūma Eliš. Moreover, any
inhabitant of Mesopotamia could determine the progress of the current month by simply
looking up and seeing which part of the Moon was illuminated as illustrated in figure 1.
Therefore, recorded occurrences of lunar eclipses on days 20 and 21 must reflect the use
of a schematic lunisolar calendar rather than an unperceived discrepancy of 6 or 7 days.
4.1.1. Month Lengths
Since their inception, Babylonian calendar months appear to have either 29 or 30
days; and certainly by the late sixth century BCE, we begin to see schematically a
monthly alternation of “full” (30-day) and “hollow” (29-day) months as structured in
Babylonian, Persian, and Hebrew calendars of this period. Alternating month-lengths in
this fashion, however, limits possible lunar eclipse occurrences to the ideal days of 14
and 15 in the lunar month. If we start with the full moon occurring on the 14th of Month I
for example, each calendar month for the year must only have 29 days in order for a lunar
eclipse to have the possibility of occurring on the 20th of Month XII. Moreover, each
calendar month in the subsequent year must contain 30 days in order to restore the
possibility of eclipses occurring on the 14th of a month. Thus, omen series of the
classical pattern in the Enūma Anu Enlil appear to reflect a yearly rather than monthly
alternation of full and hollow months.

Appendix B provides a sample schematic calendar illustrating the above approach
over two 8-year cycles from 743 to 727 BCE, with table 7 summarizing data related to
full moon and lunar eclipse occurrences. Under the proposed calendar scheme, Old
Babylonian omen series are clearly formulaic since the structure prevents months in the
middle of the calendar from ever having eclipses that occur on days 14, 15, 20, and 21.
Full moon and potential lunar eclipse occurrences appear to have a bell-curve
distribution, with neither potential nor visible eclipse occurrences on day 22. Almost half
of visible eclipses in the sample dataset occur on days 18 and 19, a finding that belies the
occasional assignment of omens to these days under the classical pattern. However, this
current distribution of visible eclipses can easily change with a different range of dates. It
is quite possible that omen series reflecting the classical pattern were initially recorded
during a period when visible lunar eclipses occurred more frequently in months towards
the end and beginning of the calendar year (e.g. Months XI, XII, XII2, I, and II). But most
surprising is that although day 17 is the most frequent day for full moon occurrences and
second most frequent for potential lunar eclipses within this calendar scheme, no visible
eclipse seems to occur for this day. This result may seem purely coincidental for the date



49
range of appendix B; nevertheless, it confirms an empirical basis for the omission of day
17 in Old Babylonian omen series that could potentially date pertinent tablets of the
Enūma Anu Enlil.
4.1.2. Intercalation
Although intercalary months have been used since the second millennium BCE,
the earliest extant discussions of intercalation practices do not appear until the first
millennium BCE with the MUL.APIN providing two different intercalary schemes. The
first, as alluded to earlier, determines the need for an intercalary month by comparing the
visibility of the moon in relation to certain constellations during the equinoxes and
solstices. The second scheme is based on a simple rule of inserting an intercalary month
every 3 solar years or 37 lunations. Neither of these schemes, however, appears to be
used during the Old Babylonian period. As Hunger and Pingree note, constellations under
the first scheme would be acceptable approximations for both solstices and the autumnal
equinox (the constellations assigned to the vernal equinox in the scheme are extrapolated
and not based on observations) but are only applicable to a few centuries before and after
ca. 1000 BCE.79 In addition, Old Babylonian administrative documents of 1-year rental
home leases contain dates that include a mixture of intercalary months VI2 and XII2
during the reign of Hammurabi, suggesting at a minimum that intercalation intervals were
not always in whole solar years.80
One potential clue concerning Old Babylonian intercalation procedures can be
found in Tablet 63 of the Enūma Anu Enlil, which records over a 21-year period the rise

times of Venus as well as its first and last visibilities on the horizon. Venus has a synodic
period of 583.92 days or 20 lunar months minus approximately 6 days; and as it orbits the
Sun, it becomes invisible to observers on Earth twice: (1) for 1-19 days when it passes
between the Earth and Sun, known as an inferior conjunction, and (2) for 55-70 days
when it passes behind the Sun, called a superior conjunction.81 The start and end of each
superior conjunction are regarded respectively as the moments of last visibility and first
visibility. More importantly as these first and last visibilities migrate through the solar
year, they return to their initial days of occurrence in an 8-year cycle—more precisely 99
lunations minus 4 days.
The first 10 omens of Tablet 63 contain visibilities for a full 8-year cycle of
Venus, after which year 8 of Ammi-saduqa is inscribed.82 This explicitly dates the omens
of Tablet 63 to the entire reign of Ammi-saduqa (ca. 1646-1626 BCE). If the Babylonians
were aware of the above 8-year cycle for Venus, then there is an extremely high
probability that they we also cognizant of the 8-year cycle between lunar phases,
equinoxes, and solstices. Therefore, it is certainly possible that Old Babylonian calendar
schemes required 3 intercalations every 8 years as previously discussed.
It is often claimed that intercalary months were inserted to ensure that each
calendar year began on or after the vernal equinox. This claim is based on Huber’s work
on Babylonian New Year conjunctions (i.e. the new moon immediately preceding 1
Nisannu) from the mid-eighth to fifth centuries BCE. According to Huber, the vernal
equinox occurs on average 9 days before 1 Nisannu after ca. 610 BCE. Yet, it is

51
important to note that this represents the average and not the full possible range of the
vernal equinox occurring 30 days before and 18 days after the start of the calendar year.83
Consequently, it would be erroneous to conclude from Huber’s data that the Babylonians
always intended the vernal equinox to occur in the last month of the year. Several fixed
schemes for calculating equinoxes and solstices used during the fourth century BCE and
later add further support to this position, with numerous recordings of the vernal equinox
occurring on and after 2 Nisannu.84
With New Year conjunctions failing to support the assertion that the vernal
equinox was always expected to occur before a specific calendar date, scholars like Stern
maintain that there is no astronomical rationale between the equinoxes and Babylonian
schematic calendars as previously mentioned. The “ideal year” scheme, however,
suggests an attempt by the Babylonians to stabilize the summer solstice, autumnal
equinox, winter solstice, and vernal equinox in Months III, VI, IX, and XII respectively.
In the MUL.APIN and related Neo-Assyrian texts, these cardinal phenomena are shifted
one month later; but Britton suspects that the emergence of the Neo-Babylonian Empire
marks a return to the Old Babylonian tradition.85 This study agrees with Britton’s
suspicion; therefore, the role of solstices in relation to lunar phases, specifically the new
moon, is also explored in appendix B as a means of determining the need for intercalation
within an 8-year schematic cycle.

85 Britton, “Calendars, Intercalations and Year-Lengths,” 119.



52
The date range of appendix B has been selected to reflect Huber’s analysis that
the vernal equinox on average preceded the new moon by 9 days.86 Furthermore, the
initial vernal equinox of the sample dataset has intentionally been dated to 21 Month XII
so that the new moon is observed on 30 Month XII (remembering that each calendar day
begins after sunset). Notice in year 1 of each cycle that cardinal phenomenon, as
potentially detected by the water-clock, fall either on or within a few days of the new
moon. This lunisolar alignment marks the start of each 8-year cycle. All cardinal
phenomena also occur in their respective months per the “ideal year” scheme, if we
interpret the new moon to represent the official end of the lunar month. Conversely, each
cycle ends with all cardinal phenomena occurring on or within a few days of the full
moon in year 8, which most likely provides the empirical basis for the “ideal year”
scheme with equinoxes and solstices occurring at their respective mid-months.
In year 2 of the first cycle in appendix B, the summer solstice (-741 July 1)
undoubtedly occurs after the new moon by more than 7 days and well into Month IV. I
contend that such an occurrence indicates the need for an intercalary month VI2. Once
inserted, the other cardinal phenomena occur in their assigned months rather than each
drifting a month later into the calendar. A similar situation also occurs for the summer
86 Huber does not explicitly mention the vernal equinox occurring on average 9 days before New Year conjunctions during the Neo-Babylonian period, but this fact can be discerned easily from his data (Huber, Astronomical Dating of Babylon I and Ur III, 9). Using the work of Hunger and Sachs on NeoAssyrian lunar eclipse records dating from 728 to 625 BCE, Huber notes that the vernal equinox occurred on average 14 days after New Year conjunctions (i.e. 14 Month I rather than 21 Month XII) in harmony with the calendar scheme detailed in the MUL.APIN. This dramatic change of average vernal equinox occurrences in relation to New Year conjunctions suggests an institutional shift in calendric procedures during the Neo-Babylonian period, which per Britton this study interprets as having roots in the Old Babylonian tradition. Preliminary experimentation reveals that the length of time between the initial vernal equinox and New Year conjunction of an 8-year cycle equals the average length of time between the two phenomena for the entire cycle. For example, if the initial length of time between the two phenomena was -6 days (i.e. the vernal equinox occurred 6 days prior to the New Year conjunction), then the average length of time between the two phenomena for the entire 8-year cycle would also be -6 days.



53
solstice in year 5 (-738 July 1). In year 7, the summer solstice (-736 June 30) occurs
again after the new moon but this time within a few a days. Recall from chapter 3 that
lengths of daylight and darkness are roughly the same for 5-6 days surrounding each
solstice. Therefore, the Babylonians probably waited for a more clear indication to insert
an intercalary month. The occurrence of the winter solstice (-736 December 27) 6 days
after the new moon provides such an indication, with the insertion of an intercalary
month XII2 again restoring occurrences of the other cardinal phenomena to their assigned
months. Thus, we have an 8-year schematic cycle with 3 intercalations at intervals of 2.5
or 3 years that also demonstrates the need for both intercalary months VI2 and XII2 as
observed during the Old Babylonian period. More importantly, the rules of intercalation
appear to be very simple under the Old Babylonian tradition:
1. If the summer solstice occurs undoubtedly after the new moon immediately following the end of Month III (i.e. after 6 or more days), insert an intercalary month VI2.
2. If the winter solstice occurs undoubtedly after the new moon immediately following the end of Month IX (i.e. after 6 or more days), insert an intercalary month XII2.
By using the solstices to determine intercalation, the Babylonians would know to insert
an intercalary month by as much as 70 days in advance, doubling the range confirmed by
Samuel Greengus from Old Babylonian administrative documents.87
It is important to note that years of intercalation are by no means fixed within the
Old Babylonian scheme. Whereas intercalary years in the Metonic cycle and the
hypothesized octaeteris are determined arithmetically to prevent the epact from
exceeding 30 days, intercalary years under the Old Babylonian tradition can fluctuate
depending on solstice and new moon occurrences. For example, year 7 of the first 8-year
87 Greengus, “The Akkadian Calendar at Sippar,” 214n20.



54
cycle in appendix B requires the insertion of an intercalary month XII2. In the next cycle,
however, an intercalary month VI2 is inserted into year 8 since both solstices of year 7 are
within a few days of the new moon. Consequently, Babylonian intercalation patterns are
nearly impossible to detect if one ignores cardinal phenomena within each cycle.
4.1.3. Calendar Drift vs. Extra Days
As previously stated, 99 synodic months exceeds 8 solar years by 1.5 days or 3
days over two 8-year cycles. This surplus of lunar days has the potential to cause lunar
phases and eclipse occurrences to drift through the calendar such that either occur on any
given day of the month. Under the proposed Old Babylonian calendar scheme, new
moons would eventually occur on day 15 and full moons on day 30 after only a few cycle
iterations. The issue of calendar drift appears to have been addressed in the Neo-Assyrian
period via the adjustment of month days when the new moon no longer coincided with its
expected date:
To the king, [my lo]rd, (from) your servant Adad-[šumu-usur]: Good health to the king, [my lord]! May the gods of Aššūr, Sîn, and Šamaš, [Nabû, Marduk] (and) the great gods of heaven [and earth] very much bless the king, my lord. (When) I first observed the (crescent of the) Moon on the 30th day, it was (already) high, (too) high to be (the crescent) of the 30th. Its position was like that of the 2nd day. (So), if it suits the king, my lord, the king should wait for the report of Assur before fixing the date. Perhaps the king, my lord, (now) says: “Why didn’t you decide (about the matter)?” (Break) The king should [inquire] the scri[bes]; the days [...] (remainder lost)88
As evidenced in the above letter from the exorcist Adad-šumu-usur to Aššurbanipal (668
627 BCE), the first day of a month could be slightly adjusted if there was clear evidence
that the first crescent had been observed too late (or too early). Adad-šumu-usur asks the
king to wait before “fixing the date,” presumably to mitigate calendar drift by revising
88 ABL 894; trans. Parpola, LAS, vol. 1, 89.



55
the month to have 29 days so that day 30 now becomes day 1 of the next month. Parpola
notes in his commentary that the frequency at which the king really took the trouble to
adjust the calendar by decree is at best speculative, but the letter does seem to suggest
that the need for such decisions was rare given the exorcist’s attempt to explain why he
had not already addressed the matter on his own.89
It is clear from the “classical pattern” that the Babylonians had established a
similar approach to ensure that full moon and lunar eclipse occurrences remained
between days 14-21. I argue this was accomplished by inserting an extra day into the
calendar to prevent the new moon from occurring on the 7th of the month or later. One
added advantage of this proposed strategy is that it practically eliminates the full moon
from occurring on day 22 or later, aligning well with the “classical pattern.” Moreover, it
is quite possible that another method for inserting extra days could have been used
namely when the new moon failed to return to day 30 towards the end of even-numbered
cycle years; but this approach becomes increasingly difficult since insertions can only be
determined in hindsight one month later at a minimum rather than within a week of the
new moon occurrence as with the Neo-Assyrian example.
In the sample dataset of appendix B, an extra day is not required until year 7 of
the first cycle to prevent the new moon (-735 January 20) from occurring on 7 Month XI.
This is achieved by revising Month X to have 30 instead of 29 days. Another extra day
must be inserted uncommonly soon in Month XII2; nevertheless, the insertion of both of
these days enables the cycle to end with the new moon (-734 April 8) occurring on 30
Month XII just as it had in the previous cycle. A third insertion is not needed until year 7
of the next cycle with the new moon in Month XII (-727 February 20), which again
89 Parpola, LAS, vol. 2, 101-102.



56
allows the final new moon of the cycle to occur on 30 Month XII. Hence, the surplus
lunar days expected over a 16-year period are satisfied by revising three 29-day months
so that each has 30 days.
Just as with intercalary months, the insertion of extra days is not fixed to specific
years within each cycle but can fluctuate depending on new moon occurrences. The
structure of the proposed calendar scheme causes new moon dates to drift towards day 7
near the end of odd-numbered cycle years when all months are allocated 29 days.
Therefore, adding an extra day to a 29-day month could be a likely method in which
astrologers of the Old Babylonian period mitigated calendar drift. More importantly, this
combination of non-fixed months with 30 days potentially explains why prior scholarship
has failed to detect the presence of “leap” days in Babylonian calendar schema,
particularly since it has assumed that month lengths are determined solely by visual
confirmation.
4.2. Summary
Astrologers practicing during the Old Babylonian period clearly know that lunar
eclipses can only occur at the middle of each lunation, yet numerous omens composed
during this time reflect a structure in which full moons and lunar eclipses can occur as
late as days 20 and 21 of the lunar month. This scheme requires the use of fixed rather
than visually-confirmed month lengths in order to accommodate and maintain a 7-day
range of possible eclipse days. As demonstrated in this chapter, the only way to achieve
this structure is for all months in a year to alternate between having 29 or 30 days.
Moreover, since the Babylonians were aware that the first and last visibilities of
Venus occur in an 8-year cycle during the seventeenth century BCE, it is very likely that



57
they were cognizant of the 8-year lunisolar cycle as well. It is certainly possible, as
shown in appendix B, that the latter provided the basis for intercalation during the Old
Babylonian period. However, rather than fix intercalation at years 3, 5/6, and 8 as with
the octaeteris, the Babylonians developed fixed rules of intercalation to stabilize cardinal
phenomena in specific months as outlined in the “ideal year” scheme. Replicating these
rules within an 8-year lunisolar cycle produces the astonishing result of each equinox and
solstice, as detected by the water clock, occurring on or near the new moon in the first
year and on or near the full moon in the eighth year. This strongly suggests that the “ideal
year” scheme represents an idealized depiction of the last year in each cycle. We thus
have evidence of the Babylonians employing a sophisticated, lunisolar calendar scheme
early in the second millennium BCE.



CHAPTER 5: CONCLUSION
Do you believe then that the sciences would ever have arisen and become great if there had not beforehand been magicians, alchemists, astrologers and wizards?
—Friedrich Nietzsche
Many regard Galileo Galilei (1564-1642 CE) as the “father of observational
astronomy,” but few are aware that he and Johannes Kepler (1571-1630 CE) were also
noted astrologers of their time. Galileo’s reputation for casting horoscopes is said to have
brought requests (and lucrative high fees) from cardinals, princes, and patricians.
Moreover, his extensive attempts to calculate birth charts for himself and his daughters,
Virginia and Livia, suggest that he held some value to the practice.90 Kepler’s devotion to
the craft is evident with his publication of 18 astrological almanacs over the course of his
life.91 In addition, Isaac Newton (1642-1727 CE) is known to have devoted much of his
time toward the areas of biblical prophecy and eschatology, using his knowledge of the
precession of equinoxes to revise ancient chronology and to predict the final apocalypse
in the book of Revelation to occur in 2060.92 Europe in the seventeenth century CE thus
reflects a period in which scientists doubled as astrologers and prophets, all in an effort to
understand the laws and rules by which perceived supernatural forces interacted with the
natural world. Yet, no one argues that the contributions of Galileo, Kepler, and Newton

59
no longer constitute as science simply because they applied their knowledge to non
scientific endeavors.
Likewise for Babylonia in the seventeenth century BCE, there was no distinction
between astrologer and astronomer. The individuals occupying these roles were one in
the same; and they (1) meticulously recorded lunar and planetary observations, (2) made
predictions, (3) built apparatuses to improve the precision of those observations and
predictions, and (4) established rules to align the reckoning of time with reoccurring
phenomena. Again, all of these activities were conducted with the aim of understanding
the laws by which unseen forces (in the form of their gods) affected the ancient world and
its affairs.
Whether the interplay between religion and science is more explicit during the
Old Babylonian period or conveniently ignored during Europe’s scientific revolution, a
persistent bias embedding modern scholarship is that the religious pursuits of the
Babylonians negatively impacted their powers of observation. Consequently, lunar
eclipses recorded on day 21 of a month or daylight/darkness ratios of 2:1 are perceived as
gross errors rather than as signs of intentional structure. Another pervasive bias, to
borrow from Franz Boas, is that Hellenistic culture “represents the highest cultural
development” of the ancient world “toward which all other more primitive cultural types
tend;” and we, therefore, reconstruct an orthogenetic development towards Greek
civilization.93 In other words, we assume that all paths of scientific innovation lead to
Athens, with parallel achievements either being inferior or occurring in close
chronological proximity.

60
We certainly cannot deny the role of cultural diffusion between ancient Near
Eastern and Mediterranean societies. However, the primary goal of this study has been to
illustrate how the discovery of period relations between cardinal phenomena and lunar
phases could enable any civilization to embark on its own trajectory of calendar
development. The Mesopotamian trajectory appears to be best characterized as a gradual
shift from annual to semiannual to monthly alternations of month lengths of 29 to 30
days. Furthermore, while the Hellenistic approach seeks to reconcile the epact
arithmetically with fixed points of intercalation at the end of specific years, Babylonian
calendrical rules are designed to insert intercalary months whenever lunisolar phenomena
reveal that the epact has reached a certain threshold. The degree to which Babylonian
calendrics influenced Hellenistic calendar developments remains unknown. Nevertheless,
it is clear from the prominence of the “classical pattern” in lunar eclipse omens of the
Enūma Anu Enlil, the invention of the water-clock, as well as knowledge of Venus and
New Year conjunctions during the first half of the second millennium BCE that the
Babylonians had already been using their own 8-year lunisolar cycle more than a
thousand years before the earliest appearances of the octaeteris in Greece.
By uncovering the basic strategies of Babylonian calendrics, this study opens
numerous opportunities in the field of astronomical chronology (the dating of historical
events that are associated with astronomical observations). We can now potentially
replace year approximations of key events with absolute dates and more easily identify
discrepancies between textual sources to resolve problematic chronologies. But more
importantly, we can also begin to rewrite the history of astronomy with its birthplace now
in ancient Babylon.

APPENDIX A: SAROS FIVE-MONTH LUNAR ECLIPSE DISTRIBUTIONS
The following table applies the Saros scheme of 8-7-8-7-8 as proposed by John
M. Steele for the distribution of lunar eclipses occurring after five-month intervals (as
opposed to the more common six-month intervals) for two Saros series starting from 747
BCE. This scheme is compared against an actual distribution of five-month interval
eclipses (rows highlighted in bold) as well as a distribution that would have been
observable to Babylonian astronomers. See chapter 1 for detailed analysis of the
distributions.
Column Descriptions
LC: long count of actual days since the initial event
EI (Days): lunar eclipse interval in days
Eclipse Date: Julian date of lunar eclipse (expressed in astronomical year numbering in which the year 0 = 1 BCE, −1 = 2 BCE, etc.)
Eclipse Visibility: visibility of the lunar eclipse from within Babylonia
SE Num.: Saros series lunar eclipse number from 1 to 38
EI (Months): lunar eclipse interval in months; five-month eclipse interval events are in bold
8-7-8-7-8 Scheme: proposed Saros distribution of 8-7-8-7-8 for lunar eclipses occurring after five month intervals
Observ. Scheme: actual distribution of observable lunar eclipses occurring after five month intervals from within Babylonia

APPENDIX B: OLD BABYLONIAN PERIOD SAMPLE CALENDRICAL TABLE
The following table represents a sample 8-year or octaeteris calendar scheme for
the Old Babylonian period. All data in the table are calculated using astronomical
algorithms from Meeus.94 Delta T (ΔT) adjustments for the eighth century BCE have
been obtained from Morrison and Stephenson.95 The new moon of -742 April 7 has been
set to the Babylonian date of 30 Month XII for illustrative purposes. Since days begin at
sunset, events with times between 0:00 UT and sunset UT+3 actually occur one day prior
to the Babylonian date indicated.
Column Descriptions
CY: cycle year number from 1 to 8
SM: synodic month number within the eight-year cycle
ML: month length in days
LC: long count of actual days since the initial event
Julian Date: Julian date of lunar event (expressed in astronomical year numbering in which the year 0 = 1 BCE, −1 = 2 BCE, etc.)
Babylonian Date: Babylonian date as day and month with VI2 and XII2 indicating intercalary months
Event: astronomical event that occurred
Time (UT): universal time (UT) of the mid-point of the astronomical event
Comments: notes pertaining to the astronomical event
