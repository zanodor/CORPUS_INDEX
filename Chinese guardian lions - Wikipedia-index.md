Chinese guardian lions
Chinese guardian lions or Imperial guardian lions, often miscalled "Foo
Dogs" in the West, are a common representation of the lion in imperial China.
Chinese guardian lions are sometimes referred to in English as shishi, from the
Chinese shí shī (Chinese: 石 獅 ; pinyin: shíshī; literally: "stone lion"), which
refers specifically to lion sculptures in stone. The concept, which originated and
became popular in Chinese Buddhism, subsequently spread to other parts of
Asia including, Japan, Korea, Tibet, Thailand, Burma, Vietnam, Sri Lanka,
Nepal, Cambodia and Laos[.1]

Since the introduction of the lion symbolism from Indian culture especially
through Buddhist symbolism, statues of guardian lions have traditionally stood
in front of Chinese Imperial palaces, Imperial tombs, government offices,
temples, and the homes of government officials and the wealthy, from the Han
dynasty (206 BC – AD 220), and were believed to have powerful mythic
protective benefits. They are also used in other artistic contexts, for example on
door-knockers, and in pottery. Pairs of guardian lion statues are still common
decorative and symbolic elements at the entrances to restaurants, hotels,
supermarkets and other structures, with one sitting on each side of the entrance,
in China and in other places around the world where the Chinese people have
immigrated and settled, especially in localChinatowns.
The lions are usually depicted in pairs. When used as statuary the pair would
consist of a male leaning his paw upon an embroidered ball (in imperial
contexts, representing supremacy over the world ) and a female restraining a
playful cub that is on its back (representing nurture [).2]

Guardian lions are referred to in various ways depending on language and
context. In Chinese they are traditionally called simply shi ( 獅 , Pinyin: shī)
meaning lion—the wordshi itself is thought to be derived from the Persian word
šer.[3] Lions were first presented to the Han court by emissaries from Central
Asia and Persia, and by the sixth century AD they were already popularly
depicted as guardian figures.[4] Today the guardian lions are more usually
specified by reference to the medium or material, for example:
Stone lion (石獅, Pinyin: Shíshī): for a stone sculpture; or
Bronze lion (銅獅, Pinyin: Tóngshī): for a bronze sculpture.
and less commonly:
Auspicious lion (瑞獅, Pinyin: Ruìshī): referring to the Tibetan Snow Lion or good fortune
Fortuitous lion (福獅, Pinyin: fúshī): referring to good fortune
Buddha's or Buddhist lion(佛獅, Pinyin: fóshī): referring in a religious context to the lion as protector ofBuddha
In Japan: the lion figures are known asKomainu (狛犬, lion dogs)
In Korea: known as Haetae
In Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia: known as Chinthe and gave their name to theWorld War II Chindit soldiers
In Okinawa, Japan: known asShisa
In Sri Lanka: known as Simha ( ංහ )
In Thailand: known as Singha
In Tibet: known as a Snow Lion
In Vietnam: known as Sư tử đá
In English and several Western languages, the guardian lions are often
referred in a multitude of name such as: "Fu Dogs",[5] "Foo Dogs", "Fu
Lions", "Fo Lions", and "Lion Dogs".[6] The term "Fo" or "Fu" may be
transliterations to the words 佛 (pinyin: fó) or 福 (pinyin: fú), which means
"Buddha" or "prosperity" in Chinese, respectivel.yHowever, Chinese reference
to the guardian lions are seldom prefixed with 佛 or 福, and more importantly
never referred to as "dogs".
Reference to guardian lions as dogs in Western cultures may be due to the
Japanese reference to them as "Korean dogs" ( 狛犬・高麗犬) due to their
transmission from China through Korea into Japan. It may also be due to the
misidentification of the guardian lion figures as representing certain Chinese
dog breeds such as theChow Chow (鬆獅犬, Pinyin: sōngshī quǎn, lit. "puffy
lion dog") or Shih Tzu (獅子狗; Pinyin: Shīzi Gǒu, lit. "lion dog").

Appearance



The lions are traditionally carved from decorative stone, such as marble and
granite or cast in bronze or iron. Because of the high cost of these materials
and the labor required to produce them, private use of guardian lions was
traditionally reserved for wealthy or elite families. Indeed, a traditional symbol
of a family's wealth or social status was the placement of guardian lions in
front of the family home. However, in modern times less expensive lions,
mass-produced in concrete and resin, have become available and their use is
therefore no longer restricted to the elite.
The lions are always presented in pairs, a manifestation of yin and yang, the
female representing yin and the male yang. The male lion has its right front
paw on a type of cloth ball simply called an "embroidered ball" (xiù qiú, 绣
球 ), which is sometimes carved with a geometric pattern (coincidentally,
resembling the figure called "Flower of Life" in the New Age movement). The
female is essentially identical, but has a cub under the closer (left) paw to the
male, representing the cycle of life. Symbolically, the female fu lion protects
those dwelling inside (the living soul within ), while the male guards the
structure ( the external material elements ) . Sometimes the female has her
mouth closed, and the male open. This symbolizes the enunciation of the
sacred word "om". However, Japanese adaptations state that the male is
inhaling, representing life, while the female exhales, representing death. Other
styles have both lions with a single large pearl in each of their partially opened
mouths. The pearl is carved so that it can roll about in the lion's mouth but
sized just large enough so that it can never be removed.
According to feng shui, correct placement of the lions is important to ensure
their beneficial effect. When looking out of a building through the entrance to
be guarded, looking in the same direction as the lions, the male is placed on the
left and the female on the right. So when looking at the entrance from outside
the building, facing the lions, the male lion with the ball is on the right, and the
female with the cub is on the left.
Chinese lions are intended to reflect the emotion of the animal as opposed to
the reality of the lion. This is in distinct opposition to the traditional English
lion which is a lifelike depiction of the animal. The claws, teeth and eyes of the
Chinese lion represent power. Few if any muscles are visible in the Chinese
lion whereas the English lion shows its power through its life like
characteristics rather than through stylized representation.
Asiatic lions were once quite common throughout their historic range inSouthwest, South and Central Asia and are believed to be the
ones depicted by the guardian lions in Chinese culture[.7]
In India where the Asiatic lion also lived it is known by its ancient Sanskrit name "Sinh" or "Simha" (िसंह) and due to travels of
Buddhist monks many East Asian languages have borrowed from this Sanskrit word for lion. Since ancient times Lion statues
adorned palaces and temples and other important buildings in India and in Buddhist culture Lion was depicted as the protector of
Dharma. In Hinduism lions are associated with Gods and Goddesses.

History



With increased trade during theHan dynasty and cultural exchanges through the Silk
road, lions were introduced into China from the ancient states of Central Asia by
peoples of Sogdiana, Samarkand, and the Yuezhi (月氏) in the form of pelts and live
tribute, along with stories about them from Buddhist priests and travelers of the
time.
[8]
This exchange can be seen in that the Chinese word for lion is "Shi" (師,
later 獅/狮), which shares the same etymological roots as "Shiar" ( شیر )/šer
[3]
, the
Persian languagename for the animal.
Several instances of lions as imperial tributes from Central Asia were recorded in the
document Book of the Later Han ( 後 漢 書 ) written from 25-220 CE. On one
particular event, on the eleventh lunar month of 87 CE, "... an envoy from Parthia
offered as tribute a lion and an ostrich"
[9]
to the Han court. Indeed, the lion was
associated by the Han Chinese to earlier venerated creatures of the ancient Chinese,
most notably by the monk Huilin (慧琳) who stated that "the mythic suan-ni (狻猊) is actually the lion, coming from the Western
Regions" (狻猊即狮子也,出西域).
[10]
The Buddhist version of the Lion was originally introduced to Han China as the protector of dharma and these lions have been found
in religious art as early as 208 BC. Gradually they were incorporated as guardians of the Chinese Imperial dharm. Lions seemed
appropriately regal beasts to guard the emperor's gates and have been used as such since. There are various styles of guardian lions
reflecting influences from different time periods, imperial dynasties, and regions of China. These styles vary in their artistic detail
and adornment as well as in the depiction of the lions from fierce to serene.
Although the form of the Chinese guardian lion was quite varied during its early history in China, the appearance, pose, and
accessories of the lions eventually became standardized and formalized during the Ming and Qing dynasties into more or less its
present form.
