Vatican Assassins G. Gordon Battle Liddy and J. Edgar Hoover, 1960 #20
This photo illustrates the fact that FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover heavily recruited his agents from the Jesuit Universities of Georgetown, Fordham and Marquette as well as Mormon Universities controlled by Shriner Freemasonry. G. Gordon Liddy, an Irish-Italian Roman Catholic whose uncle, Ray Abbaticchio, was one of Hoover’s most notorious FBI agents, received his education from the Jesuits at Fordham of whom he said in his book, Will: The Autobiography of G. Gordon Liddy:
“As much as I had admired the German Benedictines, I admired the Jesuits more . . . the Society of Jesus was something special; the shock troop of the Catholic church. So effective an organization was it that . . . Heinrich Himmler used it as the model for his own corps of Ubermenschen [Supermen], the Schutzstaffel [the SS, known as “the Order of the Death’s Head,” considered by Catholic Archbishop Grober of Freiburg to be the most respectable of the Nazi Party organizations], whose hand-picked members swore a special oath of loyalty to the Fuhrer as the highest rank of Jesuits [Professed of the Fourth Vow] did to the Pope . . . These men [Professed Jesuits at the Fordham University

Club] ran the world, and it was obvious that they enjoyed it.” {66} [Emphasis added]
Familiar with certain conspirators involved in the death of President Kennedy, they being Papal Knights Cartha DeLoach of the FBI and E. Howard Hunt of the CIA, Liddy was a highly trained and mentally disciplined assassin having formally boasted, “I could kill as I could run — like a machine.” This man was used by the Order’s Council on Foreign Relations to carry out the botched Watergate burglary. All of the parties involved were caught and made a deal to provide evidence for the embarrassment of President Nixon — all except the Cubans and G. Gordon Liddy. For the Jesuits intended to remove from office the Commander-in-Chief of their Fourteenth Amendment American Empire as a result of his disobedience to their Council on Foreign Relations. It began with Watergate, and upon moving to his betrayal by Secretary of State and Knight of Malta, “Deep Throat” Alexander Haig (whose younger brother, Francis R. Haig, is a Jesuit {67}), finally culminated in the House Resolution for his impeachment introduced by a Jesuit and current Georgetown University law professor – the socialist-communist and anti-capital punishment gun grabber, Congressman Robert F. Drinan – America’s evil “Rodin the Jesuit” of Eugene Sue’s Nineteenth Century masterpiece, The Wandering Jew!
Valuing loyalty to the President over life, Liddy resolutely remained silent. For this disobedience in refusing to betray Nixon, the Order’s criminal, most reversed federal judge, “Maximum” John Sirica, sentenced our friend to twenty years in prison, later commuted to eight by the Society’s Trilateralist and servant of Masonic David Rockefeller, “the wimpy and gimpy” Bible-rejecter, Jimmy Carter. Anticipating the command to kill E. Howard Hunt in prison, Liddy made ready his plan to poison him. But the order never came down! Hunt had been a key player in the Kennedy assassination and was not to be touched. But in the providence of the risen Son of God, Hunt would live, only to suffer the shame and disgrace of being present while Mark Lane, the Jewish defense lawyer hated by both Hunt and his master, William F. Buckley, Jr. (whom Lane had defeated in a previous civil case), established before a jury in open court that Hunt, acting as an agent for the Central Intelligence Agency, had in fact been in Dallas on the day Kennedy was murdered. (Additionally, the Israeli Mossad’s Masonic Yitzak Rabin had also been in Dallas that day according to his late wife, Leah Rabin.) Like Pope Pius VII and Pius IX, the Company of Jesus punished and yet spared the life of G. Gordon Liddy for daring to resist the POWER of its General, Pedro Arrupe, the Black Pope.
“Were God to order me through the voices of my superiors to put to death, father, mother, children, brothers and sisters, I would do it with an eye as tearless, and a heart as calm, as if I were seated at the banquet of the Paschal Lamb. Affirmation of a Jesuit” {68}

These initials are the abbreviations for the names of the gods of the pagan Egyptian trinity, they being Isis (the Mother goddess and “Queen of Heaven”), Horus (the deified Child) and Seb (the Father of the gods).

Ignatius Loyola, 1491 – 1556 #22 Founder and “Father” General of the Society of Jesus, 1540 – 1556 This most sinister White Gentile, Ignatius of the Basque House of Loyola, was born into the wealth and power of a noble Spanish dynasty and later became a page in the royal court of King Ferdinand II of Aragon (1479-1516) and Queen Isabella, they having formally expelled the Jewish Race from Spain in 1492. As Satan’s great servant in beginning the Counter-Reformation, Loyola, a member of the occult and Luciferian Spanish “Alumbrados,” purposed to restore the Dark Ages in making the “infallible” Pope of his creation, herein called “the Papal Caesar,” being continually overseen and sustained by his diabolical Order, to be the Universal Monarch of the World ruling all Nations from within King Solomon’s rebuilt Hebrew Temple on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem.

BLOCK I – (1540 - 1773)
The Jesuits,
In Seeking to Destroy the Protestant Reformation and Restore the Dark Ages with The Pope Exercising His Temporal Power as the Universal Monarch of the World,
Authored the Twenty-Five Sessions of the Council of Trent (1545-1563), and Established Themselves as the Confessors and Advisors of the Monarchs of Europe, Promoting Absolute Monarchial Despotisms through which they Ignited Great Wars such as:
• The Dutch Revolution 1568 - 1648, • The Thirty Years’ War 1618 - 1648, • The Puritan Revolution 1644 - 1653,
While Oppressing and Weakening the Peoples of the Nations and the Semitic Hebrew/Jewish Race with the “Holy Office of the Inquisition,” Aided by the Knights of Malta, and later, Scottish Rite Freemasonry, from 1540 to 1773.
“The Roman Catholics have not only the right, but it is their duty to kill heretics [evidenced] that the following law was among those promulgated [expounded] by St. Thomas [Aquinas in his Summa Theologica, II-II, Q. 11, A. 3, 4] as one of the present and unchangeable laws of the Church of Rome:
‘. . . they [heretics] deserve not only to be separated from the Church by excommunication, but also to be severed from the world by death. . . . much more reason is there for heretics, as soon as they are convicted of heresy, to be not only excommunicated but even put to death. . . . after the first and second admonition, . . . if he [the heretic] is yet stubborn . . . [the Church] . . . by excommunicating him and separating him from the Church, delivers him to the secular tribunal to be exterminated thereby from the world by death.’
Every heretic and Protestant is condemned to death, and every oath of allegiance to a government which is Protestant or heretic is abrogated by the [Fourth] Council of Lateran, held in 1215 [by the demon Pope Innocent III].” {1}

Their Purpose and Oath Secret Instructions of the Jesuits The Jesuit General and Absolutism
The Spaniard would be of noble birth, Who with his Order enflame the Earth.
The shout of its General to each man, “Restore the age of Hildebrand!”
The Pope’s two swords were through this one, Unsheathed by Satan against God’s Son.
What is his name that we may know, Who broke our hearts with wars of woe?
Ah, we’ll whisper in your ear, That dreaded name of yesteryear.
“Ignatius Loyola” you’ve heard before? Ne’er forget! Evermore!

The Jesuits – 1540



Chapter 1
“The nobility and populace must, by all methods, be persuaded into a belief that the Society was instituted by the particular direction of divine providence, according to the prophecies of the abbot Jachim, that by this means the church, though depressed by the attempts of heretics, may be raised again to its primitive luster.” {1}
Ignatius Loyola, 1540 Founder, 1st Jesuit General, 1540-1556 Secret Instructions of the Jesuits
“ . . . for liberal institutions and civil and religious freedom have no greater enemies than that cunning fraternity; while it is equally true, that although the Jesuits are dreaded and detested knaves, there are few who are thoroughly acquainted with their eventful history, and with all those arts by which the fathers have earned for themselves a disgraceful celebrity . . . Their country is Rome; their sovereign the Pope; their laws the commands of their General . . . the Jesuits, by their very calling, by the very essence of their institution, are bound to seek, by every means, right or wrong, the destruction of Protestantism. This is the condition of their existence, the duty they must fulfill, or cease to be Jesuits.” {2}
G. B. Nicolini of Rome, 1854 Protestant Italian Patriot Exiled to England History of the Jesuits
“I swear to erect the throne and the altar upon the bones of the infamous Liberals, and to exterminate them one by one, without being moved by the clamors of children, old men and women!” {3}

“The term ‘Jesuit’ has become synonymous with terms like deceit, chicanery, infiltration, intrigue, subversion...many organized Jesuits have been justly described as treacherous, traitorous workers, seducing many in the service of the Roman Pontiff away from national allegiance . . .
‘The profligate, the cunning, the daring, and all similar members of this motley sect, with their general and the host of his spies crawling like frogs, and flying like the locusts of Egypt all over the land, were fully initiated into the secrets of their ‘instructions’, and they acted on them every day, hence the horrid works of their footsteps of pollution and blood.’ ” {5}
Jonas E. C. Shepherd, 1987 General Secretary, Canadian Protestant League,
[Shepherd investigated and confirmed that Alberto Rivera was indeed an ex-Jesuit] The Babington Plot
“The General is the true Pope of the Company of Jesus, and the plan of this institute is to destroy all authority, and all government, having concentrated all in its society.
This ambitious Company is a nation, a power apart germinating in the loins of all others, changing their substance and surmounting their
ruins.” {6}
Riquet, 1762 Member, French Parliament
“In Roman Catholic circles it is well known that the Black Pope is the term used for the General of the Jesuits. As the Pope is always robed in white, and the General in black, the contrast is obvious. But those Romanists who do not greatly love the Jesuits, and their number is not limited, use the term as indicating that the Black Pope rules the White Pope . . . even while the former is obligated to make, at least, a show of submission to the latter.” {7}
M. F. Cusack, 1896 Converted Nun of Kenmare The Black Pope
The Jesuits – 1540



Chapter 1 87
“ ‘The power of the General shall be so unlimited that should he deem it necessary for the honour of God, he shall even be able to send back, or in other directions, those who have come direct from the Popes.’ ” {8}
Ignatius Loyola, 1540 Founder, 1st Jesuit General, 1540-1556 Constitutions
“But not only is all friendly communication forbidden to the Jesuit but he is also placed under constant espionage. He is never permitted to walk about alone, but, whether in the house or out of doors, is always accompanied by two of his brethren — ‘Except the General order otherwise for the greater glory of God [the Pope], and the benefit of the Society.’ . . .
Thus, no one but the General can exercise the right of uttering a single original thought or opinion. It is almost impossible to conceive the power, especially in former times, of a General having at his absolute disposal such an amount of intelligences, wills, and energies.” {9}
Further,
“ . . . the merit of framing the Constitution which was to govern it belongs solely to Ignatius himself. He alone among them all was capable of such a conception. He alone could have devised a scheme by which one free rational being is converted into a mere automaton acting, speaking, even thinking, according to the expressed will of another. There is no record in history, of any man, be he king, emperor, or pope, exercising such absolute and irresponsible power over his fellow-men as does the General of the Jesuits over his disciples . . .
Thus, the General knowing the past and present life, the thoughts, the desires of every one belonging to the Society, it is easy to understand how he is enabled always to select the fittest person for every special
service.” {10}

“The General is at the head of this black and mute militia, which thinks, wills, acts, obeys — the passive instrument of his designs. Their whole life must have but one aim — the advancement of the Order to which they are
attached.” {11}
Jeremiah J. Crowley, 1912 Ex-Irish Priest
Romanism: Menace to the Nation
“See, sir, from this chamber I govern not only to Paris, but to China, not
only to China, but to all the world, without any one to know how I do
it.”{12}
Michaelangelo Tamburini 14th Jesuit General, 1706-1730
“Later, I will develop what is sure to become a controversial hypothesis: that the Black Pope rules by divine appointment, and for the ultimate good of mankind. . . . I am pleased to honor as the American republic’s least known founding father [Jesuit General] Lorenzo Ricci [who was] . . . at war with [in 1773 extending to 1815] . . . everyone [including the Papacy, its Hierarchy and Dominican Inquisition; the Roman Catholic monarchs of Europe and the Protestant British Empire].” {13} [Emphasis added]
Frederick Tupper Saussy, 2001 Jesuit Temporal Coadjutor American “Patriot” and “Historian” whose cousin is a Jesuit Rulers of Evil
The purpose of the Society of Jesus, founded by Ignatius Loyola in 1534 and formally established by Pope Paul III on September 27, 1540 with a Papal Bull titled Regimini militantis Ecclesiae (R[O]ME), is to destroy every vestige of the Lord’s Grand and Glorious Protestant Reformation begun by Martin Luther in 1517. The Jesuits call this “the Counter-Reformation.”
In seeking to destroy the Protestant Reformation, the Professed Jesuits, after a fifteen-year education and thirty-one years in the Order, have obligated themselves with an Oath known as the Fourth Vow. Many Jesuits, however, are not Professed and therefore have never been fully initiated into the evils of “the Company.” The honest Juan de Palafox, Bishop of Los Angeles, Mexico, in a letter to Pope Innocent X written in 1647, writes:
The Jesuits – 1540



Chapter 1
“ ‘But the Jesuits alone, shroud themselves intentionally in a darkness, which the laity are completely forbidden to penetrate, and the veil is not even uplifted to many of the members. There are among them a large number who have taken merely three vows, but not the fourth, and who are in consequence, not at all, or at any rate, not properly instructed regarding the true principles, institutions and liberties of the order; this secret, on the other hand, is entrusted, as is known to His Holiness, to only a small number, and whatever is especially important is known only to the Superiors and the General.’ ” {14} [Emphasis added]
But of the Fourth Vow, taken by no more than two-percent of the Jesuits, we read the words from M. F. Cusack’s masterpiece, The Black Pope, written in 1896:
“The Jesuit is not permitted to take his full and final vows [Extreme Oath of the Fourth Vow] until he has attained the age of forty-five. As a consequence there are few fully professed members of the Order . . . Thirty-one years shall have been passed in the Order before the final vows are taken, so that a Jesuit who had not entered the novitiate at a very early age, might be far older than the years specified before he could take the final vows. In the meantime he is simply the bond slave of the General, who may dismiss him at will, or retain him at pleasure. He must become a corpse in the hands of his superior . . . ” {15}
A portion of the Oath published in 1845 reads:

I do renounce and disown any allegiance as due to any heretical king, prince, or state, named Protestant, or obedience to any of their inferior magistrates or officers. I do further declare the doctrine of the Church of England, of the Calvinists, Huguenots, and other Protestants, to be damnable, and those to be damned who will not forsake the same.

The complete Oath published in 1883 reads:
CEREMONY OF INDUCTION AND EXTREME OATH OF THE JESUITS
[When a Jesuit of the minor rank is to be elevated to command, he is conducted into the Chapel of the Convent of the Order, where there are only three others present, the principal or Superior standing in front of the altar. On either side stands a monk, one of whom holds a banner of yellow and white, which are the Papal colors, and the other a black banner with a dagger and red cross above a skull and crossbones, with the word INRI, and below them the words IUSTUM NECARE REGES IMPIOS. The meaning of which is: It is just to exterminate or annihilate impious or heretical Kings, Governments or Rulers. Upon the floor is a red cross upon which the postulant or candidate kneels. The Superior hands him a small black crucifix, which he takes in his left hand and presses to his heart, and the Superior at the same time presents to him a dagger, which he grasps by the blade and holds the point against his heart, the Superior still holding it by the hilt, and thus addresses the postulant.]
SUPERIOR.
My son, heretofore you have been taught to act the dissembler: among Roman Catholics to be a Roman Catholic, and to be a spy even among your own brethren; to believe no man, to trust no man. Among the Reformers, to be a Reformer; among the Huguenots, to be a Huguenot; among the Calvinists, to be a Calvinist; among the

Protestants, generally to be a Protestant; and obtaining their confidence to seek even to preach from their pulpits, and to denounce with all the vehemence in your nature our Holy Religion and the Pope; and even to descend so low as to become a Jew among the Jews, that you might be enabled to gather together all information for the benefit of your Order as a faithful soldier of the Pope.
You have been taught to insidiously plant the seeds of jealousy and hatred between communities, provinces and states that were at peace, and incite them to deeds of blood, involving them in war with each other, and to create revolutions and civil wars in countries that were independent and prosperous, cultivating the arts and the sciences and enjoying the blessings of peace. To take sides with the combatants and to act secretly in concert with your brother Jesuit, who might be engaged on the other side, but openly opposed to that with which you might be connected; only that the Church might be the gainer in the end, in the conditions fixed in the treaties for peace and that the end justifies the means.
You have been taught your duty as a spy, to gather all statistics, facts and information in your power from every source; to ingratiate yourself into the confidence of the family circle of Protestants and heretics of every class and character, as well as that of the merchant, the banker, the lawyer, among the schools and universities, in parliaments and legislatures, and in the judiciaries and councils of state, and to “be all things to all men,” for the Pope's sake, whose servants we are unto death.
You have received all your instructions heretofore as a novice, a neophyte, and have served as a coadjutor, confessor and priest, but you have not yet been invested with all that is necessary to command in the Army of Loyola in the service of the Pope. You must serve the proper time as the instrument and executioner as directed by your superiors [such as the murder of Cornelius Jansen (1585-1638), Bishop of Ypres, Holland, and father of Jansenism who was a most determined Roman Catholic enemy of the Jesuits and died of a sudden illness – the poison cup – on the 6th of May, 1638 at the young age of fifty-three] for none can command here who has not consecrated his labors with the blood of the heretic; for “without the shedding of blood no man can be saved.” Therefore, to fit yourself for your work and make your own salvation sure, you will, in addition to your former oath of obedience to your Order and allegiance to the Pope, repeat after me:

THE EXTREME OATH OF THE JESUITS.
I, M____ N ___ , Now, in the presence of Almighty God, the Blessed Virgin Mary, the blessed Michael the Archangel, the blessed St. John the Baptist, the holy Apostles St. Peter and St. Paul and all the saints and sacred hosts of heaven, and to you, my ghostly father, the Superior General of the Society of Jesus, founded by St. Ignatius Loyola, in the Pontificate of Paul the Third [Paul III], and continued to the present, do by the womb of the Virgin, the matrix of God, and the rod of Jesus Christ, declare and swear, that his holiness the Pope is Christ's Vice-regent and is the true and only Head of the Catholic or Universal Church throughout the earth; and that by virtue of the keys of binding and loosing, given to his Holiness by my Saviour, Jesus Christ, he hath power to depose heretical kings, princes, states, commonwealths and governments, all being illegal without his sacred confirmation and that they may safely be destroyed. Therefore, to the utmost of my power, I shall and will defend this doctrine and His Holiness’ right and custom against all usurpers of the heretical or Protestant authority whatever, especially the Lutheran Church of Germany, Holland, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, and the now pretended authority and churches of England and Scotland, and branches of the same now established in Ireland and on the Continent of America and elsewhere; and all adherents in regard that they be usurped and heretical, opposing the sacred Mother Church of Rome. I do now renounce and disown any allegiance as due to any heretical king, prince or state named Protestants or Liberals or obedience to any of their laws, magistrates or officers.
I do further declare that the doctrines of the churches of England and Scotland, of the Calvinists, Huguenots and others of the name Protestants or Liberals to be damnable, and they themselves damned and to be damned who will not forsake the same.
I do further declare, that I will help, assist and advise all or any of his Holiness’ agents in any place wherever I shall be, in Switzerland, Germany, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, England, Ireland, or America, or in any other kingdom or territory I shall come to, and do my uttermost to extirpate the heretical Protestants or Liberals’ doctrines and to destroy all their pretended powers, regal or otherwise.
I do further promise and declare, that notwithstanding I am dispensed with, to assume any religion heretical, for the propagating of the Mother Church’s interest, to keep secret and private all her agents’

counsels from time to time, as they may entrust me, and not to divulge, directly or indirectly, by word, writing or circumstance whatever; but to execute all that shall be proposed, given in charge or discovered unto me, by you, my ghostly father, or any of this sacred convent.
I do further promise and declare, that I will have no opinion or will of my own, or any mental reservation whatever, even as a corpse or cadaver, (perinde ac cadaver), but will unhesitatingly obey each and every command that I may receive from my superiors in the Militia of the Pope and of Jesus Christ.
That I will go to any part of the world whithersoever I may be sent, to the frozen regions of the North, the burning sands of the desert of Africa, or the jungles of India, to the centres of civilization of Europe, or to the wild haunts of the barbarous savages of America, without murmuring or repining, and will be submissive in all things whatsoever communicated to me.
I furthermore promise and declare that I will, when opportunity presents, make and wage relentless war, secretly or openly, against all heretics, Protestants and Liberals, as I am directed to do, to extirpate and exterminate them from the face of the whole earth; and that I will spare neither age, sex or condition; and that I will hang, burn, waste, boil, flay, strangle and bury alive these infamous heretics, rip up the stomachs and wombs of their women and crush their infants’ heads against the walls, in order to annihilate forever their execrable race. That when the same cannot be done openly, I will secretly use the poisoned cup, the strangulating cord, the steel of the poniard or the leaden bullet, regardless of the honor, rank, dignity, or authority of the person or persons, whatever may be their condition in life, either public or private, as I at any time may be directed so to do by any agent of the Pope or Superior of the Brotherhood of the Holy Faith, of the Society of Jesus.
In confirmation of which, I hereby dedicate my life, my soul and all my corporeal powers, and with this dagger which I now receive, I will subscribe my name written in my own blood, in testimony thereof; and should I prove false or weaken in my determination, may my brethren and fellow soldiers of the Militia of the Pope cut off my hands and my feet, and my throat from ear to ear, my belly opened and sulphur burned therein, with all the punishment that can be inflicted upon me on earth and my soul be tortured by demons in an eternal hell forever!

All of which I, M ___ N ___ , do swear by the blessed Trinity and blessed Sacrament, which I am now to receive, to perform and on my part to keep inviolably; and do call all the heavenly and glorious host of heaven to witness these my real intentions to keep this my oath.
In testimony hereof I take this most holy and blessed Sacrament of the Eucharist, and witness the same further, with my name written with the point of this dagger dipped in my own blood and sealed in the face of this holy convent.
[He receives the wafer from the Superior and writes his name with the point of his dagger dipped in his own blood taken from over the heart.]
SUPERIOR.
You will now rise to your feet and I will instruct you in the Catechism necessary to make yourself known to any member of the Society of Jesus belonging to this rank.
In the first place, you, as a Brother Jesuit, will with another mutually make the ordinary sign of the cross as any ordinary Roman Catholic would; then one crosses his wrists, the palms of his hands open, the other in answer crosses his feet, one above the other; the first points with the forefinger of the right hand to the center of the palm of the left, the other with the forefinger of the left hand points to the center of the palm of the right; the first then with his right hand makes a circle around his head, touching it; the other then with the forefinger of his left hand touches the left side of his body just below his heart; the first then with his right hand draws it across the throat of the other, and the latter then with his right hand makes the motion of cutting with a dagger down the stomach and abdomen of the first. The first then says Iustum; and the other answers Necare; the first then says Reges. The other answers Impios. (The meaning of which has already been explained.) The first will then present a small piece of paper folded in a peculiar manner, four times, which the other will cut longitudinally and on opening the name JESU will be found written upon the head and arms of a cross three times. You will then give and receive with him the following questions and answers.

A portion of the Oath published in 1894 reads:
“I do now renounce and disown my allegiance as due to any heretical King, Prince or State, named Protestant, or liberals, or obedience to any of their laws or magistrates or officers.

Should I prove false or weaken in my determination, may my brethren and fellow militia of the Pope cut off my hands and feet, cut my throat from ear to ear, may my belly be opened and sulphur burning therein with all the punishment that can be inflicted upon me on earth and my soul shall be tormented by demons in eternal hell forever [Does not this sound like a Masonic Oath?]. That I will in voting always vote for a Knight of Columbus in preference to a Protestant, especially a Mason . . . ” [The former Governor of the State of California was Gray Davis, a Fourth Degree Knight of Columbus, who is continued to further disarm the citizens of that State in preparation for the coming massive Chinese invasion of the West Coast after the Company’s new “Sword of the Church” first conquers Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, the entire Pacific Rim and then Hawaii. This Chinese naval campaign will apparently be fueled by Unocal’s oil from the Caspian Basin because of which the Jesuit Order’s war in Afghanistan is presently being fought.]” {19}
(Dear truth-seeker, the Jesuits not only authored the above Oath of the Knights of Columbus but also, as we shall later see, they wrote the Oaths of Scottish Rite Freemasonry over one hundred years prior to the creation of their new Order of the Knights of Columbus. In 1879 Edmond Ronayne, another Bible-believing hero, converted Romanist and Past Master of the Keystone Lodge in Chicago, gives some of the guidelines from his Masonic Handbook – Hand Book of Freemasonry evidencing nearly identical Oaths with Freemasonry’s supposed enemies and junior Jesuits, “the Knights of Columbus”:
“When a brother reveals any of our great secrets; whenever, for instance, he tells anything about Boaz, or Tubalcain, or Jachin, or that awful Mah-hah-bone (‘the name of the great Masonic god’), or even, whenever a minister prays in the name of Christ in any of our assemblies, you must always hold yourself in readiness, if called upon, to cut his throat from ear to ear, pull out his tongue by the roots, and bury his body at the bottom of some lake or pond. Of course, all this must be done in secret, as it was in the case of that notorious man [Captain William] Morgan [who was murdered by the Brotherhood for publishing Illustrations of Masonry,

A portion of the Oath published in 1981 by one of our heroes Alberto Rivera, a former Professed Jesuit under this Extreme Oath reads:
CEREMONY OF INDUCTION AND EXTREME OATH OF THE JESUITS
(Given to a Jesuit of minor rank when he is to be elevated to a position of command.)
Superior Speaks:
“My son, heretofore you have been taught to act the dissembler among the Roman Catholics to be a Roman Catholic, and to be a spy even among your own brethren: to believe no man, to trust no man.

You have received all your instructions heretofore as a novice (one who has no training), a neophyte (a newly ordained priest), and have served as a coadjutor (worked as a helper), confessor and priest, but you have not yet been invested with all that is necessary to command in the army of Loyola and in the service of the Pope.
You must serve the proper time as the instrument and executioner as directed by your superiors; for none can command here who has not consecrated (made secret or holy) his labors with the blood of the heretic; for ‘without the shedding of blood no man can be saved.’
Therefore, to fit yourself for your work and make your own salvation sure, you will in addition to your former Oath of obedience to your order and allegiance to the Pope, repeat after me:

or persons, whatever may be their condition in life, either public or private, as I at any time may be directed so to do by any agent of the Pope or superior of the brotherhood of the holy faith, of the Society of
Jesus.’ ” {21}
Notice the Jesuits have taken this Oath to destroy “Protestant or Liberal doctrines” as they wage “relentless war” against “Protestants and Liberals.”
The term “Protestant,” as the Jesuits understand it, includes all believers in the Lord Jesus Christ who reject both the Spiritual Power and the Temporal Power of the Pope of Rome, while believing and teaching the Biblical doctrines proclaimed during the Protestant Reformation, championed by Martin Luther, John Calvin and John Knox (“Calvin with the Sword of Just Defense”) in particular. Protestants are “heretics” and must be “exterminated from the face of the whole earth.”
The term “Liberal,” as the Jesuits understand it, includes all Catholics who concur with the Protestants in rejecting the Temporal Power of the Pope of Rome. Liberals both believe and teach that governments are best when they serve the people, and when their powers are expressly limited by written Constitutions. Liberals, like both the Protestant and Baptist Calvinists, further believe that if governments become absolute tyrannies, they have the right and duty to formally withdraw their allegiance and resist those tyrannies with armed force, called by John Knox “the Sword of Just Defense.” It is for this reason the Black Pope’s fascist-communist military dictatorships forbid gun ownership by the peoples they rule. It is for this reason “The Jesuit Conference” within the United States seeks to abolish gun ownership through their agents within their Council on Foreign Relations, thereby destroying the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution — that “heretic” document created by condemned “Protestants and Liberals.”
In addition to the Oath, the Jesuits have a guidebook entitled Secreta Monita. It has only been disclosed to the world a few times, beginning in the early 1600s (openly published in Cracow, Poland in 1612) and extending through the late 1800s:
“ . . . but it has been made to disappear as has the most of all other
books against the Jesuits.” {22}
Because of the magnitude of its contents as it relates to our subject, Secreta Monita or Secret Instructions of the Jesuits {23} has been incorporated in its entirety, in the form of an attached CD within this volume’s cover, as it was republished in 1857. The Secret Instructions are no forgery, as we again recall a portion of the famous letter from Juan de Palafox, Bishop of Los Angeles, Mexico (for which letter and continued resistance he was relentlessly persecuted by the Order until he was forced to flee to Europe for his life), to Pope Innocent X dated January 8, 1647:
The Jesuits – 1540



Chapter 1
“ . . . what other Religion has a secret constitution, hidden privileges, and concealed laws of its own? And what other order has all those things which relate to its government involved in so much mystery? There is suspicion in mystery. The rules of all other orders are open to all; . . . BUT THE SUPERIORS OF THE JESUITS DO NOT GOVERN THEM BY THE RULES OF THE CHURCH, WHICH ARE KNOWN TO ALL, BUT BY CERTAIN SECRET RULES WHICH ARE ONLY KNOWN TO THOSE SUPERIORS.” {24}
Edwin A. Sherman encourages us:
“Read them all, omitting nothing, and say afterward if these precepts are a dead letter. Having ceased to care for the widow, to capture the inheritances, to rob the children from their families, of intriguing near the great, of influencing in the politics of the nations, of working to the last with but one object, that is... the engrandisement of the ‘Company of Jesus’ and the establishment of its dominion in the earth.” {25} [Emphasis added]
G. B. Nicolini adds:
“Now, examine well these instructions, and you will find that the true Jesuit must be crafty, insinuating, deceitful, and you will at once perceive the extent of the Jesuit immorality, and the artful way in which, in the name of the most sacred of all things — religion, they accomplish the most heinous offences.” {26}
Dear truth-seeker, after reviewing your CD containing the Secret Instructions of the Jesuits, notice the last page where the Jesuit is permitted to commit high treason – the greatest of crimes worthy only of public execution – against a non-Roman Catholic government he has sworn to destroy.
The Jesuits, in resisting the Biblical teachings of the Reformers, guided the Council of Trent from 1545 to 1563. The twenty-five sessions of that Council condemned all the “doctrines of grace” held by the Reformers, accursing all peoples who maintained those beliefs. The Fourth Session condemned freedom of conscience, freedom of speech and freedom of the press. We read and marvel:
“The Fourth Session...was one of the most important sessions of the council. In this session, a decree was passed which placed tradition upon an equality with the Scriptures – declared the books of the Apocrypha to be a part of the word of God – elevated the Latin translation of the
The Jesuits – 1540



102 Vatican Assassins
Scriptures called the Vulgate, to an authority superior to that of the inspired Hebrew and Greek originals, and exacted severe penal laws against the liberty of the press . . . The right of private judgment in reading the Scriptures was prohibited, its exercise punished and the liberty of the press was authoritatively forbidden.” {27}
The Fourth Rule of the Congregation of the Index of Prohibited Books enacted by the Fourth Session of the Council of Trent and approved by Pope Pius IV in a Bull, issued on the 24th of March, 1564 regarding the Bible reads:
“Inasmuch as it is manifest from experience, that if the Holy Bible, translated into the vulgar tongue, be indiscriminately allowed to every one, the temerity of men will cause more evil than good to arise from it . . . But if any one shall have the presumption to read or possess it without such written permission, he shall not receive absolution until he has first delivered up such Bible to the ordinary . . . But regulars shall neither read nor purchase such Bibles without a special license from their superiors.” {28} [Emphasis added]
The Council concluded with the cry,
“Accursed be all heretics! Accursed!! Accursed!!” {29}
This wicked and evil Council of Trent – the backbone of the Counter-Reformation – would embody the religious and political maxims the Jesuit Order and its “infallible” Pope would follow for the rest of the millennium. Trent would become the foreign policy of nations under Jesuit control, further extending the Temporal Power of the Pope. The nation whose foreign policy has been the Council of Trent for the last one hundred years is Fourteenth Amendment America, as she financed the Second Thirty Years’ War including the Bolshevik Revolution, which introduced the bloodbath of Communism into the Twentieth Century. Under the absolutism of Communism the Bible is a forbidden book — pursuant to the Council of Trent! President William Jefferson Clinton, that Jesuit-trained tool of the Pope, continued the policies of Trent with the mass bombing of Rome’s old enemy, Orthodox Serbia during the late 1990s.
The Jesuit General is an “absolutist.” Today we would call him a “fascist military dictator.” His absolute, unlimited power is supreme — even over the Pope! We read:
“The general has usually stood towards the Pope much as a powerful grand feudatory of the Middle Ages did towards a weak titular lord

paramount . . . and the shrewd Roman populace have long shown their recognition of this fact by styling these two great personages severally the ‘White Pope’ and the ‘Black Pope’. In truth the society has never, from the first, obeyed the Pope, whenever its will and his has happened to run counter to each other.” {30} [Emphasis added]
The General of the Jesuits, intending to set up a Universal Paparchy controlling the people and princes through “education [indoctrination] and diplomacy,” is without question the most powerful man in the world. He is the Sovereign over the Society of Jesus and his Provincials are the masters of the Pope’s Cardinals, who are in turn the visible or invisible political masters over every government of every nation. The Cardinals always promote or enforce some form of absolutism over the peoples be it Monarchialism, Socialism, Nazism, Communism, Fascism or Zionism. Of the General’s power over the Society of Jesus, also called “the Company,” we read from the pen of an ex-Jesuit, Andrew Steinmetz, in 1848:
“The General possesses the secrets of every member — a terrible fulcrum for the lever of influence. He knows the character, the inclinations of every member; he knows these facts, or may know them, for he has them in writing. He is made acquainted with the consciences of all who must obey him, particularly of the provincials and others, to whom he has entrusted functions of great importance. He must have, like each Superior, a complete knowledge of his subjects; their propensities, their sentiments, the defects, the sins to which they have been or are more inclined or impelled . . .
Every year, a list of the houses and members of the Society, the names, talents, virtues, failings of all are there recorded. It was such a list, doubtless, that suggested to a General of the Society that proud exclamation, when, having exultingly alluded to his philosophers, mathematicians, orators, etc., he cried . . . ‘and we have men for martyrdom, if they be required.’
In effect, from this minute list of mental and bodily qualities, he can compute his power and direct his plans, adapt his commands and insure success to his delegated functions . . .
The simple Jesuit is to possess for himself neither power, nor office, nor credit, nor riches, nor will, nor sentiments: the concentrated authority belongs to the general. His commands, his desires, are the law: his power flows from his hands as from its source, on the heads whom he chooses: it extends as far as he pleases; it stops when he wills . . .
The Jesuits – 1540

His qualifications, according to the Constitutions, must be great piety, and the spirit of prayer: he must be exemplary in all the virtues; calm in his demeanor, circumspect in words. Magnanimity and fortitude are most essential attributes. He must have extraordinary intellect and judgment; prudence, rather than learning; vigilance, solicitude in his duties: his health and external appearance must be satisfactory. He must be middle-aged; and a due regard is to be had to recommendations of nobility, or the wealth and honors he may have enjoyed in the world.” {31}
It is this polished gem of a gentleman, the masterpiece of Satan who, with the advice of his assistants, wields THE POWER in the earth. Of the General overseeing the Novices we observe:
“The Jesuit novice . . . may some day have kings and princes kneeling at his feet, and have the power to direct the destinies of nations. He may regulate the policy and frame the laws even for nations which are not of his own faith, through the members of his Church who now take places in the councils of Protestant nations. If the process of the “making of a Jesuit” is hard to flesh and blood, he is reminded that he aspires to belong to the only body of men in the world who can boast of almost universal domination, who wield a sword with the hilt in the hand of their general in Rome and the point everywhere . . . Obedience is the one end of all this training — unmasking, unthinking, unreasoning obedience.” {32} [Emphasis added]
Of the General’s authority over the Jesuits we read:
“It is true that the Jesuit has his General to whom he gives the obedience of a slave, but the Jesuit believes his General to be as God, so that if the dead voice of God, so to say, in Scripture, seems to conflict with the living voice of God which comes through the General, the authority of the living voice must prevail.” {33}
For the Jesuits are
“ . . . a phalanx . . . bound to their General-in-chief by the chain of entire submission – obedience prompt, enthusiastic, blind – and scattered, without division, on the face of the earth...In this mighty family all subscribed to the same articles of faith, whatever might be the tendency of their particular inculcations. That was their uniformity: – whilst theory is respected, practice will be allowed for: if you leave the former untouched, the latter, to a vast extent, may riot unmolested. The Roman

and the Greek, the Portuguese, the Brazilian; the Irishman, the Russian; the Spaniard and the Frenchman; the Belgian and Englishman — all worked as one man, the individual tastes and inclinations were merged in the general object of appetence: they were a multitude in action, but in will a single, naked soul.” {34} [Emphasis added]
Dear truth-seeker, the great French playwright, Alexandre Dumas – the mulatto son of one of Napoleon’s greatest generals and the friend of anti-Jesuit Eugene Sue, King Louis Philippe (1830-1848) and Italy’s great anti-Jesuit and low-level Freemason, Giuseppe Garibaldi – accurately portrayed the Jesuit General in The Count of Monte Cristo. Of the Count, rich, well-born, cultured and taking vengeance on his enemies via an extensive intelligence network, he writes in 1845:
“ ‘This devil of a fellow . . . I said at the time he would create a sensation here, and I measure his effect by an infallible thermometer. My mother has noticed him, and he must therefore, perforce, be
remarkable.’ ” {35}
Indeed he is! In command of this family of traitors swearing allegiance to only the Pope of Rome, the General is an absolute Monarch over the Order. And when the Order has conquered a nation, the government installed is always in fact absolutist. That is, the powers of the chief executive have no absolute limitations. In a letter to the king of Naples from a Jesuit Provincial written in 1854 we read:
“SACRED ROYAL MAJESTY
[We] . . . have always inculcated respect . . . for . . . absolute monarchy. This we have done, not only from conviction, but also because the doctors of the company, who are Francisco Suarez, the Cardinal Bellarmine, and many other theologians and publicists of the same, have publicly taught absolute monarchy to be the best form of government. This we have done, because the internal economy of the company is monarchial, and therefore we are by maxim and by education devoted to absolute monarchy . . . Majesty . . . absolute monarchy is the best of governments . . .
In so much, we who sign this are a full guarantee for their devotion by all proof to the absolute monarchy. [Emphasis added]

Dear truth-seeker, do you value freedom of conscience, freedom to say what you believe and the freedom to print the Bible in your own language? These are liberties championed by the Protestant Reformation, secured by the Bill of Rights to the United States Constitution, condemned by the Jesuits’ Council of Trent and destroyed by absolutist forms of government maintained by the power of the Jesuit General.
Miss Cusack, the brilliant and renowned converted Catholic nun of the late Nineteenth Century having warned the English of the Jesuits’ plot (already successful by 1800) to take over the British Empire, properly concludes:
“ . . . thus was established an Institution, which as we shall see from undisputable evidence, has done more than any other so-called religious order to ruin the peace of families, to check the growth of human progress, and to enslave the souls of men, and yet all this was done in the name of religion.” {37}
Having examined the purpose, oaths and devilish doctrines of the Society of Jesus, we pause to reflect on the dying words of Ignatius Loyola, the Order’s founder and thus the father of the Counter-Reformation:
“ ‘I have done much good to the Church of Rome — I have seen many provinces of our men, many colleges, houses, residences, and wealth belonging to our Society; but all these things desert me now, and I know not whither to turn!’ At length he expired in a fit of trembling, and his face turned black, according to an eye-witness, the Jesuit Turrianus.” {38}
In contrast, the dying words of Martin Luther, the father of the Reformation bringing freedom of conscience, freedom of speech and freedom of the press with the German Bible and his noble defender, Frederick III, Elector of Saxony, were:
“O my Father, God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of all consolation, I thank Thee for having revealed to me Thy well beloved Son, in whom I believe, whom I have preached and acknowledged, loved and celebrated, and whom the Pope and the impious persecute. I commend to Thee my soul. Jesus Christ my Lord, I am quitting this earthly body, I am leaving this life, but I know that I shall abide eternally with Thee.” {39}
Dear truth-seeker, whose dying words will you repeat in your final moments of ebbing strength as you begin your journey to Heaven or to Hell?

The Jesuit General’s Council of Trent, 1545 - 1563 #23 Being the backbone of the Counter-Reformation, the Council of Trent was dominated by Diego Laynez, a Jew by race and destined to be the Second Jesuit General (1558-1565), during which the Biblical Doctrines of the Reformers having spread across Europe were absolutely condemned, including Freedom of Conscience, Freedom of Speech and Freedom of the Press. The Protestant and Calvinist Bible believers of the Lord’s Grand and Glorious Reformation were declared to be “accursed” for their beliefs one hundred and twenty-five times and therefore have been persecuted and mass-murdered by the millions! In the centuries to come this evil Council of Trent would ultimately be the foreign policy of every nation and empire to fall under the domination of the Company of Jesus, better known as the Society of Jesus. Some of those empires would be the Spanish Empire under Philip II; the British Empire under King George III to the present; the Vatican Empire under Pope Pius VII to the present; the French Empire under Napoleon III; the American Empire under President Theodore “Rex” Roosevelt to the present; the Russian Empire under Lenin to the present; the Nazi Third Reich under Adolf Hitler; and the Moslem International Terrorist Empire under the Order’s Osama bin Laden.

In France the Protestants, called “Huguenots,” were gaining wealth and political power. Admiral Gaspard de Coligny was their leader. The Jesuits, with that she-wolf, Catherine de Medici, Queen Regent of France, plotted their destruction. On August 24, 1572 the murderous frenzy began. Admiral Coligny bravely resisted his assassins but to no avail. He was murdered and his head was sent as a trophy to the Cardinal of Lorraine who had been educated, or rather brainwashed, by the Jesuits in Flanders. Seventy-five thousand Protestants were butchered in cold blood. Rome celebrated, struck a coin commemorating the “great victory” and sang her “Te Deums.” Of this horrible genocide we read from Roman Catholic R. W. Thompson:
“There is no intelligent reader of French history who is not familiar with the steps taken by this perfidious queen regent [Catherine de Medici] after the admission of the Jesuits into Paris, to bring about the terrible Massacre of St. Bartholomew — an event so closely allied with others, of which they were the undoubted authors, that one must close his eyes not to see the evidences which point to their agency in that infamous transaction. They needed such bloody work to give them the mastery over France; although they have since then been more than once expelled in disgrace from French soil, they have returned again and again to torment her people, who still continue to realize, under their [Third] Republic, how unceasingly they labor for the entire overthrow of every form of popular government.” {5}
Dear truth-seeker, do you see how a Cardinal working in conjunction with the Jesuits can be involved in the murder of a political leader?
As we shall see, in 1963, a Cardinal working in conjunction with the Jesuits was involved in the murder of an American political leader. The Cardinal was Francis Spellman, who had a special parlor (Room number three) at the Jesuit Novitiate of St. Isaac Jogues in Wernersville, Pennsylvania. The political leader was our President John Fitzgerald Kennedy (JFK), wounded in the house of his friends.

Saint Bartholomew’s Massacre, August 24, 1572 #24 Francis Borgia, the 3rd Jesuit General (1565-1572), having been in secret council with the Monarchs of France, laid the plan for this mass-murder of the righteous French Protestant Calvinists including their great leader, Admiral Gaspard de Coligny. Pope Pius V, formerly “Brother Michael” the Inquisitor, exhorted both Queen Regent Catherine de Medici and her son, King Charles IX, “ . . . to punish the heretics with all severity, and thus justly to avenge not only their own wrongs, but those of Almighty God; to pursue and destroy the remnants of the enemy, and wholly to tear up not only the roots of an evil so great, and which had gathered to itself much strength, but also the very fibers of the roots . . . Under no circumstances, and from no considerations, ought the enemies of God to be spared.” This was done in obedience to the Order’s evil Council of Trent, which to this day stands affirmed by the Second Vatican Council, having been neither repudiated nor renounced by either the Black Pope or the Papal Caesar.

Under the eye of the Black Pope, a trap was set luring all of the Protestants to a royal wedding in Paris. After the party, early in the morning, with white crosses on their hats, the assassins first murdered the great Admiral Coligny in his bedroom.

The Netherlands also called “The Low Countries” began to embrace the Biblical doctrines of grace taught by the Reformers, especially John Calvin. Thousands of Dutchmen were receiving Christ as the gospel was being preached in open fields. The result was that Rome began to lose her political power. To stop this movement of the risen Son of God, the Devil and his Jesuits moved Philip II to re-enact the Edict of 1550, which read in part:
“No one shall print, write, copy, keep, conceal, sell, buy or give in churches, streets, or other places, any book or writing made by Martin Luther, John Calvin, or other heretics reprobated by the Holy Church . . . nor in his house hold illegal gatherings . . . Moreover, we forbid all lay persons to converse or dispute concerning the Holy Scriptures, openly or secretly, or to read, teach or expound the Scriptures . . . or to preach secretly or openly . . . on pain . . . to be punished in the following manner. That such . . . are to be executed, to wit: the men with the sword and the women to be buried alive, if they do not persist in their errors; if they do persist in them, then they are to be executed with fire; all their property in both cases being confiscated to the crown.” {5}
To enforce this “mischief framed by a law” Philip dispatched ten thousand Spanish troops led by the Duke of Alva. The Duke established an evil tribunal called “the Blood Council.” Thousands perished to the delight of Cardinal Granvelle and Titelmann the Inquisitor. Of this horrible time we read:
“In the second half of the sixteenth century the Spanish armies occupied Holland and Flanders and the glare of the Inquisition’s autos-da-fé lit up the market squares of the cities great and small. After a long vigil in prayer, the silent man with the cruel eyes in the Escorial [Philip II of Madrid, Spain] had decreed the extermination of the new religion in the Netherlands. In less than a decade there perished by his will in the torture chambers, on the gallows and on the pyres two hundred and fifty thousand men and women of the Dutch race. Nobles and burghers, old and young, rich and poor, all were dragged from their homes, frequently on secret denunciation, to face the Grand Inquisitor – the monk Titelmann – and his helpers, who knew no mercy.” {6}
But the Dutch Protestants would not be conquered. They had a great leader. His name was William I of Orange, surnamed “the Silent.” He had been raised in the court of Charles V, the “Holy Roman Emperor,” and was fit to lead a people to political liberty. He waged war from the sea commanding the bravest soldiers of the age. John Lothrop Motley, one of the Reformation’s greatest historians having authored The Dutch Republic and The United Netherlands, writes:

“Scarred, hacked, and even maimed, in the unceasing conflicts in which their lives had passed; wearing crescents in their caps, with the inscription, ‘Rather Turkish than Popish’, renowned far and wide, as much for their ferocity as for their nautical skill; the appearance of these wildest of the ‘Sea-beggars’ was both eccentric and terrific. They were known never to give nor to take quarter, for they went to mortal combat only, and had sworn to spare neither noble nor simple, neither king, kaiser, nor pope, should they fall into their power.” {7} [Emphasis added]
The Sea Beggars always engaged their Spanish enemy and if they perceived the battle to be lost they would gather together, eat the Lord’s Supper and fire the magazine, blowing themselves and the enemy into eternity.
This William I of Orange became the Father of religious liberty and greatly beloved of his people. He did not force the Anabaptists to go to war, as they were non-resistant. He further gave the European Jews religious liberty, so much so that they migrated to Amsterdam, calling it “the New Jerusalem.” (Rembrandt painted some of his greatest portraits using the Jews of Amsterdam to illustrate Biblical characters.) William ultimately produced in his son, Prince Maurice, the greatest soldier of the age. Maurice contributed to the final victory in 1648 after eighty years of war with the Spanish Empire under the command of the Jesuits and their tools, Philip II and his son, Philip III.
Obviously, the Jesuits hated William of Orange. They kidnapped his eldest son who was then raised a Roman Catholic, the heart-broken father never to see him again. After several attempts to assassinate William, they finally succeeded one sad day in 1584. Their tool was Balthazar Gerard fulfilling the Jesuit Oath once again. Shooting the Father of the Dutch Republic three times with a pistol, Gerard attempted to escape but was caught and later brutally executed. As the poison from the rounds was coursing through his veins, William’s last words were:
“O my God, have mercy on this poor people.” {8}
Like Coligny, William I of Orange, the father of religious liberty and political freedom, died at the hand of a Jesuit assassin fulfilling the Company’s bloody oath once again:
“I will . . . make and wage relentless war . . . against all heretics . . . to exterminate them from the face of the whole earth . . . That when the same cannot be done openly, I will secretly use . . . the leaden bullet . . . ” {9} [Emphasis added]

“There was no disguise they [the Jesuits] could not assume, and therefore, there was no place into which they could not penetrate. They could enter unheard the closet of the Monarch, or the Cabinet of the Statesman. They could sit unseen in convocation or General Assembly, and mingle unsuspected in deliberations and debates. There was no tongue they could not speak, and no creed they could not profess, and thus there was no people among whom they might not sojourn, and no church whose membership they might not enter and whose functions they might not discharge. They could execrate the Pope with the Lutheran, and swear the Solemn League with the Covenanter.” {7}
J. A. Wylie, 1878 English Historian History of Protestantism
The Reformation was prospering in England. Queen Elizabeth I, “every inch a queen” speaking six languages better than her own, permitted the reformed doctrines of the Bible to be openly preached. From her kingdom, she first banished the Order in 1579. Of course the Jesuits hated her, called her a bastard, denied her right to the throne and attempted to murder her several times. The Ridolfi Plot (1571), the Throgmarton Plot (1583) and the Babington Plot (1586), although failures, were instigated by the soldiers of the Jesuit General in attempting to reduce England to the earthly, political rule of the Pope — the Temporal Power of “the Vicar of Christ.”
Meanwhile, the Jesuits were in control of Spain. Philip II was the king through which they sought to destroy the Reformation in the Netherlands as well as in England. (Philip II enjoyed the execution of his cousin Dona Isabella who, before a mock Inquisitional Court, professed Christ as her Lord and Saviour.) Therefore, with the military might of Philip, the Jesuits plotted the “extirpation” of England’s Protestants and Queen with one great stroke. They would invade with thousands of Spanish soldiers carried by a huge array of ships – the invincible Spanish Armada – its building having been financed by Rome’s Papal Caesar for two million crowns! Setting out in 1588, assured of naval supremacy and ultimate victory, the Jesuits urged their thirty thousand attackers aboard 128 ships on to heretic England. But the risen Son of God chose to intervene. After five desperate days of naval battle with the fleets of both Howard and Drake out of food and ammunition, we read:
“A mighty storm – a storm, which, to use the emphatic expression of Strada, ‘shook heaven and earth’ – finally decided the contest, and delivered England from the slightest apprehension of a rally, and fresh attack, from the scattered ships of the Armada . . . But winds and waves fought mightily for England, and while not so much as a single boat of

ours was lost, many of the stateliest ships of Spain [63] were dashed upon the shores of Ireland and Scotland [37 perished without a trace], while their crews perished miserably [20,000].” {8}
Indeed, the English noble and true author of Othello joyfully wrote:
“News lads! our wars are done. The desperate tempest hath so bang’d the Turks That their designment halts: a noble ship of Venice Hath seen a grievous wrack and sufferance On most part of their fleet.” {9}
Captain Thomas Fenner, commanding the Queen’s ship Nonpareil, declared:
“THE MIGHTY GOD OF ISRAEL STRETCHED
{10}
OUT BUT HIS FINGER AGAINST THEM.”
With England’s victory by the hand of the One “that even the winds and the sea obey” Bishop John Fisher’s deeply laid plans, perfected by the Jesuits, to destroy the “heretics” of England since 1533 were foiled. Elizabeth and the English people thanked God for giving so mighty a deliverance in answer to their prayers.
(Dear truth-seeker, would the Jesuits attempt to invade the U.S. with a foreign fleet? Is it simply a coincidence that Russia has the largest merchant marine fleet in the world? Could it be possible that Russia would provide the fleet for millions of Chinese (and possibly Japanese) to invade America? Why has President Clinton attempted to give the American Naval Base in Long Beach, California, to Red China whose Secret Service has been run by the Company through England for decades? Why is the scrap steel from New York’s demolished WTC being shipped to China, its Defense Ministry’s Director of Strategy Colonel Xu Junping – who recently defected to the U.S. – having declared that his agents have been bringing in nuclear and biological weapons for the last five years?)

J. E. C. Shepherd, 1987 Canadian Historian The Babington Plot
The Jesuits at every turn sought to discredit Queen Elizabeth in the eyes of her English subjects. They claimed “that guilty woman of England” had neither right nor title to the throne because she was the daughter of Roman Catholic King Henry VIII’s second wife, Anne Boleyn. Claiming that Henry’s second marriage was adultery, Elizabeth was called “the bastard Queen” by the Jesuits. To add insult to injury, the Jesuits then moved Pope Pius V to excommunicate her with his most infamous Papal Bull, Regnans in Excelsis (February 25, 1570). Formally condemned by the Devil’s dynastic “Vicar of Christ,” certain Roman Catholic English lords could be convinced that killing Elizabeth would not be murder but a virtuous act.
Therefore, the Jesuits plotted Elizabeth’s overthrow — many times. They attempted to make Mary, Queen of Scots, the Queen of England. But the conspiracy failed and the treacherous Mary lost her life. The conspiracy to put a Jesuit-controlled, Roman Catholic Monarch on England’s throne was thwarted — this time. She was tried and beheaded on the 8th of February 1587, by order of the Parliament.
Others would attempt the life of the Queen. William Parry, Anthony Babington, Roberto Ridolfi, as well as Jesuits Edmund Campion and Robert Parsons were a few of the many would-be assassins. They too all failed and paid with their lives. The risen Son of God was protecting Elizabeth not because of her personal purity but because of the prayers of her subjects and her benevolent policy towards the English Reformers.
History would prove that the reign of Elizabeth was the birth of religious liberty, the Middle Class, and thus the mighty Protestant British Empire. Of her kingdom’s great prosperity an ex-Jesuit writes:
“The results of Protestantism were gloriously promoted and expanded by Elizabeth – in the vast improvement of agriculture – internal trade and foreign commerce. Philip’s tyranny ruined the Netherlands: Elizabeth received and tolerated the fugitives. New manufacturers, of various kinds, energetically advanced the nation’s onward march to

supremacy amongst the most industrious, the wealthiest of earth. The Royal Exchange of London – built by one of her subjects – became the center of commerce extending over Europe, and to Barbary, Morocco, Guinea, and Turkey. Her sailor, Willoughby, actually discovered Archangel — and a Russian trading company was established. Frobisher, Davis, Raleigh, Drake, and Cavendish, are names of high renown: these men were Elizabeth’s discoverers of the world, which they circumnavigated at no expense to the nation, because they had to fight their way on the papal seas of the Spanish despot – and brought home solid equivalents as well as contributions to ‘the diffusion of knowledge.’ Some call them pirates – but, if they were, they robbed from a thief – the King of Spain [Philip II] – that wholesale pirate among the Indians.” {13}
Elizabeth’s successor, King James I – the son of Scotland’s beheaded Mary Queen of Scots – banished the Jesuits, rightly blamed the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 on “Jesuits and papists,” and became the founder of the Protestant British Empire. He would also authorize the translation of the Protestant English Bible (for which his good name would be continually maligned, vilified and slandered), destined to be taken to the ends of the earth in creating Western Civilization, while furthering The Great Commission given by Jesus the Messiah,
“And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.”
– Matthew 28:18-20
One of the most important plots in attempting to assassinate Queen Elizabeth miserably failed, having been exposed by England’s Lord Great Chamberlain, Edward de Vere, the Seventeenth Earl of Oxford. In his revealing of the Jesuit General’s Campion-Parsons Plot we read:
“During the latter 1570’s, the whole-souled Oxford had remained unsuspicious as his intimacy with his Catholic cousins and their circle of intellectual friends increased. Finally . . . they recklessly confided to him, in December, 1580, their plans to overthrow Elizabeth and place Mary Queen of Scots on the throne of England. To their horror, Oxford went at once to the Queen — the sovereign to whom, as a feudal knight, he had sworn undying fealty.” {14}

Therefore,
“From this time forward Jesuits who ventured into England were remorselessly hunted down, persecuted, and executed (125 by the time of Queen Elizabeth’s death in 1603); and the law imposing fines on Catholics for non-attendance at Protestant services, which had remained a dead-letter since it received the royal assent at the beginning of Elizabeth’s reign, was resuscitated and put into rigorous execution . . . This change of policy is frequently attributed to the well-known mission to England of the Jesuits, Campion and Parsons. But they landed in England as far back as April 1580; and it was not until after Lord Oxford’s disclosure in December and the proclamation in January that Campion was apprehended and sentenced to death. These dates make it clear that it must have been Lord Oxford’s dramatic interview that induced the Queen to take her first step against her Catholic subjects . . . ” {15}
Who was this Edward de Vere, Queen Elizabeth’s greatest courtier and the Jesuits’ greatest enemy, having foiled the Pope’s plots to overthrow England’s greatest Monarch? He was none other than the one we know today as “William Shakespeare.” For,
“ . . . it has become impossible to hesitate any longer in proclaiming Edward de Vere, Seventeenth Earl of Oxford, as the real author of
‘Shakespeare’s’ works.” {16}
And why would the true authorship of the works of “Shakespeare” be suppressed to this day? Because this Protestant, Bible-reading, honourable English knight, the enemy of the Jesuit Provincial Henry Garnett and greatest swordsman of the realm, used his pen – mightier than his sword – to thwart the designs of the Jesuits as they attempted to destroy the Reformation, wrought by the Spirit of God, and to restore the Temporal Power of the Pope over Britain. With their tool, William Cecil – who openly displayed prayer beads while a Catholic advisor during the reign of Queen Mary I of England (“Bloody Mary”), who always attempted to please the Jesuits’ Philip II, who advised Elizabeth to marry the Catholic Archduke Charles of Austria (known also as Charles of Styria, being the son of the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand I) rather than Protestant Leicester and who hired the Jesuit Henry Garnett to spread a nasty rumor about Edward de Vere – the Sons of Loyola robbed “the Red Knight” of his eighty-six estates. They also robbed him of his right to the throne and, through both Cecil and Masonic Francis Bacon, destroyed the memory of his great name, continuing to perpetuate the lie that some illiterate, money-hungry, grain dealer of Stratford-on-Avon wrote the masterpieces of the man whom the British Empire has voted “the most important personality of the last millennium.”

Chapter 4 125
History would prove that the reign of Elizabeth was the birth of the mighty Protestant British Empire. England’s first century as a Protestant nation produced the world’s greatest Greek scholar and father of the Protestant English Bible, William Tyndale (John Wickliffe having previously translated Rome’s Latin Vulgate); its greatest poet and abstract historian, Edward de Vere, (alias “Shakespeare”); its greatest scientist and mathematician, Isaac Newton; and its greatest sailor and naval commander at the defeat of the Spanish Armada, Francis Drake. Her successor, King James I, would also expel the Jesuits from his kingdom and authorize the translation of the English Bible destined to be taken by the missionary servants of the risen Son of God, as they preached the Gospel of the Grace of God, to the ends of the earth. And for these reasons the perpetually warring Counter-Reformation Jesuits have assassinated his character, calling him “a homosexual” and “a confirmed heretic,” rather than acknowledge him as the great English Solomon that he was! Further, those wicked Sons of Loyola attacked the credibility of that finished literary classic which he authorized by asserting that the pagan Masonic Francis Bacon added his final touch to the work. This is a sheer and outright lie, as the forty seven learned and godly men, having devoted their lives to one of the greatest moments in the history of the true Church of the Lord Jesus Christ, would never had dedicated THEIR WORK to THEIR DREAD SOVEREIGN had they known that infidel Francis Bacon was permitted to alter a single letter of their torturous epic masterpiece!
More importantly for us Americans, the risen Son of God would use The Authorized King James Version of 1611 as the foundation for the Calvinistic, Federal Republic of the United States. George Washington’s “Holy Experiment” in the form of a Protestant republic would last from the ratification of the Constitution in 1789 to the coerced ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868. Meanwhile, America would be the refuge and haven for Europe’s Protestants, Baptists and Jews having been so mercilessly persecuted by Rome’s Jesuits for over two hundred years.
All these blessings can be traced to England’s “bastard queen,” Elizabeth I, whom the risen Son of God protected while she encouraged the Reformation and furiously refused to be conquered by the Jesuits. May we never forget her in all her greatness and the immense Jesuit power she opposed with all of her might.
Dear truth-seeker, G. B. Nicolini, in making our lesson relevant for today, rightly concludes:
“If [the Jesuits] hated England and Queen Elizabeth in the 16th century, they bear no less hate to England and Queen Victoria in the 19th. Let an opportunity present itself, and you shall see them again heading the rebellion, and preaching murder as the most meritorious of all actions. Nor do they remain inactive while waiting for the opportunity. Their evil genius is constantly present and active.” {17} [Emphasis added]

Aware of the Order’s plots and agitations among Catholics, the Queen ordered the immediate execution of any Jesuit found within her borders. Decreed a “heretic” and excommunicated by Pope Pius V, the Jesuits sought to assassinate her many times. But the risen Son of God spared her life using her faithful courtiers, the greatest being Edward de Vere, her beloved Earl and Lord Great Chamberlain. Miraculously, Elizabeth ruled for over forty years with the aid of her Puritan advisor, Francis Walsingham, and laid the foundation for the Lord’s Protestant English Bible and the Protestant British Empire.

In vengeance, the Jesuits used William Cecil to steal his landed estates and “wounded” his name, henceforth to be known as “William Shakespeare.” This true author of the plays and of the sonnets, having been England’s premier Earl in the House of Lords, was voted by the British Empire in the year 2000 as “the most important personality of the last millennium.” Having coined 5000 words for the English language, de Vere’s prose was the basis for The King James Bible.

It was ultimately acquired by the Folger Library of Washington and hangs there today. Alterations were revealed by x-ray and infrared photography executed by Charles Wisner Barrell who, in the early 1950s, published his findings in The Scientific American. Some of them were: the courtier’s lace ruff had been painted over to resemble a commoner’s plain collar; the boar-crest of the seal ring on the thumb had been obscured; the Trentham coat-of-arms in the upper left hand corner had been painted over and the date changed; the initials “C.K.” for Cornelius Ketel, the famous artist, had been painted out; the hairline was moved back to make him to appear bald. Like the unbiblical “Jesus Christ” of Jesuitism, the Ashbourne Portrait of “William Shakespeare” is just another pious and literary fraud.

In 1603, Queen Elizabeth died having banished the Jesuits from her kingdom “forever.” James I became king; he too banished the Jesuits and commanded a hangman to publicly burn the evil doctrines of the Jesuit Francisco Suarez Defensio Fidei Catholicae found in his Opera Omnia! So England posed a problem for the Jesuit General. The king was a Protestant (“a confirmed heretic” in the words of Spain’s King Philip III), the House of Commons was full of Protestants and the people no longer gave heed to the Pope’s decrees. Therefore the Jesuits determined to
“ . . . annihilate the king, with his whole family, together with the
entire heads of Protestantism in England in one blow.” {5}
How? By blowing up the King and the assembled Parliament with thirty-six barrels of gunpowder. The plot nearly succeeded but a letter alerted the king to the plan. When the sheriff entered the large cellar beneath the Parliament he discovered the conspirator, Guy Fawkes, a soldier in the service of King Philip III of Spain, with
“ . . . a piece of tinder, three matches, a dagger and a pistol . . . booted and spurred, like a man who was prepared to take a journey on
horseback.” {6}
Indeed he was. Violently resisting arrest, Fawkes was tried and executed having been the fanatical tool of England’s Jesuit Provincial, Henry Garnett. Convicted of high treason having obeyed the Jesuit Oath, Garnett was also publicly executed in 1606.
To this day, every November 5th the English Protestants, especially those in Lewes and Sussex who burn the effigy of the Pope annually, celebrate “Guy Fawkes Day” while the Jesuit Provincial at Stonyhurst controls the Archbishop of Westminster who in turn rules the country through the Royal Institute for International Affairs (RIIA), the British version of the American Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) likewise controlled by the Archbishop of New York.

“Between 1555 and 1931 [1921] the Society of Jesus was expelled from at least 83 countries, city states and cities, for engaging in political intrigue and subversive plots against the welfare of the state, according to the records of a Jesuit priest of repute [Jesuit Thomas J. Campbell, The Jesuits, 1534 - 1921] . . . practically every instance of expulsion was for political intrigue, political infiltration, political subversion, and inciting to political insurrection.” {4} [Emphasis added]
J. E. C. Shepherd, 1987 Canadian Historian The Babington Plot
In 1589, King Henry III of France was stabbed to death by the Jesuit assassin Jacques Clement — ending the dynasty of the House of Valois. For glorifying this treasonous murder, the Jesuit Guignard was publicly executed with the hangman’s noose. The throne passed to a Protestant, Henry of Navarre also known as King Henry IV. Henry’s ascent began the Bourbon dynasty that would span nearly three centuries. At its anti-Jesuit height it would threaten war on the Papacy if it refused to abolish the Company of Jesus in the late Eighteenth Century and at its pro-Jesuit depth it would end in disgrace, overthrown by an outraged France, in 1830. Henry was not fully accepted as king until he renounced Protestantism, as the Jesuits had plotted to give the crown to a Spanish Roman Catholic, Clara Isabella. Henry’s cowardly and shameful renunciation was accomplished in 1593.
Henry IV proved to be the greatest French king since Charlemagne. He sought to better the plight of the peasants created by Rome’s Dark Ages. He encouraged the arts and industries while manufacturers arose throughout the kingdom. France began to flourish while its treasury increased. Henry IV’s greatest act, however, was the issuing of the Edict of Nantes in 1598. This edict guaranteed freedom of worship and equality of rights to the Protestant Huguenots. The Jesuits were furious! If religious freedom was permitted, France might become a Protestant nation. O horrors! Although a Roman Catholic, the king’s good will toward the Protestants brought upon him the one hundred and twenty-five curses of the Jesuits’ Council of Trent. Clearly Henry IV must die!
The Jesuits must now fulfill their bloody Oath as they did with Admiral Coligny and Henry III. The king clearly understood his peril. Chiniquy writes in quoting Sully’s Memoirs:
“Henry IV, King of France, after being wounded by an assassin sent by the Jesuits, said: ‘I am compelled to do one of these two things: Either recall the Jesuits, free them from the infamy and disgrace with which

they are covered, or to expel them in a more absolute manner, and prevent them from approaching either my person or my kingdom. But then, we will drive them to despair and to the resolution of attempting my life again, which would render it so miserable to me, being always under the apprehension of being murdered or poisoned. For these people have correspondence everywhere, and are so very skillful in disposing the minds of men to whatever they wish, that I think it would be better that I should be already dead.’ ” {5}
One sad day in 1610, the Jesuits, those masters of murder, slew France’s great King Henry IV. While returning from a visit with Sully (who later described this entire tragedy in his Memoirs) the king’s carriage was stopped in the middle of the street — just like President Kennedy’s limousine was nearly stopped in the middle of the street in Dallas. Instantly Francois Ravaillac, the Jesuits’ assassin, jumped upon the wheel and stabbed his shocked victim through the heart. When arrested, he was still clutching his bloody knife.
“With that good nature which characterized him, he at length consented to allow them [the Jesuits] to return. It was in vain that Sully, his minister, represented to him that no kindness could soften such foes; he recalled them, and fell a victim to their instigations, being stabbed by Ravaillac, on May 14th, 1610.” {6}
The Edict of Nantes would maintain religious liberty in France for eighty-seven years. In 1685, the Jesuits would cause it to be revoked through their most obedient servant and brother Jesuit, King Louis XIV who
“ . . . saw his kingdom impoverished, his commerce gone, his name execrated throughout the world, and lay in his magnificent palace at Versailles dying [of venereal disease]. He is utterly wretched. The people curse him, and hurl stones and mud at his coffin.” {7}
And Protestantism, including the Bible, would be outlawed for over one hundred years, Satan’s Jesuit-controlled Papacy maintaining absolute control over every civil institution of France. (Doesn’t this sound like Communist Russia, China and Cuba?)
Dear truth-seeker, do you understand how the Jesuits will murder even Roman Catholic rulers if they dare resist Rome’s policies? Did President Kennedy resist the Jesuits by seeking to break the CIA “into a thousand pieces” and end the Vietnam War? Was this a threat to the “infallible” Pope’s Temporal Power?
Indeed, the Jesuits, in seeking to introduce unbridled tyranny, believe there is nothing their Church cannot do.

Henry III’s death sentence was for openly allying himself with his “heretic” cousin, Henry of Navarre. The risen Son of God used Henry IV to bring Religious liberty to France with his promulgation of the wonderful Edict of Nantes thus outraging Satan’s Black Pope. As the leader of the French Protestant Calvinists, called “Huguenots,” he sought military alliances with other Protestant princes against the political conspiracies of Rome. He even planned to come to the aid of the struggling Dutch Protestants in their war with Spain. After several attempts, the Jesuits finally assassinated him at point blank range with one of their fanatical, remorseless tools, Francois Ravaillac, in fulfilling their bloody Oath and murderous Council of Trent.

Frederick Schiller, 1790 German Dramatist and Poet History of the Thirty Years’ War
“All throughout Germany the Jesuits spread desolation and misery whenever the cause of truth and freedom was overcome by the superior material force of despotism and bigotry. ‘They were the most able auxiliaries of [Emperor] Ferdinand II [and King Philip IV of Spain] in destroying the Protestants; they were in the imperial cabinet, in his armies, among the defeated sectarians, and they even dared to penetrate into the camp of the Lutherans’ (as spies, no doubt). The Jesuits had formed [General Barclay] Tilly [the butcher of Protestant Magdeburg and the victor of a hundred battles], [General Albert de] Wallenstein [who personally hated the Jesuits for which he was ultimately assassinated], and [General Ottavio] Piccolomini, the three champions [military Generals] of the Catholic cause in the Thirty Years’ War.
‘They (the Jesuits) accompanied the armies in their march, they followed them to the battlefield; . . . they preached the extermination of the Protestants [in accordance with the Council of Trent having pronounced 125 curses on all heretics], and gave out that no work was so meritorious in the eyes of God as to kill those accursed heretics. They did not calm, but rather excited, the ferocious passions of their pupils the generals, and, above all, of Tilly, over whom they possessed a very great influence. . . .
They fought here, as elsewhere, not for their faith or their Church, but for their idol — the Order. . . . The greatest part of the properties of which the Protestants were iniquitously divested went to enrich the covetous and insatiable disciples of Loyola.” {5} [Emphasis added]

“[The Jesuits] . . . aim and object was that the war . . . should in truth, become a war of annihilation. Besides, was it possible for them to allow peace to be concluded with countries whose rebellious Governments had issued a law ruling that no Jesuit should ever again dare to show his face, under pain of death, within their boundaries? This, indeed, had Bohemia done, as also Hungary, Moravia, Silesia, with Upper and Lower Austria; and not only had they acted thus; but, at the same time, had publicly disclosed to the world, all the nefarious peculiarities and deeds of the Order of Jesus, in such a manner as to embitter the feelings of the Jesuits in the highest degree . . . the whole frightful responsibility for this terrible thirty years’ war must rest upon the Emperor Ferdinand II, and his teachers, rulers, and bosom friends, the Sons of Loyola.” {6}
Theodor Griesinger, 1873 German Historian The Jesuits
This most horrible chapter in history was started by the Protestants using their Swords of Just Defense as a result of years of Jesuit persecution through the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand II. Of this persecution Ridpath writes:
“The reformed churches were closed or demolished, the hymn books and Bibles of the people seized and burned, and a decree of banishment promulgated against all who would not return to the Holy Church.” {7}
Therefore, on the 23rd of May, 1618, the first Thirty Years’ War began. By a special decree Bohemia expelled the Jesuits declaring:
“We lords, knights, deputies of Prague, Kuttenberg and other estates, together recognize in what great danger this kingdom of Bohemia has stood ever since the introduction of the hypocritical sect of Jesuits. We have, moreover, found in truth that the originators of all this mischief are the above-mentioned Jesuits, who occupy themselves in contriving how they may strengthen the Roman See, and bring all kingdoms and lands under their power and might, who to this end employ the most illicit means, inflame rulers against one another, cause rebellion and unrest among the estates of countries, especially such as are of different religions, set superiors against subordinates, subordinates against superiors . . . Now therefore, as they are in these ways the cause of the evil state which has befallen the kingdom, they have justly merited to be no longer tolerated in the said kingdom . . . ” {8} [Emphasis added]

Silesia, Moravia and Hungary joined in the revolt. But the Jesuits became masters of Germany through their agent and tool, Emperor Ferdinand II (1619-1637), who was as clay in the hands of his confessor-advisor, Jesuit Martin Becan and later, Jesuit William Lamormaini.
“ . . . there now began a regular system of Protestant persecution – more mean, cruel, and horrible bloody things happened, indeed than can well be conceived – and according to the evidence furnished by the Jesuits themselves, the originator of all this was their distinguished brother, William Lamormain [Lamormaini] . . . ” {9}
One of the greatest military atrocities
“ . . . consisted in this, that the Croats [like the Ustashi two centuries later during World War II] . . . were employed, with drawn swords, in hunting down the people, forcing them to the Mass with dogs and whips, and throwing the refractory ones into the cages in which they could neither sit, lie down, nor even stand, while they were compelled to witness, at the same time, the most horrible violence [forcible rape] applied to their poor wives and daughters, until the husbands and fathers swore upon their knees to renounce heresy.” {10}
The Sons of Loyola, ever true to their bloody Oath, used Emperor Ferdinand II with his Catholic League in opposing the Protestant Union to kill over ten million people. Ridpath tells us:
“It has been estimated that this benign [Catholic] sovereign went into the world of spirits with the blood of ten millions of people on his soul . . . In the whole history of the German race no other sovereign ever contributed so largely to the woes of the people.” {11} [Emphasis added]
Gustavus Adolphus the Great, known as the “Lion of the North,” the “Snow-King” of Sweden and the invincible military hero of the Thirty Years’ War will forever stand as one of the eight greatest generals in the history of the world (Alexander the Great, Hannibal, Julius Caesar, Gustavus Adolphus, Turenne, Prince Eugene, Frederic II the Great, and Napoleon I) according to Napoleon Bonaparte himself. Never knowing that his beloved daughter, Christiana, would be converted to Romanism by a Portuguese Jesuit, Antonio Macedo, and therefore renounced her father’s Lutheran throne of Sweden, this godly, prayerful and simply attired Lutheran servant of the risen Son of God raged:
“There are three Ls I should like to see hanged: the Jesuit Lamormaine [Lamormaini], the Jesuit Laymann and the Jesuit Laurentius Forer.” {12} [Emphasis added]

As this “holy war” came to a close Ridpath continues:
“It was evident that the end was at hand – that the insane and bloody project, conceived in the bosom of Jesuitism, and transplanted to the brain of [Emperor] Ferdinand II, to crush into the earth the cause for which Huss had died and Luther had lived, was now doomed to a complete and everlasting disappointment.” {13}
Indeed the end was a great disappointment for the Jesuits, but hardly everlasting. The Treaty of Westphalia, concluded in 1648, secured religious liberty and furthered the Reformation. At the same time the Protestant Dutch Republic achieved its liberty from Jesuit-controlled Spain. The Jesuits had failed to destroy Yahweh’s Protestant Reformation in attempting to return Europe to the Dark Ages. They failed to enslave Europe’s greatest nations to the Temporal Power of the Pope. For in 1648 the world entered into what historians call “the Modern Era.”
Dear reader, do you understand why the Bible-believing Protestants through the arm of government were forced to use guns to resist tyrannical, political power under the control of the Jesuits?
Could it be that the Jesuits, using Senator Kennedy, Senator Specter and President Clinton to deprive us Americans of our right to bear arms, have also penetrated the National Rifle Association with one of their tools, John M. Snyder, a former Jesuit seminarian who is a member of the Pope’s Order of St. Michael the Archangel and presently leading the effort to make “St. Gabriel of the Sorrowful Mother” the patron saint of gun owners? In the light of the Jesuit Conference seeking to ban all privately owned firearms, HOW RIDICULOUS CAN HE BE!!!!!
Could it be that the Jesuits have used their Georgetown University graduate, President William “Bill” J. Clinton, to deprive Americans of their right to own and bear arms secured by the Second Amendment?
Could it be that Adolf Hitler, brought to power by the Chairman of the Center Party, Jesuit Ludwig Kaas, given the Chancellorship by Papal Chamberlain and Knight of Malta Franz von Papen, and advised by the Jesuit-controlled SS General Martin Bormann, was the second Emperor Ferdinand II, waging the Second Thirty Years’ War against the Jews and Protestants of Europe, he too having deprived the German people of their right to own and bear arms? Remember, our own Gun Control Act of 1968 is based upon Hitler’s gun control legislation of 1935, as brought back from Germany by Thomas Dodd, a Nuremberg prosecutor and later, a Senator from Connecticut. Were both Roman Catholic brothers, Senators Thomas and Christopher Dodd, connected to the Jesuits through the Council on Foreign Relations, controlled by the Archbishop of New York, Francis Cardinal Spellman?

Death of Gustavus Adolphus at Lutzen, 1594 – 1632 #35 Protestant King of Sweden, 1611 - 1632 Known as “the Snow King” and “the Lion of the North,” this greatest of Lutherans was the hero of the Thirty Years’ War brought upon Europe by the Sons of Loyola. On his knees, upon entering this, his last battle, he prayed, “O Lord Jesus Christ, bless our arms and this day’s battle for the glory of Thy Holy Name!” Here, he is dying, giving his last full measure for Protestant liberty declaring to his killers, “I am the King of Sweden, and thus I seal with my blood the religion and liberties of Germany.” Our hero’s modest life and noble death furthered the Reformation that brought about “The Modern Era” with the Treaty of

Ascendancy and Power
Dear truth-seeker, in light of the previous seven chapters we must pause and reflect on the power of the Jesuit Order. Historian John Clark Ridpath writes:
“The Society of Jesus was thenceforth recognized as the chief opposing force of Protestantism. The Order became dominant in determining the plans and policy of the Romish Church. The brotherhood grew and flourished. It planted its chapters first in France, Italy and Spain, and then in all civilized lands. The success of the Order was phenomenal. It became a power in the world. It sent out its representatives to every quarter of the globe. Its solitary apostles were seen shadowing the thrones of Europe. They sought, by every means known to human ingenuity, to establish and confirm the tottering fabric of Rome, and to undermine the rising fabric of Protestantism. They penetrated to the Indus and the Ganges. They traversed the deserts of Thibet, and said, “Here am I,” in the streets of Peking. They looked down into the silver mines of Peru, and knelt in prayer on the shore of Lake Superior. To know all secrets, fathom all designs, penetrate all intrigues, prevail in all counsels, rise above all diplomacy, and master the human race, – such was their purpose and ambition. They wound about human society in every part of the habitable earth, the noiseless creepers of their evergrowing plot to retake the world for the Church, and to subdue and conquer and extinguish the last remnant of opposition to her dominion from shore to shore, from the rivers to the ends of the earth.” {1}[Emphasis added]
Having gained control of a nation’s political leaders, the Order then enforced its power over the people with its “Holy” Office of the Inquisition. We read:
“The Jesuits reckon it among the glories of their order, that Loyola supported, by a special memorial to the Pope [Paul III (1534-1549)], a petition for . . . reviving the infamous tribunal of the [Roman] Inquisition [with a Bull on April 1, 1542] . . . This terrible tribunal, in the hands of the relentless and unforgiving Caraffa [Gian Pietro Cardinal Caraffa or Carafa, later Pope Paul IV (1559-1565)], spread desolation and dismay throughout Italy, from its very commencement . . . death assumed a new

and more terrible aspect. And he who should invent new instruments of torture to dislocate the limbs of the victims with the most exquisite and excruciating pains possible would be rewarded!!! Throughout Italy, and in various parts of Europe, you might have seen, whilst the infernal flames of the pile were ascending, the sinister and diabolical smile of the Jesuits, who were aiming at the increase of their order, under the shade of this all-mastering power!” {2}
Dear truth-seeker, the Order’s “Holy” Office of the Inquisition – in maintaining its all-mastering power over the people – was brought into Stalin’s Russia and Hitler’s Germany under the guise of political ideologies — Communism and Nazism! Under the guise of drug-based, allopathic, medical ideology, the Order extended its Inquisition into Theodore “Rex” Roosevelt’s Fourteenth Amendment American Empire with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) controlling its agent, the American Medical (Murderer’s) Association (AMA). Of Rome’s power over America at the turn of the Nineteenth Century, Thomas Edward Watson, the great U. S. Senator from Georgia known as “the Sage of Hickory Hill,” declared:
“Today the Roman priest is the most insolent and arrogant man in America. The laws will not touch him. The politicians do his bidding. The press is afraid of him. His powerful hand controls Congress and the President. . . . [The priests] have established the Inquisition here: . . . they are in secret league with the head-chiefs of both the old political parties: they have shackled the press; and the cowardly politicians are in deadly fear of them. They have promised their Papa that the United States shall be his within the next few years! . . .But the Papa would burn heretics right now, if he could. . . . The Roman Catholic Hierarchy! The most damnable group of interlocking secret societies that ever met in darkness, and took hellish oaths to a compact of greed, and lust, and crime, for the sordid purpose of grasping uncontrollable power, boundless wealth, and a never ceasing supply of the most enjoyable women. These secret societies [the Society of Jesus, the Knights of Malta, the Knights of Columbus, Shriner Freemasonry, etc.] which constitute the real machinery of the Roman Catholic Church, have the same sort of religion that Satan would have . . . were he to . . . take human shape on earth.” {3}
As we shall see, the power of the Jesuits is now universal. In command of all the governments of he earth, the Society of Jesus kills political leaders if they oppose their policies even if those leaders are Roman Catholic — like President John F. Kennedy. They foment wars to suit their purposes in fulfilling the Council of Trent — like the Vietnam War and the present American-led Papal Crusade against the Muslim peoples of Iraq, Afghanistan and ultimately Saudi Arabia!

Chapter 8 147
Remembering the purpose of the Jesuit Order, it set out to conquer the Far East, particularly Japan, and upon that victory, the Chinese Empire. First came the priests, and then came the foreign soldiers. In attempting to capture Japan with Francis Xavier arriving in 1549, the Jesuits converted many of the Japanese lords called “daimyo.” The Jesuits then incited them to destroy hundreds of Buddhist temples and slaughter the priests. But it came to pass that the risen Son of God would send a Protestant sea captain to the court of the Emperor’s shogun. Having saved William Adams from being crucified by the Jesuits, the shogun Iyeyasu held many interviews with the mariner. There he learned of the Order’s bloody history including the extermination of the West Indian races and of the Inquisition in Spain. As a result, the Englishman rose to extraordinary favor and was created a Samurai.
The shogun then purposed to resist the Pope’s political agenda of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy guided by the Jesuits and their evil Council of Trent. We read:
“From the beginning of his reign Iyeyasu had been organizing and unifying his empire and establishing his power to cope with the foreign conspirators. In 1606 he issued an edict forbidding further mission work and proclaiming that those who had adopted Christianity must abandon it. By Christianity he meant what Voltaire meant by “the Infamous,” the intriguing system of Rome which aimed at the overthrow of the native government and the sectarian domination of the country.” {3}
With this understanding, by 1639 the Tokugawa shoguns, Iyeyasu (1603-1616), Hidetada (1616-1623) and Iyemitsu (1623-1651), successfully expelled the Jesuits with their minions, the Spanish and the Portuguese, allowing only the Protestant Dutch to trade with the Empire until 1854! With the Order first expelled in 1587 and again in 1597 by Daimyo Hideyoshi (for which he paid with his life in 1598), in 1614 Iyeyasu issued an edict in the name of his son, Hidetada, finally expelling the Company and outlawing both Protestant and Catholic “Christianity.” In 1622 many Jesuits were justly put to death (“martyred”) for high treason, and in 1624 the Roman Catholic Spanish were banished by one of Iyemitsu’s edicts. And why?
“The Christians [Jesuits], so the decree alleged, were striving ‘to spread abroad a pernicious code, to exterminate the true religion [Buddhism], to overthrow the government, and to make themselves masters of the whole empire.’ ” {4} [Emphasis added]
And to what end?
“These [Jesuits] had for their object nothing less than the conquest of China, and the Jesuit fathers cherished the hope of gaining before long entry into Peking in the train of the Japanese ruler.” {5} [Emphasis added]
The Jesuits – 1614 - 1945

(Dear truth-seeker, this is precisely what happened from 1865 to 1989. The Jesuits, in control of the Japanese Army through Emperor Meiji and his grandson Hirohito, ended the Manchu Dynasty in 1911 and, during World War II, gang-raped and mass-murdered the Chinese people, as described in The Rape of Nanking, until 1945. Then in 1949 the Order, using their British, American and Russian Empires, installed its Chinese Grand Inquisitor, Mao Tse-tung. He in turn, in the name of “communism,” murdered fifty million of his own people. The Jesuit General, having won the Cold War, became the absolute master of the Far East and emerged with a powerful new “sword of the Church” in his hands—the enormous Chinese Army! This army will one day absorb Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, and a disarmed Australia, having been given technology and high finance by the Papal Caesar’s “Holy Roman” Fourteenth Amendment American Empire.)
But the Company of Jesus never cedes any portion of its power without a fight, as, in the words of the former Speaker of the House and one of the Kennedy assassins, Tip O’Neill, “power is never given, only taken.” In 1637 it resisted the shogun’s edicts by force through raising an army and inciting a rebellion. This army of thirty thousand Roman Catholic Japanese declared a religious war and openly revolted against the Emperor. It seized an abandoned castle on the coast of Shimabara and waited for the Spanish fleet. The fleet would have reinforced the Jesuits and their army. But the shogun’s forces, along with the Protestant Dutch fleet, foiled the aim of the Order by destroying the fortress along with the rebels.
“With the crushing of this rebellion fell the hopes of the Jesuits of establishing themselves in Japan. Their religion, says Lafcadio Hearn, had brought to Japan nothing but evil: disorders, persecutions, revolts, political troubles, and war. Even those virtues of the people which had been evolved at unutterable cost for the protection and conservation of society – their self-denial, their faith, their loyalty, their constancy and courage – were by this black creed diverted, distorted, and transformed into forces for the destruction of that society. Could that destruction have been accomplished, and a new Roman Catholic empire have been founded upon the ruins, the forces of that empire would have been used for the further extension of priestly tyranny, the spread of the Inquisition, the perpetual Jesuit warfare against freedom of conscience and human progress . . . Viewed from any other standpoint than that of religious bias, and simply judged by its results, the Jesuit effort to Christianize Japan must be regarded as a crime against humanity, a labor of devastation, a calamity comparable only – by reason of the misery and destruction which it wrought – to an earthquake, a tidal-wave, a volcanic eruption.” {6} [Emphasis added]
The Jesuits – 1614 - 1945



Chapter 8 149
(Dear truth-seeker, as we shall later see, this is exactly what the Jesuits did to our Federal Republic established by our great George Washington. They founded a new “Holy Roman” American Empire on the ruins of our nation devastated by the War Between the States (1861-1865). The Jesuits then used their new American Empire to subdue all nations to the Temporal Power of their “infallible” Pope. In so doing the Jesuit General used his International Intelligence Community – the Holy Office of the Inquisition – and thereby conducted his warfare against freedom of conscience, freedom of speech and human progress pursuant to the evil Council of Trent.)
The result of this upheaval was that in 1639 shogun Iyemitsu, having previously expelled the Jesuits and the Spanish, now banished the Roman Catholic Portuguese and all foreigners from Japan forever. The Expulsion Edict reads:
“For the future, let none, so long as the sun illuminates the world, presume to sail to Japan, not even in the quality of ambassadors, and this declaration is never to be revoked, on pain of death.” {7}
As a result of these edicts, the Jesuits would be barred from Japan for over two hundred and fifty years, allowing art, prosperity and peace to come to the nation under the Tokugawa shoguns. Little did the Emperor and shogun know that both of their dynasties and nation would pay dearly for this! Always plotting and forever returning, in 1854 the Order used the American gunboats of Commodore Matthew C. Perry to open up trade with Japan. In taking vengeance on its old enemy, the Company (formally readmitted in 1865), using foreigners, incited a revolution in 1868. The shogun Keiki was branded a “tyrant” (for refusing to submit to the Temporal Power of the Pope, pursuant to the evil doctrines of the Jesuit Francisco Suarez) and was forced to resign, ending the fifteen-generation Tokugawa shogunate.
With the shogun out of the way, the Society of Jesus restored Emperor worship and centralized power (Jesuit style) in Tokyo. In 1868, using the agents of Queen Victoria’s British Ambassador Thomas Glover, the Order assassinated Emperor Komei at the young age of only thirty-six. And why? Emperor Komei absolutely refused to open up Japan to the treasonous, Jesuit-controlled, White “Christian” foreigners who were at the time in the process of causing a revolution! (Thank you Toichi for these facts!) True to form, having assassinated another enemy in obedience to its wicked laws, the Sons of Loyola put the young Emperor Meiji on the throne. Inexperienced and intimidated through the murder of his father, he became a most willing tool of the Order’s advisors for over forty years, from 1868 to 1912. In 1873 the “Christianity Ban” was lifted, allowing all “Christian” sects formal reentry into Japan, which included not only the Jesuits but the true Bible believing, gospel missionaries of the Lord Jesus Christ saving many Japanese in the 1880s! In 1874 Buddhism, the Company’s old enemy, was legally disenfranchised, the Emperor no longer protecting or providing for the former state religion.

(Years later during the Pope’s Cold War, the Order would launch a massive Inquisition against the peaceable Buddhists and its Dalai Lama (exiled in 1959 and presently a bosom friend of the Jesuits at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.) for daring to challenge THE POWER of “the Black Pope.” Using Jesuit-trained, bloodthirsty dictators like Chairman Mao of China, President Diem of Vietnam and Pol Pot of Cambodia, the Brotherhood would murder millions of Buddhists in obedience to its bloody Jesuit Oath and the Council of Trent, which is presently the foreign policy of the United States, Russia and China dictated by the Order’s Council on Foreign Relations and Trilateral Commission in New York.)
With this new absolute power in place, the Order would use its “Japanese Sword of the Church” until 1945. It used the Emperor’s army to make war on two of its old enemies, China (1895) and Russia (1905). For the Manchu Emperor in Peking had expelled the Jesuits in 1716 and again in 1775 as a result of the Order’s Papal Suppression in 1773, while the Romanoff Tzar Alexander I in Moscow had done the same in 1820. By 1941 payback time had arrived for the Japanese people. Under the supervision of “the Black Pope” (Jesuit General Ledochowski in Rome), the Sons of Loyola in Tokyo (working in conjunction with their brother Jesuits in Washington, D.C.) would create a war between the United States and Japan. With the full knowledge of President Roosevelt, the Shriner Freemason, Pearl Harbor would be bombed by Tojo’s Japanese fleet creating a fury across America. (Had not that Jesuit-controlled traitor, Admiral Nagumo, cancelled his third attack wave, all ship repair and fuel storage facilities having formerly belonged to Papal Knight of Malta and key player in the Teapot Dome Scandal, Edward L. Doheny would have been destroyed, forcing the American Navy to wage a long-range war from the California coast!) Congress would be tricked into declaring war — for the last time. This deception resulted in many Japanese Americans being shamefully shipped to midwest concentration camps — the brainchild of Earl Warren of the Warren Commission. Emperor Hirohito lost his absolute monarchy, Japan with its ancient culture was destroyed and the Japanese people suffered the shame and humiliation of a national defeat. The Jesuits then incorporated Japan, like Hawaii, into their “Holy Roman” Fourteenth Amendment American Empire and created a socialist-commercial colony, utterly dependent on Washington, D.C. for its protection and prosperity. Dear truth-seeker, I am and will always be an American. My heart breaks for my father’s generation of American soldiers who suffered the cruelty of Japanese torture and death marches. The bloodbaths of Iwo Jima, Guadalcanal, Tarawa and the re-taking of the Philippines gave the United States Marines a fame they will never lose and a suffering they will never forget. If they only knew they were fighting not for American freedom under our Protestant Constitution but for the vengeance of the Jesuit General and his wicked Council of Trent, “for the greater glory of God,”
the god who sits in St. Peter’s Chair!

Doheny’s second wife, Estelle, was a Papal Countess and Dame of Malta who financed the building one of the Order’s Churches in Los Angeles. This evil and calculating man bribed his old friend, Albert Fall, into leasing Navy oil land in Elk Hills, California, which oil netted him 100 million dollars in gold. Doheny then built Navy fuel storage tanks at Pearl Harbor in the name of “National Security” for the protection against a west coast “Mongol” invasion, the Black Pope preparing to wage a future war against Japan. Fall was convicted of taking a bribe from Doheny, but after four court battles Papal Knight Edward Doheny was found innocent of giving the very same sinister bribe that Fall had been sent to prison for receiving!

Japanese Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo, 1941 #39 Jesuit Temporal Coadjutor in Command of the Carrier Strike Force Having been exhorted by the Order’s Emperor Hirohito and Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (educated at Harvard University, 1919-1921), that “the fate of the Japanese Empire will depend on the issue of this battle,” this shameless traitor refused to order a third airborne attack wave at Pearl Harbor, sparing essential targets including ship repair and fuel storage facilities. The harbor’s aboveground fuel tanks, built by Knight of Malta Edward L. Doheny in preparation for the Pacific War, were filled to capacity with 4.5 million barrels of oil and remained untouched. According to Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, if the oil tanks had been destroyed the Pacific Fleet would have been forced to wage a four thousand mile war from the distant California Coast, as there was no fuel available anywhere else in the Pacific. The Battle of Midway would have never taken place during which Japan lost half of its Fleet. Since the purpose of the Black Pope’s attack on Pearl Harbor was merely to incite Fourteenth Amendment America to declare war on Japan, Nagumo’s attack was never intended by the Japanese High Command under Jesuit control to destroy the base. As a result “the fate of the Japanese Empire” was sealed. Pearl Harbor, Susan Wels, (Hong Kong: Time/Life & Tehabi Books, 2001) p. 194.

Ian Paisley, 1968 Irish Presbyterian Preacher Member, House of Commons The Jesuits
While the Jesuits were busy with the Thirty Years’ War and suppressing the Protestant quest for liberty in the Dutch Republic, they planned the annihilation of the Protestants in Ireland. We read:
“The great design was, that a general insurrection should take place at the same time throughout the kingdom, and that all the Protestants, without exception, should be murdered. The day fixed for this horrid massacre was the 23rd of October, 1641, the feast of Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuits; and the chief conspirators in the principal parts of the kingdom made the necessary preparations for the intended conflict.” {4}
The Jesuits – 1641



Chapter 9 155
Having devised the plan to murder all the Protestants of Ireland on Ignatius Loyola’s feast day, the Jesuits moved the deceived Irish Catholic people to carry out the plan.
“The Irish were more strongly instigated to execute the infernal business by the Jesuits, priests, and friars, who when the day for the execution of the plot was agreed upon, recommended to their hearers diligence in the great design, which, they said, would greatly tend to the prosperity of the kingdom and to the advancement of the Catholic cause. They everywhere declared to the common people that the Protestants were heretics, and ought not to be suffered to live any longer among them, adding that it was no more sin to kill an Englishman than to kill a dog, and that the relieving or protecting them was a crime of the most unpardonable nature.” {5}
When the extirpation began, the Jesuits, true to form, carried out their bloody Oath once again. Remember, they always use other people or organizations to do their dirty work in enforcing the Council of Trent. We read again:
“It is impossible to conceive the pleasure these monsters took in exercising such cruelty; and to increase the misery of those who fell into their hands, when they butchered them they would say, ‘Your soul to the devil!’ One of these miscreants would come into a house with his hands imbrued in blood, and boast that it was English blood, and that his sword had pricked the white skins of the Protestants even to the hilt. Upwards of thirty Protestants, men, women and children, in the county of Tipperary, fell into the hands of the papists, who, after stripping them naked, murdered them with stones, poleaxes, swords, and other instruments. . . . Others were hung on windmills, and before they were half dead the barbarians cut them in pieces with their swords. Some, both men, women and children, they cut and hacked in various parts of their bodies [sexual] and left them wallowing in their blood to perish where they fell. . . . Similar barbarities were practiced on the wretched Protestants in almost all parts of the kingdom; and when an estimate was afterwards made of the number who were sacrificed to gratify the diabolical cruelty of the papists, it amounted to 150,000.” {6}
Continuing with a passage from J. T. Headley’s The Life of Oliver Cromwell, we read with horror from Sir J. Temple’s Irish Rebellion as given by Merle d’Aubigne:
“Ever since the dreadful massacre of 1641, a perpetual war had been carried on between the Protestants and Catholics. This, Charles [Charles I, whose descendants include the U.S. Bush Dynasty having made its family fortune through banking via the Black Pope’s Third Reich according to John Loftus, a former prosecutor in the Justice

Department’s Nazi War Crimes Unit and the author of Unholy Trinity], while alive, had fostered by throwing the weight of his influence on the side of the Catholics. [For six years Charles I of England and Louis XIV of France had the same Jesuit confessor, Pere La Chaise] . . . ‘The Catholics burnt the houses of Protestants, turned them out naked in the midst of winter, and drove them like herds of swine before them. If ashamed of their nudity, and desirous of seeking shelter from the rigor of a remarkable severe season, these unhappy wretches took refuge in a barn, and concealed themselves under the straw, the rebels instantly set fire to it, and burned them alive. At other times, they were bound without clothing, to be drowned in rivers; and if, on the road they did not move quick enough they were urged forward at the point of the pike. When they reached the river, or the sea, they were precipitated into it in bands of several hundreds . . . If these poor wretches rose to the surface of the water, men were stationed along the brink, to plunge them in again with the butts of their muskets, or to fire at, and kill them. Husbands were cut to pieces in the presence of their wives; wives and virgins were abused in the sight of their nearest relations; and infants of seven or eight years were hung before the eyes of their parents. Nay, the Irish even went so far, as to teach their own children to strip and kill the children of the English, and dash out their brains against the stones. Numbers of Protestants were buried alive – as many as seventy in one trench. An Irish priest, named MacOdeghan, captured forty or fifty Protestants, and persuaded them to abjure their religion, on a promise of quarter. After their abjuration he asked them if they believed that Jesus Christ was bodily present in the host, and that the pope was the head of the church? And, on their replying in the affirmative, he said, ‘Now, then, you are in a very good faith;’ and for fear they should relapse into heresy, cut all their throats.’ ” {7} [Emphasis added]
And why all this needless bloodshed? Because it was boldly preached by the Jesuits. We read the brazenly unabashed words of Jesuit Conor O’Mahony, professor of Moral Theology in Evora, Portugal, spoken in 1645:
“My dear Irish, – Go on and perfect the work of your liberty and defence, which is so happily begun by you; and kill all the heretics, and all that do assist and defend them. You have in the space of four or five years, that is, between the years 1641 and 1645, wherein I write this, killed 150,000 heretics, as your enemies acknowledge. Neither do I deny it. And for my own part, as I verily believe you have killed more of them, so I would to God you had killed them all — which you must either do, or drive them all out of Ireland, that our Holy Land may be plagued no longer with such a . . . barbarous, ignorant and lawless generation of people.” {8}

(Dear truth seeker, two hundred years later the Satanic Sons of Loyola in control of the Queen of England would instigate the Second Irish Massacre. Deceptively called, “The Irish Potato Famine of 1845 to 1850,” our ex-Jesuit editor writes:
“During this five-year period – with Queen Victoria sitting on the British throne (The Royal Butcheress of Ireland whose Masonic Scotland Yard never caught Walter Richard Sickert, the notorious “Jack the Ripper”), and closely attended by her Jesuit advisors – freighters laden with Irish wheat, oats, barley, eggs, beef and pork were DEPARTING Irish ports en route to other countries, at the rate of about EIGHT FREIGHTERS PER DAY, while nearly one million of my Irish ancestors were starving to death. [In the 1930s the Company would cause Stalin’s Massacre of Orthodox Ukrainians, the so called “Famine in the Ukraine,” ordering Stalin to lock up all the food as millions perished.] In addition to producing another Vatican harvest – the Irish Protestant body count – the ensuing increased Irish emigration provided the Jesuits with a stepped-up flow of Irish Catholics to the United States, to help build within that Protestant nation a blindly obedient Papal fifth column, as an instrument for destroying American constitutional self-government. It worked. [In the 1960s the Jesuits would cause the forced mass emigration of North Vietnamese Catholics to South Vietnam by using Ho Chi Minh to spread the rumor that his Communists were going to kill all the Catholics in North Vietnam. The U.S. Navy, controlled by Cardinal Spellman’s Francis Matthews, provided the vessels for that movement.]” {9})
From 1641 to 1649 – eight long years – the Jesuits continued this murder in Ireland. It was for this reason Oliver Cromwell, the Defender of the Protestant faith, landed in Ireland and demanded the country to surrender. Upon refusing, Cromwell made an example out of the Jesuits’ Catholic Drogheda by breaching its wall and destroying nearly every living thing — men, women and children. (The same was later done to Wexford, which had also killed Protestants.) This never would have happened had not the Jesuits instigated the mass-murder of the Protestants beginning with the Irish Massacre of 1641, having brainwashed the Irish Catholics to hate and kill English and Irish Protestants — men, women and children! Headley writes:
“Cromwell himself attempts no disguise, and in writing to the government on account of it, he says, after speaking of carrying the entrenchments: ‘Being thus entered, we refused them quarter, having the day before summoned the town. I believe we put to the sword the whole number of the defendants [over 2000]. I do not think thirty of the whole number escaped with their lives. Those that did are in safe custody for the Barbadoes . . . I wish that all honest men may give the glory of this to God alone, to whom, indeed, the praise of this mercy [to the Irish Protestants] belongs.’ . . . His

Chaplin, Hugh Peters, took the same view of it, and went to the chief church, where he solemnly offered up thanks to God for the slaughter of his enemies. Parliament also decreed that a day of thanksgiving should be kept in honor of this great mercy. The fate of Drogheda struck the Irish people with dread. The day of vengeance had arrived; and the atrocities they had practiced on the helpless Protestants were now to be visited upon their own heads. Cromwell — resolved to bring the Irish [Jesuit instigated] war to a speedy termination, followed up this victory . . .” {10} [Emphasis added]
Why is it that today, the Irish Protestants of Northern Ireland do not want to lose the protection of the British Army and be given over to the Jesuits’ Sein Fein and the Irish Republican Army (IRA)? Is it not shocking to know that both the Sein Fein and the IRA – aided by certain American Knights of Columbus – work with the Russian Civilian Intelligence (KGB) as revealed by KGB agent Vasili Mitrokhin in The Sword and the Shield? Could it be that the Jesuits also control the KGB?
Of the Jesuit penetration and control of all intelligence as well as the Order’s ultimate doom, Doctor George Brown, Bishop of Christ Church in Dublin, Ireland sagaciously preached a sermon in 1551, a portion of which declares:
“But there is a new fraternity of late sprung up who call themselves Jesuits, which will deceive many, who are much after the Scribes and Pharisees’ manner. Amongst the Jews they shall strive to abolish the truth, and shall come very near to do it. For these sorts will turn themselves into several forms [spiritual shape-shifters]; with the Heathen a Heathenist, with the Atheists an Atheist, with the Jews a Jew [we wonder how many Talmudic Rabbis and Masonic Zionists – such as the late New York Zionist known as “the Jewish Pope,” Rabbi Stephen S. Wise – are secret Jesuits controlling the Zionist government in Israel through the Labor Party for the purpose of securing Jerusalem for the Papal Caesar in Rome], with the Reformers a Reformade [like Billy “Bully” Graham, so accurately described in the recent release, Billy Graham and His Friends, authored by Cathy Burns], purposely to know your intentions, your minds, your hearts, and your inclinations, and thereby bring you at last to be like the fool that ‘said in his heart there was no God.’ These shall spread over the whole world, ‘shall be admitted into the counsels of princes, and they never the wiser’, charming of them, yea, making your princes reveal their hearts, and the secrets therein, and yet they not perceive it; which will happen from falling from the law of God, by neglect of fulfilling the law of God, and by winking at their sins. Yet in the end . . . they shall become odious to all nations: so that at the end they shall be worse than Jews, having no resting-place upon earth; and then shall a Jew have more favour than a Jesuit.” {11} [Emphasis added]

Knowing that the Society of Jesus will never change, could it be that the Jesuits have planned to destroy the Protestants and Baptists of the American Empire? If so, how?
The First Irish Massacre, 1642 #40 The Irish Massacre was incited by the Jesuits on October 23, 1641, the feast day of Ignatius Loyola, and lasted until Oliver Cromwell landed in Drogheda in 1649 to put an end to it. The intended purpose of this conspiracy was to put every Protestant in Ireland to death. This scene depicts forty thousand Bible reading Protestants being sacrificed by the savage and bloodthirsty Papists or Romanists having been brainwashed by the Sons of Loyola into believing that Protestants were “heretics” and had no right to live. Deceptively called “Christians” by their priests, whose allegiance was to the Papal Caesar in Rome, they merely enforced the curses pronounced by the Black Pope’s Council of Trent, it being a reaffirmation of Pope Innocent III’s Fourth Lateran Council of 1215.

Chapter 10 161
We are about to acquaint ourselves with one of the greatest chapters of human history. Its hero was the Puritan freeman and Independent Baptist-Calvinist,
Oliver Cromwell.
The Jesuits, however, have slandered our greatest of heroes branding him “the Usurper,” as well as “a monster, a tyrant and a hypocrite,” and have done all they could do to destroy his memory from English history. Therefore we shall review his astounding life pitted against Romish tyranny.
In 1625 King James I died and his son Charles I came to the throne. But Charles unlike his father became a tool of the Jesuits through the direction of the cruel and merciless Anglican Archbishop William Laud. He violated the Magna Charta and sought to govern as an absolute Monarch. Most of all, he suppressed the right of freedom of conscience by persecuting the Puritans who preached the Bible plan of salvation. Thousands left for America and Cromwell nearly departed England as well. But the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ had decreed that Cromwell should remain and deliver the persecuted Protestants from the designs of the Jesuits.
With King Louis XIII of France (1610-1643) slaughtering the French Huguenots, ruining their Calvinist city of La Rochelle along with the sinking of the Huguenot Fleet via the British Royal Navy on loan to France in 1625, the division between Charles I and the Puritan Parliament ultimately arose in 1642. Both prepared for war. Cromwell, after being defeated in his first battle by Rupert’s horsemen, declared that he would raise a cavalry of,
“ ‘ . . . men who will bring some conscience to what they do, and I promise you they shall not be beaten.’ . . . He thus got around him a body of men who scorned idleness and pleasure; and submitting cheerfully to his rigid discipline, bore privations and toils without a murmur, nay, with enthusiastic pride, for often their gallant leader slept beside them on the cold earth, and shared all their hardships. Fighting under the special protection of heaven, and for God and religion, they would rush to battle as to a banquet and embrace death with rapture . . . and this body of a thousand horse was never beaten.” {2} [Emphasis added]
For he said,
“A few honest men are better than numbers.” {3}
Cromwell’s Puritan cavalry came to be known as the “Ironsides.” They utterly routed Rupert’s finest horsemen at Marston Moor. From that time forward,

Cromwell was regarded as invincible and enjoyed the confidence and love of his soldiers. Cromwell went on to triumph over the Jesuits with their tools, Charles I and the Royalists. The battles of Nasby, Marston Moor, Dunbar, Worcester and charging the breach of Drogheda were all crowned with success, as Cromwell was fighting for freedom of conscience – so hated by the Jesuits and their Council of Trent – while Charles I was fighting for absolute monarchy and Papal supremacy. With the Parliament executing the king for high treason, Cromwell went on to be “the Lord Protector of the British Commonwealth and Defender of the Protestant Faith.” He later dissolved the self-serving Parliament and banished the Jesuits from the kingdom resulting in many conspiracies against his life. In 1654 a plot was discovered and the Jesuits’ would be assassins, Gerard and Vowel, were promptly executed.
Therefore:
“A hundred and sixty brave fellows selected from his different regiments of cavalry, divided into eight companies, became his bodyguard; ten of whom were always on duty about his person. On these he could rely; and unflinching and bold must be the man, and quick the assassin’s knife, that could reach him then.” {4}
Clearly, Cromwell would not be another Admiral Coligny, William I of Orange or Henry IV. Although the Jesuits failed in their many attempts to assassinate The Defender, they managed to cruelly poison his beloved daughter, Elizabeth. We read of her painful suffering and of her father’s despairing heart:
“ . . . the Lady Claypole [Elizabeth Cromwell], his favorite daughter, was taken sick with a fatal and most painful disease. The Protector was forgotten in the father; and hurrying to Hampton Court, he took his place by her bed-side, overwhelmed with sorrow. Her convulsions, and cries of distress, tore his heart-strings asunder, and shook that strong and affectionate nature to its foundations. His kingdom, his power, the Commonwealth, were all forgotten; and for fourteen days he bent over his beloved child . . . ” {5} [Emphasis added]
The Protector went on to lay the foundation of the British possessions in the West Indies and caused the flourishing of the preaching of the gospel while defending freedom of conscience condemned by the Jesuits’ Council of Trent.
“So far did his thoughts reach beyond his age, that he desired and earnestly attempted [but failed] to extend the rights of citizenship to the outcast and persecuted Jews. [Cromwell, the Protector of England and the Defender of the Protestant faith, did however readmit the Jews into England in 1655 upon the formal request of Manasseh ben Israel].” {6}

Chapter 10
Further, he gave the American Colonies a taste of real freedom and protected the Protestants of France. Of Cromwell’s protection of the Vaudois we read:
“In June of this year came the news of the persecutions in the valley of Piedmont. Six Catholic regiments, three of which were Irish, were appointed to drive the Vaudois from their homes in mid-winter. The cruelties, the inhuman barbarity, that marked the proceedings against the poor Protestants, are well known. ‘Villages were burned to the ground; men were hewn in pieces: children’s brains dashed out against the rocks, and women impaled naked — a hundred and fifty females were beheaded, and their heads used in a game of bowls.’ When the news of the atrocities reached Cromwell, he burst into tears — they were the saints of God who thus suffered, and all his compassion was roused within him. On that day (January 3, 1655) he was to sign the treaty with France, which had for a long time been under contemplation; but he immediately refused, declaring that negotiations should proceed no further until the king [Louis XIV, whose Jesuit confessor would later cause him to revoke the Edict of Nantes] and Cardinal Mazarin, the prime minister, would pledge themselves to assist him in saving the Vaudois Protestants . . . A day of fasting and humiliation was appointed, and a collection ordered to be taken in all the churches. The contribution amounted to over 37,000 pounds, showing how deeply Protestant England was stirred by the persecution of the Piedmontese Christians. It is said that Cromwell, in a burst of passion, replied to some obstacles that were mentioned as interfering with his plans, that ‘he would sail his ships over the Alps, but that he would put a stop to the persecution.’ . . . War with France, nay, with the whole world, if necessary, he would wage, but this persecution of the children of God should cease. The king of France at length yielded, and word was sent that the Duke of Savoy had granted an amnesty to the Vaudois, and restored their ancient rights. Mazarin, who, in fact, ruled France, had brought this about, for he stood in deadly fear of Cromwell. It is said that he always turned pale when he heard his name mentioned. Oliver was the champion of Protestantism the world over, and he wished it so understood: he would defend it wherever his arm could reach . . . He also took pains to let the Pope understand, that he knew him to be at the bottom of the unnatural persecution, and if he did not beware, he would see his ships in the harbor of Civita Vecchia, and hear the thunder of his cannon around the Vatican. [It was for this reason that the calculating rage of the Jesuit General would reach our hero through the Protector’s personal physician. Doctor George Bate, while on his deathbed having confessed to his series of mercury poisonings of our beloved example of godliness and zealous English patriotism, was the Serpent who “extirpated the infamous heretic,” Oliver Cromwell. {7} ]

In all his treaties, he made the rights of Protestants an indispensable article. He insisted that English merchants in Portugal should be allowed to worship God in their own way, and compelled France to respect the lives of the Huguenots. The latter called him ‘their only hope next to God.’ . . .
Thus the terror of his name became everywhere a shield for the persecuted Christians, and he was always remembered by them in their morning and evening devotions.” {8} [Emphasis added]
Lastly, the Defender would not tolerate an attack of the Jesuits’ Spanish Inquisition against any Englishman.
“To such gigantic stature of power did this dismal institution attain, that no one was safe from its fangs . . . Llorente gives several cases of English merchants, who were pounced upon by it in defiance to the law of nations. On one occasion Oliver Cromwell had to intercede for an English consul, whom they had got into their dens. The king replied, he had no power over the inquisition. ‘Then,’ added Cromwell, in a second message, ‘if you have no power over the inquisition, I will declare war against it.’ . . . Cromwell . . . menaced war on the inquisition — and the menace was heard to the lowest depths of its infernal dens.” {9}[Emphasis added]
The rise of Cromwell, the Defender of the Protestant Faith was no coincidence. It was the answer to the prayers of Queen Elizabeth. We read her petition to the Lord before her battle with the Spanish Armada:
“O let Thine enemies know that Thou hast received England, which they most of all for Thy gospel’s sake do malign, into Thine own protection. Set a wall about it, O Lord, and evermore mightily defend it. Let it be a comfort to the afflicted, a help to the oppressed, and a defense to Thy church and people, persecuted abroad . . . ” {10} [Emphasis added]
Yes, the Queen’s request was mightily answered in the person of an unlettered farmer and Puritan commoner:
“With no knowledge of the art of war, but much of himself, of men and of the Bible, this stout English squire had made up his mind in no hasty or factious spirit to draw the sword against his king, and venture his life for what he believed with his whole heart and soul to be the cause of ‘freedom and the truth in Christ.’ ” {11}

Chapter 10 165
This honest man of God,
“ . . . through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises . . . escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.”
– Hebrews 11:33, 34
For, Oliver Cromwell
“ . . . had risked his life in open war with the sovereign power of England, and his life a thousand times on the battle-field; who had placed his foot on the neck of a king; broken up parliament at the pike’s point, and dissolved it by his imperial word; boldly assumed all the power the title of king could confer; laid his hand on the very chieftains who surrounded him at Naseby, Marston Moor, Dunbar, and Worcester, and quartered his troops in almost every town in England; — this man . . . had performed the boldest acts ever planned by the human intellect or exerted by a human arm . . . ” {12}
And how so?
“On one occasion, while looking at some statues of famous men, he turned to a friend and said,
‘Make mine kneeling, for thus I came to glory.’ ” {13}
Further, as the Lord seems to do His greatest works in responding to the persistent prayers of righteous women having trusted Him, pitifully and helplessly laying bare their hearts before the One “who gathers the wind in His fists,” Israel has known her greatest deliverers. Joseph, Samson, Samuel and the returning Messiah Jesus are but a few. True to form, the greatest Gentile Deliverer of the Lord’s Bible-reading Church during this “dispensation of grace,” we find Oliver Cromwell deeply moved by his prayerful mother. As she lay dying, he at her side, we see England’s greatest Chieftain, the Reformation’s greatest Champion and the Father of the British Empire broken to shivers as she utters her last words:
“ ‘The Lord cause His face to shine upon you,’ she said; ‘and comfort you in all your adversities; and enable you to do great things for the Glory of the Most High God, and to be a relief to His people. My dear son, I leave

my heart with thee. Good Night!’ and closing her eyes, she breathed forth her spirit to the God who gave it. Cromwell gazed a moment on her pallid features, and then burst into a flood of tears. What a picture does he, the Lord-Protector of England – the hero of so many battle-fields – the resolute, iron-willed man, present, weeping beside his aged mother.” {14} [Emphasis added]
This good and great man, the most maligned actor on the stage of modern history, crowned his success with the Reformation’s greatest victory over the gates of hell. The Protector boldly expelled the Jesuits from his kingdom and those who dared to remain he hunted them down like the traitors they were! Praise God!
“But while the enemies of peace and order at home were made to feel the invincible power of his government, it was in his relations with foreign states that the commanding genius of Oliver was most conspicuously displayed. No Monarch ever so sustained in the eyes of Europe the majesty of British power. The grand object of his foreign policy was to unite the Protestant states, with Britain at their head, in a defensive league against Popery [and the Jesuits], then as now [1903] the enemy of civil and religious liberty.” {15} [Emphasis added]
(Two hundred years later Luther’s Germany would be blessed with a similar champion of Protestantism and the hero responsible for the expulsion of the Jesuits from the Second German Empire. He would be the “Iron Chancellor,” Otto von Bismarck, known for his political struggle with Rome called “the Kulturkampf,” waged from 1872 to 1887, which he ultimately lost! Had this German hero persecuted the Jewish Race within the Empire in accordance with the supposed anti-Jewish writings of Luther – falsely imputed to our great Reformer by Jesuits and popularized by the Order’s Fabian Socialist, Will Durant, with his revisionist histories – there would have been no need for Hitler and the Nazi Party.)
The Jesuits had been taken in their own snare. The attempt to make King Charles Stuart I an absolute Roman Catholic Monarch provoked the Puritan Revolution, producing the greatest archenemy of Jesuitism to date. They could not openly assassinate the Lord Protector nor thwart his foreign policy, which flew in the face of the Council of Trent. Imagine the rage of the Jesuit General!
But the Order “never forsakes nor forgets”; therefore, it patiently awaited Cromwell’s death after he was poisoned by his doctor, restored the Stuarts in 1660 and made Protestant Scotland “to howl” for twenty-eight years, King Charles II slaughtering in excess of 17,000 Covenanters. Both Charles II and the Jesuit James II turned their courts into houses of prostitution – like the Papal Caesar’s Vatican Palace and Bill Clinton’s White House – and sunk England in vice and corruption.

Although the Jesuits dug up Cromwell’s body, dragged it through the streets of London, cut off its head and set it on a spire of Westminster Abbey, they could never undo his defense of Protestantism which led to the establishment of Rome’s greatest antagonist, her most fearless and resolute of spiritual and political enemies the Protestant British Empire – whose missionaries would take the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ to the ends of the earth.

For the risen Son of God used his Protector of Biblical faith to inspire America’s Puritan Revolution led by our hero, George Washington. The Life of Oliver Cromwell, J. T.

Revocation of the Edict of Nantes Protestants Murdered and Expelled from France
“No man has a right to choose his religion. Catholicism is the most intolerant of creeds. It is intolerance itself. We might as rationally maintain that two and two does not make four as the theory of Religious Liberty. Its impiety is only equaled by its absurdity.” {1}
John Hughes, 1864 Archbishop of New York Vigorous Defender of the Pope’s Temporal Power
In 1598 King Henry IV issued the Edict of Nantes granting religious liberty to the Protestants of France. This act infuriated the Jesuits as it opposed their Council of Trent. As we have discovered in a previous chapter, the king paid for this with his life; he was stabbed in the chest by a Jesuit-controlled assassin, Francois Ravaillac.
Determined to implement their foreign policy – the evil Council of Trent – the Jesuits sought to abolish the Edict of Nantes. The result would be the purging of France of its “heretic” Protestants. Their tool for this heart-breaking injustice was the immoral “Sun King,” Louis XIV, whose belief in Rome’s works salvation drove him to murder the innocent: he was a spiritual captive at the feet of his confessor.
In understanding the cause of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes we must review the famous intercepted letter written by the king’s Jesuit confessor, Pere La Chaise, to Priest Peters, the Jesuit confessor of England’s corrupted King James II — who ultimately died in the palace of his cousin, King Louis XIV. We read his measured words with shocking unbelief, as they reflect the calculating coldness of the Council of Trent carried out by this, yet another, heartless Son of Loyola:
“It cost me many threats and promises, before I could bring it thus far, our King being a long time very unwilling. But at last I got him on the hip, for he had lain with his daughter-in-law, for which I would by no means give him absolution, till he had given me an instrument under his own hand and seal, to sacrifice all the heretics in one day. Now, as soon

as I had my desired commission, I appointed the day when this should be done; and in the meantime made ready some thousands of letters to be sent into all parts of France in one post night . . . And many a time since, when I have had him at confession, I have shook hell about his ears, and made him sigh, fear, and tremble, before I would give him absolution. Nay, more than that, I have made him beg for it on his knees before I would consent to absolve him.” {2} [Emphasis added]
Hislop, in describing the psychology of control used by the Jesuit, continues:
“In the confessional, when they have an object to gain, they make the sins and transgressions good weight; and then, when they have a man of influence, or power, or wealth to deal with, they will not give him the slightest hope till round sums of money, or the founding of an abbey, or some other object on which they have set their heart, be cast into the other scale. In the famous letter of Pere La Chaise, the confessor of Louis XIV of France, giving an account of the method which he adopted to gain the consent of that licentious Monarch to the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, by which such cruelties were inflicted on his innocent Huguenot subjects, we see how the fear of the scales of St. Michael operated in bringing about the desired result: – ‘many a time since,’ says the accomplished Jesuit, referring to an atrocious sin of which the king had been guilty, ‘many a time since, when I have had him at confession, I have shook hell about his ears, and made him sigh, fear and tremble, before I would give him absolution. By this I saw that he had still an inclination to me, and was willing to be under my government; so I set the baseness of the action before him by telling the whole story, and how wicked it was, and that it could not be forgiven till he had done some good action to BALANCE that, and expiate the crime. Whereupon he at last asked me what he must do. I told him that he must root out all heretics from his kingdom.’ This was the ‘good action’ to be cast into the scale of St. Michael the Archangel, to ‘BALANCE’ his crime. The king, wicked as he was – sore against his will – consented; the ‘good action’ was cast in, the ‘heretics’ were extirpated; and the king was absolved.” {3} [Emphasis added]
So the Edict was revoked, the Huguenots lost their religious liberty and the protection of French law.
“Let us see what the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes involved. The demolition of all the remaining Protestant Temples throughout France, and the entire proscription of the Protestant religion; the prohibition of

even private worship under penalty of confiscation of body and property; the banishment of all Protestant pastors from France within fifteen days; the closing of all Protestant schools; the prohibition of parents to instruct their children in the Protestant faith; the injunction upon them, under a penalty of five hundred livres in each case, to have their children baptized by the parish priest, and brought up in the Roman Catholic religion, the confiscation of the property and goods of all Protestant refugees who failed to return to France within four months; the penalty of the galleys for life to all men, and of imprisonment for life to all women, detected in the act of attempting to escape from France.” {4}
Then the fanatical Jesuits with their French soldiers, called “the Dragonnade,” fulfilled the bloody Jesuit Oath and Council of Trent once again, shedding innocent blood throughout France. Of the bloodthirsty Dragonnade we read:
“The dragons entered the houses with drawn swords, shouting ‘kill, kill or become Catholics.’ The scenes of brutal outrage, which occurred during these dragonnades, can not be described. These soldiers were among the roughest, loosest, cruelest of men. They suspended their victims with ropes, blowing tobacco-smoke into their nostrils and mouths, and practicing upon them a hundred other nameless cruelties . . . These infamous wreckers took a pleasure in maltreating women. They beat them with whips; they struck them on the face with canes in order to disfigure them; they dragged them by their hair in the mud and over the stones . . . Great was the rejoicing of the Jesuits on the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes.” {5}
Chiniquy, a French Canadian and one of our heroes, concludes:
“It was to obey those bloody laws that Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes, caused the death of half a million of men, women and children, who perished in all the highways of France, and caused twice that number to die in the land of exile, where they had found a refuge.” {6}[Emphasis added]
Ridpath agrees:
“The regions where the Huguenot population predominated were reduced to a desolation, and it is estimated that France by her frightful barbarity to her own people lost fully half a million of her most industrious inhabitants . . . [Does this not sound like the Purges under Jesuit-trained Joseph Stalin and CIA tool Mao Tse-tung?]” {7} [Emphasis added]

Chapter 11 171
The result of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes was over one hundred years of Jesuit suppression of the Protestant faith in France! (Many Huguenots would come to America and settle in English Carolina — North and South Carolina. One of our Founding Fathers was a descendant of these persecuted French Calvinists. A contributor to The Federalist Papers and our first Chief Justice, he was the learned and great John Jay!) But, like in the Jesuits’ Communist Russia and Communist China, the Bible-believing Protestant and Baptist Churches continued underground until the Jesuit General used his French Revolution to punish the disobedient Pope and Roman Catholic Monarchs of Europe for abolishing his Society of Jesus.
“Although Protestantism seemed to be utterly stamped out in France during the century which followed the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes – although its ministers were banished, its churches and schools suppressed; and it was placed entirely beyond the pale of the law – it nevertheless continued to have an acted existence . . . for the Protestants, after the Revocation, constituted a sort of underground church, regularly organized, though its meetings were held by night in forests, in caves among the hills, or in unsuspected places even in the heart of large towns and cities, in all parts of France.” {8}
Dear truth-seeker, what is the difference between France under the Revocation and Russia and China under Communism in their treatment of Protestant and Baptist Bible-believers? Nothing! For as we shall see, their masters are the same — those vile, heartless and murderous Sons of Loyola!
Dear truth-seeker, do you see why America’s founding fathers, the Baptist-Calvinist Virginian patriots being James Madison and George Mason in particular, insisted upon a Bill of Rights to secure Protestant and Baptist liberties from federal abridgement? Do you see why certain of our Southern, anti-federalist, Bible believing founding fathers wanted neither the Roman Catholic Hierarchy nor the English Anglican Hierarchy, both brotherhoods then and now being overseen and infested with Jesuits, to govern us Americans with unrestrained, absolute power through our duly constituted Federal Government? Has Washington, D.C., our national capital, degenerated into what our founding fathers feared what it might become as declared during the federalist and anti-federalist debates, namely “Rome on the Potomac?” (In 1888 Justin D. Fulton released his masterpiece, Washington In The Lap of Rome, fully substantiating the fears of our Southern Founding Fathers!)
If a French King – Louis XIV – could revoke Protestant liberty with an “edict” could not an American President, operating under the Emergency War Powers Act of 1950 as the Commander-in-Chief, do the same with an “executive order”? Would the Jesuits attempt to do the same thing in the United States if all the guns were registered then confiscated just as they did in Nazi Germany?

Pere La Chaise, 1624 – 1709 #42 Jesuit Confessor to King Louis XIV, 1675 - 1709 Louis XIV, King of France, 1643 - 1715 Words cannot describe the diabolical infamy of this evil and sinister man. Living in wealth and splendor, he used Rome’s cruel doctrine of “salvation by works” to force King Louis XIV, surnamed “the Sun King,” to revoke King Henry IV’s Edict of Nantes, having granted freedom of worship, and thereby destroyed the most productive and cultivated people of France, the Calvinist Huguenots. La Chaise’s enforcement of the Papal Caesar’s evil Council of Trent fueled French resentment for priestly tyranny, which later erupted into the Revolution of 1789 — secretly directed by the Order. The atheism, socialism and immorality of the French today is largely the result of this perfidious Jesuit and his devilish master, the Black Pope. History of the Jesuits, G. B.

Communist Reductions in Paraguay
“The Society may also advantageously traffic under the borrowed names of some rich merchants [Shriner Freemasons and Knights of Malta], our friends; but never without a prospect of certain and abundant gain; and this may be done even to the Indies, which hitherto, by the bountiful favor of God, have furnished us not only with souls, but also plenteously supplied our coffers with wealth.” {1}
Ignatius Loyola, 1540 Founder, 1st Jesuit General, 1540-1556 Secret Instructions of the Jesuits
“I find almost the whole wealth of Central America in the hands of the Jesuits, and the property they hold in heads of cattle [“the Father of the Cattle Business” being Arizona Jesuit Eusebio Kino] and sheep is something truly enormous . . . and they have succeeded in a word to bring to such a height their power and riches that the secular clergy will soon be compelled to beg their bread from the Jesuits.” {2} [Emphasis added]

In fact, their form of a republic was nothing else

This chapter is most important as it will be proven that the Jesuits are the true authors of socialist-communism. The economic system of the Dark Ages was feudalism consisting of the few rich landowners and the many poor peasants. It was “a sin” to make a profit by anyone other than the feudal lords. Thus, if the world is to be returned to the Dark Ages, the White Protestant Middle Class must be destroyed. Socialist-Communism accomplishes this, having yielded its bitter fruit in both Great Britain and the United States.
The great deception is that the Jews are the authors of communism. (After all, is not Zionism Jewish communism?) The facts are that the Jesuits used their Masonic Jews to introduce it in 1848 with the Second French Revolution (Marx), and again in 1917 with the Bolshevik Revolution (Lenin). Several years later, in 1933, the Jesuits then moved their Shriner Freemason, Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR), to recognize Russia’s bloody government. The Order then financed Russian communism with its Knights of Malta on Wall Street. This enabled Joseph Stalin, “the Grand Inquisitor,” to carry out the purges of the Thirties. Having deceived the world into believing communism was of Jewish origin, the Jesuits then used Hitler to implement “the Final Solution to the Jewish Question” pursuant to the evil Council of Trent. The result was the mass-murder of European and Russian Jewry at the hands of the Jesuit-controlled, Nazi “Schutzstaffel” (SS).
At the close of the Second Thirty Years’ War (1945) the Jesuits, with their Vatican Ratline, helped hundreds of top Nazis to escape to South America. And where in South America? To the old dominion where socialist-communism had been perfected by the Jesuit fathers — to the nation of Paraguay.
The Jesuits – 1600 - 1750



178 Vatican Assassins
The Jesuits entered Paraguay in the early 1600s, sent by the kings of Spain and Portugal. They established their supremacy over the natives called “Guarani Indians” and did not allow them to mix with the Spanish or Portuguese. It was among this people that the Jesuits established their communes called “Reductions.” R. W. Thompson writes:
“The unsuspecting Indians were easily seduced by acts of kindness, and the result was that, in the course of a brief period, they succeeded in establishing a number of what were called Reductions – or, more properly speaking, villages – with multitudes of Indians assembled about them; the whole aggregating, in the end, several hundred thousand. These constituted the Jesuit State, and were all, by the mere ceremony of baptism, brought under Jesuit dominion.” {6}
The “Commune” or “Reduction” was kept in order by a system of spying.
“ . . . each Reduction was governed by a Jesuit father, supported by a vicar and a curate as assistants, but whose chief duty was espionage.” {7}
This is important as Rome’s socialist-communist Reduction of the United States is also kept in order by a system of spying, carried out by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and National Security Agency (NSA). (Vincent M. Cannistraro, the former CIA anti-terrorism chief under Knight of Malta William J. Casey, is now the Vatican’s security advisor in 2002.) And this system of spying will be greatly increased due to the New York Archbishop Cardinal Egan’s CFR/CIA September 11th attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
The Commune, called by the Jesuits a “republic,” gave the appearance that it was self-governing. It was a republic in form but a monarchy in power controlled by the Jesuit General in Rome.
“At each Reduction the natives were allowed to select a secular magistry, with limited and unimportant powers over such temporal affairs as could be intrusted to them without impairing the theocratic feature of the Government. It was in everything pertaining to the management of public affairs an absolute monarchy, with all its powers centered in the general at Rome, whose authority was accepted as equal to that of God, and to whose command obedience was exacted from all.” {8} [Emphasis added]
(This also is important, as the Protestant-Calvinist republic of George Washington, with express and limited powers delegated to the Federal government, was an abomination to the Jesuit Order:
The Jesuits – 1600 - 1750



Chapter 12 179
“For the Vatican condemned the Declaration of Independence [based on the Presbyterian Mechlenberg Declaration of 1775, not on the writings of the Jesuit Robert Cardinal Bellarmine (1640)] as ‘wickedness’ . . . and called the Constitution of the United States ‘a Satanic document’. ” {9}
So the Order with its “Radical Red Republican party” forced the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868. This converted Washington’s republic into a Jesuit republic — a republic in form but a monarchy in power.)
The status of the natives was one of equality and the economic system was socialist-communism. And of course, each Reduction had a common treasury or central bank. We read:
“ . . . universal equality prevailed. The principles of socialism or communism – very much as now understood [1894] – governed all the Reductions. Everything necessary to the material comfort and prosperity of the Indians was in common. Each family had a portion of land set apart for cultivation. They also learned trades, and many of them, both men and women, became experts. But the earnings of the whole were deposited in common storehouses at each Reduction, and distributed by the Jesuits in such portions to each individual as necessity required . . . Suffrage was universal, but ‘the sanction of the Jesuits was necessary to the validity of the election.’ ” {10} [Emphasis added]
(Dear truth-seeker, is this not how the people of the United States are governed today? Marx’s ten planks of The Communist Manifesto, having spawned over fifty revolutions in Europe, are in full force. We have a privately owned central bank called the “Federal Reserve Bank.” An annual income tax is collected from “each according to his ability” and redistributed to “each according to his need,” thereby destroying the White Protestant Middle Class. The sanction of the Jesuits, in control of the Council on Foreign Relations, is necessary to the validity of our “elections.” Politically, women are equal with men and we are oppressed with “one man, one vote.” We have no “lawful money” which is real wealth, as President Roosevelt and President Johnson took our gold and silver coins out of circulation and created the supremacy of monopoly money — the bogus notes of the Federal Reserve Bank.)
One last trait of the Jesuit republic must be noted. Through its police state the Jesuits destroyed true manhood.
“In order to teach the confiding Indians that obedience to authority was their chiefest duty, they were subjected to rules of conduct and intercourse which were enforced with the strictest severity. They were watched in everything, the searching eyes of the Jesuits being continually upon them.
The Jesuits – 1600 - 1750

They constituted, in fact, a state of society reaching the Jesuit ideal completely; that is, docile, tractable, submissive, obedient, without the least real semblance of manhood. Having thus completed their subjugation, energetic measures were adopted to render any change in their condition
impossible.” {11}
(Dear truth-seeker, I must comment! Is this not the America of 2003? As a nation, we no longer read the Bible of the Protestant Reformation — The Authorized King James Version of 1611, the edition of 1769. As a result, there are no longer any Calvinists who would use “the Sword of Just Defense” against a Jesuit-controlled tyranny. Therefore, we Americans live in a police state and are watched and tracked in everything we do through the use of the “date of birth” and “social security number.” The eyes of the FBI and CIA are continually upon us — like the KGB in Russia. And like the Guarani Indians, the vast majority of American men are submissive and obedient, docile and effeminate, “without the least real semblance of manhood” thanks to the use of fluoride and amalgam fillings by the American Dental Association (ADA) along with synthetic estrogens, toxic chemicals and vaccinations by the American Medical Association (AMA) and cartel corporate farmers.)
“The Jesuit Republic,” composed of over thirty Paraguayan Reductions, was in fact a vast, commercial empire on which were laboring over two hundred thousand slaves. E. Boyd Barrett, an Irish ex-Jesuit, tells us:
“The Jesuits, as it is well known, held very large regions of Paraguay under missionary control from 1650 to 1750. More than a quarter million natives worked under their [absolutist] direction, and no payment was made directly to them. . . . They were educated, trained, housed, clothed, fed and, to some extent, amused, but what became of the surplus profits of their labours, and of the extensive trading that was carried on? Over two thousand boats are said to have been engaged in carrying merchandise and goods on the Parana River; and the economic value of the Reductions was beyond doubt very great: so great indeed as to have awakened the envy of Spanish and Portuguese traders. Robertson estimated that the reductions represented at least $25,000,000 capital for the Society.” {12}
Further, the Order’s commercial empire extended north through Central America to include all of Mexico. Again our ex-Jesuit writes:
“The most dramatic testimony to Jesuit ‘avidity and eagerness for earthly goods’ is contained in a letter from the Venerable Bishop Palafox of Los Angeles [Mexico] to [Pope] Innocent X [who had fully approved of the Jesuits’ continuing Irish Massacre commenced in 1641] dated May 25, 1647. It treats the wealth of the Mexican Jesuits of that time.

‘Most Holy Father:
I found almost all the wealth, all immovables, and all the treasures of this Province of America in the hands of the Jesuits, who still possess them. Two of their colleges have 300,000 sheep, without counting the small flocks; and whilst almost all the Cathedral Churches and all the Orders together have hardly three sugar refineries, the Society has six of the largest. One of these refineries is valued at more than half a million thalers; and this single province of the Jesuits, which however only consists of ten colleges, possesses, as I have just said, six of these refineries, each of which brings in one hundred thousand thalers yearly. Besides this they have cornfields of enormous size. Also they have silver mines, and if they continue to increase their power and wealth as they have done up to now, the secular clergy will become their sacristans and the laymen their stewards, while the other Orders will be forced to collect alms at their doors. All this property and all these considerable revenues which might make a sovereign powerful, serve no other purpose than to maintain ten colleges [military fortresses]...To this may be added the extraordinary skill with which they make use of and increase their super-abundant wealth. They maintain public warehouses, cattlefairs, butchers-stalls, and shops. They send part of their goods by way of the Philippine Islands to China. They lend out their money for usury, and thus cause the greatest loss and injury to others.’ ” {13} [Emphasis added]
Dear truth-seeker, “the Jesuit Republic” of South America became the model for “the Jesuit Republic” of North America. The thirty Reductions in Paraguay from 1600 to 1750 have become the model for the fifty States of Fourteenth Amendment America from 1868 to (the present) 2003. Both “republics” were established by super cartel-capitalists – the Jesuits – who then implemented the economic system of the Dark Ages — feudal socialist-communism. As always, cartel-capitalists and socialist-communists work together! Like Paraguay, Fourteenth Amendment America functions as a vast commercial empire, the Jesuits controlling all the wealth and reaping all the profits from their multinational corporations. Like the Guarani Indians, we American people are slaves; for, after being “educated, trained, housed, clothed, fed and amused,” we Americans have nothing! Like Paraguay, the commercial power of Fourteenth Amendment America has been harnessed by the Jesuit Order and has been used to finance Great Wars furthering Loyola’s Counter-Reformation while destroying Luther’s Protestant Reformation!
Should those of us who believe the Bible to be the final rule of faith and practice continue to be used to such evil ends? Should our preachers continue to remain mute in the face of such grand theft and Anti-Christian tyranny?

Finally, the Jesuits, in keeping the natives ignorant and enslaved, taught them to hate and kill White men and so keep the existence of the Reductions a secret from the sovereigns of Europe. Portugal issued the following statement of grievances:
“That [the Jesuits] had under them thirty-one great populations, producing immense riches to the society, while the people themselves were kept in the most miserable slavery; that no Spaniard or Portuguese, were he even governor or bishop, was ever admitted into the Reductions; that ‘with strange deceit,’ the Spanish language was absolutely forbidden; that the Indians were trained to an unlimited, blind obedience, kept in the most ‘extraordinary ignorance,’ and the most insufferable slavery ever known, and under a complete despotism as to body and soul; that they did not know there was any other sovereign in the world than the fathers, and knew nothing of the king, or any other law than the will of the ‘holy fathers,’ that the Indians were taught that white laymen adored gold, had a devil in their bodies, were the enemies of the Indians, and of the images which they adored; that they were consequently taught to kill white men wherever they could find them, and to be careful to cut off their heads, lest they should come to life again.” {14}
(As an aside, did not the cult of the Black Muslims originate in the Jesuit-controlled city of Chicago? Are not the Black Muslims taught hatred for the “sub-human” White man? Was not the late Black Muslim, Khallid Abdul Muhammad, America’s Black Hitler, hating both the White and Jewish races? Are not the Black Muslims taught that all White men are “white blue-eyed devils”? Do not the Black Muslims have a private army called “the Fruit of Islam” for the purpose of conducting an American race war pursuant to the wishes of its mulatto leader, Louis Farrakhan? Would not a race war (its preview being the Nation of Islam’s Zebra Killings during the 70s, the Mau Mau butchery in Africa led by the Jesuits’ Jomo Kenyatta during the 1950s, and now Black-on-White gang rape and murder in Nelson Mandela’s South Africa his release from prison secured by African Knight of Malta, Abukuse V.

used and would ultimately be interned in concentration camps? Could it be this is one of the reasons why he left the cult and founded his own movement resulting in his assassination? Could it be that Betty, the wife of Malcolm X, told the truth, that her husband was murdered by the leaders of the Nation of Islam in conjunction with the high command of the FBI, the Bureau in 1965 under the control of a White, apostate Presbyterian and homosexual, thirty-third degree Freemason, J. Edgar Hoover? Was not Hoover the bosom friend of the homosexual American Pope, Cardinal Spellman, educated by and having been the great patron of the Society of Jesus? As we can see, the Black Muslim cult bears all the marks of Jesuit control including rabid, anti-Jewish and anti WASP/Baptist fury; its Masonic leader, Louis Farrakhan (the personal friend of Jesuit Temporal Coadjutor Fidel Castro), notoriously distributes the Jesuits’ Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion – even though his violin teacher is Jewish – while promoting hatred for the Reformation’s English King James Bible of 1611 pursuant to the wishes of his master, the Archbishop of Chicago.) In casting further light on the assassination of Malcolm X in 1965, a private letter was received by the author from a brilliant and former associate of the Black Muslims, he having realized Rome’s control of the movement through Black Freemasonry of the Prince Hall Rite. In moving me to tears as he applied a healing balsam to some of my old wounds, he bravely declared after forty years of study and involvement:
“Elijah Muhammad was a Mason. (Many members of the Nation of Islam were/are Masons belonging to the Prince Hall Rite.) His son [Imam] Wallace (Warith) [Deen] as well as [Louis] Farrakhan and Jesse Jackson are Masons. Farrakhan [presently involved in mutual “worship” with his brother Shriner Freemason, “the White blue-eyed devil” and pastor of the Crystal Cathedral, Robert H. Schuller] was involved in Malcolm’s assassination. He betrayed him knowing that he was going to be killed. His role was that of a supervisor. He made sure the job was carried out. Wallace [Deen Muhammad] (Elijah Muhammad’s son) also knew about his father’s plans. His jealousy of Malcolm prevented him from warning him. He really wanted Malcolm out of the way. Based on declassified FBI, State Department, and Military Intelligence records which I have obtained a number of years ago, Wallace was/is the hand picked stooge of the FBI/Vatican. He was a government informant for the FBI as early as 1963-64. As for the thugs who were convicted of killing Malcolm, Thomas Johnson, Norman Butler and [Talmadge] Hayer are now free men. Hayer said the other two were not involved. This is a lie. I have personally spoken to an eyewitness who was present in Auburn Correctional Facility in 1972-1973 when Talmadge Hayer and Thomas Johnson planned their fabricated story. From 1966-1972 not one of the three ever had any contact with each other. It was not until 1971 after the riot at Auburn that a large portion of the inmate population was transferred to other prisons. Then in 1972 the Attica riots took place and

it was then that Hayer was moved to Auburn. They were indeed the killers. However, there were others also involved who were on the scene as well as other conspirators, and the main culprit who gave the orders, Pope Paul VI (G. [Giovanni] Batista [Battista] Montini) was the first Pope to ever visit the U.S. . . . I hope I did not bore you with all this. In any event I am honored to be of service in this cause. Let me say I have been at this for more than forty years. I don’t take this lightly and the seriousness of all this can never be overstated.” {15}
As the Jesuits taught the native peoples of color hatred for the White race on their Reductions in Paraguay, even so they teach it now to the Blacks in their American Empire through the Press, the Jesuit Theatre (Hollywood) and the Nation of Islam. (Islam has been highly embraced by the angry Blacks of the North as opposed to the Bible-believing Blacks of the historic Old South – as they have been victimized for over one hundred years by the majority White Roman Catholics controlling the cold Northern cities.) R. E. McMaster, Jr. writes concerning Islam:
“The Blacks particularly . . . are being played for suckers by the centralizing planners of this country. . . . too many Black minority groups have been conned into accepting the slavery of the dole . . . resulting from the government’s welfare handout. Some Blacks have further been deceived into adopting the religion of [three quarters of] the slave traders who ruthlessly abused their ancestry — the Muslim religion. {16}
For the Nation of Islam is the Jesuit General’s North American Masonic Black Terrorist Network intricately tied to the General’s International Islamic Terrorist Network (created by Order’s CIA via Operation Cyclone) headquartered in the Shriner Masonic House of Saud’s deliberately created oil monopoly, Saudi Arabia. And that wicked Wahhabi Islamic Terrorist Network is presently being financed by the trillionaire King of Saudi Arabia, Fahd bin Abdul Aziz Al-Saud. Any honorable Black man resisting and exposing this scenario will be threatened or silenced – permanently – unless he is protected by the risen Son of God who is the King of the Jews, the Lord Jesus Christ! Such was the Jesuit state of Paraguay from 1600 to 1750. Such is the Jesuit state of the Fourteenth Amendment “Holy Roman” American Empire from 1868 to the present (2003). God the Father had decreed, however, that the Guarani Indians should be delivered from their invincible Jesuit masters. Therefore, the risen Son of God sent a man and the Jesuits
“ . . . encountered an adversary of whose courage and capacity they had not the least conception, and whom they found, in a brief period, capable of inflicting a death-blow upon the society. This was Sebastian Cavalho, Marquis of Pombal, who was [a Freemason and] the chief counselor of the Portuguese king [Joseph I].” {17} [Emphasis added]

The Guarani Reductions, 1600 - 1750 #47 These secret and evil socialist-communist Reductions, known today as “Communes” or “Kibbutzim,” produced untold wealth for the Order using hundreds of thousands of slaves, “collecting from each according to his ability and giving to each according to his need.” This wealth in turn was used to finance the many occult stratagems of the Order. The lessons learned on these Platonic Republics provided the groundwork for Marx’s The Communist Manifesto by which every nation on earth would be reduced to a Guarani Reduction, thereby destroying the White Protestant Middle Classes of Northern Europe and Western Civilization. In restoring the communal Feudalism of the Dark Ages known as “the World’s Midnight,” the Order would submit the world to the rule of Rome’s bold Papal Caesar.

The Layout of a Reduction, 1600 – 1750 #48 The Order’s utopian Reductions upon which socialist-communism was perfected included central banks called “storehouses,” universal equality and universal male and female labor. The goods produced by this slave labor were put into international trade with the Order’s huge fleet of “Blackships.” Benefiting the Jesuit cartel capitalists in financing their wars of annihilation against Protestant cultures, the Reductions bear a striking resemblance to the Concentration and Death Camps of the Black Pope’s Nazi Third Reich in fulfilling the Council of Trent. Presently, the profits generated from the slave labor of the Order’s many Communist Reductions in the Far East are financing the building of Red China’s huge navy intending to invade “heretic and liberal” North America, filled with refugees, Jews and apostate Bible-rejecting Protestants and Baptists.

Malcolm Little, alias “Malcolm X,” 1925 – 1965
Unknowingly controlled by the Order through the mulatto and “the honorable” Elijah Muhammad – the absolute Masonic dictator of the Nation of Islam (NOI) who was the obedient servant of the White Archbishop of Chicago, Albert Cardinal Meyer and later John Cardinal Cody – Malcolm bore all the marks of a Jesuit agitator including his detestation of Jews, White Anglo Saxon Protestants, the U.S. Constitution and the King James Bible. Surnamed “Big Red” due to his reddish-brown hair inherited from a White forefather, Malcolm’s racial views had been born out of deplorable crimes of White Catholic and White Masonic violence, including intolerable, hate-filled racism experienced in the Northern, Mafia-dominated, Jesuit-controlled, White Roman Catholic cities of Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York and Washington, D.C., as well as the Second Ku Klux Klan’s gruesome murder of his father, Earl Little — an influential Baptist preacher and an outspoken advocate of Marcus Garvey’s Back-to-Africa Movement. In opposition to the Jesuit Order’s intended plan for a totally integrated North America thereby destroying the “heretic and liberal” White races, both Garvey and Malcolm seriously pursued the same policy of final separation and repatriation, as did Presidents Jefferson, Monroe and Lincoln. Malcolm advocated that Blacks should break away from Whites either by returning to Africa or by establishing a separate Black North American nation, which indeed is the correct and Biblical solution to the Black Pope’s international anti-White, Negro Agitation! Upon publicizing Elijah Muhammad’s fathering of nine illegitimate children to six teenage girls, and for exposing the collusion between the NOI and KKK leaders, whose cooperative extremism in creating “collective guilt” among all Whites – cunningly calculated to unite Catholics and Protestants pursuant to the ecumenical doctrines of the Second Vatican Council while destroying the God-given preference to one’s own race thus insuring the success of the Civil Rights Movement –, Malcolm became a threat to the Black Pope’s NOI and was silenced for ninety days. This resulted in his trip to Mecca during which he was carefully watched by Cardinal Spellman’s CIA; he was converted to Orthodox Islam in spite of the brutal enslavement of African Blacks by Arab Muslims for centuries; he ceased to advocate Black separatism; and he finally broke with the NOI’s Masonic leadership which included FBI informers Wallace Muhammad and Louis Farrakhan. The eloquent and independent Malcolm X who was now preaching against the NOI could not be allowed to live, as the genocidal race-mixing plot of the Order’s Socialist-Communist Second Reconstruction, led by the wicked Black Martin Luther (Lucifer) King, Jr., championing the Order’s doctrine of “universal equality” as perfected on the Reductions of Paraguay, could not be allowed to fail again. Therefore Malcolm became another victim of the Order’s Jesuit Oath and “leaden bullet,” savagely shot down on stage at Harlem’s Audubon Ballroom by three NOI assassins, all of whom were aided by Cardinal Spellman’s CIA, FBI and New York police.

Quite correct! My Square and Compass are every way equal to, if not superior to the Authorized Version of the Bible, and will ‘enlighten’ mankind quite as well. Go on, my dear sir! Go on, Bro.

“And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?”
Jesus the Messiah Matthew 12:26
Dear truth-seeker, the relationship between the Jesuits and Freemasonry is important to understand. The Jesuits, in control of the Vatican since 1814, portray Freemasonry as their enemy. This is simply not true. (In Masonic Baltimore, the Jesuits flourish at their prestigious Loyola College of Maryland!) As we shall see, Shriner Freemasonry’s “Invisible Empire” and Jesuitism are friends and work together, as both secret societies desire to rebuild Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem.
The Knights Templars of the Popes’ Crusades were revived in 1717 in Protestant England, having become the present day Freemasons. The Scottish Rites were written by the Jesuits at one of their colleges in France. Why? To restore the Jesuit-controlled House of Stuart to the throne of England. Our Masonic author, William O. Peterson, P.M. 32nd Degree, writes:
“Chevalier de Bonneville [like the Bonneville automobile manufactured by Chevrolet/General Motors] formed a chapter of twenty-five Degrees of the so-called High-Degrees in the College of Jesuits of Clermont, in Paris in 1754. The adherents of the House of Stuart had made the college of Clermont their asylum, they being mostly Scotchmen. One of these Degrees being the “Scottish Master,” the new body organized in Charleston, S.C., in 1801, gave the name of Scottish Rite to these Degrees, which name ever since that time has characterized the Rite all over the world.” {7} [Emphasis added]
Again we read:
“In the matter of the Stuarts we are, however, on firm ground with regard to Freemasonry. That the lodges at the end of the seventeenth century were Royalist is certain, and there seems good reason to believe that, when the [Glorious anti-Jesuit Protestant] revolution of 1688 divided the Royalist cause, the Jacobites who fled to France with [the Jesuit King] James II took Freemasonry with them. With the help of the French they established lodges in which, it is said, Masonic rites and symbols were used to promote the cause of the Stuarts. Thus the land of promise signified Great Britain, Jerusalem stood for London and the murder of Hiram represented the execution of Charles I.” {8}

Chapter 13 193
(Dear truth-seeker, as we shall see, Freemasonry has become a great tool of the Jesuits. It was used to punish the Pope and Monarchs of Europe for suppressing the Jesuit Order. Their tools were Robespierre and Napoleon. When the Jesuits were suppressed, the most powerful Freemason in Europe protected them. He was Frederick the Great of Prussia. When the Jesuits caused the American War Between the States (1861-1865), they used Freemasonry to ignite it. When the Jesuits overthrew the German Kaiser, Wilhelm II (being the foremost protector of the “heretic” Lutheran Church), after World War I, they used Freemasonry to betray him. When the Jesuits destroyed key evidence pointing to more than one gunman in the Kennedy Assassination, they used Shriner Freemasons as their agents — J. Edgar Hoover, Lyndon Johnson, Earl Warren and Gerald Ford in particular.)
Let us now reflect, as our hearts must understand this era of time. The Lord Jesus Christ – to Whom has been given all governing authority in earth – had granted Britain religious and political liberty for the third time. Indeed, the Protestant Revolution of 1688 was glorious; for it drove that Jesuit-controlled savage, James II, out of the country, “who,” in the words of D’Alembert, “was much more fit to be a Jesuit than a king”, it hunted down and drove out the Jesuits as in the greatest days of Elizabeth I and it forever forbade a Catholic to sit on England’s throne. This historic victory of good over evil marked the one hundredth anniversary of the risen Son of God intervening for His English Protestants and Baptists in miraculously sinking the Jesuit General’s Spanish Armada in response to their earnest prayers.
The following year of 1689 was a time of great rejoicing for:
“When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice:”
– Proverbs 29:2
Protestants William III of Orange and Mary of the United Netherlands – the model for George Washington’s United (Protestant) States of America (USA) – were given England’s throne by an act of Parliament. As the Dutch Fleet arrived in England carrying its precious Protestant King, the cheers of the crowds ascended to heaven as the eyes of English freemen beheld the words emblazoned on those mighty sails:
“The Protestant Reformation and the Liberties of the English People.”
Further, a law was passed forbidding any Roman Catholic from ever governing England again. After shedding rivers of blood for over one hundred years, the English people finally put an end to the Jesuit-controlled House of Stuart and its Anti-Christian tyranny. This freedom would last for over one hundred years when, in 1773, the wicked King George III would secretly receive, protect and be advised by the Society of Jesus having been abolished by Pope Clement XIV.

In response to the Lord’s establishment of English liberty in 1689, Satan attempted to secretly undermine it. In 1717 his Jesuit Order revived the Order of the Knights Templars – those bloodthirsty Crusaders – calling it “Freemasonry.” Its purpose was to reestablish English tyranny, restoring the Roman Catholic Stuarts as “divine right Monarchs” subject to the Temporal Power of the Pope. Later in 1754, the Jesuits created Scottish Rite Freemasonry and in 1786 with their Protector, Frederick the Great, centralized all Masonic power with the creation of Shriner Freemasonry. From 1789 to 1815 the Jesuits used this “warhorse” to punish the Roman Catholic Monarchs of Europe and the Papacy, including Pope Clement XIV, Pope Pius VI and Pope Pius VII, for suppressing the Jesuit Order in 1773.
Since the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Satan’s Jesuit General has used Shriner Freemasonry for three purposes. Being keys of understanding, they are:
1. To maintain the Order’s death grip over the Pope, the College of Cardinals and thus the Papacy (controlling the leaders of Roman Catholicism);
2. To destroy the Protestant Reformation while restoring and maintaining the Temporal Power of the Order’s “infallible” Pope over every nation (controlling the leaders of all Protestants including the Orangemen, and pre Protestant “Christian” sects including the Orthodox Church leadership);
3. To gain possession of Jerusalem in order to rebuild Solomon’s Temple, for the Pope, after which every Masonic Lodge is patterned (controlling the leaders of all Islamic sects, including the American Black Muslims, and the leaders of all Judaistic sects including the Orthodox Chief Rabbis).
Years later the Jesuits, using Shriner Freemasonry, would begin a powerful cult in George Washington’s Calvinistic Republic of the United States. The new brotherhood would be called “The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints” Mormonism! Being another salvation-by-works religion (like Roman Catholicism), its founder, Joseph Smith, was a high-level Freemason. His successor, Brigham Young, was also another high Freemason. According to the book Blackrobe, Brigham Young was an intimate friend of Peter De Smet, one of the most powerful American Jesuits of the Nineteenth Century. Being the foremost Jesuit of influence among the Indian Nations, De Smet, using Confederate General and Shriner Freemason Albert Pike, incited his Sioux Indians to mass murder seven hundred White Lutherans of Minnesota (Northerners) while having procured the exemption of Jesuits from the draft during America’s bloodbath, erroneously called “the Civil War.” De Smet personally visited Young on his settlement in the West, furthering “the Mormon agitation.” For the Mormon leaders sought to create their own nation,

and thus were considered so dangerous to our Union by President Abraham Lincoln. Knowing that whatever enterprise the Jesuit Order is involved in, it was either secretly controlled by the Brotherhood from the beginning or its leadership was later subverted, we must ask the question,
“What service does the multi-million dollar, Masonically controlled, Mormon headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah provide for the Jesuit General and his high command?”
Dear truth-seeker, that service is the genealogical record keeping so accurately maintained by the Mormon hierarchy. And for what purpose? The practical, non-religious answer can only be to keep track of the world’s racial Jews enabling the Jesuit General, using his fascist military dictators, to locate, arrest, imprison and murder the physical descendants of the sons of Jacob having yet to inherit the promises given to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and David. The coming international Jewish persecution will be especially bloody inside the world’s greatest haven for the wandering Jews — Fourteenth Amendment America. And the “infallible,” Masonic Mormon Prophet, possibly the present Gordon B. Hinkley, will aid the Jesuit General in this annihilation! The survivors will flee to Zionist Israel to ultimately face the horrifying and ghastly

“ . . . that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.”
– Daniel 7:20
A quote from the past regarding the “Twin Pincers” of Jesuitism and Freemasonry, ruling the Devil’s “Invisible Empire,” is most appropriate for today:
“It is very greatly to be feared that forgetting their petty differences for the time being, both Romanism and Freemasonry would make common cause and stand shoulder to shoulder, the very embodiment of the works of darkness . . . as two such terrible systems united would be well-nigh irresistible.” {9} [Emphasis added]
Dear truth-seeker, these united systems are resistible. If you have turned from your sin upon believing the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, you have been saved and indwelt by the Holy Spirit. He is THE POWER “which worketh in you mightily”! If you “yield yourself” and do not “quench” Him, “grieve” Him or “insult” Him through acts of personal sin and disobedience, His POWER will flow through you and He will do “that which is good in His sight.” “Be of good courage,” sincerely calling upon God your Father “out of a pure heart” in Jesus’ name, as you now have access to His “throne of grace” through “the blood of Christ” in this great time of need for our families, country and community of nations. He will joyously answer your prayers without regard to your race or nationality, as “it is God who hath made us” and “is no respecter of persons.” With all of your might and in all your ways “acknowledge Him and He will direct your paths” as you resist Satan’s “Society of Jesus” (Oh, what blasphemy!) and its greatest tool, Shriner Freemasonry (Oh, what deception!), lest we be consumed by an American, AntiChrist, White Roman Catholic, homosexual-led, Neo-Nazi fascist tyranny (having been purposed against us by the Jesuit General and his Archbishop of New York), before the Lord comes for His Bible-believing Church! May you have confidence in the day of His appearing when, in that memorial moment having been “valiant for the truth in the earth,” your eyes meet His and you hear similar inspiring words,
“Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.”

“ . . . the Jesuit Order at last reached the pinnacle of its power and prestige in the early eighteenth century.

Pope Clement XIV, 1774 Abolished the Society of Jesus with a Papal
Bull titled: Dominus ac Redemptor, 1773
By 1750, the Society of Jesus was composed of the most powerful group of men in the world. They were the confessors of nearly every king in Europe including the Pope. The Jesuit General knew the affairs of every nation and his soldiers were making millions of dollars for the Order. The Reductions produced herbs, hides, tallow, clocks and other goods, which the Jesuits traded in Europe with their huge fleet of ships. The profits were used to finance wars against the Protestant nations they had sworn to destroy. But all this wealth and power was acquired in secret, as the kings of Portugal and Spain knew nothing about the Reductions.
Therefore, upon the discovery of the Reductions, the most powerful Roman Catholic kings of Europe expelled the Jesuits from their dominions. First was King Joseph I of Portugal in 1759 with the help of his great Prime Minister Sebastian Cavalho, Marquis of Pombal. The king’s banishment of the Jesuits reads:
“ . . . in order to protect my royal honour, which is equally the life and soul of the whole monarchy; in order to maintain uninjured my independence as sovereign and ruler; in order to remove from the midst of my dominions such extraordinary and great vexation, and to shield my subjects from similar frightful occurrences with their sad results, I

declare the so-called ecclesiastics – the Jesuits, namely – to be thoroughly corrupt, and to have receded from the rules of their Holy Order, and from deeply-rooted depravity to have become completely incapable of ever again learning to observe them; I declare them to be notorious rebels, traitors, enemies, and disturbers of the peace, who have opposed, and will again oppose, my royal person and Government, the public peace of my kingdom, and the general welfare of my subjects, and, therefore order that each and every one of them may be looked upon as rebels and traitors, and treated as such. On the strength of this I declare them to be denaturalized, exiled, outlawed, and banished, and decree that they shall be expelled from all my kingdoms and lordships, without ever again, at any time, being allowed to return.”{6} [Emphasis added]
R. W. Thompson concludes:
“In Portugal the culminating point was reached by an attempt to assassinate the king [Joseph I] . . . the deed had been incited by the Jesuits, who had impressed ignorant and fanatical minds with the idea that no wrong was committed by killing a heretical king; that is one who did not submit to their dictation . . . Hence, as a measure absolutely essential to the life of the nation, the king issued a decree of banishment against the Jesuits as traitors, rebels, enemies to, and aggressors on, his person, his States, and the public peace and the general good of the people. The Jesuits were then seized, transported to the States of the Church [Italy] under the jurisdiction of Clement XIII, and the three accused fathers were placed in prison to await his action . . . The chief one of these was turned over to the Dominicans – ‘the natural enemies of the Jesuits’ – by whom he was burned alive . . . ”{7} [Emphasis added]
Little did the King and the Dominicans know they would pay dearly for this, as Napoleon the Freemason would drive the Portuguese King Joseph I from his throne while making war on the Dominicans and their Holy Office of the Inquisition.
The second expulsion was by the Bourbon King of France in 1764, having been heartily encouraged by his mistress, Madame de Pompadour. Of Louis XV (nearly assassinated by the Jesuit-controlled Damiens for which he was burnt at the stake) and his Parliament’s righteous decree we read:
“Whereupon, the investigation into the constitution and statutes of the society (of Jesuits) . . . resulted in the enactment of a Parliamentary decree which shows the odium then attached to the society in France. It

denounced their doctrines and practices ‘as perverse, destructive of every principle of religion, and even of probity; as injurious to morality, pernicious to civil society, seditious, dangerous to rights of the persons of sovereigns; as fit to excite the greatest troubles in States, to form and maintain the most profound corruption in the hearts of men.’
[And finally,]
‘ . . . that the institutions of the Jesuits should forever cease to exist throughout the whole extent of the kingdom.’ ” {8}
Little did King Louis XV know his dynasty would also pay dearly for this, as his grandson, Louis XVI along with his Hapsburg Queen Marie Antoinette and little son called “the Dauphin,” would be cruelly murdered by the fanatical Jacobins under Jesuit control.
The third sovereign to expel the Jesuits was Charles III, the King of Spain, in 1767. He had read the Jesuit handbook, Secret Instructions of the Jesuits known as Secreta Monita (scanned onto a CD and enclosed herein). His confessor was a Franciscan – a confirmed enemy of the Jesuits – and none of the Company were advisors in his Court. Of his renown we read:
“His greatest work, the expulsion of the Jesuits, would never have been carried out if he had not been persuaded of its political necessity. The order had already been driven out by [Cavalho, the Marquis of] Pombal from Portugal and by Choiseul from France, when Charles III was convinced that a riot in Madrid . . . had been promoted by the Jesuits [Lopez, Benavente and Gonzalez] . . . ” {9}
And why did the Jesuits incite a riot against the king?
“ . . . this revolt . . . this Jesuitical high treason . . . was got up . . . for . . . the deposition of the king himself . . . the Monarch, who had been from
the first opposed to the Order.” {10}
Having purposed to expel the Company, the king and his Masonic counselor, Count Aranda, moved secretly and decisively. What a movie this would make!
“All the superior Spanish officials in the whole Spanish monarchy, as well as all the military commandants in the towns in which there existed Jesuitical colleges, residencies, or houses of other description, at once received packets, the contents of which were precisely the same, and

provided with the King’s seal; the contents thereof were extremely mysterious, as, upon the packet being opened, another was found provided with three seals, together with an open note, in which the following words were to be read:
‘On pain of death you shall not open the document provided with three seals, previous to the 2nd of April, at the hour of sunset, and the same punishment will await you, if anyone, be he whom he may, discloses his having received a secret writing.’
Precisely similar instructions were forwarded to all the prefects, governors, and commandants, in different colonies of Asia and America...One may well imagine the anxiety that existed among those officials and commandants on their receiving this remarkable document, and not the less may it be supposed, how difficult it was for them to restrain their anxiety; but they all did so, without a single exception, and the secret remained inviolate up till the 2nd of April. As soon, however, as the sun went down on that day, all these secret packets were opened at the same time, and what was now their astonishment when the matter in question became known to them! Among things, the [substance of the] document ran as follows:
‘I convey to you herewith all my authority and Royal power; as soon as you have opened this document you will at once summon all the troops, and, accompanied by them, you will immediately betake yourself to the house or college of the Jesuits. Having arrived there, you shall place a sentinel at the door; you shall awaken all the members of the Society, one with another, out of their sleep, and arrest them. Thereupon you shall seal, with the Royal seal, the archives and magazines, take the whole books and papers which may be found there into safe keeping, and intimate to the Jesuits that they must follow you without daring to take anything away with them except their prayer-books, mantels, and hats, and whatever linen may be required for a long journey. As soon as you have requisitioned a sufficient number of carriages, you shall place the Jesuits therein and convey them to the seaport I here point out to you. There, ships shall be already in waiting to transport the Fathers to their destination, as soon as you have delivered over your prisoners to the captains, your responsibility shall be at an end. But this, however, I must tell you, that after the embarkation of the Fathers, if a single one of the Society – the sick not even exempted – be found in your department or province, you shall atone for this by death. Yo el Rey, that is, I, the King.’

[Oh, that we would have a President with the courage of this Roman Catholic king!]
Thus ran the order which the governors and superior officials received from the Government, and that they strictly carried out the same may be well understood. In this manner were the whole of the sons of Loyola, throughout all Spain, numbering about six thousand, arrested at the same hour, that is, about midnight on the 2nd April 1767, and a few days afterward they all found themselves, without exception, on the ships already prepared for them. It was a master-stroke, the like of which had never been seen, and the whole of Christendom were so astonished thereat that it could not for a long time recover itself.” {11}
The fourth sovereign to expel the Jesuits from his dominion was the Roman Catholic Crusader for the Pope, the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta, Fra Manuel Pinto de Fonseca. Driven from the island of Malta in 1768 we discover:
“In 1768 the Jesuits, having given much trouble, were expelled and their
property confiscated.” {12}
Little did the Knights know that they would pay dearly for this, as the Jesuits would use Napoleon to confiscate all their landed property in France, invade Malta, plunder their weapons and treasures, and drive the Knights to an alien existence at the Court of Tzar Paul I of Russia.
(Dear truth-seeker, our lesson is we must never be blinded by the terms “Protestant,” “Roman Catholic,” “Moslem” or “Orthodox” when seeking to understand conflicts between nations for the last five hundred years – between patriotic, non-aggressive, nationalists opposing treasonous, imperialistic internationalists – between the risen Son of God with His Biblical Protestant-Baptist-Calvinist Reformation opposing Satan with his Tridentine (Council of Trent) Jesuitical Counter-Reformation. Knowing that the solution to any problem always lies in asking the right question, we must unceasingly ask, “Where are the Jesuits and their Shriner Freemasons in this picture?” And in answering the questions, “Who benefits?” and “Who suffers?,” the smoke will clear and all will become naked before our eyes.)
With the return of the Jesuits to Italy, R. W. Thompson quotes the Roman Catholic Louis Marie de Cormenin in his History of the Popes of Rome,
“ . . . the soil of Italy was polluted by this unclean slime which the nations had rejected, and which they had sent back to Rome, the
fountain of all corruption.” {13}

With the Jesuits expelled from all of South America and from the mightiest Roman Catholic nations on the continent, Europe’s kings demanded, under the threat of a formal declaration of war on the Vatican, that the Pope abolish the Company. When Pope Clement XIII was about to do it he was poisoned the night before:
“During the night preceding the day appointed for the public ceremony of announcing the abolition of the Jesuits, Clement XIII was suddenly seized with convulsions [like Cromwell’s daughter], and died, leaving the act unperformed, and the Jesuits victorious. Cormenin . . . records this event in the terse and expressive words: ‘The Jesuits had poisoned him.’ ” {14}
However, after a four-year investigation, his successor, Pope Clement XIV did sign a Bull of Suppression in 1773 “under the seal of the fisherman,” part of which reads:
“ . . . ‘that the name of the company shall be, and is forever extinguished and suppressed;’ that ‘no one of them do carry their audacity so far as to impugn, combat, or even write or speak about the said suppression, or the reasons and motives of it;’ and that the said bull of suppression and abolition shall ‘forever and to all eternity be valid, permanent, and efficacious.’ ” {15}
One of our hero ex-priests, Emmett McLoughlin, sheds further light on the power of “the Company” and the Pope’s extinction of so dastardly an Order. He writes:
“The Jesuits have always been known to all other priests as the most treacherous, single-minded and supranational of all Roman Catholic orders. This is the basic reason why in country after country, their treachery, ambition and systematic consuming greed have resulted in their suppression and expulsion from every country in Europe, and all the Catholic-dominated countries of America. From the days of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I, the English ferreted them out and hanged them. The Jesuits, Fr. Garnett, Fr. Gerard and Fr. Greenway, were involved even in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 which was planned to blow up Parliament and destroy British royalty.
[If the Jesuits sought to blow up the English Parliament for expelling them from England in 1604, would not the Jesuits, with their Nazi SS, burn the German Parliament for expelling them from Germany in 1872?]
Even their own Catholic countries finally became surfeited with Jesuit political intrigue and financial avarice and, in self-preservation, were

forced to expel them. Portugal, Angola, Goa and Brazil took the lead in 1759. France followed in 1764. Several Italian states as Parma, Sicily and Naples followed suit. By sealed imperial orders sent to her colonies around the world, Spain threw out all Jesuits in 1767. This decree suppressed them in the Philippines, Argentina, New Granada (Colombia), Peru, Chili, Ecuador, Guatemala, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Mexico, New Mexico and Arizona. Austria did the same in 1773. Finally, Pope Clement XIV in 1773 issued the document ‘Dominus ac Redemptor’ [found in Nicolini’s History of the Jesuits, pp. 387-406] abolishing the Jesuit Order altogether, listed eleven Popes as having tried to curb their excesses. Among them were Benedict XIV, Innocent XI, Innocent XIII and Clement XIII. He cited the Jesuits for opposition to ‘other religious orders,’ for ‘revolts and intestine troubles in some of the Catholic states’ and ‘persecutions against the church in Europe and Asia.’ ‘There remained no other remedy to so great evils . . . and this step was necessary in order to prevent the Christians from rising one against the other and from massacring each other in the very bosom of our common mother, the holy church.’
[Therefore, the Papal Caesar concluded,]
‘ . . . after a mature deliberation, we do out of our certain knowledge and the fullness of our apostolic power, suppress and abolish the said
Company.’ ” {16}
Upon signing the Bull of Suppression and Extinction in the early hours of the morning (half past one), Pope Clement XIV was reported to have said,
“The suppression is accomplished, I do not repent of it, having only resolved on it after examining and weighing everything, and because I thought it necessary for the church. If it were not done, I would do it now. But THIS SUPPRESSION WILL BE MY DEATH.” {17}
Further:
“We can well believe with what a terrible sense of responsibility the Pope signed this document . . . And he had but too good reasons for personal fear. He had done and dared what none of his predecessors would have attempted; he knew the penalty and paid for it . . .
The signature was made on July 23rd, 1773. On September 27th [in fact on the 22nd, fourteen months to the day], 1774, he died.” {18}

Indeed, the Pope knew the Jesuits well. Eight months later he was slow poisoned with the dreaded “aquetta” as it does not at once prove fatal, but, according to the dose, it may be predicted beforehand at what time the victim must die.
And how was the Pope poisoned?
“ . . . a peasant woman was persuaded, by means of a disguise, to procure entrance into the Vatican, and offer to the Pope a fig in which poison was concealed. Clement XIV was exceedingly fond of this fruit, and ate it without hesitation. The same day the first symptoms of severe illness were observed, and to these, rapidly succeeded violent inflammation of the bowels. He soon became convinced that he was poisoned, and remarked: ‘Alas! I knew they would poison me; but I did not expect to die in so slow and cruel a manner.’ His terrible sufferings continued for several months, when he died, ‘the poor victim,’ said Cormenin, ‘of the execrable Jesuits [to which the Bishop of Pistoia, Scipio di’ Ricci, the nephew and heir of Jesuit General Ricci, fully agreed.]’ ” {19} [Emphasis added]
There is no doubt Pope Clement XIV, after lingering six long months, had been poisoned, evidenced by his autopsy. Of this ghastly scene we see:
“ . . . on the day following the death, the 23rd of September, the process of embalming the body was commenced. The face then presented a leaden colour, while the lips and nails had become quite black. Ash coloured strips showed themselves too, under the skin, on the arms, sides, thighs, and feet, and on other parts of the body blue spots appeared, as if from coagulation of the blood. The body was opened in order to remove the intestines, which was effected with considerable difficulty, while the whole presented the appearance as if eaten up with something resembling cancer. They were immediately placed in an especially well-closed vessel, as the odour was most offensive, while the examination was proceeded with. Not an hour, however, had elapsed before the vessel burst with a loud explosion, and the gases issuing from the intestines produced so frightful a stench that it was impossible any longer to remain in the chamber, and the embalming process had to be discontinued for that day. On the following day, the 24th, when they came again, it was found that decomposition had made rapid process, such as never occurs in ordinary cases, but alone in those of poisoning, the face and hands having become quite black, while on the skin appeared thick blisters filled with a noisome lymph, and when these were cut or pressed an odour was emitted entirely similar to that coming from the intestines, and it was, indeed, necessary to avoid coming near the body as much as possible. But this was still not the least difficulty in carrying out the embalmment, as the skin had become detached from

Chapter 14 209
almost the whole body of the deceased, as in the case of a putrid carcass. Indeed, the nails came off, and the hair remained on the pillows on which the head rested. Under such circumstances embalmment was, of course, quite out of the question, and it became necessary to hasten to place the body quickly into a coffin before the limbs became entirely separated; and the Roman people had, for this time, to forego the spectacle of the exhibition of a Papal corpse in full Pontifical robes. . . . [The] question was who had poisoned him? The people of Rome quickly gave an answer, and exclaimed as from one throat, ‘This the Jesuits have done.’ . . . the Order of Jesus had perpetrated an act of revenge; and that it was not contrary to their morals that such an act might be accomplished by poison or dagger . . .” {20}
With this Roman Catholic Richard W. Thompson agrees:
“ . . . that it was not criminal but rather the proper service of God, to
assassinate their enemies.” {21}
For the famous German Jesuit and “moral theologian,” Martin Becan, had declared in his outrageous Opusculum Theologicum on page 130 concerning regicide:
“That every subject can assassinate his prince when he has assumed the power of the throne as a usurper . . . in all the nations, it will be observed, that they will be honored in the extreme, those who immolate similar tyrants. It is necessary yet, however, that he shall be a usurper, because, having a probable right, his death will not be lawful. It is permitted to a nation . . . to depose a legitimate prince always, when he conducts himself as a tyrant.” {22} [Emphasis added]
Over two hundred years later, the Jesuits, using their Shriner Freemasons, would poison another Pope who had become their enemy as a usurper and a tyrant. After only thirty-three days in office Pope John Paul I lay dead in his bedroom. The Pope’s death, according to some, was the result of a trusted friend who entered his room and, while standing nearby during a friendly conversation, crushed a two-chambered capsule under the Pope’s nose releasing deadly airborne cyanide. In the words of a memorandum from a U.S. Army medical facility in Washington, D.C., the Papal Caesar was found sitting in a chair with a look of wide-eyed horror. Avro Manhattan gives us a similar description:
“The Pope’s lips were pulled backwards and upwards, his gums exposed, giving him a most horrific grimace. But then, what horrified her [the nun] even more, was, that both his eyes seemed about to be shooting out of their sockets . . . Cardinal Villot . . . announced with the utmost detachment, that, yes, the Pope was truly dead.”{23}

And why?
“ . . . John Paul [I], had said that, the following morning he was going to read personally to Father Arrupe, the Jesuit General, a document which he had written himself. Although he did not reveal its nature, his companions guessed, it had something to do with Liberation Theology . . . the Jesuits, behind the whole movement of Liberation Theology, were supporting ever more openly, Communist guerrillas. Some of these movements, indeed, were even led by the Jesuit padres . . . Father Arrupe, their General, who had been in contact with Moscow [under Jesuit control since the commencement of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917], had become a ruling Pope [“Pope”] himself, with a private army of his own. . . . Pope John Paul [I] became perturbed about the whole problem . . . The new Pope, decided to start dealing with Father Arrupe. Perhaps with Father Arrupe’s dismissal.” {24} [Emphasis added]
And two key players in the assassination of Pope John Paul I were Jean Cardinal Villot, the Papal Secretary of State (like President Kennedy’s Dean Rusk), and Bishop Paul Marcinkus of the Vatican Bank. Both of these men were Freemasons. We read with astonishment and utter disbelief:
“Now, along with top politicians, journalists, pundits, and others with a need to know first, the pope read about what L’Osservatore Politics OP called ‘The Great Vatican Lodge.’ The article gave names of 121 people who were alleged to be members of Masonic lodges . . . If the information was authentic, then it meant Luciano [Pope John Paul I] was virtually surrounded by Masons . . . The Secretary of State, Cardinal Villot, Masonic name Jeanni . . . Bishop Paul Marcinkus . . . of the Vatican Bank. The disconcerted pope read a list that seemed like a Who’s Who of Vatican City.” {25} [Emphasis added]
By virtue of their high positions of power in Vatican City and being members of the P2 Masonic Lodge, Jean Cardinal Villot and Bishop Paul Marcinkus (who was also a criminal money launderer for the Pope’s Italian Mafia and CIA now residing in Sun City, Arizona) were obedient tools of Pedro Arrupe, the Jesuit General.
Dear truth-seeker, in addition to Popes, the Jesuit General using his many soldiers has imprisoned or killed scores of liberal-minded priests within the Roman hierarchy and priesthood who dared to resist his absolutism. This policy further entrenched the power of his “infallible” Papal Roman Caesar and of his fascist dictators. We read:
The Jesuits – 1750 - 1773



Chapter 14 211
“ . . . the Hitler regime in the beginning interned Catholic priests in concentration camps because they refused to obey his dictates . . . Persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany has been directed only against those elements which did not entirely submit to the ever-increasing centralization of authority in Church and State. To this end the Vatican helped crush out the Catholic popular parties both in Italy and Germany and centralized all political matters in Rome. This insured to the dictators freedom from popular interference on the part of Catholics; it established a more complete dictatorial regime within the Catholic Church itself; it enabled the Vatican to enter into secret concordats with fascist countries already existing, and with democratic countries, like Spain, France, Belgium [which, under the Order’s King Leopold II having invited the Jesuits into the Congo, murdered ten million Black Congolese], and Portugal, after the destruction of their democratic governments by revolution and blitzkrieg. Finally it left the way clear for complete harmony and unity between Nazi-Fascism and Jesuit Catholicism . . . [This is exactly the same scenario that will be followed within the American Empire during its coming White, “New Right,” fascist military dictatorship led by someone like the Jesuit-trained Knight of Malta, Patrick J. Buchanan, or the centralizing, “New Federalist” Roman Catholic and anti-Jew, Grand Orient Freemason, Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr., brought to power by Catholics and Protestants alike, who will be enraged over the treasonous policies of previous Presidents — like President George W. Bush’s blanket naturalization of illegal aliens, they being mostly Hispanics, Orientals and Blacks, further making America a nation of color. The Jesuits, advising and directing their American Nazi fascists, will use domestic concentration camps to murder “liberal,” Roman Catholic priests resisting tyranny just as they did in Hitler’s Nazi Germany. This ruse of war will further create the deception that the Order’s American tyrant is against the Pope and his Hierarchy to the delight of the Black Pope!] With the extinction of liberal Catholicism and the imprisonment of liberal Protestant leaders, Vatican absolutism was triumphant. Of supreme satisfaction to the Jesuit Catholic faction was the dissolution of Protestantism in Germany [with the help of Jesuit General Ledochowski’s Grand Inquisitor, the Jesuit-trained Roman Catholic Joseph Djugashvili (“Son of a Jew”) Stalin (“Man of Steel”), and his Red Army directed by the Black Pope’s NKVD].” {26} [Emphasis added]
If the Jesuits, in assassinating their enemies, would kill Popes, Cardinals, Bishops and Priests, would they not kill a Roman Catholic American President if they thought it essential to the fulfillment of their imperial plans, while imposing their evil Council of Trent on us trusting and naive Americans?
Indeed they would, and indeed they did on November 22, 1963.

Pope Clement XIV, 1769 – 1774 #56 After a four-year investigation and pressured by the Roman Catholic Monarchs of Europe, this brave Pope suppressed the Society of Jesus with a Papal Bull on July 21, 1773. He knew the tremendous POWER he was resisting and that the signing of the Bull would be his death warrant. Fourteen months later he lay dead having been poisoned by those masters of murder, as the Italians declared the Pope’s death to be a work of the Jesuits in obedience to their god, the Black Pope. To this day no mortal man occupying the office of Satan’s sacred Papacy has dared to suppress the Company of Jesus, as the Pope’s every word, tendency and action is closely monitored by the Jesuit General’s Curia overseeing him.

His fatal error was in attempting to formally relieve Pedro Arrupe of his command as the Superior General of the Society of Jesus. He should have learned his lesson from Pope Clement XIV.

Jesuit Power During the Suppression and Extinction of the Society From Pope Clement XIV to Pope Pius VII
“Never before in the course of the world’s history had such a Society appeared. The old Roman Senate itself did not lay schemes for world domination with greater certainty of success.” {1}
Friedrich von Hardenberg, 1800 Alias “Novalis” Protestant German Philosopher
“Even in England, Jesuits were never so well treated, nor perhaps so prosperous, as during their legal suppression.” {2}
G. B. Nicolini of Rome, 1854 Protestant Italian Patriot Exiled to England History of the Jesuits
We shall pause for a moment of reflection, dear truth-seeker. You have finished your First Block of Jesuit history as it relates to the Kennedy Assassination. There are three more to go.
Having an understanding of the Order’s first two hundred and thirty-three years of existence, you now know the true course of European history. It was the righteous Protestant Calvinist Reformation versus the Catholic Jesuit Counter-Reformation; the Old and New Testament teachings of the Bible as preached by Luther and Calvin versus the teachings of the evil Council of Trent as championed by the Sons of Ignatius Loyola. A Bible-believing, ex-Irish Catholic Priest who (while ordained, conducted a legal action in Rome on behalf of American bishops and priests in the 1920s against the Jesuits) was an evangelist conducting mission work among Roman Catholics in New York during the 1940s, Leo Lehmann, adds:



216 Vatican Assassins
“Space permits only a very brief summary of the counter-Reformation activities of Jesuit Catholicism which led to the rise and present successes of Nazi-Fascism against the liberalizing effects of the Protestant Reformation. The Thirty Years’ War, the murderous reign of the Duke of Alva in the Netherlands, the massacre of St. Bartholomew and the bloody attempts at Catholic restoration in England, are visible, and terrifying examples of the anti-Protestant activities of the Jesuit Order in the past.” {3} [Emphasis added]
In addition to the Council of Trent, Peter Dens’ Theologia, as taught to the Irish priests in 1826 at a Roman Catholic Seminary in Maynooth, Ireland, declared:
“Prop. 1. Protestants are heretics, and as such are worse than Jews, and pagans.
Prop. 2. That they are by baptism, and by blood, under the power of the Roman Catholic church.
Prop. 3. That heretics (Protestants) are subject to the Roman Catholic church.
Prop. 4. So far from granting toleration to Protestants, it is the duty of the church, to exterminate the rites of their religion.
Prop. 5. That it is the duty of the Roman Catholic church to compel heretics, by corporal punishment, to submit to her faith.
Prop. 6. That the punishments decreed by the Roman Catholic church, are confiscation of goods, exile, imprisonment, and
death.” {4} [Emphasis added]
And to what end did these unbiblical, tyrannical and heretical doctrines so insanely serve? In 1550 Pope Julius III declared his claim to universal Temporal (political) Power evidenced by a new coin he issued, its motto having read:
“The nation and kingdom that will not serve me shall perish!” {5}
This claim of the Papal Caesar was and is a perversion of a passage of Holy Writ referring to the Nation of Israel under the rule of her Messiah during His future universal reign, having established the kingdom promised to King David. We read:
The Jesuits – 1773 - 1814



PAUSE II 217
“And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee [Israel]: for in my wrath I smote thee [Israel], but in my favour have I had mercy on thee [Israel] . . . For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee [Israel] shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.”
– Isaiah 60:10, 12
Dear truth-seeker, since you now understand our First Block of Jesuit history, you are now able to understand our Second Block of Jesuit history. It begins with the Order’s formal suppression by Pope Clement XIV in 1773 and ends with its formal reestablishment by Pope Pius VII in 1814 — a total of forty-one years.
These forty-one years were absolutely golden for the Society of Jesus. For the Sons of Loyola punished all their enemies including the Dominican priests, perfected the inner workings between themselves and Freemasonry, created an alliance between the House of Rothschild in establishing the Illuminati, punished and then absorbed the Knights of Malta just like the “Borg” of Star Trek. They used the Orthodox Catherine II “the Great” of Russia and the Lutheran Frederick II “the Great” of Prussia to conquer and divide Poland, rendering the Pope’s Bull of Suppression and Extinction of no effect in that Roman Catholic land. The Order caused the French Revolution, beheading a Bourbon Catholic King, Louis XVI, and a Hapsburg Catholic Queen, Marie Antoinette, in retaliation for being expelled from France and Austria. With Napoleon the Freemason they drove the Bourbons from their throne in Spain and the Braganzas from their throne in Portugal. They even attempted to take Palestine and thus Jerusalem from the Moslems, as did the Pope’s Crusaders, led by the evil Knights Templars of the Dark Ages.
The Company’s most important victories were both religious and political. The Jesuits deeply penetrated the Russian Orthodox Church and Germany’s Lutheran Church, along with its Tubingen University, attributing their Jew-hating propaganda to the works of Martin Luther! Politically, they took control of the Crown and Bank of England. For this reason England, with Shriner Freemason Viscount Palmerston, would never go to war with France again, it would conduct the Pope’s Opium Wars against the people of China (just like the Company, with its CIA and Mafia Commission, is presently conducting a massive Drug Trade against the “heretic and liberal” people of the American Empire) governed by the Order’s enemy – the Manchu Dynasty – and would refuse to help the Italian patriots in their warring with the armies of the Pope during the Italian Revolution of 1848. The Jesuits also captured the Vatican Empire, along with its landed Church properties the world over, and for this reason the Papal Caesar, occupying Satan’s sacred Office of the Papacy, would never suppress the Society of Jesus, ever again!

Lorenzo Ricci #60 Eighteenth Superior General of the Society of Jesus, 1758 - 1775 During the Order’s Suppression from 1773 to 1814 by Pope Clement XIV, General Ricci created the Order of the Illuminati with his soldier, Adam Weishaupt, uniting the House of Rothschild with the Society of Jesus. Weishaupt, the Father of modern Communism, used his bloody Jacobins to conduct the French Revolution incited by his Masonic Encyclopaedists, Voltaire and Diderot. Years later Jesuit General Ledochowski, with his Bolsheviks, conducted the Russian Revolution in 1917 incited by his Masonic Communists, Marx and Engels, it being identical to the upheaval of 1789. What many modern writers of today describe as “the Illuminati” is, in fact and purpose, another name for the Jesuit Order under the all-pervading guidance of its master governing Washington, D.C., London, Paris, Moscow, Peking, Jerusalem, Mecca and the Vatican, the Black Pope.

BLOCK II – (1773 - 1814)
The Jesuits,
During Their Suppression and Extinction,
In Seeking to Destroy the Protestant Reformation and Restore the Dark Ages with The Pope Exercising His Temporal Power as the Universal Monarch of the World,
Established the Illuminati in Alliance with Shriner Freemasonry, and then, as the Advisors of Napoleon Bonaparte, Punished the Papacy, the Dominican Priests, the Knights of Malta, the Roman Catholic Monarchs of Europe, the Protestant people of Germany, and the Orthodox people of Russia; moreover, they Exposed the Outrages of the Dominicans’ “Holy Office of the Inquisition,” and Enfranchised the Semitic Hebrew/Jewish Race (Further Humbling the anti-Jewish, Roman Catholic Sovereigns of Europe), for the Purpose of Inducing Pope Pius VII to Restore Life to the Society of Jesus in 1814, following its Suppression by Pope Clement XIV having been Suppressed by the Papacy from 1773 to 1814. With the Jesuit Order now revived, the Black Pope would continue to magnify demon-possessed Pope Innocent III’s Fourth Lateran Council (1215 A.D.). One of its death sentences reads as follows:
“We excommunicate and anathematize every heresy that exalts itself against the holy, orthodox and Catholic faith, condemning all heretics, by whatever name they may be known; for though their faces differ, they are tied together by their tails. Such as are condemned are to be delivered over to the existing secular powers, to receive due punishment. . . . Secular powers of all ranks and degrees are to be warned, induced, and, if necessary, compelled by ecclesiastical censure, to swear that they will exert themselves to the utmost in the defence of the faith, and extirpate all heretics denounced by the Church who shall be found in their territories. . . . If any temporal lord, . . . shall neglect to clear his territory of heretical depravity, . . . the bishops of the province shall unite in excommunicating him. . . . the Supreme Pontiff . . . will bestow the territory on Catholics . . . on the condition of exterminating the heretics and preserving the said territory in the faith.” {1}

The Jesuits
Protected by Frederick II “the Great” of Prussia and Catherine II “the Great” of Russia
“All these things cause the Father-General to be feared by the Pope and the sovereigns . . . A sovereign who is not their friend will sooner or later experience their vengeance.” {1}
Luigi Desanctis, 1852 Official Censor of the Inquisition Popery, Puseyism and Jesuitism
The Jesuit Order was now formally banned by Pope Clement XIV’s Bull of Suppression issued in 1773. The Bull was effective in countries where the Roman Catholic Church and the Civil State were united. In countries where another Church was united with the State, the Bull would not be enforced. Such was the case with Prussia and Russia. “Mother Russia” was governed by an absolute monarchy, headed by the Romanoffs. The Romanoff dynasty was the legal protector of the Russian Orthodox Church, which included the Orthodox “Pope” called the “Patriarch.” Church and State were united. Since Pope Clement XIV’s Bull of Suppression would not be enforced in Russia, the Jesuits sought and received admittance and protection there. In spite of the fact that Peter the Great had expelled the Jesuits during his reign in 1719, Catherine the Great freely readmitted them once again in 1773.
Catherine believed the Order would protect her throne since she had murdered her husband to acquire it. She was German and a Lutheran, as well as a whore according to her son, Tzar Paul I; but as the Monarch of Russia she was the protector of the Orthodox Church. Little did she know the secret designs of the Order as it deeply penetrated the Orthodox priesthood and acquired such political power that Tzar Alexander I would expel it after the Congress of Vienna, in 1820.
The other absolute Monarch who gave protection to the Jesuit Order was Frederick II “the Great,” King of Prussia. This heroic military leader of the Seven Years’ War with its Protestant victory was the protector of the Lutheran Church in that country. Church and State were united. Therefore, Clement XIV’s Bull of Suppression and Extinction was not enforced in Lutheran Prussia . . . So the Jesuits, “the Pope’s bodyguard,” sought and received protection from Frederick II.



Chapter 15 221
A key detail here is that Frederick II was the most powerful Freemason in Europe, possessing the sovereign Masonic power over all “the Craft.” We read:
“ . . . on the 1st of May, 1786, Frederick II, King of Prussia, caused the high degrees and Masonic Constitutions of the ancient Rite to be revived. He added eight degrees to the twenty-five [written by the Jesuits in France] already recognized in Prussia, and founded a Supreme Council of thirty-three degrees, of which he himself constructed the regulations in eighteen articles.” {2}
Could it be that the Jesuits aided Frederick II in writing the additional eight degrees as well as establishing the Supreme Council of thirty-three degrees?
This is one of the major connections between Jesuitism and Shriner Freemasonry. For when the Jesuits would cause the Russian Revolution in 1917 they would institute communism. (Communism had been perfected on their Reductions in Paraguay from 1600 to 1750.) And the great day of celebration in Stalin’s Russia and Hitler’s Germany would be May 1st — the very day Frederick II instituted Shriner Freemasonry. Of this union between Frederick II and the Jesuits we read:
“The Jesuits flocked, therefore, to Silesia from all quarters, seeking his Protestant protection, which caused Voltaire to remark in his caustic style, that ‘it would divert him beyond measure to think of Frederick as the general of the Jesuits, and that he hoped this would inspire the Pope with the idea of becoming mufti.’ ” {3}
Little did Frederick II know that Protestant Germany would pay dearly for this. The Jesuits would penetrate the Lutheran clergy and add to the words of Luther, portraying him as a Jew-hater! They would attack the Bible of Luther’s Germany with “higher criticism,” and overthrow Frederick II’s distant descendant, Kaiser Wilhelm II. The Jesuits would also bring Hitler to power and in their beloved Silesia (now Poland), would erect their Death Camps in which the Jews of Europe along with the Roman Catholic Roma (Gypsies, many of which were vagabond Jews by race) would be mass murdered. And when many were calling for the Americans to bomb Auschwitz, it was President Roosevelt – the Shriner Freemason – who prevented it with his tool and CFR member, John J. McCloy. And it was John J. McCloy along with two other Shriner Freemasons who were appointed to the Warren Commission. They were Gerald Ford and Supreme Court Chief Justice, Earl Warren.
As we all know, the Warren Commission covered up the Kennedy Assassination. But most Americans do not know that the Jesuits got away with murder – again – with the help of their Shriner Freemasons.

Frederick II “the Great,” 1712 – 1786 #61 King of Prussia, 1740 - 1786 Frederick II was the most powerful Freemason on the European Continent. Even though he was the hero of the Seven Years’ War (1756-1763), which enabled Great Britain to win North America, was the Protector of the Lutheran Church, and declared “No country ever got any good by injuring the Jew,” he treacherously admitted the Jesuits into his Protestant Empire. This is an undeniable link between high-level Shriner Freemasonry and the Professed Jesuits of the Fourth Vow. His dynasty would pay dearly for this however, as his distant relative, Kaiser Wilhelm II, would be forced to resign by the Jesuits in 1918, the victim of the very Grand Orient Freemasonry Frederick had used to import the French Revolution into France.

Catherine II “the Great,” 1729 – 1796 #62 Empress of Russia, 1762 - 1796 This German was the greatest disgrace ever to sit upon the throne of the Romanoffs. Having murdered her husband in usurping the power of the Empire, Catherine was openly called a “whore” by her son, Paul I. As the protector of the Orthodox Church, she treasonously admitted the Jesuits into Russia despite Peter the Great’s expulsion of the Order in 1723. The Jesuits deeply penetrated Russia’s state Church and Tsarist government, successfully overthrowing both by 1922 using their “Holy Monk,” Grigory Rasputin, a secret Jesuit according to our hero and ex-Jesuit, Alberto Rivera. Rasputin was covertly advised by the Jesuit General’s openly Orthodox rector of the Company’s Tiflis Theological Seminary, Bishop Hermogen, along with Hermogen’s fellow Jesuit, the evil Orthodox priest Iliodor. Meanwhile the Sons of Loyola awaited their ultimate restoration until the Black Pope had finished conducting his Napoleonic Wars.

“Von Hammer, in his History of the Assassins, a branch or development of the Illuminati, points out singular parallels between the teaching of Loyola and the Assassins. [The Jesuit Order has revived the Assassins in creating the intolerant and fanatical modern day sect within Islam known as Osama bin Laden’s “Wahhabism,” having been embraced by tribal chief Abdul Aziz ibn Saud in 1744 and now, since formally established by King Abdul Aziz ibn Saud 1932, is the state religion of Saudi Arabia.] Nor can it be said that drawing attention to this parallelism is a mere Protestant prejudice, since the first charge was made by the priests of Alcala, and in the very lifetime of the founder of the Jesuits.” {1} [Emphasis added]

The Jesuits, now formally suppressed by the Pope, were allied with Frederick the Great of Prussia and Catherine II of Russia. The Jesuit General was in control of Scottish Rite Freemasonry and now sought an alliance with the Masonic Baron of the House of Rothschild. To accomplish this he chose a Jesuit who was a German Gentile (not a Jew) by race and a Freemason by association — Adam Weishaupt.
“That Weishaupt was not the originator of the system he named ‘Illuminism’ will be already apparent to every reader of the present work . . . How did these Oriental methods penetrate to the Bavarian professor? According to certain writers, through the Jesuits. The fact that Weishaupt had been brought up by this Order has provided the enemies of the Jesuits with the argument that they were the secret inspirers of the Illuminati . . . That Weishaupt did, however, draw to a certain extent on Jesuit methods of training is recognized even by Barruel, himself a Jesuit [and the most influential historian of the French Revolution], who, quoting Mirabeau, says that Weishaupt, ‘admired above all those laws, that regime of the Jesuits, which, under one head [the Jesuit General], made men dispersed over the universe tend towards the same goal . . . ’ ” {4} [Emphasis added]
Adam Weishaupt was also a brilliant instructor of Canon Law – including the evil Council of Trent – at a Jesuit College in Bavaria. We read:
“From the Jesuit College at Ingolstadt is said to have issued the sect known as ‘the Illuminati of Bavaria’ founded by Adam Weishaupt; its nominal founder, however, seems to have played a subordinate though conspicuous role in the organization of this sect.” {5} [Emphasis added]
(Dear truth-seeker, Masonic Jews always play “a subordinate though conspicuous role” when used by the Jesuit General. Such was the case of the birth of the Illuminati with Rothschild (1776), the financing of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars with Rothschild (1789-1815), the creation of modern Communism with Marx (1848), the first head of the Federal Reserve Bank with Paul M. Warburg (1913) and presently, Alan Greenspan (2002), the creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) via the Bolshevik Revolution with Trotsky and Lenin (1917), the financing and building of the USSR with Jacob H. Schiff and Armand Hammer (1920-1980) and AIG’s Maurice Greenberg (2002), the Jewish Holocaust of Europe with Rudolf Kastner (1939-1945), the birth of Zionist Israel with Theodor Herzl (1948), the cover-up of the Kennedy Assassination with the Warren Commission’s Arlen Specter and his “single bullet theory” (1964) and the continual high treason against the people of the American Empire by Henry A. Kissinger (1972 to the Present (2003)). These are high-level Masonic Jews who adhere to the evil Babylonian Talmud of Judaism – the twin sister of the evil Council of Trent of

Jesuitism – and have betrayed their own Jewish Race contributing to the atrocities committed by the Jesuit Order including the Jewish Holocaust. These same Masonic (racially) Jewish Zionists with their secret brethren, the Masonic (religiously) Jewish Talmudic Rabbinical leaders, will one day betray “the holy people” by making Jerusalem an international city and by entering into a treaty with the Papal Caesar,
“ . . . the prince that shall come . . . ”
– Daniel 9:26
For if the Talmudic Jewish leaders had “no king but Caesar” in Messiah’s day, why should we be surprised to see these same men serving the Papal Caesar of our day? May those elect racial Jews today in Israel awake to the good news of Yeshua, the racially Jewish, Talmud rejecting, Torah believing Messiah before it is too late!)
On May 1, 1776, the Order of the Illuminati was officially founded at the Jesuit University of Ingolstadt in the old Jesuit stronghold of Bavaria from which the Sons of Loyola had ignited the Thirty Years’ War. The Company would now use the Jewish House of Rothschild to finance the French Revolution, which would in turn enfranchise the Jewish People in 1791, furthering the illusion that “the Jews” were the real culprits behind the upheaval in France. Rothschild would also finance the rise of Napoleon the Freemason with his Jesuit-trained advisor, Abbe Sieyes. In spite of the historical writings of the Jesuit Abbe Barruel, who blamed the Rothschilds and Freemasonry for the Revolution, it was the Society of Jesus that used these very tools to carry out the Revolution and punish the Monarchs who dared to expel the Sons of Loyola from their dominions. The Jesuits, having been expelled from the Spanish Empire, found refuge in Corsica. From there they raised up their great avenger, Napoleon Bonaparte.
In the early forties, during World War II – nearing the end of the Second Thirty Years’ War – the Jesuits would again use their Rothschild Illuminati and Shriner Freemasonry to punish two nations having dared to expel the Order from their borders. In conjunction with the Rothschilds of England, they would use their “Federal Reserve Bank” to finance the building of a huge aerial war machine. The B-17s and B-29s would be used to destroy these nations, which after the war would be rebuilt according to the religious and commercial blueprints of the Jesuit Order. In carrying out the plan of destroying these two nations, the Jesuits would again use Shriner Freemasonry. Their tools were Masons General Douglas MacArthur in the firebombing of Japan and General Dwight Eisenhower in the annihilation of Germany. For Japan had expelled the Jesuits for over two hundred and fifty years and Germany had banished them for forty-five years. Indeed, these paybacks were previews of Hell – an atomic mushrooming and firebombing hell – carried out by the agents of The Engineer Corps of Hell — the Blackrobes of Ignatius Loyola.

Since Pope Clement XIV’s Bull of Extinction was not enforced in Lutheran Germany, the Order flourished at its University of Ingolstadt, out of which Weishaupt established the Illuminati in 1776 and joined the Grand Orient Masonic Lodge in 1777. He united the magnificent financial empire of the Cabalistic, Masonic, Jewish House of Rothschild, the “Guardians of the Vatican’s Treasury,” with the opulence of the international and secret, anti-Jewish Race, primarily White Gentile Society of Jesus.

As a result of Pope Clement XIV’s Bull of Suppression, the Jesuits sought refuge in non-Roman Catholic countries. One of the countries in which they secretly received protection was Protestant England. Although the Jesuits had been expelled in 1604 by King James I, and Parliament (thanks to the Glorious Revolution in 1688) had passed a law forbidding any Roman Catholic to sit on England’s throne, the Jesuits persisted in their plot to conquer that nation. Knowing if they could control the English King, even though he was a Protestant and the protector of the Anglican Church, they could control the vast British Empire. Then, that Empire, with the world’s greatest navy, could be used to suppress Protestant liberty, both political and religious. Such was the case during America’s War for Independence.
According to Bancroft’s History of the United States, America’s thirteen colonies had been settled by White European Protestants — including Maryland. At the time of the Revolution, of the three million inhabitants, ninety-seven percent were Protestants and Baptists, the rest being Roman Catholics and Jews. And what drove these displaced European Protestants to a wild and unsettled land? It was the relentless and ferocious persecutions and wars having drenched Europe in Protestant and Baptist blood for over two hundred years. And as we have seen in our previous chapters these all were incited by the Jesuit Order! George Bancroft writes:
“For more than two centuries the humbler Protestant sects had sent up the cry to heaven for freedom to worship God. To the panting for this freedom half the American states owed their existence . . . The immense majority of the inhabitants of the thirteen colonies were Protestant dissenters . . . The establishment of liberty of conscience, which brought with it liberty of speech and of the press, was, in the several states, the fruit not of philosophy, but of the love of Protestantism for the open (Bible) . . . ” {7} [Emphasis added]
(Dear truth-seeker, the Jesuits knew this. Do you think for one minute they would allow the establishment of a Protestant nation, founded upon The Authorized King James Version of 1611, and the creation of a new form of Protestant constitutional government limiting the powers of the Legislative, Executive and Judicial branches through an express grant of powers ratified by thirteen sovereign States? Do you think for one minute the Jesuits would permit delegated powers of the federal government to be limited by a Calvinist document called “The Bill of Rights” written by the Baptist James Madison and influenced by the Baptist George Mason at the insistence of Virginia’s greatest Baptist preacher, John Leland? In light of the Council of Trent and the Jesuit Oath the answer is absolutely not! Remember, the Jesuits hated the Dutch Republic of William I of Orange and the English Commonwealth of Oliver Cromwell. They would also come to hate the Federal Republic of these United States of the Baptist George Washington.)

Now, the Jesuit Order had a war on two fronts. In the Providence of the risen Son of God, the American Revolution erupted in 1775 — the same year Jesuit General Ricci supposedly died in the state prison of Castel St. Angelo, Italy. (Like Hitler, his death could have been faked while he made his escape to another continent, possibly North America. Interestingly, there was no formal successor to General Ricci for seven critical years until General Czerniewicz appeared in Russia.) Therefore, the Order had to punish Europe’s Roman Catholic Monarchs and the Pope for its suppression as well as imprison Pius VII as payback for the imprisonment and death of its General. It also had to prevent the establishment of another Protestant “heretic and liberal” nation with a Constitutional, non-absolute, form of government. To affect these ends the Jesuits sought control of the English throne. From there they could incite a revolution, justify a British Armada invasion, and crush the preaching of the true gospel. From there the Jesuits could use England as a controlled enemy of Napoleon while he executed vengeance for the Order. Therefore, the General of the Jesuits sought protection for his army of Jesuits from King George III. We read:
“Clutching at straws [Jesuit General Lorenzo] Ricci had been heartened when King George III’s brother, the Duke of Gloucester, lunched with him and hinted at English support.” {8}
The Order received more than support. It was given all it needed, to survive and prosper, from George III. This wicked king also reestablished the English branch of the Knights of Malta in 1782, it having been banished from the Empire for over two hundred years. In 1795, Stonyhurst, one of England’s most beautiful landed estates, was donated to the Company by an English lord, Thomas Weld. In exchange for the King’s protection, the Jesuits have never overturned but rather protected the British Crown, London having become the center of the world’s commerce.
Once in the Court of King George III the strategy of the Black Pope became the foreign policy of England. He would use certain American Freemasons, like Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams (who later became “the King-aping President”) to ignite a revolution and thereby justify the use of England’s military to plunder the Colonies, fiercely persecuting its Protestants by burning many of them alive in their churches. But these Protestants were Calvinists with a history of Biblical resistance to Jesuit tyranny. We read of these men who did not hesitate to pit their convictions against the power of the state, the princes and dictatorships:
“It was Calvinism which formed the hosts who resisted and overcame the worldly dictatorships of France, the Netherlands, and Great Britain. It was Calvinism which broke the chains in which the spiritual dictatorship of Rome and the Jesuits sought to enslave western Europe. To be an ‘elect of the Lord’ was not a mere theological phrase with which the

Inquisition had to reckon, but a political fact, a thousand times tested on
the battlegrounds of freedom.” {9} [Emphasis added]
What was that something in their creed that made them what they were — the only fighting Protestants? The answer is found in our second question: Why were these men able to resist the Jesuits? Indeed, it was their creed, what they believed about God, man, themselves and the Pope, that enabled them to repel the armies of Rome. We read in their Westminster Confession of Faith of 1658 concerning what the Calvinists believed about God:
“There is but one only, living and true God, who is infinite in being and perfection, a most pure spirit, invisible, without body, parts, or passions, immutable, immense, eternal, incomprehensible, almighty, most wise, most holy, most free, most absolute, working all things according to the counsel of his own immutable and most righteous will, for his own glory; most loving, gracious, merciful, long-suffering abundant in goodness and truth, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin; the rewarder of them that diligently seek him; and withal most just and terrible in his judgments; hating all sin, and will by no means clear the guilty.
II. God hath all life, glory, goodness, blessedness, in and of himself; and is alone in and unto himself all-sufficient, not standing in need of any creatures which he hath made, not deriving any glory from them, but only manifesting his own glory, in, by, unto, and upon them: he is alone the foundation of all being, of whom, through whom, and to whom, are all things; and hath most sovereign dominion over them, to do by them, for them, or upon them, whatsoever himself pleaseth. In his sight all things are open and manifest; his knowledge is infinite, infallible, and independent upon the creature, so as nothing is to him contingent or uncertain. He is most holy in all his counsels, in all his works, and in all his commands. To him is due from angels and men, and every other creature, whatsoever worship, service, or obedience, he is pleased to require of them.” {10} [Emphasis added]
Of man, the Calvinists believed:
“By the decree of God, for the manifestation of his glory, some men and angels are predestinated unto everlasting life, and others foreordained to everlasting death. These angels and men, thus predestinated and foreordained, are particularly and unchangeably designed; and their number is so certain and definite, that it cannot be either increased or diminished.” {11}
The Jesuits – 1775 - 1815



Chapter 17 233
Of themselves, the Calvinists believed:
“As God hath appointed the elect unto glory, so hath he, by the eternal and most free purpose of his will, foreordained all the means thereunto. Wherefore they who are elected being fallen in Adam, are redeemed in Christ; are effectually called unto faith in Christ by his Spirit working in due season; are justified, adopted, sanctified, and kept by His power through faith unto salvation. Neither are any other redeemed by Christ, effectually called, justified, adopted, sanctified, and saved, but the elect only . . . The doctrine of this high mystery of predestination is to be handled with special prudence and care, that men attending the will of God revealed in his Word, and yielding obedience thereunto, may, from the certainty of their effectual vocation, be assured of their eternal election. So shall this doctrine afford matter of praise, reverence, and admiration of God, and of humility, diligence, and abundant consolation to all that sincerely obey the Gospel.” {12} [Emphasis added]
Lastly, of the Pope, the Calvinists believed:
“There is no other head of the church but the Lord Jesus Christ; nor can the Pope of Rome in any sense be head thereof; but is that antichrist, that man of sin, and son of perdition, that exalteth himself in the church against Christ, and all that is called God.” {13} [Emphasis added]
Ah, dear truth-seeker, sublimer words have never been written by sin-cursed men. Yes, it was these fighting Calvinists, knowing the risen Son of God and rightly thinking of Him coupled with their pure, stable and obedient lives, who completely changed the face of medieval Europe. They in the minority, the Pope with his Jesuits and papists in the majority, the risen Son of God mightily moved in answering their prayers, giving the world “the Modern Era” and the greatest refuge for the world’s persecuted Protestants, Baptists and Jews — The Federal (Calvinist) Republic of these United (Protestant) States of America! They knew they were the elect and therefore believed whatever befell them was predestinated! For it was these White Celtic-Anglo-Saxon Calvinists who invented new technologies as did the learned Presbyterian Edwin H. Armstrong, the father of FM radio and more importantly his Presbyterian predecessor, James Clerk Maxwell, the father of electro-magnetic theory and engineering. They created prosperous civilizations out of barren wildernesses – like South Africa – and brought wealth and industry to the great cities of Europe — like London, Paris, Berlin and Amsterdam. And it was the prayers, pens and swords of our American Calvinists that thwarted the design of Jesuit General Lorenzo Ricci whose evil agents attempted to make our Confederate Republic of these United States of America into a centralized, Jesuit Empire of the West, with its “Rome on the Potomac,” subject to a British Monarch controlled by the Black Pope.

But above all the Calvinists regarded resistance to unlawful government – the Anti-Christian tyranny of the Jesuit General’s absolute monarchies – a sacred duty. We read the words of John Knox, the great Scottish Reformer nicknamed “Calvin with a Sword of Just Defense,” spoken to Mary, Queen of Scots:
“ . . . we are constrained by unjust tyranny purposed against us, to declare unto Your Grace, that except this cruelty be stayed by your wisdom, we will be compelled to take the sword of just defense against all that shall pursue us for the matter of religion, and for our conscience sake, which ought not, nor may not be subject to mortal creatures, farther than by God’s Word man be able to prove that he hath power to command us . . . Better we think, to expose our bodies to a thousand deaths, than to hazard our souls to perpetual condemnation, by denying Christ Jesus, and His manifest truth.” {14} [Emphasis added]
This classic Calvinist conviction was expressed by a Scotch Covenanter, Isabel Alison, in 1681 before her heartless execution by the government agents of the Roman Catholic King Charles II. (In being fair, we must remember that during his reign the king, later given “the poison cup” on his deathbed in 1685, sanctioned Parliament’s decree to banish all Catholic priests in 1662, consented to the Protestant’s anti-Popish “Test Act,” signed a proclamation in 1674 confirming all the pains and penalties issued against Catholics by former sovereigns, and consented to the execution of no less that fourteen Jesuits, including the Provincial Fr. Thomas Whitbread, convicted of conspiring to his assassination. The plot, having been secretly financed by Pere La Chaise, the Jesuit confessor to France’s King Louis XIV, was revealed in 1678 by Dr. Tongue, Titus Oates and Bedlo.) We read:
“They said, Thought I ever that Charles II was our lawful king? I said, Yes; for he entered into covenant with God and the land; but he hath broken and cast off that tie, and hath exercised so much, both tyranny and cruelty, that I had just ground to decline him and them both. Then they bade my blood be upon my own head; but I told them they would find it would be on their heads, for it was owning of Christ’s kingly office that they put me to suffer, say the contrary who will. Now I bless the Lord I am free from Jesuitical principles. The Scripture is my rule, and when obedience to men is contrary to obedience to God, I am clear to disown them.” {15} [Emphasis added]
When this Calvinist conviction was brought to the battlefield in prayer we see the American War for Independence from unbridled English tyranny in all its glory and success. J. T. Headley writes:
“ . . . the patriotic clergy of the revolution never practiced self-deception; they did not wish for one thing in their hearts and pray for another with their lips. When they wanted the destruction of their foes, they did not pray about

something else, and wait to see if their desires might not be accomplished through the agency of wicked men, or chance, or the devil. They came boldly to the Holy of Holies, and asked for it. Their enemies were the enemies of God; their foes those of the Church, who were coming to lay waste and destroy God’s heritage, and they wished their overthrow, and honestly, and with strong crying and tears, prayed for it. Like Cromwell’s Ironsides, who first invoked God’s right arm to strike with them, and then, with the fearful war-cry ‘Religion’ on their lips swept like a thundercloud to battle; like the Covenanters, who prayed that their swords might be like that of Gideon, that turned not back from the slaughter, and then fell in fury on their pursuers; like David, praying for the overthrow of his enemies, and Moses, and Joshua, and the prophets, whose earnest supplications swelled the heaps of the slain; so these puritan divines, without rancor or vindictive hate, prayed in this fashion, and with an honest, earnest purpose, ‘Thy kingdom come.’ ” {16} [Emphasis added]
Such was the rag-tag American army led by their great chieftain and Protestant Southerner, General George Washington. Surrounded by Calvinist preachers like Timothy Dwight, – the grandson of Jonathan Edwards, the Calvinist man of God who preached America’s First Great Awakening – Washington always received words of encouragement and exhortations to prayer. At Valley Forge we see the Father of our country at his greatest — on his knees. We read:
“One day a Quaker, by the name of Potts, was strolling up a creek, when he heard, in a secluded spot, the solemn voice of some one apparently engaged in prayer. Stealing quietly forward, he saw Washington’s horse tied to a sapling, and a little farther on, in a thicket, the chief himself, on his knees, and with tears streaming down his cheeks, beseeching Heaven for his country and his army. Before God alone, that strong heart gave way, and poured forth the full tide of its griefs and anxieties. Though the heavens grew dark around him, and disaster after disaster wrecked his brightest hopes, and despair settled down on officers and men, he showed the same unalterable presence — moved the same tower of strength. But to his God he could safely go with his troubles, and on that arm securely lean. How sublime does he appear, and how good and holy the cause he was engaged in seems, as he thus carries it to the throne of a just God, feeling that it has his sanction and can claim his protection . . . No wonder peace sat enthroned on that brow when despair clouded all others.” {17}
In time the prayers of Washington were answered. Haym Solomon, a wealthy Jewish banker and Philadelphia broker, loaned his entire fortune, a quarter of a million dollars in specie, for the Army at Valley Forge. The Protestant Netherlands, along with Catholic France and Spain, having expelled the Jesuits from their lands

including all of South America, declared war on Protestant England, that Jesuit nest! Louis XVI dispatched the French navy to aid the beloved Lafayette. As a result, the English army, controlled by the Jesuits through King George III, was defeated at Yorktown, a village of Protestant Virginia. Obviously, the risen Son of God worked mightily in answer to many prayers!
Enraged, the Jesuits would cause the United Netherlands, France and Spain to pay dearly for this! Napoleon would destroy the Dutch Republic in 1795, driving King William I of Orange (1772-1843) into exile in London. In addition to France’s expulsion of the Order in 1764 and now her aid to the accursed American “heretics and liberals,” the rage of the Jesuits would unleash the French Revolution. They would use Robespierre, brainwashed by Jesuits for nine years in their College of Louis-le-grand, to lead the Jacobins. The Jacobins would behead Louis XVI, who dared to resist the Order, and murder his Hapsburg Queen Marie Antoinette, whose mother, Archduchess Maria Theresa, had expelled the Jesuits from Austria. They would cruelly torture and murder Louis’ young son, the Dauphin, and destroy the flower of French manhood with the endless wars of Napoleon I. The Jesuits would break up the French Empire and use King George III to restore the Bourbon Dynasty (after the Congress of Vienna) with their tyrannical Freemason, Louis XVIII, who promptly readmitted the Jesuits. Spain suffered a similar punishment. The Jesuits used Napoleon to drive Spain’s Bourbon king, Charles IV, into exile and to begin to break up the Spanish Empire, race amalgamation being one of their tactics. Again, they used George III to restore the Bourbon Dynasty (after the Congress of Vienna) with their beast, King Ferdinand VII of Spain (1808, 1814-1833), who then promptly readmitted the Jesuits and revived the Inquisition with all its fury.
Meanwhile in America, George Washington became the most respected man of the age who, according to our famous American historian, John Clark Ridpath, as found in Ridpath’s Universal History, Volume XIV, page 617, funded the Revolution with $74,485 from his own purse. Although having been initiated into English Freemasonry as a young man in 1752, he was largely inactive. Aware of the history and presence of the Jesuits at Georgetown University, we read his words, warning the whole country to beware of secret societies, in a letter written to Pastor G. W. Snyder one year before his death, on September 25, 1798:
“I have little more to add than thanks for your wishes, and favorable sentiments, except to correct an error you have run into of my presiding over English lodges in this country. The fact is I preside over none, nor have I been in one more than once or twice within the last thirty years. I believe, notwithstanding, that none of the lodges in this country [unlike the British, French and German lodges] are contaminated with the principles ascribed to the [Jesuits’] society of the Illuminati.” {18} [Emphasis added]

Having been baptized into a Baptist Church by one of his officers, Pastor John Gano, he became our first and greatest President. Our French hero, Marquis de Lafayette, sent him the key to the Bastille after it was stormed and demolished, while Frederick the Great sent him his sword with these words engraved upon it:
“From the Oldest General in Europe, To the Greatest General in the World.” {19}
Indeed, George Washington, in obtaining one of the Bible’s promises God-breathed by the Holy Spirit – and recorded in I Peter 5:6, had humbled himself under the mighty hand of God for which he was exalted in due time. Like Cromwell, it was Washington who, with tender heart, wept on his aged mother’s neck after he heard her last words:
“You will see me no more . . . But you George, fulfill the high destinies which Heaven has assigned you. Go my son, and may Heaven and your
mother’s blessing be with you always.” {20}
Having released all of his Black slaves upon his death (including his beloved house servant “Billy Lee”), it was Washington who brought each colony into Statehood. For in the Treaty of Paris in 1783 the colonies were declared to be “free, independent and sovereign.” It was Washington who, having declined all compensation for his services, brought the nation out of bankruptcy by abolishing paper currency and called for the 1792 Coinage Act establishing gold and silver coins for the nation’s money. He erected protective tariffs enabling the nation’s manufacturers to grow – and prosper – unlike the Jesuits’ oppressive North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) treaties of the 1990s. He left office after a glorious two terms as President and a brilliant Farewell Address with decency and honor.
Lastly, it was George Washington who was so beloved by France’s General Lafayette. During the revolution our great chieftain took the “boy General” under his wing for which cause the Frenchman named his eldest son George Washington Lafayette. With this same endearing love the Roman Catholic Lafayette warned:
“It is my opinion that if the liberties of this country – the United States of America – are destroyed, it will be by the subtlety of the Roman Catholic Jesuit priests, for they are the most crafty, dangerous enemies to civil and religious liberty. They have instigated most of the wars of Europe.” {21}
This in turn was paramount on the mind of President Washington, who had visited the suppressed Jesuits at Georgetown University’s Old North in 1796, the same year he gave his Farewell Address in which he warned:

“Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful woes of republican government.”{22}
Dear truth-seeker, are we to believe that the great Father of our country, the White Anglo-Saxon Baptist and Southern Virginian having founded a nation of Protestant freemen, escaped the vengeance of the suppressed Jesuit Order? We must remember that the Society of Jesus HATED George Washington and for good reason. The Revolution that Jesuit General Lorenzo Ricci had helped to foment, using continental, Bible-hating, pagan Freemasons like Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, was intended to be a War of Annihilation – a war that would have to wait for the passing of two generations in order to be successfully waged against the White Protestant South from 1861 to 1865. Employing the British Army, seventeen thousand Hessian mercenaries and the bloodletting Six Indian Nations, the war was to be a successful repeat of the Order’s French Indian War having been lost to England’s King George II (fully aware of the Order’s Secret Instructions) in 1763. Once successful, with the aid of certain traitors within the Continental Congress who sought to overthrow General Washington as the Commander of the Continental Army while deliberately cutting off payments to our patriotic soldiers thereby attempting to effect a mutiny, the Baptist and Protestant Colonies would be subordinated to the Anglican Church, it being under the control of the Jesuits via its protector, King George III. With the intended subjugation of the Colonies, which were then to be managed exactly like the Society’s communist Reductions in South America, the Jesuit General would then be able to realize the goal of his Order in making the White Pope the Universal Monarch of the World. He would use his British Empire, with the world’s mightiest Navy, supported by the “reduced and centralized” American Colonies governed by their federal city of Washington, D.C. – surnamed “Rome on the Potomac” and designed by the Order’s continental French Freemason, Pierre-Charles L’Enfant, the job having been obtained through the intercession of Jesuit John Carroll – to subjugate all the governments of the world to the Temporal Power of the Pope. This Anglo-American Jesuit-controlled Japhetic “Protestant Kingdom” in alliance with the Order’s European, Japhetic, “Catholic Holy Alliance” established in 1815 (after the Company had used Napoleon to punish the Pope and Roman Catholic Monarchs of Europe for suppressing the Society from 1773 to 1814), was intended to be the death knell to the risen Son of God’s grand and glorious Protestant Reformation. Imagine, “Protestant” King George III acting in concert with “Roman Catholic” Prince von Metternich subject to Jesuit General Johannes Roothaan — the rebuilder of the Jesuits! But our hero, George Washington, brought the Revolution to a successful termination striking a major blow for Protestant liberty, thus outraging the Devil’s Jesuits.

Further, George Washington thwarted the Order’s plan by preventing Congress from adopting an absolutist and centralized Constitution. He brought calm and stability to the discussions of the Convention, and within ninety days our organic document was complete, having been modeled after the Protestant Pelatiah Webster’s Treatise on Government written in 1775. Additionally, the Baptist-Calvinist James Madison, compelled by the demand of Virginia’s leading Baptist-Calvinist preacher, John Leland, added to the Constitution the Baptist Bill of Rights (modeled after the Baptist Calvinist George Mason’s Declaration of Rights adopted by Virginia, the “Empire State of the South”). This further infuriated the Jesuit General and his fanatical Order of brainwashed cutthroats!
Our gallant Washington (who, when he was fourteen years of age, wrote his 110 Rules of Civility and Decent Behavior) went on to further stifle the Order’s quest in establishing absolutism in America. He, unlike Napoleon, stoutly refused the title of “King,” as a monarchy could be more easily corrupted than a republic. He was unanimously chosen to be the first President of these federated United States of America, and he erected a protective tariff stimulating the growth of our domestic manufacturers. Having inspired the 1792 Coinage Act, the Federal Government properly began minting gold and silver coins as lawful money. He abolished worthless paper currency called “continentals”, saving the nation from bankruptcy. After eight years in guiding the nation as its first and greatest President, he dealt the Order his final blow with his immemorial Farewell Address given in 1796 America’s greatest state paper! In it he warned of the “insidious wiles of foreign influence” knowing full well the power of the Jesuit Order having been exercised over the nations of Europe for over two hundred years prior to this, his last address. (It is staggering to note, when the Jesuits fomented our terrible War Between the States waged from 1861 to 1865, they merely instituted the federal policies to be avoided as described in the Farewell Address, one of them being the geographical division of our country into “the North” and “the South.”)
It is for these reasons that our inspirational President George Washington became the greatest enemy of the Jesuit Order throughout the Eighteenth Century. If the Society had murdered the Kings of France and England in the past, why would it not murder the greatest “accursed heretic” of the age, pursuant to the Council of Trent? Indeed it did! With those masters of murder slipping him the poison cup on December 12, 1799, Washington was stricken at sixty-seven years of age in the full vigor of life. America’s greatest historian, J. T. Headley, in his The Life of Washington, on pages 465 to 467, describes the sufferings of our hero whose life ended on December 14th, a mere two days after he became ill. Dr. Craik, Dr. Brown and Dr. Dick, after bleeding him, were “powerless against the disease,” making “the last struggles doubly violent,” which brought him to “the point of suffocation. . . . death seemed doubly terrible, when with one quick blow it could carry so much to the grave.” This, dear truth-seeker, is the poison cup!

The difference between the Protestant American Revolution and the atheistic, French Revolution was the difference between Washington the Baptist, advised by Presbyterian Calvinists, and Napoleon the Roman Catholic, advised by the Jesuit, Abbe Sieyes. In Washington’s darkest hour, he is weeping on his knees in prayer at Valley Forge. In Napoleon’s darkest hour, he is abandoning his army in the snows of Russia, it being left to the mercy of the Cossacks. Washington refuses the title of “King” while Napoleon accepts the crown from the Pope as “Emperor.” Further, the people of the colonies were Protestant Calvinists and Bible-reading; the people of France were disillusioned, atheistic Catholics, the Jesuits having outlawed the Bible and Protestantism for over one hundred years since the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. The outcome of the American Revolution was a Constitutional Republic of federated sovereign States. The outcome of the French Revolution was a Jesuit-controlled military dictator resulting in the restoration of a Jesuit-controlled Monarch, Louis XVIII. The Jesuits had their way in France; but, with their “Federalists” in America, failed to establish absolutism, the Calvinistic, States’ Rights Anti-Federalists emphatically warning that Washington, D.C. would become the Pope’s domain. That victory of the Black Pope would have to wait until 1868.
But the Jesuits, with King George III who later became deaf and blind for persecuting the Bible-believing Church of the risen Son of God, were still alive and plotting. While Napoleon was busy deliberately sacrificing his army in the snows of Russia, George III invaded America again with the War of 1812. The apostate English Protestants set fire to our White House on August 24, 1814, and threatened to reduce us to serving the British Crown once again. But the risen Son of God sent us a second deliverer who was the savior of our Protestant Republic Washington had established. This man, the hero of New Orleans, was none other than “Old Hickory” another Protestant Southerner – President Andrew Jackson.
(As an aside, those great Jesuit agitators hated President Jackson, a Bible-believing Protestant although a low-level Freemason. By saving this “heretic” nation in restoring economic stability through abolishing “the United States Bank,” returning to hard money (gold and silver coins) and erecting a protective tariff thereby helping our domestic manufacturers, the Jesuits attempted to shoot him at point-blank range with one of their dupes. In the providence of the risen Son of God the pistol misfired and our hero-President lived on to be the great inspiration of Pennsylvania’s only President, James Buchanan.)
Years later the Jesuits in creating the American Indian Agitation of the 1960s reattacked their old enemy by blaming him for the movement of the Cherokee Nation from Georgia to west of the Mississippi River. In setting the record straight we appeal to the great Missouri Senator, Thomas Benton, and his Thirty Years’ View. In Chapter CXXXVI titled “Removal of the Cherokees from Georgia” we read:
The Jesuits – 1775 - 1815



Chapter 17
“In the winter of 1835-’36 a treaty was negotiated, by which the Cherokees, making clean disposal of all their possessions east of the Mississippi, ceded the whole, and agreed to go West, to join the half tribe beyond that river. The consideration paid them was ample and besides that moneyed consideration, they had large inducements, founded in views of their own welfare, to make the removal. These inducements were set out by themselves in the preamble to the treaty, and were declared to be: ‘A desire to get rid of the difficulties experienced by a residence within the settled parts of the United States; and to reunite their people, by joining those who had crossed the Mississippi; and to live in a country beyond the limits of State sovereignties, and where they could establish and enjoy a government of their choice, and perpetuate a state of society, which might be most consonant with their views, habits, and condition, and which might tend to their individual comfort, and their advancement in civilization.’
These were sensible reasons for desiring a removal, and, added to the moneyed consideration, made it immensely desirable to the Indians. The direct consideration was five millions of dollars [!!!] which, added to stipulations to pay for the improvements on the ceded lands – to defray the expenses of removal to their new homes beyond the Mississippi – to subsist them for one year after their arrival – to commute school funds and annuities – to allow pre-exemptions and pay for reserves – with some liberal grants of money from Congress, for the sake of quieting complaints – and some large departmental allowances, amounted in the whole, to more than twelve millions of dollars! Being almost as much for their single extinction of Indian title in the corner of two States, as the whole province of Louisiana cost! And this in addition to seven millions of acres granted for their new home, and making a larger and a better home than the one they had left. Considered as a moneyed transaction, the advantage was altogether, and out of all proportion, on the side of the Indian; but relief to the States, and quiet to the Indians, and the completion of a wise and humane policy, were overruling considerations, which sanctioned the enormity of the amount paid.” {23} [Emphasis added]

So our great and learned White Anglo-Saxon, Scotch-Irish Protestant and Baptist Congress justly and generously treated the Cherokee people. (Is this not the manner in which Israel and her Islamic neighbors should cooperate to remove and repatriate the displaced Arab Palestinians from her borders? Ah, but the Black Pope would never allow it! There must be ceaseless agitation and murder justifying more Jesuit mediation intending to secure Jerusalem’s Temple Mount for “the antichrist.”) And it was for this reason, in appreciation for their righteous treatment by the people of Protestant and Baptist Georgia, that the Cherokee Nation sided with the Southern Confederacy during the War Between the States and was the last to surrender to the Northern invaders controlled by the Order’s Radical Red Republicans in Washington.
A few years later, the Jesuits would make the Cherokee pay dearly for this, along with the rest of the Indian Nations in the process of the Jesuit General creating his Twentieth Century Monster of Vengeance — the “Holy Roman” Fourteenth Amendment American Empire. Dee Brown in her masterpiece, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, gives a most detailed and tragic account of the systematic destruction of the American Indian during the second half of the Nineteenth Century. For the Society of Jesus, in control of Washington, D.C. via the Republican Party, used its savage Grande Armee of the North, led by its Roman Catholic Federal General Philip Sheridan to cruelly humiliate and destroy the Native American Indian Nations through the Indian Wars of the Great Plains. Tragically for the natives, they were betrayed by Sheridan’s evil White master they had come to trust, the Jesuit Peter De Smet! (Dear American truth-seeker, did you learn this in high school or college? If you remember, we were all singing along with Paul Revere and the Raiders’ “Cherokee Nation.” This Jesuit agitation, along with the Civil Rights agitation, the abortion agitation and the Vietnam War nearly destroyed our patriotism while making us ashamed that we were members of the great White American Gentile Race!)
Under the blessing of the risen, reigning, righteous and returning Son of God, George Washington and his Calvinist army won a war and created a country with a Protestant Constitution. Andrew Jackson saved it from the British sword wielded by King George III and his Jesuits, including his Jesuit Prime Minister, Robert Petty, titled Lord Shelburne of Berkeley Square. This glorious page of history would never have been written without the suppression of the Jesuit Order from 1773 to 1814. May we pause for a moment of silence to thank our Heavenly Father for using Roman Catholic sovereigns and Pope Clement XIV himself who courageously suppressed and abolished so odious and perfidious an Order. As we shall see, the history of the Jesuits will continue to be one of murder, intrigue and enslavement towards all who resist their designs, including President John F. Kennedy who was wounded in the house of his friends, two of them being Henry R. Luce, whom he called “Lucy,” and J. Peter Grace, a former suitor of his sister, Kathleen.
God help us to open our eyes!

He established a Nation of freemen, maliciously called “THE INVADED TERRITORY of NORTHERN PARAGUAY” by Orestes A. Brownson, a journalist and secret lay Jesuit “of the short robe” who published his popish Brownson’s Quarterly Review during the latter half of the Nineteenth Century. The illustrious Father of our country saved the Revolutionary Army from dissolution many times; his leadership alone is responsible for the success of the Revolution; he served two terms as President having established a Constitutional Confederate Republic of Sovereign States in which we displaced and exiled White Celtic-Anglo-Saxon Calvinistic Protestants and Baptists could worship God according to the dictates of our consciences in obedience to His Holy Word, translated into English by the Puritans of the Protestant Reformation, The Authorized King James Version of the Bible of 1611. For thwarting the Order’s plan for North America, Washington was given the poison cup and within two days lay dead at his home in Mt. Vernon, another victim of the Black Pope.

“But if our hopes in this should be blasted, and since offences of necessity will come, our political schemes must be cunningly varied, according to the different posture of the times; and princes, our intimates, whom we can influence to follow our counsels, must be pushed on to embroil themselves in vigorous wars one with another, to the end, our Society (as promoters of the universal good of the world,) may on all hands be solicited to contribute its assistance, and always employed in being mediators of public dissensions: . . . ” {1}

They cost kings their lives, not on the scaffold, but by assassination, and equally hurtful as the society of Illuminati; they were the foremost among the crowd, at all events, who applauded the murder scenes in Paris . . . They held in their hands all the springs for working upon mankind; money, protection . . . were plentifully at their command . . . and it is impossible, therefore to indulge in a conviction that the re-establishment of the Society of Jesus can be productive of any benefit whatever.” {2} [Emphasis added]

It was now payback time for the Pope, his Dominican priests with the Holy Office of the Inquisition, the Knights of Malta and the Roman Catholic sovereigns of Europe. The Jesuits, with Freemasonry and the Illuminati as their tools, would punish the Monarchs as they had never been punished before! The Jesuits would also take time to punish a few Protestant nations pursuant to the Council of Trent, having pronounced over one hundred curses on all “heretics and liberals.” In this light the purpose of the atheistic, French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars becomes crystal clear. And with this understanding, the authors and purpose of the atheistic, Russian Revolution of 1917 will also become crystal clear.

Rather than give a history of the revolution and subsequent wars we shall focus on the question “Who benefits?”
Did not the Jesuits benefit when Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette were beheaded by the fanatical Jacobins? These sovereigns had aided the Protestant American “heretics” in their revolt from King George III. Additionally, both the Bourbon and Hapsburg dynasties had expelled the Jesuits from their countries. Louis XV, the grandfather of Louis XVI, had expelled the Jesuits from France and Archduchess Maria Theresa, the mother of Queen Marie Antoinette, had expelled the Jesuits from Austria. So Louis XVI of the Bourbon dynasty and Marie Antoinette of the Hapsburg dynasty must be gruesomely murdered in broad daylight – just like John F. Kennedy – as a lesson to the future Roman Catholic sovereigns.
Did not the Jesuits benefit when the Jacobins killed nearly all the Dominican priests in France? We must remember that the Order of the Dominicans was the enemy of the Jesuits from the inception of the Jesuit Order! Further, when the Jesuits had been suppressed by the Pope, the Dominicans took back the “Holy Office of the Inquisition,” thus outraging the Jesuit Order. Could this be the reason why Napoleon made war on the Inquisition, exposing the dastardly deeds of the Dominican inquisitors to the light of day? For example:
“Even as late as the time of Napoleon, we read that after his troops had captured Toledo, an Inquisition prison was opened there. The historian of Napoleon’s wars said it was like opening tombs, as the poor captives came forth. Their beards had grown down over their chests, their finger nails were like bird claws, and their bodies not much more than mere skeletons. Some of them had not breathed fresh air in years. Some were hopelessly crippled and deformed from having been kept in dens so low that they could not rise up in them. The next day, General LaSalle and several of his officers carefully inspected the place. The torture instruments they found filled even these men of the battlefield with horror.” {6}
(Dear truth-seeker, the torture instruments of Rome’s Inquisition were very similar and as gruesome as those found in Hitler’s Death Camps in Poland.)
Did not the Jesuits benefit when General Berthier made war on the Vatican when he captured Rome and imprisoned the ungodly Pope Pius VI in 1798, the Pope having fathered two illegitimate children to his sister? Was this not a payback, as the Pope had imprisoned Jesuit General Ricci following the abolition of the Jesuit Order? Did not the Jesuits completely humiliate the Pope when the occupying French soldiers overturned “St. Peter’s Chair”? Of this we read:
The Jesuits – 1789 - 1815



Chapter 18 247
“I said so on the authority of Lady Morgan, who, in her work of Italy, in the fourth volume, says that the sacrilegious curiosity of the French at the time when they occupied Rome, in the beginning of this century, overcame all obstacles, in order to see so famous a seat. They took off its copper covering, and drew out the seat, and examining it diligently, found there engraved in Arabic characters these words: – ‘There is one God, and Mahomet is His prophet.’ . . . The Pope, then, knowing that amongst the relics there was a seat, brought as a relic from the Crusades, ordered this to be taken and brought for veneration . . . ” {7} [Emphasis added]
Did not the Jesuits benefit when Napoleon Bonaparte drove the Bourbon King of Spain, Charles IV, into exile? Did not the Jesuits benefit when Napoleon exiled the Braganza monarchs, Queen Maria Francisca I (1777-1816) and her son John (later King John VI, 1816-1826) of Portugal to Brazil? Did not the Jesuits benefit when Napoleon drove the Knights of Malta from the island of Malta, confiscating all their treasures and weapons? (Remember, the Knights had previously expelled the Jesuits from Malta.) Did not the Jesuits benefit when Napoleon conquered the Protestant Dutch Republic, founded by one of our heroes, William I of Orange? Did not the Jesuits benefit when Napoleon conquered Italy, and vanquished Austria as both nations had expelled the Jesuit Order? Did not the Jesuits benefit when Napoleon conquered Protestant Switzerland? Would not the Jesuits have benefited if the French General Hocke had succeeded in breaking away Catholic Ireland from Protestant England (later accomplished after World War I)? Would not the Jesuits have benefited had Napoleon conquered Jerusalem, he having called for the establishment of “Jerusalem for the Jews” on April 14, 1799? Did not the Jesuits benefit when Napoleon broke up the Pope’s Holy Roman Empire? Why did nearly every strategy of Napoleon result in benefiting the Jesuit Order? The answer is in the person of Abbe Sieyes. According to Ridpath’s Universal History this priest was a prime mover of the French Revolution, the Directory, and was the Second Consul on Napoleon’s Consulate (Pierre-Roger Ducos being the third), calling for the end of the nobility and clergy — the enemies of the Society of Jesus! It is also most fascinating to see that Sieyes, the man whose coup d’etat brought Napoleon to power, was Jesuit-trained. We read:
“Sieyes, Emmanuel Joseph (1748-1836), one of the chief political thinkers and writers of the period of the French Revolution and the first empire . . . He was destined for the Church, was educated by the Jesuits, became a licentiate of the Canon law [including the oppressive and evil Council of Trent] . . . ” {8} [Emphasis added]
Thus Napoleon, the Roman Catholic Freemason called “Robespierre on horseback” by Madame de Stael, whose right-hand man was both a Jesuit-trained and controlled advisor, Abbe Sieyes, was brought to power from the Jesuit stronghold of Corsica.

By 1812 the Jesuits had punished their enemies with Napoleon. It was now time to destroy his Grande Armee, as those men would not allow the restoration of the old absolute monarchies. So Napoleon attacked Russia and then abandoned his patriotic soldiers, those men having hated absolute monarchy with all their hearts, to the winter snow and Russian army. Of the retreat from Moscow Count Leo Nikolayevich Tolstoy writes in his War and Peace:
“One army fled and the other pursued . . . But after a four days’ halt the mob, with no maneuvers or plans, again began running along the beaten track, neither to the right nor to the left but along the old – the worst road . . . At the Berezina they again became disorganized, many were drowned and many surrendered, but those who got across the river fled farther. Their supreme chief donned a fur coat and, having seated himself in a sleigh, galloped on alone, abandoning his companions.” {9}
This Napoleon Bonaparte, the Roman Catholic Freemason and pawn of the Jesuits, was not only a traitor to France but a mass murderer, as he was responsible for abandoning a quarter of a million dead, frozen or starving men in the snows of Russia. He should have been hanged for being not only a traitor but also a coward. And who gave him the order to abandon his army? It could only be his masters, the Jesuits, who had, in the words of Eugene Sue, brought him from nothingness to become Emperor of the French and master of the world!
(Dear truth-seeker, one hundred and thirty years later the Jesuits would order the destruction of the German Army in the East. Their tool, Adolf Hitler, during Operation Barbarossa, would “snatch defeat from the jaws of victory,” destroying his army in the snows of Russia. He, like Napoleon, insured an Allied victory with the agents of the Jesuits determining the terms of surrender.)
Following Napoleon’s Russian campaign – his successful betrayal and murder of hundreds of thousands of freedom-loving republican soldiers – the Jesuits sought to restore the old order of things. The Jesuit Order was revived in 1814 and the Congress of Vienna began as well. Meanwhile, Napoleon was rewarded for a job well done with an annual pension of two million francs while on the island of Elba. But the Monarchs at the Congress of Vienna squabbled; so, the Jesuits brought Napoleon back to France, known as “the hundred days.” This frightened the Monarchs into coming to terms with each other. With the Congress of Vienna having fulfilled the purpose of the Jesuit Order, the soldiers of France could now be finally defeated. Napoleon gathered an army of French patriots and deliberately sacrificed it at Waterloo by attacking the wrong point of the British line. We read concerning General “Stonewall” Jackson’s observations:
The Jesuits – 1789 - 1815



Chapter 18 249
“In the summer of 1856, he employed his long vacation in a European tour, in which he visited England, France, and Switzerland. During this journey he carefully examined the field of Waterloo, and traced out upon it the positions of the contending armies. When he returned home, he said although Napoleon was the greatest of commanders, he had committed an error in selecting the Chateau of Hougomont as the vital point of attack upon the British line; it should have been the village of Mont St. Jean. This opinion has subsequently been corroborated by high authority in the military art.” {10} [Emphasis added]
Dear truth-seeker, do you think the master of Austerlitz would make such a basic blunder – by accident – blasting all hope for French liberty? How ridiculous!
Napoleon was captured by the English and banished to an island in the South Atlantic Ocean called St. Helena. There, his Memoirs were written which accurately described his masters, the Sons of Loyola, having betrayed him into the hands of his captors. In awe and in anger he declared:
“The Jesuits are a military organization, not a religious order. Their chief is a general of an army, not the mere father abbot of a monastery. And the aim of this organization is: POWER. Power in its most despotic exercise. Absolute power, universal power, power to control the world by the volition of a single man. Jesuitism is the most absolute of despotisms: and at the same time the greatest and most enormous of abuses . . . The general of the Jesuits insists on being master, sovereign, over the sovereign. Wherever the Jesuits are admitted they will be masters, cost what it may. Their society is by nature dictatorial, and therefore it is the irreconcilable enemy of all constituted authority. Every act, every crime, however atrocious, is a meritorious work, if committed for the interest of the Society of the Jesuits, or by the order of the general.” {11} [Emphasis added]
The Society of Jesus had now emerged more powerful than ever. Satan’s Kingdom was no longer divided. In control of Freemasonry and the Illuminati, the Jesuits had taken the Protestant British Empire — its Throne as well as its Bank. London would now be their commercial capital of the world. They had retaken the Vatican and control of the Papacy. Rome would be their religious capital of the world and by 1900 New York would be the Order’s political capital of the world. They had punished the Roman Catholic sovereigns of Europe and would use England to restore them to their thrones again. (Dear truth-seeker, we must remember that even though Jesuit General Michelangelo Tamburini (1706-1730) had revived the old Knights Templars under the new name of “Freemasonry” with its letter “G” in

the midst of the Compass and the Square standing for the Order’s Church of the Gesu, it being the Company’s world headquarters in Rome, the Craft was divided. There were Masons loyal to the Black Pope such as Napoleon Bonaparte and Abbe Sieyes; there were others who were loyal to their Catholic Kings, country and people such as the ministers of state who expelled the Jesuits from their sovereigns’ borders. These Masons were Sebastian Cavalho, Marquis of Pombal of Portugal’s King Joseph I, the Count of Aranda of Spain’s King Charles III, Minister de Tillot and Duc de Choiseul of France’s King Louis XV and Prince von Kaunitz and Gerard von Swieten of Austria’s Archduchess Maria Theresa. This would be remedied with the Council of Wilhelmsbad in 1782 and the creation of the Supreme Council of the Thirty-Third Degree in 1786 — after the risen Son of God’s successful Protestant and Baptist-Calvinist American Revolution! Praise God!)
Now one final piece of business needed to be completed. On May 5, 1821, Napoleon Bonaparte was poisoned with arsenic, and he knew it, by guess who? When Napoleon’s will was opened after his death, General Montholon read the Emperor’s last accusation concerning St. Helena’s English governor, Hudson Lowe, — his detested jailer. Napoleon’s words, destined to fly across Europe, were:
“I die prematurely, murdered by the English oligarchy and its hired
assassin.” {12}
Dear truth-seeker, who benefited? The Jesuits had used King George III to protect their Masonic King Louis XVIII while in exile during the French Revolution and Napoleonic wars. Having betrayed Napoleon into the hands of his captors, they used the English king to banish the Emperor to a distant island in the middle of the South Atlantic Ocean. They again used George III to restore Louis XVIII to the throne of France. Louis XVIII then gave the Jesuits permission to reenter France having been previously expelled by King Louis XV, including his Jesuit confessor, Pere de Sacy, for which he nearly paid with his ungodly, homosexual life at the hand of Damiens, another Jesuit-sent assassin. The Jesuits then used French troops to suppress popular liberty in Spain pursuant to the oppressive policy of their “Holy Alliance,” called by the Saxons “the White Terror.” The murder of Napoleon crushed the hope of the French for liberal government and silenced the only rival of Louis XVIII as he enforced the Jesuits’ tyrannical program for the Continent. Little did the French people know that Napoleon had been only a tool of the Jesuit Order and was never intended to bring popular, “liberal” government to the European nations. If the Jesuits would poison Pope Clement XIV, would they not poison Napoleon? And if they would poison Napoleon would they not assassinate an American President like John F. Kennedy? Yes indeed, for he was mortally wounded in the house of his friends, the Jesuits. For he had attended one of their churches in Washington, D.C. while being a U.S. Senator from Massachusetts.

Napoleon Bonaparte, 1769 – 1821 #65 Emperor of the French Empire, 1804 - 1815 Being one of the greatest enigmas of history, Napoleon was a tool of the Order. As a result of the Order’s Suppression in 1773, Napoleon, believing the people should not have the Bible in their own language pursuant to the Council of Trent, was brought to power out of Corsica, the Order’s island fortress. Through Bonaparte’s military exploits the Jesuits imprisoned the Papal Caesar and drove the Roman Catholic Monarchs of Europe into exile until they had learned their lesson to never interfere with the POWER of the Black Pope. Here we see the great betrayal by the Emperor as he abandons his Grande Armee of 250,000 men to the snows and Cossacks of Russia in 1812. Those brave men, truly believing they were fighting for liberty, could not be allowed to return to France, the Order intending to reduce Europe to the tyranny of the Holy Alliance. To further dash the hopes of the French, Napoleon, betrayed by his Jesuit masters including the Jesuit-trained coadjutor Abbe Sieyes, was confined to St. Helena, an island in the middle of the South Atlantic Ocean, and in due time given the Order’s “poison cup” by his detested English jailer in 1821.

Chapter 19 253
The connection between the Knights of Malta, the Pope and the Jesuit General, with his army of Jesuits, is a key in understanding the flow of history since 1814. For the Pope’s restoration of the Society of Jesus was the capstone of Satanic Power through which the Devil would control all of his secret societies during the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries. Never in the history of the world had evil men been so successfully united in purposing to destroy all religious and political liberty. The intended result was to have the Papal Caesar ruling the world from Solomon’s rebuilt Temple in Jerusalem as the Theocratic Universal Monarch of the World.
But before we begin our next chapter, please, dear truth-seeker, read the following brief history of the Knights of Malta, received from the secretary at their office in St. Patrick’s Cathedral, New York. Note that on the last page, the Order has established formal diplomatic relations with Cuba, presently oppressed by that Jesuit-trained, Jesuit Temporal Coadjutor, bastard son of a Nazi and fascist military dictator – that Communist Roman Catholic son of the Church – Fidel Castro.
As we shall later see, the Knights of Malta, in control of the CIA and the Pentagon, put Castro in power, as Castro is a puppet of the Jesuits’ “infallible” Pope. And being one of the Pope’s “altar boys” enforcing the Temporal Power of “the Vicar of Christ,” he forbids the free circulation of the Protestant Bible, has caused a mass Jewish exodus to Israel and Miami by the thousands, while cruelly suppressing any movement towards liberal, popular government pursuant to the Council of Trent.
Notice also that the American Branch of the Knights of Malta was established in 1927. This was one year before the Company created Opus Dei (another international Brotherhood dedicated to the restoration of the Pope’s Temporal Power and the Dark Ages) in Spain and two years before the Knights caused the Great Depression, which in effect made the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank the financial monopoly of the American Empire created in 1868. This was five years before they attempted to make FDR a fascist dictator who, as President, formally recognized Jesuit-trained Joseph Stalin’s bloody government. This enabled the American Knights, in control of the Empire’s Military Industrial Complex, to aid the Russian Knights in building the Military Industrial Complex of the Jesuits’ Soviet Empire.
Then one day in 1962 three puppets of the Jesuits (Kennedy, Khrushchev and Castro), overseen by the intelligence agencies of the Knights of Malta (the CIA and KGB), created the hoax called “the Cuban Missile Crisis.” That deceit was based on another hoax called “the Cold War” which in turn was based on yet another hoax called “Nuclear War.” The fear created by the American press, controlled by Cardinal Spellman through his Knight of Malta Henry R. Luce (whose nickname as one of Yale’s Skull and Bones members was appropriately “Baal”), resulted in a secret agreement between “the superpowers.” That agreement, prohibiting an American invasion of Cuba, secured the island as a landing base for a future foreign invasion of the American Protestant South — pursuant to the evil Council of Trent.

HISTORY OF THE ORDER OF MALTA
The Order of St. John was founded before the taking of Jerusalem in 1099 by the armies of the First Crusade. It began as a monastic community, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, which administered a hospice-infirmary for pilgrims to the Holy Land. Originally connected with the Benedictines, it became, under Blessed Gerard (1120), an independent organization. By the Bull of 15 February 1113, addressed to Gerard, Pope Pascal II approved the confraternity of the Hospital of St. John, placed it under the protection of the Holy See, and ensured its right of freely electing its heads, Gerard’s successors, without any interference from any other ecclesiastical or any lay authority. In virtue of this Bull and of subsequent Papal acts, the Hospital became an exempt Order of the Church.
Owing to the political situation after the setting up by the Crusaders of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the Order, now under its second head (and the first to be styled Master), Fra Raymond du Puy, was obliged to assume military functions for the protection of the sick, the pilgrims, and the Christian territory which the Crusaders had won back from the Muslims. Accordingly, the Order of the Hospital of St. John acquired the additional character of an Order of Knighthood. The Knights were thus also Religious, bound by the three monastic vows of Obedience, Chastity, and Poverty. It thus became a persona mixta, a religious-military Order.
The Jesuits – 1801 - 1814



Chapter 19
Fra Raymond du Puy introduced the first rule of the Order known to us and also the white octagonal cross which has to this day remained the Order’s emblem (the Maltese Cross).
While continuing on a vast scale its hospitaller activity, one of its two aims: obsequium pauperum (service of the poor), the Order pursued valiantly its other aim – the defense of Christendom: tuitio fidei (protection of the Faith). However, in 1291, Acre, the last Christian stronghold in the Holy Land was lost and the Order settled temporarily in Cyprus.
From the beginning, the Order’s independence of all other States, in virtue of Papal acts, and its universally recognized right to maintain armed forces and wage war constituted its international sovereignty. With the occupation of the island of Rhodes, completed in 1310 under the Grand Master Fra Foulques de Villaret, the Order acquired territorial sovereignty as well (and the Knights of St. John came to be called Knights of Rhodes). The island faced Muslim territorial and naval might and became a bastion of Christendom in the East Mediterranean sea.
The military defense of Christendom now of necessity required naval action. Accordingly, the Order came to possess a powerful fleet; it patrolled the East Mediterranean waters and engaged in many renowned battles with the enemy. It took part in the crusades in Syria and in Egypt and brought aid to the Christian Kingdom of Armenia (Cilicia) against Muslim invaders.
The members of the Order who came to Rhodes from all over Europe, as well as the establishments of the Order in Europe, were from the beginning of the fourteenth century, grouped according to languages spoken. There were thus, initially, seven such groups of Langues (Tongues): Province, Auvergne, France, Italy Aragon(-Navarre), England (with Scotland and Ireland), Germany. In 1462 Castile and Portugal separated from the Langue of Aragon and formed together the eight Langues.
In the sixteenth century the Langue of England was suppressed and later, in 1782, temporarily reestablished under the name of the Anglo-Bavarian Langue. Each Langue was composed of Priories or Grand Priories, Bailiwicks, and Commanderies.
The Jesuits – 1801 - 1814



Vatican Assassins
The Order was ruled by the Grand Master and the Council, minted its own money and maintained diplomatic relations with other States. The Grand Master was Prince of Rhodes, as later he was Prince of Malta. The high offices of the Order were attributed to representatives of different Langues; and the seat of the Order, the Convent, was in effect composed of a number of national religious houses.
The Knights gallantly repulsed numerous Turkish assaults, until the Sultan Suleyman the Magnificent attacked Rhodes with a large fleet and a powerful army. On Christmas Eve of 1522 the Knights were forced to capitulate and, on 1 January 1523, left the island with military honors. For the next seven years the Order, while vested with international sovereignty, was deprived of territory, until the cession by the Emperor Charles V (in his capacity as King of Sicily) of the islands of Malta, Gozo, and Comino, as well as Tripoli in North Africa, in sovereign fief.
On 26 October 1530 the Grand Master Fra Philippe de Villiers de l’Isle-Adam took possession of Malta, with the approbation of Pope Clement VII. It was stipulated that the Order was to remain neutral in wars between Christian nations.
Yet the war of defense of Christendom went on. The Turks attacked Malta, but in the Great Siege, from 18 May to 8 September 1565, were finally routed by the Knights led by the heroic Grand Master Fra Jean de la Vallette-Parisot (after whom the island’s capital Valletta is named). The decline of Ottoman sea power dates from the defeat of 1565. The navy of the Order of St. John (or of Malta as it now came to be called) became one of the most powerful in the Mediterranean and took part in the final destruction of the Ottoman naval might in the great battle of Lepanto in 1571.
In 1607 and, again, in 1620, the dignity of Grand Master was conjoined with the title of Prince of the Holy Roman Empire and in 1630 with the rank equal to the dignity of a Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church with the style of Eminence.
In 1798 Bonaparte, engaged in a campaign against Egypt, occupied the island of Malta and drove out the Order. The Knights again found themselves without a home. This was followed by what has been called the Russian coup d’etat (1798-1803). The Emperor Paul I of Russia, who had shown himself a

Chapter 19
friend of the Order, now had himself proclaimed Grand Master by a handful of Knights then in Russia, in place of the Grand Master Fra Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim who had been obliged to abandon Malta to the French. This proclamation of a married non-Catholic as head of a Catholic religious order was wholly illegal and void, and never recognized by the Holy See (a necessary condition for legitimacy). Accordingly, Paul I, who was nevertheless accepted by many Knights and a number of governments can only be regarded as a Grand Master de facto, never one de jure. His successor Alexander I, on the other hand, helped the Order to return to legitimate rule; and in 1803 Fra Giovanni Battista Tommasi was elected Grand Master. The British had meantime occupied Malta in 1801 and though the Treaty of Amiens (1802) recognized the Order’s sovereign rights over the island, it has never been able to avail itself of them.
After temporary seats in Messina, Catania and Ferrara the Order finally established itself in 1834 in Rome, where it holds, extra-territorially, the Malta Palace at 68 Via Condotti and Villa on the Aventine. From 1805 the Order was ruled by Lieutenants, until in 1879 when Pope Leo XIII restored the Grandmastership and the honors of a Cardinal attaching to it. Hospitaller work, the original work of the Order, became once again its main concern. The hospital and welfare activities, undertaken on a considerable scale in World War I, were greatly intensified and expanded in World War II under the Grand Master Fra Ludovico Chigi della Rovere Albani [Albani della Rovere].
The activities of the Order have been further expanded under the rule of Grand Master Fra Angelo de Mojana di Cologna (1962-1988), who was succeeded by the present Prince and Grand Master Fra Andrew Bertie.
The Order of Malta constitutes the sole unbroken continuation of the Order of the Hospital of St. John recognized in 1113. It alone is a religious Order of the Catholic Church and at the same time a Catholic Order of Knighthood. It alone contains the governing nucleus of the professed Knights of Justice, direct successors of its founders, from among whom the Grand Master and most of the members of the Sovereign Council are elected, and which is placed above the ranks of the lay Knights, grown numerous since the fall of Malta. It has never ceased to be recognized by the community of nations as sovereign and independent of any civil power. These facts constitute the irrefutable proof of the Order’s unique historical identity and authenticity, to which no other organization can lay claim.
The Jesuits – 1801 - 1814



Vatican Assassins
The sovereignty of the Order is expressed in the diarchy of the Prince and Grand Master, who is its Supreme Head, and the Councils: the Sovereign Council, the General Chapter, and the Council Complete of State. The General Chapter is the supreme assembly of the Knights, is convened normally every five years, and elects members of the Sovereign Council; while the Council Complete of State is convened for the purpose of electing a Grand Master or a Lieutenant. Both the General Chapter and the Council Complete of State contain representatives of the Grand Priories, Priories, Sub- Priories, and National Associations, into which the Order is territorially divided throughout the world.
The full title of the Grand Master is, in Latin: Dei gratia Sacrae Domus Hospitalis Sancti Johannis Hierosolymitani et militaris Ordinis Sancti Sepulchri Domini magister humilis pauperumque Jesu Christi custos. (A part of this title commemorates the granting to the Grand Master Fra Pierre d’Aubusson [a Cardinal] of the Mastership of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre by Pope Innocent VIII in 1489, which grant proved temporary.) Enjoying the precedence of a Cardinal and therefore that of a Royal Prince as well as the dignity of Prince of the Holy Roman Empire (recognized later by Austria and Italy), and formerly a reigning Prince of Rhodes and then of Malta, the Grand Master is styled both Eminence and Highness, or Most Eminent Highness, and is internationally recognized as a Chief of State and sovereign honours are vested in him.
The Grand Master governs the Order with the assistance of the Sovereign Council, presided over by himself and composed of the four High Officers of the Grand Magistry elected by the General Chapter: the Grand Commander, the Grand Chancellor, the Hospitaller, and the Receiver of the Common Treasure, as well as of six Councillors. The holders of these offices are chosen from among the professed Knights and, exceptionally, from among the Knights of Obedience.
The Sovereign Pontiff is the Superior of the Order, as of any religious Order, and He nominates as His representative to it a Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church, styled Cardinalis Patronus: the latter is assisted by the Prelate of the Order, who is likewise appointed by the Sovereign Pontiff. The Prelate of the Order is the ecclesiastical superior of the Order’s clergy and the Grand Master’s assistant in the care for the spiritual welfare of the Order.
The Jesuits – 1801 - 1814



Chapter 19
The life and activities of the Order are regulated by the Constitutional Charter approved by the Holy See, and the Code. The Code de Rohan, promulgated by the Grand Master Fra Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc in the eighteenth century, retains its validity as a supplementary source of law, provided its provisions are applicable and not contrary to the other two sources of law. Juridical questions and problems of interest and importance for the Order are dealt with by the Consultative Juridical Council, appointed by the Grand Master with the consent of the Sovereign Council.
To deal with cases outside the competence of Canon Law and ecclesiastical Courts, the Order has its own Court of Law of First Instance and Courts of Appeal with the Presidents, Judges, Promoters of Justice, and Auxiliaries appointed by the Grand Master with the deliberative vote of the Sovereign Council. Appeals against the sentences of the Order’s Courts may be lodged with the Court of Cassation of the Vatican State, which, in such cases, acting by proxy on behalf of the Order, may exercise the functions of Supreme Court.
A Board of Auditors, elected by the General Chapter, controls the income and the expenditures of the Order.
Under the provisions of International Law, the Order maintains diplomatic relations, through accredited representatives, with the Holy See, on which, in its double nature, it depends as a religious Order, but of which, as a sovereign Order of Knighthood, it is independent, and through the exchange of such diplomatic representatives, with six European countries: Austria, Italy, Malta, Portugal, San Marino, Spain; with nineteen South American States: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Costa Rica, Cuba, El Salvador, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Dominican Republic, Uruguay, Venezuela; in Asia with the Philippines, Thailand, Lebanon; in Africa with Benin, Burkina, Faso Cameroun, Central Africa Republic, Comores, Egypt, Ethiopia, Gabon, Guinea, the Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Morocco; Niger, Senegal, Somalia, Togo, Tchad and Zaire. Moreover, it maintains Delegations in Belgium, France, Germany, Monaco and Switzerland, as well as at the Council of Europe, the UNESCO, the FAO and several International Organizations in Geneva.

international organization which, while never abandoning its aim of the defense of Christendom, is now dedicated to providing assistance in the hospitaller, charitable, and social fields in the widest possible meaning of these words. In particular the Order comes to the aid of those stricken by natural disasters and to the casualties of war.
THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION
On April 28, 1927 at the special request of the Holy Father, Pope Pius XI [whose confessors were Jesuits Alissiardi and Celebrano], the Supreme Council of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta granted a Constitution (Charter) creating the:
AMERICAN CHAPTER OF THE KNIGHTS OF THE SOVEREIGN MILITARY ORDER OF MALTA
(End of History of the Order of Malta having begun on page 240)
Recalling previous chapters, the Knights of Malta expelled the Jesuits from their island of Malta in 1768. So Napoleon the Freemason, with his French Fleet, was used by the Jesuits to return the insult, driving the Knights from Malta, absorbing their weapons and treasures thirty years later. (The Order never forgives or forgets!)
And to where would those ancient Crusaders go? The Knights sought and received protection from the Russian Tzar Paul I (having designated himself as their Grand Master) and stayed in his Imperial Palace from 1798 onward. It just so happened that on March 7, 1801, the Polish Jesuit Vicar General Franciskus Xavier Kareu, also appeared in Russia. (For it was in 1801 that the suppressed Company of Jesus was given legal existence and permission to reside in that “heretic” nation by Pope Pius VII). What reason could justify this secret rendezvous? The Knights of Malta and the Jesuit Order had mutual interests. They both wanted to take Jerusalem away from the Moslems and rebuild Solomon’s Temple for the Pope. So having been humbled by the Jesuits with Napoleon, they evidently agreed to be subordinate to the Jesuit General. The Knights would never be expelled from Russia unlike the Jesuit Order. By 1878, the Jesuit-trained Pope Leo XIII gave the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta the status of a Cardinal. This act formally subordinated these warriors to the Pope — the now “infallible” Pope under Jesuit control.
In 1927, the American Branch of the Knights of Malta was established at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York. One of the original thirteen founding members was John J. Raskob, the Chairman of the Board for General Motors and major financier of the Democratic Party. In the 1930s these criminals, including Joseph P. Kennedy, sought to create martial law in America by making FDR, the Shriner-Freemason, a

fascist, absolutist dictator. It was only appropriate, as FDR’s “alter ego,” advisor and speechwriter, was a “Jesuit of the short robe” (a secret lay Jesuit) and member of the General’s Council on Foreign Relations, the dirty Harry Hopkins. But the plot failed as a hero and two-time Medal of Honor recipient exposed the conspiracy. He was General Smedley Butler of the United States Marine Corps. May we pause and thank God for so great and courageous a man whom He used to temporarily deliver us Americans from a fascist bloodbath overseen by the Archbishop of New York!
Dear truth-seeker, the Knights and the Jesuits then and now work together! This may seem irrelevant but it is important for you to understand this connection. As we shall see, the Knights financed Lenin and Hitler from Wall Street also using their Federal Reserve Bank headed by a Masonic Jew and CFR member, Paul M. Warburg. The Knights negotiated the Concordat (a Papal treaty) between the Pope and Hitler in the person of Franz von Papen. The Knights, as American ambassadors, coordinated Roosevelt with Churchill and Pius XII using Joseph P. Kennedy and Myron C. Taylor, another CFR member. They also helped top Nazis to escape to North and South America after World War II using William J. Donovan, James J. Angleton, William J. Casey and Argentina’s President Juan D. Peron.
In America the Knights with their Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which later became the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), were behind the Pentagon’s “Operation Paperclip,” (publicly exposed in 1984) moving the Jesuit General’s Third Reich across the Atlantic. After World War II, over two thousand top Nazis and scientists were illegally secreted into the United States, including SS Major Werner von Braun. Many were placed in the top-secret military installation in Tonopah, Nevada known as “Area 51.” The perfection of the Nazis’ anti-gravity aircraft (flying saucers made of Pyrex with a mirrored finish by Corning Incorporated, General Electric Company and Lockheed Martin, all three corporations being represented on the Council on Foreign Relations) was to be completed there, among other secret light-electro-magnetic technologies. “Operation Paperclip” was overseen by America’s most powerful Knight of Malta, J. Peter Grace. Grace was subject to the Jesuit-trained Archbishop Spellman, as the American headquarters for the Knights was and is St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York.
Years later the Knights would oversee another clandestine event known as “Operation Mongoose.” Mongoose, like Hitler’s “Operation Barbarossa” was a Jesuit-controlled fascist Crusade, betrayed by high-ranking intelligence officers who were Knights of Malta loyal to the Jesuit General. The result of the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis and Operation Mongoose – all failures due to high treason – was the securing of Jesuit-trained Fidel Castro’s absolute power over Roman Catholic Cuba. For Communist Cuba is to serve as the Order’s staging base for a massive Sino-Soviet-Moslem-Mexican invasion into the last of the Reformation’s historically Protestant and Baptist Calvinist cultures — the South!
The Jesuits – 1801 - 1814



262 Vatican Assassins
At the time of the Bay of Pigs invasion the Director of the CIA was Allen W. Dulles whose nephew, Avery Dulles, was an active participant in Vatican II and is presently a powerful Jesuit and Cardinal at Fordham University in New York. Embarrassed, President Kennedy relieved Dulles of his command and appointed Knight of Malta John A. McCone as the Agency’s new Director. The President then took steps to break the CIA “into a thousand pieces.”
This the Jesuits would never permit! The CIA was a necessary tool in preventing popular government from emerging around the world. (It would betray the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 into the hands of the Russian Communist Army and KGB, among other nefarious acts.) The Jesuits’ great deception known as “The Cold War” must continue. Protestant America must be conquered from within, depriving her of sacred, Baptist liberties by “Royal Edicts” known as “Executive Orders.”
The Inquisition behind the “Iron Curtain” known as “communism” must continue. From 1917 to 1989 one hundred million people must be tortured and murdered, and the Bible must be suppressed. Indeed, the difference between the Jesuits’ Inquisition in Europe during World War II and the Jesuits’ Communist Inquisition in Orthodox Russia and in the Buddhist Far East is none. Both Inquisitions have been financed and supported by the Jesuit-controlled governments of the United States and Great Britain — to the shame and disgrace of both generally Protestant peoples! The Jesuits, refusing to permit President Kennedy to destroy their CIA, called upon their fanatical “Cold Warrior,” Francis Cardinal Spellman. He in turn called upon the head of his American “tongue” of the Knights of Malta, J. Peter Grace. The plan was to assassinate President Kennedy in broad daylight as a warning to the heads of all nations should they dare to interfere with the Pope’s International Intelligence Community enforcing his Temporal Power. Meanwhile, the Jesuit-trained, communist Cuban dictator Castro sent his ambassador to the Nation State of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta — to this day!)
After Pope Pius VII was released from Napoleon’s prison in 1814, he obediently restored the Society of Jesus with a Papal Bull, Solicitudo omnium ecclesiarum, promulgated on August 7 of that very year. (A Bull is the strongest legal document a Pope can issue.) In that Bull of Restoration, the Pope added:
“ . . . if any should again attempt to abolish it [the Society of Jesus] he would incur the indignation of Almighty God and of the Holy Apostles
Peter and Paul.” {4}
As a result, in 1816:
“John Adams wrote Thomas Jefferson about Pope Pius VII’s reinstatement of Jesuits repressed by Pope Clement XIV:
The Jesuits – 1801 - 1814



Chapter 19 263
‘My history of the Jesuits is not eloquently written, but it is supported by unquestionable authorities, is very particular and very horrible. Their restoration is indeed a step toward darkness, cruelty, perfidy, despotism, death . . . I do not like the appearance of the Jesuits. If ever there was a body of men who merited eternal damnation on earth and in hell, it is this Society of Loyola’s.’ ” {5}
On July 13th, 1886, Pope Leo XIII issued a Brief, after enduring three days of severe illness, restoring all the remaining privileges withheld by Pius VII upon the Order’s re-establishment in 1814, to do as they would please unrestrained by any human authority, as no Pope or Grandmaster of the Knights of Malta has successfully challenged the power of the General of the Jesuits, known as “the Black Pope.”
Since 1814 the General has kept the Pope in check. If a Pope becomes politically “liberal” favoring the rights of the people, he is punished, as Pius IX in 1848. (Pius resisted the policy of the Jesuits’ Holy Alliance by declaring himself a liberal, favoring popular government, as he proclaimed a general amnesty to political offenders and began to form a Constitution for Italy with his minister, Count Pellegrini L. O. Rossi, who was later assassinated. This resulted in the Jesuits causing a revolution in 1848 forcing the Pope to flee the city. Upon his return in 1849, protected by the French troops of Louis Napoleon, Pius IX obeyed his Jesuit masters becoming thoroughly absolutist for the rest of his Pontificate.) But if the Pope determines to resist the power and purpose of the “Father General” he suddenly dies, as Pope John XXIII in 1963. (Pope John resisted Jesuit General Janssen’s
secret policy of continuing the Papacy’s Cold War that had been birthed by President Truman, General Douglas MacArthur and General Curtis LeMay. He promoted the Order’s open policy of ending the Cold War in seeking to establish a World Government put forth during the Second Vatican Council.) A few months later President Kennedy was assassinated as he pursued the World-Government policy of Pope John XXIII in seeking to prematurely end the Cold War by withdrawing troops from Vietnam. That assassination was carried out by the Cold Warriors of Cardinal Spellman. They were the Knights of Malta and Shriners in alliance with the Jesuits.
Indeed, President Kennedy was wounded in the house of his friends, one of them being his own father – Cardinal Spellman’s once most powerful Knight of Malta during the Roosevelt years – Joseph P. Kennedy! Dear truth-seeker, never forget these words of Ignatius Loyola, though spoken over four centuries ago, having pierced our unguarded hearts on November 22, 1963:
“Finally; – Let all with such artfulness gain the ascendant [ascendancy] over princes, noblemen, and the magistrates of every place, that they may be ready at our beck, even to sacrifice their nearest relations and most intimate friends, when we say it is for our interest and advantage.” {6}

“MELCHOIR [MELCHIOR] INCHOFFER, a Jesuit suspected to be the author of the “Monarchy of Solipsos,” was violently carried away clandestinely from Rome, whither he had returned to petition the Pope. The FATHER SCOTTI, the true author of the “Solipsos,” escaped with difficulty the poniard and the poison.” {1}

“ . . . the Jesuits [upon the Pope being declared “infallible” in 1870] wished to take a step towards the accomplishment of their great object of establishing a universal monarchy with the White Pope nominally at the head and the Black Pope holding the reins.” {2} [Emphasis added]
M. F. Cusack, 1896 Converted Nun of Kenmare The Black Pope
Dear truth-seeker, you have now finished your Second Block of Jesuit history. Once again it is time to pause and reflect. You now have an understanding of the most important forty-one years in Modern History. You must remember the Jesuits created other international secret societies prior to and during this time. Working together they brought about the tremendous upheaval in 1789, to which the movement of modern Communism is traced, resulting in the Napoleonic Wars.
By 1815, at the time of Satan’s Congress of Vienna, the Jesuits were more powerful than before their suppression. Their purposes remained the same. The

Jesuits had united under THE POWER of the Black Pope all Freemasonry (using Adam Weishaupt and his Illuminati in 1776, Adolph von Knigge at the Congress of Wilhelmsbad in 1782, at which the Papal “compass and square” – appearing in the stained-glass windows at the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris – first began to assume its Masonic significance, and Frederick the Great creating the Supreme Council of Thirty-third degrees (remembering that even as the Society of Jesus has its Constitutions, even so Shriner Freemasonry has its Constitutions) in 1786) and sought to destroy the Protestant Reformation returning the world to the Pope’s Dark Ages. They would terribly persecute the Jews as in the Dark Ages while seeking to exalt the Papal Caesar to the place of a Satanic Egyptian Pharaoh – an “infallible” Druidic Roman Caesar and Priest-King, ruling the world from Jerusalem as “the universal god” (like the Grecian “PAN” or Egyptian “SET” of old, symbolized by the goat’s head of Mendes. This Satanic goat’s head depicted by “the Baphomet” was, according to Von Hammer in his Mines de l’ Orient, 1818, the symbol worshipped in the secret rites of those bloody Crusaders for the Popes, the Knights Templars, known today as Shriner Freemasons). He would exercise the power of an absolute Monarch over all the kings and dictators of the earth. In so doing the Jesuits would suppress any attempt by any people to establish popular, or as they called it, “liberal” government. These maxims would never change because the Jesuit Order would never change, remembering the words of former Jesuit General Lorenzo Ricci:
“Let them be as they are or else not be!” {3}
It is with these insights that we shall fully understand the Nineteenth Century leading into World War I. The Brotherhood will make great gains, as in its reentrance into Japan (1865), its assassination of the Japanese Emperor Komei and the overthrow, via resignation, of the Japanese Tokugawa shogun (1867-1868), Japan’s lifting of “the Christian Ban” (1873), its destruction of America’s Protestant and Baptist-Calvinist Republic (1868) and the Pope being declared to be “infallible” (1870). The Order will also experience great losses, as in Pope Pius IX losing his Temporal Power to the Italian patriots (1870), as well as its expulsion from the German Empire (1872) and from Republican France (1880 and 1901).
But the Jesuits never forsake their grand design. With a will of steel, inspired of Satan, they regrouped in America and England, maneuvered their forces into critical positions throughout the world and then, at the will of their “Father General,” ignited gigantic wars, the outcomes of which the Jesuits held in their hands. They further amassed power and wealth, moving ever closer to the “infallible” Papal Caesar and Priest-King of their making, ruling all the nations of the world through the Jesuit General’s universal “Monarchy of Solipsos” from his palace-temple located at the center of the earth, from Solomon’s rebuilt Temple in Jerusalem!

Out of the Order’s harsh Russian exile would this Dutchman descend upon Europe to be the backbone of Prince Metternich’s Holy Alliance. Rightly hailed as the “Second Founder” of the military Society of Jesus “fighting for Jesus and the Virgin Mary,” this man of destiny would plot the destruction of George Washington’s American Calvinist Republic. For we speak of none other than the most diabolical Luciferian High Priest of the Nineteenth Century, Johannes Roothaan, the 21st Superior General of the Jesuits, 1829 to 1853.

The Congress of Vienna The Holy Alliance Prince Metternich
“When Sovereigns require a Jesuit’s opinion on any subject, the Jesuit in question is to report the matter to his Superior, who is to lay it before several Jesuits for discussion. The resolution formed after this consultation is supplied to the Jesuit who has been consulted by the Sovereign.” {1}
Mutius Vitelleschi, 1645 6th Jesuit General, 1615-1645 Goswin Nickel, 1652 10th Jesuit General, 1652-1664 Instruction to Provincials The Jesuit Enigma
“They are Jesuits. This society of men, after exerting their tyranny for upwards of two hundred years, at length became so formidable to the world, threatening the entire subversion of all social order, that even the Pope, whose devoted subjects they are, and must be, by the vow of their society, was compelled to dissolve them. They had not been suppressed, however, for fifty years, before the waning influence of Popery and Despotism required their useful labors, to resist the light of Democratic liberty, and the Pope (Pius VII), simultaneously with the formation of the Holy Alliance, revived the order of the Jesuits in all their power. From their vow of “unqualified submission to the Sovereign Pontiff,” they have been appropriately called the Pope’s Body Guard.
And do Americans need to be told what Jesuits are? . . . they are a secret society, a sort of Masonic order, with superadded features of revolting odiousness, and a thousand times more dangerous. They are not merely priests, or of one religious creed; they are merchants, and lawyers, and editors, and men of any profession, having no outward badge, (in this country) by which to be recognized; they are about in all your society.



Chapter 20
They can assume any character, that of angels of light, or ministers of darkness to accomplish their one great end, the service upon which they are sent, whatever that service may be. They are all educated men, prepared and sworn to start at any moment, and in any direction, and for any service, commanded by the general of their order, bound to no family, community, or country, by the ordinary ties which bind men; and sold for life to the cause of the Roman Pontiff.” {2}
Samuel Morse, 1850 American Patriot, Artist, Inventor Journal of Commerce
“The sovereigns of the ‘Holy Alliance’ had massed large armies, and soon entered into a pledge to devote them to the suppression of all uprisings of the people in favor of free government; and he [Pius VII] desired to devote the Jesuits, supported by his pontifical power, to the accomplishment of that end. He knew how faithfully they would apply themselves to that work, and hence he counseled them, in his decree of restoration, to strictly observe the ‘useful advices and salutary counsels’ whereby Loyola had made absolution the cornerstone of the society.” {3}
R. W. Thompson, 1894 Ex-Secretary, American Navy The Footprints of the Jesuits
“The Congress of Vienna . . . which had held its session secret, covering the whole year of 1814-15 . . . was a black conspiracy against Popular Governments at which the ‘high contracting parties’ announced at its close that they had formed a ‘holy alliance.’ This was a cloak under which they masked to deceive the people. The particular business of the Congress of Verona it developed, was the RATIFICATION of Article Six of the Congress of Vienna, which was in short, a promise to prevent or destroy Popular Government wherever found, and to re-establish monarchy where it had been set aside.” {4}

The business at hand was now to suppress the movements for free government in Europe and elsewhere. The Jesuits had used the people and Napoleon to punish the Monarchs. The people, excited with the taste of republican freedom, must now be prevented from establishing “liberal” or non-absolutist governments. So the Congress of Vienna, having created “the Holy Alliance,” was called in 1814, while the Papal Caesar restored his Bodyguard, the Society of Jesus, to its former status as the Order had existed before the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars.
The Congress of Vienna had representatives from all the sovereigns in Europe. Tzar Alexander I attended personally. As evidence of its Jesuit control, there was even a representative from Protestant England. The three major players were the sovereigns from Russia, Prussia and Austria, overseen by the Pope, “King of the Papal States.” (This is important to remember; for, when the Jesuits decided to change their form of absolutism from Roman Catholic, feudalistic, Machiavellian monarchies to Atheistic, socialist-communist, Platonic “republics,” in contrast to Protestant-Calvinist, free enterprise, Biblical republics as established in Holland, South Africa, England and America, all three monarchies were permanently abolished by the end of World War I.) By the time that “Summit” in Austria had terminated in 1815, the nations of Europe had been realigned and the monarchies reestablished under the watchful eye of the acting “Holy Roman Emperor,” Prince Metternich, and the “Grand Inquisitor” himself, Jesuit General Brzozowski.
The Congress, in purposing to destroy all movements for popular liberty, had for its head, the evil Prince von Metternich of Austria. What Napoleon was to the Monarchs, Metternich would be to the peoples. Of this beast of a man we read from the father of Morse Code, Samuel F. B. Morse:
“ ‘Prince Metternich,’ says Dwight, ‘is regarded by the liberals of Europe as the greatest enemy of the human race who has lived for ages. You rarely hear his name mentioned without exciting indignation, not

only in the speaker but in the auditors. Metternich has not been attacking MEN but PRINCIPLES, and has done so much towards destroying on the continent those great political truths which nations have acquired through ages of effort and suffering, that there is reason to fear, should his system continue for half a century, liberty will forsake the continent to visit it no more. The Saxons literally abhor this Prince. The German word mitternacht means midnight. From the resemblance of the word to Metternich, as well from his efforts to cover Europe with political darkness, the Saxons call him Prince Mitternacht — Prince Midnight.’ ” {6} [Emphasis added]
And what did this “Prince Midnight” do? He enforced the political tyranny of “the White Terror,” commonly known as “the Holy Alliance.” Morse continues:
“He persuaded the Emperor of Austria and King of Prussia not to fulfill the promise they so solemnly made to their [Protestant and Catholic] German subjects of giving them free constitutions. It was the influence of Metternich that prevented Alexander [Tzar and protector of the Russian Orthodox Church] from assisting [Orthodox] Greece in her struggles for liberty. [Could this Jesuit political control be the same reason “the Former Soviet Union” did not give aid to their Orthodox Serbian brothers during the War in Bosnia in 1998?] He lent Austrian vessels to assist the [Moslem] Turks in the subjugation of the [Orthodox] Greeks. [Was this not President Clinton’s policy for the Serbs of Kosovo in 1999?] Metternich crushed the liberties of [Roman Catholic] Spain by inducing Louis XVIII [King of France] . . . to send 100,000 men there . . . to restore public order! When Sicily, Naples and Genoa, in 1820-21, threw off the galling yoke of slavery, Metternich sent his 30,000 [Roman Catholic] Austrian bayonets into [Roman Catholic] Italy and re-established despotism.” {7}[Emphasis added]
Prince Metternich was a most faithful tool of his occult Black-robed shadow, Jesuit General Johannes Roothaan. For “Prince Midnight’s rule was shored up by a standing army of soldiers, a sitting army of bureaucrats, a kneeling army of priests, and a creeping army of informers.” His Congress of Vienna enforced the political tyrannies championed by the Jesuit Order and their Council of Trent — regardless of the religion of any nation including Roman Catholicism. Metternich was also the bosom friend of that “Radical Red/Black Republican” from Massachusetts, Senator Charles Sumner. Sumner was the leading radical in the Senate, whose Federal “Grande Armee of the Republic” conducted a war of annihilation against the peoples of the American Protestant and Baptist-Calvinist South from 1861 to 1865.

As we shall see, Rome’s present quest for an international fascist, socialist-communist police state is the same policy of the Jesuit General’s Holy Alliance. That policy of “no religious freedom” and “no political freedom” has been continued by the Black Pope’s International Intelligence Community which, with its Global International Banking System managed by the Pope’s Knights of Malta laundering trillions of dollars in ill-gotten gain having been criminally generated by the Jesuit General’s Mafia-aided International Drug Trade, is then financing, managing and directing the Jesuit General’s diabolical and merciless Global Terrorist Network. It includes Fidel Castro of Cuba, Gerry Adams of the IRA, Saddam Hussein of Iraq, Yassir Arafat of the PLO (secretly working with Zionist Israel’s Jesuit-trained Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, in continuing the Palestinian agitation for the benefit of the Papacy and its ultimate possession of Jerusalem’s Temple Mount) and Saudi Arabia’s Osama bin Laden who now has been declared to be “dead” by the FBI’s chief of counter terrorism, Dale Watson. Although a tool of the CIA himself, Bin Laden has been the willing “scapegoat” for its remotely controlled aerial attack (using “hijacked” American airliners) on the Twin Towers of New York’s World Trade Center, then INTERNALLY IMPLODED by the CIA, and on the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. (this high treason being entirely managed by the Archbishop of New York, Edward Cardinal Egan). At the time, President George W. Bush was conveniently in Florida innocently speaking to children having been given secret instructions to follow after a recent visit to the Vatican by that forerunner of Satan’s Antichrist, Pope John Paul II. Americans will now unite to ignorantly fight a Middle East War enabling the Black Pope’s MI6/CIA/Mossad/ISI to destroy Jerusalem’s Dome of the Rock during the confusion of war. Persecution of Bible-believers and Jews will be strictly enforced during the General’s coming New World Order — the restoration of the “infallible” Papal Caesar’s Dark Ages. The propaganda being used among Bible-rejecting intellectuals to bring this about is called “the New Age Movement,” the conclusion of that agenda culminating in
“ . . . that man of sin . . . ”

Key to his great Satanic Power will be his Baal-worshipping, Jewish False Prophet who,
“ . . . had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.”

“ . . . Jesuitism inspired its followers with fanaticism . . . There was no crime too great for them to commit, no deception too base for them to practice, no disguise too difficult for them to assume . . . It was a fundamental principle of the order that the end justifies the means. By this code, lying, theft, perjury, assassination, were not only pardonable but commendable, when they served the interests of the church. Under various disguises the Jesuits worked their way into offices of state, climbing up to be the counselors of kings, and shaping the policy of nations.” {1}
Ellen G. White, 1888 Founder, Seventh-Day Adventist Church The Great Controversy
The Jesuits had not only conspired against the peoples of Europe, they had also conspired to overthrow the government of the United States as its Constitution protected the rights of Protestant American freemen. (Remember at the breaking out of the American Revolution there were less than thirty thousand Roman Catholics and twenty-four priests in the Colonies.) Of this great conspiracy we read the words of Senator Robert L. Owen recorded in the Diplomatic Code, by Jonathan Elliot, page 179:
“The Holy Alliance having destroyed the popular government in Spain, and in Italy, had well-laid plans to destroy popular government in the American Colonies which had revolted from Spain and Portugal in Central and South America under the influence of the successful example of the United States. It was because of this conspiracy against the American Republic by the European monarchies that the great English statesman, [Prime Minister George] Canning, called the attention of our government to it, and our statesmen then, including Thomas Jefferson, who was still living at that time, took an active part

to bring about the declaration by President Monroe in his next annual message to the Congress of the United States that the United States would regard it as an act of hostility to the government of the United States and an unfriendly act, if this coalition, or if any power of Europe ever undertook to establish upon the American continent any control of any American republic, or to acquire any territorial rights.
This is the so-called Monroe Doctrine. The threat under the secret treaty of Verona to suppress popular government in the American republics is the basis of the Monroe Doctrine. This secret treaty sets forth clearly the conflict between the government of the few as against the government of the many.” {2} [Emphasis added]
Yes, dear truth-seeker, the Holy Alliance of 1815 with its Secret Treaty of Verona of 1822 was a massive conspiracy against the government and people of the United States as established by George Washington.
The Monroe Doctrine was put forth in 1823 to resist this conspiracy. It was the basis for President Lincoln commanding the French army – sent by the Jesuits’ Napoleon III – to leave Mexico, during the War Between the States. This Monroe Doctrine was the basis by which President Kennedy commanded the Russian fleet to stay out of Cuba during the Missile Crisis of 1962. Ultimately, both Lincoln and Kennedy were assassinated by Loyola’s Blackrobes, surnamed The Engineer Corps of Hell, as both sought to resist the Jesuit General’s policies of the Holy Alliance in making their Papal Caesar the Theocratic Universal Monarch of the World.
In addition to the Congress of Vienna and the secret Treaty of Verona, the Jesuit Order further perfected its grand design in a little town called Chieri located in Italy. The following quote, assembled from Abate Leone’s The Jesuit Conspiracy: The Secret Plan of the Order, is taken from Augusta Cooke’s great book, Bolshevism and the Jesuits’ Church: Throne and Empire in Danger, published in the early 1930s. The quote appears to be a combination of the Company’s Secret Instructions of the Jesuits and The Protocols of the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion. We read with wonder at the audacity of these words:
“SECRET PLANS AT CHIERI
In 1825, some eleven years after the revival of the Jesuit Order, a secret meeting of leading Jesuits was held at their College at Chieri near Turin, in Northern Italy. At that gathering plans were discussed for the advancement of Papal power, world-wide, for the destabilizing of governments who stood in the way and for the crushing of all opposition

to Jesuit schemes and ambitions. A young Jesuit, named Leone, a favourite of the Rector at Chieri (who subsequently became General of the Order) took notes of the speeches and discussions at Chieri and these were afterwards published by a French publisher. In 1848 they were translated into English and published as a book entitled [The Jesuit Conspiracy:] The Secret Plan [of the Order] by Leone, which has been thoroughly authenticated and can be read in the Library of the British Museum. It makes enlightening reading and we will now reproduce some extracts as originally published by the late Augusta Cooke.
A. Long Term Plan for World Government
The first generation will not belong to us; the second will nearly belong to us; the third will entirely belong to us. You well know that what we aim at, is the Empire of the World.
B. Working in Secret and Using Duplicity
Let us prefer a Secret War, let us shun too much light.
Every Bishop must vigorously act upon this principle, be gentle but inflexible — Let him know how to assume the demeanor of a lamb...which will win all hearts; but let him also know how to act with the fierceness of a raging lion when he is called upon to defend the rights of the Church . . . Nothing ought in fact to distinguish us in appearance from other men. Yes, the Catholic exterior may be sociable but let him not the less cherish within him concentrated rage and unconquerable antipathy.
C. Working by Revolution and Class Warfare to Destabilize Opponents
When the ebullition [state of boiling agitation] which we are secretly fomenting shall have reached a sufficient point, the cover shall be suddenly removed, and we shall pour our liquid fire upon those political meddlers who are ignorant and unreflecting enough to serve as tools in our hands, and our efforts will result in a Revolution, worthy of the name, which shall combine in one universal conquest, all the conquests that have been made. For I would not have it lost sight of, that our chief concern must be to mould the people to our purpose . . . yes, the people are the vast domain we have to conquer . . . the higher classes are always very inaccessible to the lower ones. Let us nourish their mutual

Chapter 21
antipathy. Let us accustom the mob, which is in fact an implement of power to look upon us as its warmest advocates: favouring its desires, let us feed the fire of its wrath and open to its view a golden age [the New World Order].
D. Influencing the Great and Powerful
It is upon the great that we ought particularly to exert our influence. We ought to bring them to believe that in a period as storming as this there is no safety for them but through us. We must give them to understand that the cause of evil, the bad leaven, will remain as long as Protestantism shall exist, that Protestantism must therefore be utterly abolished.
E. Using Writers and Authors
We ought by every possible means to secure the aid of modern thinkers, whatever be the nature of their opinions. If they can be induced at all, to write in our favour, let us pay them well either in money or laudation [America’s Council on Foreign Relations].
F. Ireland Their Hope
Initiated fathers [Professed Jesuits], great are the hopes I build on the energies of OUR IRELAND. I regard her as OUR CHAMPION. Let us only be careful to anoint her effectually with our oil, so that in wrestling with her tyrant she may always slip from his grasp. In how many folds may she not entangle the British she-wolf if she will but listen to our counsels . . . What may we not make of an idiot, savage and famishing people (the Irish)? [Is this what the Jesuits think of their Irish Catholics?] It will prove our Samson and with its irresistible jawbone it will grind to dust the myriads of Philistines (the British).
And now we learn what is the baptism of fire, which at each confession I used to pour upon the heads of my penitents in Ireland:
‘Poor people’ I say to them, ‘How have they degraded you . . . look at these great landlords, they revel in wealth, they devour the land, they laugh at you . . . and yet if you knew how to count up your strength you are stronger than they [agitating poor Catholics against wealthy Protestants justifying socialist-communism].’
The Jesuits – 1822 - 1825

G. A Catholic ‘Master Race’
The Catholic people is the successor to the people of God (Israel) [Amillennialism], consequently, heretics are the enemies (Canaanites) we are bound to exterminate. We may say that God designs for extermination, like the Canaanites, all the nations that obstinately refuse to enter into the unity of the Church, and that the Vicar of Jesus Christ (the Pope) is appointed to execute these judgments in due time.
H. Hatred for Protestants
All will go well for us provided we can obtain that the Catholic from his childhood shall abhor even the breath of a heretic. Catholics shall be imbued with hatred for heretics, whoever they may be and that this hatred shall constantly increase and bind them closely to each other. That it be nevertheless dissembled so as not to transpire until the day when it shall be appointed to break forth. That this secret hate be combined with great activity in endeavouring to detach the faithful from every government inimical to us and to employ them when they shall form a detached body to strike deadly blows at heresy [Stalin’s NKVD, Donovan’s OSS, Menzies’ SIS and Hitler’s SS].
When the evening comes we shall pay them in good money for the Middle Ages. Do they flatter themselves that no spark still smoulders in the ashes around the stake to kindle another fire . . . they are far from dreaming that we alone know how to prepare another revolution [The Second Thirty Years’ War, 1914-1945], compared with which all theirs have been but pigmy insurrections. In calling us ‘Jesuits’ they think they have covered us with opprobrium. They little think that Jesuits have in store for them the censorship gags and flames and will one day be their masters.
I. Destroying Protestantism
We cherish at the bottom of our hearts this principle — that whatever does not unite with us must be ANNIHILATED and we hold ourselves ready to make as soon as we shall have the means [the Federal Reserve Bank], an energetic application of these principles.
Protestantism is already wearing out and sinking to decay. Yes we are destined to insult its last agonies, to march over its broken skeleton and scattered bones. O let us hasten this dissolution by our strong and

Chapter 21 283
united efforts. Protestantism is becoming decomposed; it is falling to pieces. We are beginning to gain from it men of note [England’s John Cardinal Newman] and there are even high personages whom we have succeeded in convincing that if they continue to uphold Protestantism, they are lost.
J. View of the Bible
Then the Bible [The Authorized King James Version of 1611], that serpent which with head erect and eyes flashing threatens us with its venom while it trails along the ground, shall be changed into a rod as soon as we are able to seize it [The English Revised Version (as well as the many succeeding versions) completed in 1881, based on a corrupt, pro-Latin Vulgate Greek Text pursuant to the Jesuit General’s Council of Trent, and hailed by the Jesuits in Dublin, Ireland as “the death knell of Protestantism,” the culminating work of the English Revision Committee being the result of a “conspiracy” in the words of the Dean of Chichester and master Greek scholar, John Burgon] . . . for three centuries past this cruel asp has left us no repose. You well know with what folds it entwines us and with what fangs it gnaws us.” {3} [Emphasis added]
[The Society of Jesus, in control of the world’s major universities and thus the sciences, would continue its attack on the inerrancy of the Protestant Reformation’s “final authority of faith and practice.” With the Bible teaching “geocentricity,” that the earth is stationary and therefore “cannot be moved” (Psalm 93:1), while the sun orbits around the earth traveling on its daily “circuit” (Psalm 19:6), both the Order and the Craft would use their corrupted form of “astronomy” to promote the opposite. (For Tycho Brahe, a Danish Protestant and the foremost geocentric astronomer of the Sixteenth Century, was given the Order’s “poison cup” in 1564 by his heliocentric assistant and student, Johannes Kepler, whose uncle was a Jesuit!) The Satanic sun worshipping doctrine of "heliocentricity,” that the earth “rotates on its axis while revolving around the sun,” would continue be forced down the throat of the world’s scientific community using one of the Pope’s Court Jews, the Masonic Jewish Zionist Albert Einstein, who openly advocated the rebuilding of Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem. Heliocentricity would ultimately become a religious tenet, disbelief of which would constitute a scientific “heresy” resulting in the expulsion and “excommunication” from the world’s “Holy Mother Scientific Church.”]

He, along with our hero Charles Chiniquy, also warned President Lincoln that the Jesuits, priests and nuns of Rome were merely agents of a foreign power, and that the War Between the States was a work of the Jesuits, having been planned deep within the Vatican since the Order’s evil and subversive Secret Treaty of Verona finalized in 1822.

“What is important is that a large sector of the public had gradually come to see, behind the Jesuits’ impressive front of world-wide influence a sinister design — a secret drive for power.” {1}
Ernest O. Hauser, 1959 American Journalist The Saturday Evening Post
“ ‘Learn to know us, and in the first place know that in our first book we lied. We spoke of liberty of instruction. That means that the clergy alone should teach (Instruction belongs to the clergy, of divine right. The University has usurped. Either the University or Catholicism must give place.) . . . We spoke of liberty of the press — for ourselves alone. It is a lever of which the priest should obtain possession. As for industrial liberty, ‘to seize upon the different kinds of industry, is a duty of the church.’ The liberty of worship! Let’s not speak of it! It is an invention of [Roman Emperor] Julian the Apostate [who rightly diminished Rome’s centralized power]. We will no longer tolerate mixed marriages! They performed such marriages at the Court of Catherine de Medici, on the eve of St. Bartholomew!
Let them take care! We are the strongest. We give a sufficient proof of it, and one that cannot be answered; it is, that all the powers of Europe are against us. Except two or three little States, the whole world condemns us.’ ” {2} [Emphasis added]

Chapter 22 287
By the year 1820 the Jesuits were in high gear restoring “the altar and the throne” in Europe. But their first major setback occurred when Tzar Alexander I expelled them from Russia. Of this great day we read:
“The Russian emperor, Alexander, was currently compelled to issue a royal ukase in 1816, by which he expelled them from St. Petersburg and Moscow. This proving ineffectual, he issued another in 1820, excluding them entirely from the Russian dominions. The emperor set forth in his decree that he had intrusted them with the education of youth, and had imposed no restrictions upon their right to profess and practice their own religion, but that they had ‘abused the confidence which was placed in them, and misled their inexperienced pupils;’ that whilst they enjoyed toleration themselves, ‘they implanted a hard intolerance in the natures infatuated by them;’ and that all their efforts ‘were directed merely to secure advantages for themselves, and the extension of their power, and their conscience found in every refractory action a convenient justification in their statutes’ . . . ‘where, in fact, is the State that would tolerate in its bosom those who sow in it hatred and discord.’ ” {3}
(Yes, dear truth-seeker, right here in Fourteenth Amendment America, the “Union of American Socialist Republics”! The Order also took refuge in Quebec, Canada resulting in ninety percent of its Prime Ministers being Roman Catholic!)
The Jesuits were now formally expelled from Russia and would not be allowed to re-enter for over one hundred years. In 1922 the Bolshevik and Jewish Freemason, Vladimir Lenin, would give the Jesuit Order permission to return to the Jesuit General’s “Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.” Meanwhile, the Sons of Loyola were busy using England in restoring the Monarchs to their thrones in Europe. (Indeed, the Nineteenth Century was “the British Century”!) They would also use England to suppress and hinder movements seeking to establish popular liberty. What a disgrace to the land of Oliver Cromwell! Of this we read:
“Amid all the crimes of Napoleon, let it be forever remembered that he annihilated this earthly hell [the Inquisition] with a word — but Englishmen restored [King] Ferdinand [VII] to the throne of Spain, [in 1814] and Ferdinand restored the inquisition. [King Ferdinand VII of Spain not only restored the Inquisition but also readmitted the Jesuit Order, as did the Masonic Louis XVIII of France.]” {4}
England also gave no help to the Italian patriots seeking to end Papal tyranny enforced by republican France, her troops under the command of the Jesuit General’s Louis Napoleon — Napoleon III. We read:
The Jesuits – 1820 - 1848

“On the return of the Pope [Pius IX] to Rome in 1849, and the overthrow of Italian liberty by the French republic [controlled by the Jesuits’ future Napoleon III], the Roman patriots fled to British Malta, but were refused an asylum by the British governor, who, being a Roman Catholic, and, as such, owing a first allegiance to the Pope, dared not to give refuge to the enemies of the Church of Rome.” {5}
Indeed, the history of the government of England from 1815 to the present has been entirely pro-Rome! She has never gone to war against France, especially the government of Napoleon III thanks to her treasonous Prime Minister and Shriner Freemason, Viscount Palmerston (1830-1865); but, to the contrary, has sided with the French during both the Crimean War (1856) and the war in China against the Manchu Dynasty (1860). She also sided with France when the Jesuits’ Napoleon III sent his troops to invade Mexico during the American “Civil War,” as well as during World War I and World War II — the Second Thirty Years’ War.
It is for this reason that England, France and the Pope never gave any true aid to the Protestant government of the Southern Confederacy during the American Civil War, properly called “the War Between the States” or “the War for Southern Independence.” England threatened war with the North if Lincoln (having only forty-four percent of the popular vote) would not radically emancipate the southern slaves. As calculated, the Emancipation Proclamation destroyed the Southern culture that generally had been a blessing to the Negroes, in contrast to their barbarism and cannibalism in Africa. France sent troops into Mexico pretending to unite with the Confederacy, but withdrew giving only the appearance that it favored the South.
(Pope Pius IX, towards the end of the war, sent a letter to Jefferson Davis calling him the “President of the United States.” This too was a ruse of war, as Pius IX could have prevented the immigration and enlistment of thousands of Irish Roman Catholics in the Northern Army, thereby sparing Protestant Georgia of General Sherman’s raping and thieving “bummers” during his Crusader’s march from Atlanta to Savannah. Clearly, “the Holy Alliance” with its Jesuits, favored the North and its Radical Red Republican party, the new Federalists.)
It is for this reason that the Crown of England – the supposed protector of the anti-Pope, Anglican Church – never resisted the Jesuits’ Oxford Movement from 1833 to 1845. This Tractarian Movement led by the rank Jesuits E. B. Pusey and John Newman – the John Newman who defected to Rome and was made a Cardinal by the Jesuits’ Pius IX – was never publicly condemned by any English Monarch including Queen Victoria. For if the Oxford Movement had been exposed as a plot of the Jesuits to Catholicize England, the ensuing Revision Committee would never

have been allowed to undermine the Bible of England’s grand and glorious Protestant and Calvinist Reformation — The Authorized King James Version of 1611.
It is for this reason that the Jesuits used England to take Palestine from the Turks during World War I with the Arabs of Lawrence of Arabia and the British Army of General Allenby. And in so doing the Jesuits with their Knights of Malta in England sought to create the Zionist Nation of Israel. Avro Manhattan declares:
“ . . . [Knight of Malta and Wahhabi Moslem] St. John Philby . . . told the author in strictest confidence: how Lawrence of Arabia, while posing as the Arab’s champion, had gone to London in secret, at least on two occasions, ‘to confer with [33rd Degree Freemason] Churchill and the [Masonic Jewish anti-Torah] Zionists,’ who were then planning the future state of Israel, even before the end of World War I.” {6}
With the Balfour Declaration in 1917, a steady influx of Jews transpired for thirty years when, in 1948, England gave the land to the Pope’s Masonic Jewish anti-Torah Zionists, heavily financed by the Jesuits’ Illuminati House of Rothschild. In 1967 the Temple site was taken from the Moslems enabling the Masonic Jews to lay the plans for the rebuilding of Solomon’s Temple. The Arabs fully anticipated this. Pierre van Paassen, a friend of the Jewish People, speaking fluent Hebrew and one of the greatest international correspondents of his day, wrote in 1939:
“In 1929 the Mufti [Haj Amin al-Husseini, Arafat’s uncle and tool of the Order who, during Israel’s War of Independence in 1948, would secretly aid Chaim Weizmann by ordering all Arabs to flee Palestine until the battle was over thereby securing victory for the Pope’s Zionists] raised the issue of religion: behind the peaceful behavior of the Jews loomed a sinister design to secure a numerical majority in the country. Once that was attained, the great mosque in Jerusalem was to be replaced with a Hebrew sanctuary . . . ‘Oh but that is common knowledge,’ His Eminence added . . . ‘Lord Melchett declared that he will consecrate the remainder of his life to rebuild the Jewish Temple. And here is something else,’ added the ‘Grand’ Mufti: ‘Professor [Albert] Einstein believes that Palestine without the Temple is to the Jews like a body without a head. Do you see the real aims of the Jews? They want to destroy this mosque.’ ” {7} [Emphasis added]
Little do the Jews, Arabs, and the English know that they have been manipulated, used and betrayed by the Jesuit Order through Freemasonry.
“The truth is, the Jesuits of Rome have perfected Freemasonry to be their most magnificent and effective tool, accomplishing their purposes among Protestants, yet remaining completely hidden and unknown.” {8}

For one day the wealthy Knights of International Shriner Freemasonry – who for a dress rehearsal have built the Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City, Utah – will rebuild Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem, and a risen Priest-King, the Eighth Roman Caesar chosen by the Black Pope and possessed by the Devil himself, will arrogantly sit

The Jesuits’, by 1815 were in control of England, the Vatican and continental Europe once again. They were in command of International Freemasonry, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and the Order of the Illuminati. Yet Tzar Alexander I, who died ten years later from poisoning, became a born-again Bible-believer, expelling the Sons of Loyola from Russia on March 13, 1820. Little did the Jesuits know that this first major expulsion, after the Order’s formal restoration by the Papal Caesar, would be the beginning of a series of events acting in unison ordered by their Great Enemy, the risen Son of God, in answer to the prayers of his blood-bought people scattered throughout Europe. The Ruler of Nations would send His great preachers, like Charles Haddon Spurgeon, – England’s Prince of Preachers – to boldly preach His glorious “gospel of Christ” being,
“ . . . the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth . . . ”
– Romans 1:16
His Holy Spirit would mightily move upon the hearts of many, causing the Second Great Awakening of 1835 and the Ulster Revival in 1859 among English-speaking peoples. England’s China Inland Mission flourished while many a Gentile became “a Jew inwardly,” as He invisibly circumcised the hearts and saved the souls of learned and brave Roman Catholics having been shackled to the Pope’s religious and political tyranny for all of their lives. Hundreds of authors would begin to expose the true colors of the Jesuit Order, validated with impeccable lives and irrefutable facts obtained from personal experience, the most outstanding and extensively quoted herein being M. F. Cusack, G. B. Nicolini and Luigi Desanctis. Seated at the right hand of His Heavenly Father, the risen Son of Man, who is “a Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek,” ordered a series of events acting in unison causing another upheaval for Satan’s Society of Jesus. Those events occurred during the Nineteenth Century, called by the Company “the Century of Disaster.” One of the individuals involved who struck a blow for liberty was a Frenchman — and a hero.
His name was Eugene Sue.

During the reign of his grandmother, Catherine “the Great,” the Society of Jesus found refuge in the Empire, greatly increased its power among the Orthodox Clergy and spread the growth of Freemasonry in the twin cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg. But on March 13, 1820, according to Abate Leone, Alexander expelled the Papal Caesar’s Militia of the Black Pope for opposing the free circulation of the Holy Bible. For this the Jesuits murdered him in 1825, slipping him “the poison cup.” One hundred years later the Order was readmitted into its “USSR” by Lenin and his Masonic Jewish anti-Torah Bolsheviks in 1922.

“Imagine an association whose members having destroyed all ties of family and of country, to be singled out from among men, and whose forces are to be concentrated at last to one united and formidable end, its plan devised and it establishes its dominion by all possible means over all the nations of the earth.
Imagine this immense conspiration...of a force hidden and silent. SUCH ARE THE JESUITS. Always expelled, forever returning, and little by little clandestinely and in the darkness throwing out its vigorous roots. Its wealth may be confiscated, its losses cannot be detained for they are covered...At times mixing in politics, agitating states and making princes to tremble upon their thrones, for they are terrible in their hate. WOE UNTO HIM WHEN THEY TURN UPON HIM AS HIS ENEMY! By very especial grace from heaven, any who may raise obstacles against them, although they may be found at the summit of the most lofty grandeur, yet will they be stricken down as with a thunderbolt. The formidable ‘Company of Jesus’ is a society of dead men!
Established and directed with the proposition of universal domination, this Society presents in the means of its organization such power of invasion that we cannot think of it without being oppressed by a species of fear . . .
For themselves, they are nothing, not having pompous titles, no sumptuous ornaments, no crosiers, no mitres, no capes of the prebendiaries, but pertain to that one Order everywhere governing and directing. Of command, others have the appearance; but these possess the reality.

Chapter 23 293
Eugene Sue was cut from the same mold as the great anti-Jesuit and Roman Catholic French patriot, General Lafayette. In fact they were contemporaries. He published his masterpiece and international bestseller, The Wandering Jew, in 1844. At that time the powers of the Holy Alliance were supreme in Europe. France, however, was enjoying the non-absolutist rule of its “Citizen-King,” Louis Philippe. Prince Metternich of the Austrian House of Hapsburg was still alive using the armies of the Monarchs to suppress and murder any people that would dare attempt a popular revolution. The Spanish people had expelled the Jesuits in 1820 and attempted to establish popular government. But the invading French army sent by the Jesuits’ most powerful Freemason in France, Louis XVIII, crushed them.
By 1844 France was enjoying good government, its beloved “Citizen King” Louis Philippe having expelled the Order in 1831. Praise God! But the other peoples of Europe were becoming more and more oppressed by the power of the Jesuits controlling the affairs of States according to the purposes of the Holy Alliance. They remembered the relative liberty given to them by Napoleon (as he used them to punish the Monarchs) and looked to the successful republican example of Protestant America. They yearned for that same freedom and were willing to die for it during this progressive and accomplished Nineteenth Century, the greatest of centuries!
At this time The Wandering Jew was published. Typical of the great, expressive heart of the French, the story draws from its reader every extreme of human emotion. Love, hate, joy, sorrow, hope, disappointment, suspense, courage, intrigue and surprise so grip the reader that the novel becomes irresistible. The righteous priest Gabriel, the poor but loyal hunchback Mother Bunch, the assassin Faringhea, the beautiful and accomplished Adrienne, the courageous Indian prince Djalma, the old soldier of Napoleon’s army Dagobert, and General Simon’s innocent little girls, Rose and Blanche, are but a few of the wonderful characters used to convey a story of so great a magnitude and final tragedy as to move anyone with a heart to action — action against the Jesuit Order!
One of the key characters is Rodin the Jesuit. He is thoroughly evil, deceptive, treacherous, heartless, and completely loyal to the General in Rome. He is the key player in attempting to steal a huge fortune from a French Protestant family, which is held in trust by a Jew.
Another character is the Jesuit, Abbe Marquis d’Aigrigny. The author assigns this traitor the perfect narrative describing the function and power of the Order. We read:
“What ought not to be sacrificed in order to reign in secret over the all-powerful of the earth, who lord it in full day? This journey to Rome,

from which I have just returned, has given me a new idea of our formidable power. For . . . it is Rome which is the culminating point, overlooking the fairest and broadest quarters of the globe, made so by custom, by tradition, or by faith. Thence can our workings be embraced in their full extent. It is an uncommon view to see from its height the myriad tools, whose personality is continually absorbed into the immovable personality of our Order. What a might we possess! Verily, I am always swayed with admiration, aye almost frightened, that man once thinks, wishes, believes, and acts as he alone lists, until, soon ours, he becomes but a human shell; its kernel of intelligence, mind, reason, conscience, and free will, shriveled within him, dry and withered by the habit of mutely, fearingly bowing under mysterious tasks, which shatter and slay everything spontaneous in the human soul! Then do we infuse in such spiritless clay, speechless, cold, and motionless as corpses, the breath of our Order, and, lo! the dry bones stand up and walk; acting and executing, though only within the limits which are circled round them evermore. Thus do they become mere limbs of the gigantic trunk, whose impulses they mechanically carry out, while ignorant of the design, like the stonecutter who shapes out a stone, unaware if it be for cathedral or bagnio [brothel] . . .
But now, in spite of the misfortunes which have befallen our Order, I feel myself a thousand times more ready for action, more authoritative, more strong and more daring, at the head of our mute and black-robed militia, who only think or wish, or move and obey, mechanically, according to my will. On a sign they scatter over the surface of the globe, gliding stealthily into households under the guise of confessing the wife or teaching the children, into family affairs by hearing the dying avowals, – up to the throne through the quaking conscience of a credulous crowned coward; – aye, even to the chair of the Pope, himself, living manifesto of the Godhead though he is, by the services, rendered him or imposed by him. Is not this secret rule, made to kindle or glut the wildest ambition, as it reaches from the cradle to the grave, from the laborer’s hovel to the royal palace, from the palace to the papal chair?” {2} [Emphasis added]
Having fired the soul of the French, The Wandering Jew,
“ . . . caused such a storm of indignation that the [Jesuit] novitiate was moved from Avignon to Nice on orders from General Roothaan. Jesuits in Paris were hastily redistributed, and in other danger spots there was a thinning and scattering of members . . . ” {3}

Chapter 23 295
It was these descriptive and accurate portraits of the Jesuit Order that brought Eugene Sue world renown. He also became the accursed enemy of the Brotherhood while it plotted to overthrow its most notorious French adversary, King Louis Philippe.
As we shall see, the Jesuits excited the Second French Revolution bringing their perfected doctrines of “communism” into the European upheaval of 1848. As a result, Louis Napoleon, the nephew of Napoleon I was brought to power in France. Four years later the Jesuits overthrew the Constitutional Government in a coup d’etat (even as they would overthrow the Weimar Republic in Germany, having been governed by four Roman Catholic Chancellors, they being Heinrich Bruening, Kurt von Schleicher, Knight of Malta Franz von Papen and Adolf Hitler) and Bonaparte declared himself Emperor Napoleon III (even as Hitler would be declared Chancellor of the Black Pope’s Bavarian-based Nazi Third Reich).
(Dear truth-seeker, now do you know why history repeats itself? It is the Society of Jesus, that Great Secret Society, utilizing the same tactics over and over again! The Roman Catholic Freemason, Voltaire (Francois Marie Arouet), that great agent for the suppressed Jesuits having incited the Order’s French Revolution, more accurately stated, “History never repeats itself, man always does.”)
It was now payback time for Eugene Sue. The Jesuits, with their creature Napoleon III, drove this fearless hero of international fame into exile. (Remember, it was this papal slave, Napoleon III, who had taken to wife the daughter of Italy’s finest, most honest and patriotic Roman Catholic King, Victor Emmanuel II, who in turn was excommunicated for depriving Pope Pius IX of his Temporal Power in 1870. For that unforgivable act of defiance Victor Emmanuel II “died of a fever” – “the poison cup” – and previous to his death his mother, wife and brother had died within four weeks of each other, the Jesuits openly attributing to Providence their Black Hand of vengeance.) Eugene Sue died in banishment five years later, brokenhearted over the nation of his love, to the disgrace of the people of France and to the delight of the Jesuit Order.
But our hero was not the loser; for, humanly speaking,

As long as Americans enjoy Protestant liberties, we remain indebted to the great French Roman Catholic, anti-Jesuit and friend of Eugene Sue, Marquis de Lafayette, who thoroughly knowing Europe’s history declared:
“If the liberties of the United States of America are destroyed it will be by the subtlety of the Roman Catholic Jesuit priests, for they are the most crafty, dangerous enemies to civil and religious liberty.”
Throughout the Twentieth Century Lafayette’s warning went unheeded resulting in the Order’s absolute control of the American Empire from President Theodore Roosevelt to President George W.

Abbe Sieyes also voted for the death penalty against Louis XVI. Why? The Jesuits considered the King to be a “usurper” and thus a “tyrant” for enforcing Louis XV’s banishment of the Company and for aiding and abetting the North American “heretic and liberal” White Celtic-Anglo-Saxon Protestant and Baptist Calvinists who, with the blessing of the risen Son of God, waged a successful revolution against the Order’s King George III. As a member of the Directory, Sieyes engineered a coup d’etat in 1799, overthrowing the Directory and creating the Consulate with Napoleon the Freemason as first consul, he as the second. The Jesuit General, through his advisor to Napoleon, then proceeded to punish the Pope and the Roman Catholic Monarchs of Europe with his Illuminati for daring to suppress the Society of Jesus.

But the Papal protection was no longer sufficient to shelter the Jesuits from public hatred. Pius IX lost a great part of his popularity, but could not save them.

Dear truth-seeker, we now shall embark on a very deceptive and puzzling era of history for the student whose eye is not focused on the movements of the Jesuit Order. We shall first clarify the relationship between the political doctrine of Communism and the secret society of International Freemasonry.
Remembering our previous chapters, we know that socialist-communism was perfected by the Jesuits on their commercial “Reductions” or “Communes” from 1600 to 1750. The reductions had a storehouse or central bank and the enslaved Indians contributed, “each according to his ability,” and received, “each according to his need.”
We also know from our previous chapters that the old military Order of the Knights Templars – abolished by Pope Clement V in 1312 – was revived in 1717 in England called “Freemasonry.” Its stated purpose was to restore the pro-Jesuit Stuart Dynasty to the throne of England. This occult, Luciferian religion of Freemasonry, grounded in the pagan, phallic, sex-worshipping mysteries of ancient Babylon, was intended to create a universal religious and political Empire. Its doctrines would be in accord with the Council of Trent and its political agenda subject to the Jesuit General.
Therefore, we are not surprised in discovering that the Jesuit Order – the creator of modern communism – has written all the rites of Scottish Rite Freemasonry. In a letter written by Charles Sotheran addressed to the New York Press Club, dated January 11, 1877, we read:
“It is curious to note too that most of the bodies which work these, such as the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, the Rite of Avignon, the Order of the Temple, Fesslor’s Rite, the ‘Grand Council of the Emperors of the East and West Sovereign Prince Masons’, etc., etc., are nearly all the offspring of the sons of Ignatius Loyola. The Baron Hundt, Chevalier Ramsey, Tschoudy, Zinnendorf, and numerous others, who founded the grades in these rites, worked under instructions from the General of the Jesuits. The nest where these high degrees were hatched, and no Masonic rite is free from their baleful influence more or less, was the Jesuit College of Clermont at Paris.” {7} [Emphasis added]
(Dear truth seeker, what a perfect tool Freemasonry has proven to be in effecting the reunion between Protestantism and Jesuit Romanism! Even the most conservative Protestant Orangemen (members of Northern Ireland’s openly anti Catholic Grand Orange Lodge founded in 1795 during the reign of Jesuit-controlled King George III) have been penetrated by the Order’s Craft through such men as Gerry Budden, the Past Grand Master of the Grand Orange Lodge of Canada.)

Chapter 24 301
Examples of the Jesuits authoring the higher degrees, found in Light on Free Masonry written by David Bernard, a brave and honest Nineteenth Century Baptist-Calvinist and preacher of the gospel, are these:
1. The Rite titled “The Holy and Thrice Illustrious Order of the Cross” (see the comparison chart on the last page of Chapter Fourteen) employs these words:
“ . . . we have confirmed the Induction of the Knight Templar Mason into the Councils of the said Order of Knighthood . . . and hoping and confiding that he will ever so demean himself as to conduct to the glory of I.H.S. the Most Holy and Almighty GOD, and to the honor of his MARK, we do recommend . . . ” {8}
The initiation proceeds with questions from superiors and answers from the initiate:
“ . . . ‘what therein becomes your duty?’ . . .
‘To receive the commands of my superiors in the order, and pay obedience thereto’ . . .
‘By what right do you claim this duty?’ . . .
‘By the right of a sign and the mark of a sign’ . . .
Thereupon he produces his mark in his left hand, and with the forefinger of his right on the letter S, on the cross, asks,
‘What’s that?’ . . .
‘Lisha.’ . . . (he) puts his finger on the letter H, and asks,
‘What is this?’
‘Sha.’ . . . (he) then puts his finger on the letter I, and asks,
‘What is this?’
‘Baal.’
‘What then is your mark?’
‘Baal, Sha-Lisha; [I.H.S.] I am the Lord.’ ” {9}

[The initiate then takes his Jesuitical oath:]
“To all this, and every part thereof, I do now, as before, by the honor and power of the mark, as by an . . . awful oath . . . solemnly . . . bind and obligate my soul . . . I become the silent and mute subject . . . of the Illustrious Order . . . and for a breach of silence . . . that I shall die the infamous death of a traitor . . . bearing testimony, even in death, of the power of the mark of the Holy and Illustrious Cross before I.H.S. our Thrice Illustrious Counselor . . . ” [Could it be that “the mark of the beast” will be I.H.S.?] {10} [Emphasis added]
2. In a diploma titled “The Ancient Council of the Trinity, by their Successors in the United States of America” we read:
“To every Knight Companion of the Holy and Thrice Illustrious ORDER OF THE CROSS: . . . we have confirmed the induction of the Knight Templar Mason into the Councils of said order of Knighthood, . . . and hoping and confiding that he will ever so demean himself as to conduct to the glory of I.H.S., the Most Holy and Almighty God, and the honor of his MARK, we do recommend and submit him to the confidence of all those throughout the world . . . ” {11} [Emphasis added]
Dear truth-seeker, I.H.S., displayed on the cover of Vatican Assassins: “Wounded In The House Of My Friends”, is the seal of the General of the Jesuits created by Ignatius Loyola himself! Ian Paisley, Ireland’s greatest preacher, having later converted Avro Manhattan to the Bible-believing Protestant faith, declares:
“When the original group in the crypt of Notre-Dame de Montmarte rose from their knees, Ignatius pointed to the letters on the altar—I.H.S.. ‘These’, he said ‘stand for ‘Jesus Hominum Salvator’ (Jesus the Savior of Mankind), and they shall henceforth be the motto of our institution’. I.H.S. is the design of the Jesuits. These letters do not stand for what Ignatius affirmed. They are in fact the pagan mystical symbol of the Egyptian trinity Isis, Horus, Seb—the Mother, Child and Father of the Gods. No honest person could imagine that this double sense is accidental. I.H.S. pays the semblance of a tribute to Christianity, but they are in reality the substance of devil worship. The cloven hoof is upon them.” {12} [Emphasis added]
Therefore, the Almighty God of Freemasonry, “the Thrice Illustrious Counselor,” to which every Shriner Freemason ultimately owes silent and mute obedience, is the same god of the Society of Jesus – the Black Pope – as he serves his master Satan, deceptively called Lucifer! His servants bear his mark — I.H.S..

Chapter 24 303
The Jesuits having revived Freemasonry through which they authored Communism could never be openly identified with either system. The Jesuits boldly attack these systems with their mouthpiece, the Papal Caesar, or simply tolerate them. But they do all to conceal the facts that prove the Society of Jesus brought these diabolical systems into existence and control them both. On the surface the Jesuits appear to suffer by communist revolutions but after the dust clears they always benefit! An example of this is the Second French Revolution of 1848. The Jesuits, in defense of absolutism, claimed they suffered from this revolution. We read in a letter written by a Jesuit Provincial to the King of Naples in 1854:
“Majesty, that we both think, and believe, and sustain that absolute monarchy is the best of governments, is demonstrated by the damage we sustained in the year 1848. We were the victims of liberalism, because all liberals were and are well persuaded also, that the Jesuits are the supporters of absolute monarchy.” {13}
Yet in France, all the facts point to the realization that the Jesuits ultimately benefited from the revolution. Freemason Louis XVIII was a Jesuit tool ruling France from 1814 to 1824. His Roman Catholic brother Charles X, – another one of the Order’s high-level Freemasons – then ruled under Jesuit supervision from 1824 until he abdicated in 1830, ending the Bourbon Dynasty. But then an enemy of the Jesuits and Metternich’s Holy Alliance emerged on the scene. He was Louis Philippe, declared “King of the French.” He was known as “The Citizen-King,” and his government was one of moderation and order. His policies, like those of Henry IV, were benefiting the people while the idea of absolute monarchy was a thing of the past. In 1831 he expelled Satan’s Jesuit Order from France and refused to send French troops to protect the Pope during the Italian revolution . . . So the Jesuits used the Austrians. And what was the response of the Jesuits to this liberal King? They hated him and set the powers of the Holy Alliance against him. An agent of the Jesuits attempted to assassinate him with a special gun, but failed, only wounding him. Finally, the Order fomented the Revolution of 1848, led by its Freemasons crying their old Masonic watchwords of “liberty, equality, and fraternity!” The Citizen-King abdicated, his throne was publicly burned and he was banished from France. Four years later, the French found themselves under the absolutism of the Jesuits’ Napoleon III along with the continual plague of foreign war!
It was the same story for Italy — bestowing temporary liberty giving way to tyranny. Replacing the Citizen-King’s liberal monarchy with a republic, the Jesuits installed Louis Napoleon as the President of France. He was the nephew of that great tool of the Order and Freemason, Napoleon Bonaparte. Louis Napoleon’s first act was to return the Pope to Rome, thereby destroying the Italian Republic established in 1848, with the troops of republican France! The year was 1849. For twenty-one years the French Army would be garrisoned in Rome, preventing the Italian patriots

from achieving national sovereignty to the disgrace of the silent Protestant British Empire ruled by the Jesuit General! These were merely two of the many benefits the Company received as a result of the European Revolution in 1848.
(Dear truth-seeker, in 1870 things would change. The Franco-Prussian War would break out resulting in the French troops withdrawing from Rome. Victor Emmanuel II would take the “Eternal City” and become King of Italy, taking the Temporal Power from Pope Pius IX. The Pope would declare himself a “prisoner” and lock himself in the Vatican for the rest of his pontificate, having previously condemned the modern world via his Encyclical Quanta Cura with its Syllabus of Errors in 1864.
As a result, the Pope would be deprived of his Temporal Power (the right to rule the governments of all nations) for nearly sixty years. But Roman Catholic Italy would pay dearly for this during World War I and World War II, the Second Thirty Years’ War. One of the many benefits accruing to the Jesuits during the Second Thirty Years’ War would be the restoration of the Pope’s Temporal Power in 1929. Their “man of destiny” who signed the Lateran Treaty creating the Sovereign State of Vatican City would be the fascist, absolutist, military dictator, Benito Mussolini, whose friend and financier was a notorious thief, a fellow fascist, a fugitive from American justice and later, a member of New York’s Mafia Commission — Vito Genovese. Mussolini’s confessor was the secretary of the Company of Jesus, Jesuit Pietro Tacchi-Venturi. (What a depraved display of dastardly criminals!)
In 1849, while the Pope had been banished from Rome, the Minister Sterbini of the Italian Republic abolished the Holy Office of the Inquisition liberating its prisoners. The crowds cried, “Death to the Pope! Long live the Republic!” A group of men then inspected the subterranean prisons of the Inquisition. Two of the dungeons are described as follows:
“In one of these dungeons there was a stone staircase, which led to a still deeper dungeon. It was destined to receive those unfortunate ones who were condemned to be walled up to die. The skeletons that were found here indicated the mode of their barbarous execution. They let down these unfortunate ones with their hands and feet tied; they buried them up to the breast in dry lime, mixed with earthen cement, and left them there, closing the grating above. The positions of these skeletons showed the horrible struggle they must have had before finding death . . . There remained to be seen the chamber of torture; it was in one of the lowest and most hidden dungeons . . . Near to this cellar the governor of the republic had caused an old wall to be broken down, on account of work which was to be done, but God willed that they should begin with the demolition of a very recent wall, made with lime and clay, colored so as to appear old. Having pulled down the wall, another cellar was found, but

instead of bottles, they found in it two ovens, made like beehives, and in these furnaces there were still calcified human bones. You cannot believe the horror that such a discovery occasioned the Romans; every one believed that the torture by fire was abolished. But the Holy Inquisition never derogates from its own laws, and when it can no longer burn in the open air, because the smoke would be seen, it burns them in the furnaces. We came out of so dreadful a place, never to return there again.” {14} [Emphasis added]
(Dear truth-seeker, do the instruments of torture and ovens burning the bodies of the condemned resemble a recent event in modern history? Yes! For it was the Jesuits in control of Hitler, and his homosexual Third Reich intricately detailed by Lively and Abrams’ The Pink Swastika (1997), who committed tortures (called “medical experiments”) and burned the bodies of the condemned Jews — in the ovens at Auschwitz! As it has become unpopular for the Jesuits’ Holy Office to destroy whole peoples in the name of the Inquisition, they do so in the name of Democracy, Nazism, Communism, Fascism, Zionism or any other form of socialist absolutism. In America they are doing so in the name of the American Medical (Murderer’s) Association with their Inquisitors, the Food & Drug Administration. Now, back to France.)
In 1852 Louis Napoleon overthrew the French Republic with a coup d’etat as he declared himself Napoleon III, Emperor of the Second Empire. From that day until he was defeated by the Germans in the Franco-Prussian War of 1871, he was the dictator of France and the abject tool of the Jesuits of whom we read in 1854:
“We have arrived at a great crisis . . . Napoleon ascends the throne of France. The policy of the latter days of his great uncle he carries out, and espouses the cause of the Papacy. The Church of Rome, in France, rises, with extraordinary power. Napoleon assumes the title of “Protector of the Holy Places [Jerusalem].” . . . Napoleon cannot hold a review without a military mass, he cannot send out a fleet without commending it to the virgin, whose image he devoutly inaugurates in the flagship. Napoleon, be his private views what they may, is a champion of the Papacy, and the Papal authorities are loud in his praise.” {15}
The question arises: “Who benefited from the Revolution of 1848?” The Citizen-King, Louis Philippe, was overthrown and the Pope was punished for his liberalism, being driven from Rome by Italian patriots led by Freemasonry. The French Army of Louis Napoleon then restored Pius IX to power and Louis in turn became an absolute Monarch, Napoleon III. And thus, Napoleon III was a dedicated servant of the Jesuits. Yes, like the first French Revolution and Empire, the Jesuits greatly benefited from the second French Revolution and Empire. They turned legitimate grievances of oppressed peoples into revolutions managed for their own

gain — just like the Black American Civil Rights movement of the 1960s led by the “boys” of Henry R. Luce and his master, Francis Cardinal Spellman! Two of those “boys” were the integrationists A. Philip Randolph and Martin Luther King, Jr.
We now must stand back and gaze at the forest having examined the trees. The Jesuits revived and controlled high-level Freemasonry. They authored Socialist-Communism. By 1815 they had gained control of England and the Papacy. They had created the Holy Alliance to crush popular governments. The Order was the great instigator of both French Revolutions and the absolute sovereign of both French Empires, overthrowing the kings who dared to resist the power of its General.
But times were changing by the 1840s. The old absolutism was on its way out. The altar and the throne were hated. So the question the Jesuits must have asked was, “How can we maintain absolutism and make it look like a government of the people?” The answer was to introduce absolutist Socialist-Communism, by way of Freemasonry, into Europe. But the Order could never formally endorse it, as it must appear to be its foe, as the Society would later appear to be the foe of its “USSR.”
Therefore, the Jesuits blamed the origin of absolutist Socialist-Communism on two foes — one superficial, the other very real. Their pretended foe was International Freemasonry, their executioners during the French Revolution. Their real foe was the Jewish Race, as it alone has been promised the land of Israel forever during the earthly reign of her Messiah, ruling all nations with “a rod of iron” while sitting on “the throne of David.” The Jewish Race and its Jewish Messiah are the rivals of the Gentile Jesuit Order and its “infallible,” Gentile Papal Caesar, as to who will rule the world from Solomon’s rebuilt Temple in Jerusalem — forever!
Thus, “the dictatorship (absolutism) of the proletariat” was introduced into Europe in 1848. The book was The Communist Manifesto. Its author was a Jesuit tool and Jewish Freemason, Karl Marx. As a result the Jewish Race would pay dearly for this during the Jesuits’ Third Reich, being the scapegoat for the evils of communism, further enabling the Company of Loyola to escape the light of day.
The Company’s grand design, of which the French Revolution of 1848 was only a part, was clearly stated by a courageous Italian Bible-believer in 1852. Luigi Desanctis, who for many years was a priest of Rome, Professor of Theology and Official Censor of the Inquisition, was driven into exile upon his conversion to Christ, becoming a Reformed pastor in Geneva. While yet a Catholic he had had an interview with the Secretary of the French Father Assistant (one of the Jesuit General’s most powerful Administrators over the Provincials of an Assistancy) of the Jesuit Order. In his extremely difficult-to-find masterpiece, Popery, Puseyism, and Jesuitism, which is included herein along with the Secret Instructions of the Jesuits on a CD, he revealed the Company’s quest for a world governed by its General:
The Jesuits – 1848 - 1852



Chapter 24 307
“At what then do the Jesuits aim? According to them, they only seek the greater glory of God; but if you examine the facts you will find that they aim at universal dominion alone. They have rendered themselves indispensable to the Pope, who, without them, could not exist, because Catholicism is identified with them. They have rendered themselves indispensable to governors and hold revolutions in their hands; and in this way, either under one name or another, it is they who rule the world.” {16} [Emphasis added]
And they wish to rule the world, not from Rome but from Jerusalem, from Solomon’s rebuilt Temple with an “infallible” Pope of their choosing, he having suffered a mortal wound but then raised from the dead and possessed by the Devil himself. The “Final Solution to the Jewish Question” carried out by this Eighth and final Roman Caesar – the risen Pope spoken of in the Book of Revelation, chapter seventeen, verses ten and eleven – will be
“ . . . the time of Jacob’s trouble . . . ”
– Jeremiah 30:7
Having become the “antichrist,” he will destroy Vatican City with its Papacy, Hierarchy and Empire. Ah then, dear truth-seeker, from Jerusalem within Solomon’s rebuilt Temple, “that man of sin” will begin a bloodthirsty and fanatical persecution of “those perfidious Jews,” so referred to by the priests of Rome in their “prayers” prior to Vatican II. In one last mad attempt to annihilate them all, this man-devil beast will desperately seek “to extirpate and exterminate them from the face of the whole earth” in obedience to Satan’s Jesuit Oath! At the end of his universal reign of forty-two months, as the world’s armies pour into Israel’s Valley of Megiddo – Armageddon – while raping and murdering the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the lowly Nazarene will appear once again. But this time coming upon a white horse, clothed with “a vesture dipped in blood” to “strike through kings in the day of his wrath;” He will be “the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel,” the roaring and furious “King of kings and Lord of lords,”
The Lion of the Tribe of Judah!
In that day the words of King David the Prophet will be fulfilled:

With a criminal coup d’etat in 1852, Louis Napoleon became Emperor Napoleon III, advised through the brother (a trusted third party) of Monsignor de Falloux, the most powerful Jesuit in France. He completely served the interests of the Jesuit General by crushing the Italian revolution and restoring the Temporal Power of Pope Pius IX in 1849. Obeying his Jesuit masters in making the Empire “the Sword of the Church,” he started the Crimean War in 1856, intervened in Vietnam and started the Franco-Prussian War in 1870.

Karl Mordechai Marx, 1818 – 1883 #83 Karl Marx, “the Father of Modern Communism” was himself an occultist and high-level Jewish Freemason, intimately associated with Rome’s Giuseppe Mazzini (1805-1872), the most powerful Shriner on the Continent and founder of the Mafia, and Albert Pike (1809-1891), the most powerful Shriner in Fourteenth Amendment America and creator of the first Ku Klux Klan. He was privately tutored by Jesuits in the huge Reading Room of the British Museum while writing The Communist Manifesto based upon the ten maxims or “planks” the Order had perfected on its Paraguayan Reductions (1600-1750) and its Maryland Reductions (1650-1838). His writings were financed by the Society’s wealthy, White Gentile cartel capitalists, such as John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and J. P. Morgan, also Shriner Freemasons who, being in their doctrines and deeds, were in fact the revived old Order of the crusading Papal Knights Templars. Marx, a racial Jew, was chosen for this task, for the Order intended to blame all the brutal and savage evils of their absolutist, Communist Inquisition on the Semitic Hebrew/Jewish Race. This masterstroke of Jesuit genius was fulfilled by the Black Pope’s Third Reich with its invasion of Russia during “Operation Barbarossa” and the mass-murder of European and Russian Jewry pursuant to the wicked and evil Council of Trent.

In 1988 the CIA brought down Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland killing eight members of the U.S. intelligence community, including four CIA officers led by Matthew Gannon. As Bin Laden was blamed for the destruction of the World Trade Center, even so Qaddafi was blamed for the downing of Pan Am 103. During the trial of two of Qaddafi’s highest intelligence officers, it was revealed that Libya’s dictator was a member of a secret, high-level Masonic Islamic Brotherhood that extended throughout the Middle East. This was a most unnerving revelation, since it was never to be known that the Black Pope’s “Invisible Empire” is in complete control of all Islamic nations while at the same time commanding the Masonic anti-Torah Labor Zionist government in Israel to the detriment of the risen Son of God’s beloved Hebrew/Jewish People yet to inherit the promises given to Abraham.

The Great Conspiracy of the Jesuits With their “Holy Alliance” Against The Protestant Federal Republic of the United States
“The name of Jesuit was, suffice it to say, but synonymous with all of ambition, craft, and treachery, duplicity and talent, to be conceived by the human mind . . . Let the court of Rome bear the responsibility of its daring! Necessary indeed to its service may be the devotion of such a band — but how perilous the determination to employ it!” {1}

According to our previous chapters we know the Jesuits are the Counter-Reformation. Their Council of Trent and Jesuit Oath prove they purpose to destroy the Protestant Reformation. Since the thirteen American colonies were entirely Protestant and the Federal Republic established by the Constitution was a Protestant form of government, reason, logic, common sense and knowledge of history confirms the reality that the Jesuits had a plan to destroy our Nation. America’s blueprint for its Constitution had been devised by Pelatiah Webster, its Constitution and Bill of Rights had been penned by James Madison, and its Government had been established with the sword and statesmanship of George Washington — all White Protestant and Baptist-Calvinists! (Though the Jesuits succeeded in using their Freemason, John Adams, to foment the Revolution, create the evil “Great Seal” and give shelter to the Society, they HATED Washington’s Victory over Cornwallis, defeating their plan of submitting the nation to George III.)
The Jesuits – 1815 - 1860



Chapter 25 313
That plan was greatly enhanced by the “Holy Alliance” of European sovereigns in 1815. The secret Treaty of Verona, Italy, furthered the conspiracy, which in turn was countered by the Monroe Doctrine of 1823. But the final touch was the Jesuit General’s Secret Plan at Chieri, Italy in 1825. Therefore we are safe in saying the Jesuits, with Prince Metternich’s “Holy Alliance,” conspired to overthrow that successful example of popular Protestant liberty and envy the world over — The Federal Republic of the United States. (For years, our Protestant Republic refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of Vatican City as well as the Temporal Power of the Pope. After 1867, as a result of the Jesuit hand in Lincoln’s assassination, the American Government never openly sent an ambassador to the Vatican until Shriner Freemason FDR, without the consent of Congress, sent Knight of Malta/CFR Myron C. Taylor during World War II, Rome’s advisor to the OSS headed by another Irish Roman Catholic, Knight of Malta “Wild Bill” Donovan.)
Our founding Fathers knew of the Jesuit intrigue directed at the new Protestant Republic of these United States of America. In 1816 John Adams, who later became the “King-aping” President, wrote to President Jefferson:
“Shall we not have regular swarms of them here, in as many disguises as only a king of the gypsies can assume, dressed as painters, publishers, writers and schoolmasters? If ever there was a body of men who merited eternal damnation on earth and in hell it is this Society of Loyola’s . . . we are compelled by our system . . . to offer them asylum.” {3}
Many writers warned of this Great Conspiracy of the Jesuits. Samuel Morse, the father of Morse Code, was one of them. The preface of his great work, Foreign Conspiracy Against the Liberties of the United States, written in 1835 reads:
“The author undertakes to show – that a conspiracy against the liberties of this Republic is now in full action, under the direction of the wily Prince Metternich of Austria, who knowing the impossibility of obliterating this troublesome example of a great and free nation by force of arms, is attempting to accomplish his object through the agency of an army of Jesuits. The array of facts and arguments going to prove the existence of such a conspiracy, will astonish any man who opens the book with the same incredulity as we did.” {4} [Emphasis added]
Of the Jesuits, Morse wrote:
“And who are these agents? They are for the most part, Jesuits, an ecclesiastical order proverbial through the world for cunning, duplicity, and total want of moral principle; an order so skilled in all the arts of

deception that even in Catholic countries, in Italy itself, it became intolerable, and the people required its suppression.” {5}
Morse, in alerting Protestant America to the Great Jesuit Conspiracy against our free and popular form of government, further described the Jesuit Order:
“Let us examine the operations of this Austrian Society, [St. Leopold Foundation, the Leopoldines being the present day Knights of Columbus] for it is hard at work all around us, yes, here in this country, from one end to the other, at our very doors, in this city [Boston]. From a machinery of such a character and power, we shall doubtless be able to see already some effect. With its headquarters at Vienna, under the immediate direction and inspection of Metternich, the well-known great managing general of the diplomacy of Europe, it makes itself already felt through the Republic. Its emissaries are here. And who are these emissaries? They are Jesuits. This society of men, after exerting their tyranny for upwards of two hundred years, at length became so formidable to the world, threatening the entire subversion to all social order, that even the Pope [Clement XIV], whose devoted subjects they are, and must be, by the vow of their society, was compelled to dissolve them. They had not been suppressed, however, for fifty years, before the waning influence of Popery and Despotism required their useful labors, to resist the light of Democratic liberty, and the Pope (Pius VII) simultaneously with the formation of the Holy Alliance, revived the order of the Jesuits in all their power. From their vow of ‘unqualified submission to the Sovereign Pontiff,’ they have been appropriately called the Pope’s Body Guard . . . And do Americans need to be told what Jesuits are? If any are ignorant, let them inform themselves of their history without delay; no time is to be lost: their workings are before you in every day’s events: they are a secret society, a sort of Masonic order with super added features of revolting odiousness, and a thousand times more dangerous. They are not merely priests, or priests of one religious creed; they are merchants, and lawyers, and editors, and men of any profession, having no outward badge, (in this country) by which to be recognized; they are about in all your society. They can assume any character, that of angels of light, or ministers of darkness, to accomplish their one great end, the service upon which they are sent, whatever that service may be. They are all educated men, prepared, and sworn to start at any moment, and in any direction, and for any service, commanded by the general of their order, bound to no family, community, or country, by the ordinary ties which bind men; and sold for life to the cause of the Roman Pontiff.” {6} [Emphasis added]

And what military tactic would the Jesuits use in their conspiracy to overthrow America’s Protestant Constitution, erecting an absolute tyranny in its place?
“Jesuits are not fools. They would not startle our slumbering fears, by bolting out their monarchial designs directly in our teeth . . . except so far as to cover their designs . . . Let every real Democrat guard against the common Jesuitical artifice of tyrants . . . it is founded on the well known principle that ‘extremes meet’ . . . When in despotic governments popular discontent, arising from intolerable oppressions of the tyrants of the people, has manifested itself by popular outbreakings, to such a degree as to endanger the throne, and the people seemed prepared to shove their masters from their horses, and are likely to mount, and seize the reins themselves; then, the popular movement, unmanageable any longer by resistance, is pushed to the extreme. The passions of the ignorant and vicious are excited to outrage by pretended friends of the people [like the American Negro rioting during 1968]. Anarchy ensues; and then the mass of the people, who are always lovers of order and quiet, unite at once in support of the strong arm of force for protection; and despotism, perhaps, in another, but preconcerted shape, resumes its iron reign . . . look at France in her late Republican revolution [1848] and in her present relapse into despotism [Napoleon III – 1852].
[The writer then makes this artifice of tyrants – the great Jesuit maxim for world domination under Fascist-Socialist-Communist dictators – crystal clear.]
He who would prevent you from mounting his horse has two ways of thwarting your designs. If he finds efforts to rise too strong for his resistance, he has but to add a little more impulse to them, and he shoves you over on the other side. In either case you are on the ground.” {7} [Emphasis added]
A personal friend of Professor Morse believed his warning of the Great Jesuit Conspiracy. He was President Abraham Lincoln. We read:
“The Protestants of both the North and South would surely unite to exterminate the priests and the Jesuits, if they could learn how the priests, the nuns, and the monks, which daily land on our shores, under the pretext of preaching their religion . . . are nothing else but the emissaries of the Pope, of Napoleon III, and the other despots of Europe, to undermine our institutions, alienate the hearts of our people from our constitution, and our laws, destroy our schools, and prepare a reign of anarchy here as they have done in Ireland, in Mexico, in Spain, and wherever there are any people who want to be free.” {8}

Further, the Duke of Richmond, who had been Governor of Canada in 1815-1816, told Horatio Gates, an eminent merchant in Montreal, of the same Great Jesuit Conspiracy against the United States. We read:
“ ‘The Church of Rome has a design upon that country, and it will, in time, be the established religion, and will aid in the destruction of that republic. I have conversed with many of the sovereigns and princes of Europe, and they have unanimously expressed these opinions relative to the government of the United States, and their determination to subvert it!’ ” {9} [Emphasis added]
And how would the Jesuits and the Holy Alliance accomplish this task while employing the “common Jesuitical artifice of tyrants”? By bringing in thousands of easily agitated Roman Catholic immigrants, especially from Ireland. We read the narration of Charles Chiniquy, one of our heroes, when he was invited to a meeting of priests at Buffalo in 1852. The priests, sent by the Bishops of the United States, declared:
“We are determined to take possession of the United States and rule them; but we cannot do that without acting secretly and with the utmost wisdom . . . Silently and patiently, we must mass our Roman Catholics in the great cities of the United States, remembering that the vote of a poor journeyman, though he be covered with rags, has as much weight in the scale of power as the millionaire Astor, and that if we have two votes against his one, he will become as powerless as an oyster. Let us then multiply our votes; let us call our poor but faithful Irish Catholics from every corner of the world, and gather them into the very hearts of those proud citadels which the Yankees are so rapidly building under the names of Washington, New York, Boston, Chicago, Buffalo, Albany, Troy, Cincinnati, etc. [Northern cities]. Under the shadows of those great cities, the Americans consider themselves a giant and unconquerable race. They look upon the poor Irish people with supreme contempt, as only fit to dig their canals, sweep their streets and work in their kitchens. Let no one awake those sleeping lions, today. Let us pray God that they may sleep and dream their sweet dreams, a few years more. How sad will their awakening be, when with our out-numbering votes, we will turn them forever, from every position of honor, power and profit! What will those hypocritical and godless sons and daughters of the fanatical Pilgrim Fathers say, when not a single judge, not a single teacher, not a single policeman, will be elected if he be not a devoted Irish Roman Catholic? What will those so-called giants think of their matchless shrewdness and ability, when not a single Senator or member of Congress will be chosen,

if he be not submitted to our holy father the Pope! What a sad figure those Protestant Yankees will cut when we will not only elect the President, but fill and command the armies, man the navies and hold the keys of the public treasury [the Federal Reserve Bank]? . . . Then, Yes! Then, we will rule the United States, and lay them at the feet of the Vicar of Jesus Christ, that he may put an end to their godless system of education, and impious laws of liberty of conscience which are an insult to God and man!” {10} [Emphasis added]
Chiniquy then responds in commenting on the plans of the Bishops:
“From that, the Catholic priests, with the most admirable ability and success, have gathered their Irish legions into the great cities of the United States, and the American people must be very blind indeed, if they do not see that if they do nothing to prevent it, the day is very near when the Jesuits will rule their country, from the magnificent White House at Washington to the humblest civil and military department of this vast Republic.” {11} [Emphasis added]
(Dear truth-seeker, by 1963 the rich Irish Catholics would be the true powerbrokers of Fourteenth Amendment America. Industrialist J. Peter Grace would head the Cardinal’s political and financial elite — the Knights of Malta; Joseph P. Kennedy friend of billionaire Knight of Malta Aristotle Onassis – would be supreme in power, business and entertainment; and Francis Cardinal Spellman would be the greatest and most powerful Archbishop in American history. Today, Edward Cardinal Egan has replaced Spellman; William J. Flynn has replaced J. Peter Grace; Trilateralist William J. McDonough heads the Federal Reserve Bank in New York; and CFR member Joseph A. O’Hare with Leo J. O’Donovan are the Empire’s two most powerful Professed Jesuits of the Fourth Vow — being the presidents of Fordham and Georgetown Universities respectively. Yes indeed, the true men of power in America are White Gentile Irish Roman Catholics who are completely at the beck and call of the Company of Jesus — the Militia of the Black Pope!)
The Jesuits would bring one such Irish Roman Catholic family to Boston. One of the sons would become the President of the United States to the delight of the Order. But he would turn on his masters by attempting to end their Cold War. He was John F. Kennedy. And he, without mercy, would be wounded in the house of his friends, by the man who had performed the wedding of his brother Ted,

Justin D. Fulton, 1888 American Theologian and Historian Washington In the Lap of Rome
“There have, in all ages, been really but two parties in politics. One, that did not believe in the people, but wanted a strong government to control or rule them [Jesuit Catholicism]. The other, that believed in the people, was for retaining power in their hands to control or rule the government [Calvinist Protestantism]. The former is the Monarchial or Strong Government [Federalist] party. Its members were called Tories [led by Alexander Hamilton] in the Revolution of 1776. The latter is the Democratic party [led by Thomas Jefferson]. I shall show how this Tory [Federalist] party has always been trying to subvert our Government, because it was formed on the democratic principle. I shall show that finally, after being defeated in every other effort, this Tory or Monarchial party assumed the name of Republican, and taking the advantage of a popular delusion about negroes, used it to get into power [after the Jesuits split the Democratic Convention in Charleston with their tool and Freemason, Stephen Douglas] and accomplished its long cherished purposes. I shall show that Abraham Lincoln was the direct successor of old John Adams and his infamous Alien and Sedition laws, only that Mr. Lincoln went much further, and acted much worse than John Adams ever dared to do. I shall show that the war was not waged to preserve the Union, or to maintain republican institutions, but really to destroy both, and that every dollar spent, and every life lost, have been taken by the Abolitionists

on false pretenses. This book will show that the Abolition or so-called Republican party has simply carried out the British free Negro policy on this Continent, a pet measure of all the kings and despots of Europe [the Monarchs of the Holy Alliance, including Queen Victoria]. In order to reach this end, Mr. Lincoln was compelled to assume the Dictatorship, and overthrow the government as it was formed, which he did by issuing a military Edict or Decree [Executive Orders] changing the fundamental law of the land [as further and surprisingly proven by an economics professor at the Jesuits’ Loyola College in Baltimore, Thomas DiLorenzo, author of the newly released masterpiece titled The Real Lincoln, (2001)]. . . . It will also be seen that the war has changed the entire character and system of our Government [and has] overthrown the ancient rights of the States . . . against the free action . . . of the people.” {6} [Emphasis added]

“Another principle must certainly be embodied in our re-organized form of government. The men who shape the legislation of this country, when the war is past, must remember what we want is power and strength. The problem will be to combine the forms of a republican government with the powers of a monarchial government [like “the Jesuit Republic” in Paraguay] . . . This war has already shown the absurdity of a government of limited powers; it has shown that the power of every government ought to be and must be unlimited.” {7} [Emphasis added]
Mr. Forney, 1863 Radical Red Republican The North American
The Jesuits, with their “Holy Alliance” of despots, conspired to overthrow Protestant republicanism, especially the Federal Government of these United States of America. For our government had been established upon the principles of the Bible of the English Reformation, The Authorized King James Version of 1611. Those principles were embodied in the Protestant documents known as the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Therefore, pursuant to the Council of Trent and Jesuit Oath, this “heretic nation” was to be overthrown as its obedience to the Word of God had produced the greatest Gentile civilization in world history. Of this civilization and government we read in 1835:
The Jesuits – 1861 - 1865



Chapter 26 323
“And what do the people of Europe behold in this country? They witness a successful experiment of a free government; a government of the people; without rulers by divine right; having no hereditary privileged classes; a government exhibiting good order and obedience to law, without an armed police and secret tribunals; a government out of debt; a people industrious, enterprising, thriving in all their interests; without monopolies; a people religious without an establishment; moral and honest without the terrors of the confessional or the inquisition; a people not harmed by the uncontrolled liberty of the press and freedom of opinion; a people that read what they please, and think and judge, and act for themselves; a people enjoying the most unbounded security of person and property; among whom domestic conspiracies are unknown; where the poor and the rich have equal justice; a people social and hospitable, exerting all their energies in schemes of public and private benefit without other control than mutual forbearance.”{8}
This highly cultured and scientifically advanced White, Celtic-Anglo-Saxon Protestant and Baptist-Calvinist civilization consisting of what Rome called “obstinate heretics” practicing Biblical morality must be overthrown. The method was threefold. First, as we have seen, America must be invaded by foreign immigrants, Irish Roman Catholics especially; secondly, civil war must be incited resulting in the annihilation of the White Protestant and Baptist Southern culture; and lastly, the Protestant Constitution must be modified resulting in the centralization of power in Washington, D.C.. We read the following words written in 1855:
“The Duke of Richmond . . . in speaking of the government of the United States, said . . . ‘It will be destroyed, it ought not, and will not be permitted to exist . . . and so long as it exists, no prince will be safe upon his throne; and the sovereigns of Europe are aware of it, and they have determined upon its destruction, and come to an understanding upon this subject, and have decided on the means to accomplish it; and they will eventually succeed by subversion rather than conquest. As the low and surplus population of the different nations of Europe will be carried into that country; it is and will be a receptacle for the bad and disaffected population of Europe, when they are not wanted for soldiers, or to supply the navies, and the European governments will favor such a course. [Did not that bastard son of a Nazi, Fidel Castro, expel Cuban criminals a few years ago, they ultimately landing in Miami, Florida?] This will create a surplus and majority of low population, who are so very easily excited [Irish Roman Catholic “Molly Maguires”] and they will bring with them their principles, and in nine cases out of ten, adhere to their ancient and former governments, laws, manners, and religion, and will transmit them to their posterity, and in many cases propagate them among the natives. These men will become citizens, and by the constitution and laws, will be invested

with the right of suffrage. The different grades of society will then be created by the elevation of a few and by degrading many, and thus a heterogeneous population will then be formed, speaking different languages, and of different religions and sentiments, and to make them act, think, and feel alike, in political affairs, will be like mixing oil and water; hence discord, dissension, anarchy and civil war will ensue, and some popular individual will assume the government and restore order, and the sovereigns of Europe, the immigrants, and many of the natives will sustain him.’ ” {9} [Emphasis added]
(Dear truth-seeker, does this not describe the American Empire of today? Our religious discord and dissension arises from three basic documents. They are the Council of Trent governing Roman Catholicism, the Koran governing Islam, and the Talmud governing Judaism. All three documents are Bible-rejecting, intolerant and hostile to Bible-believing Protestants and Baptists. And no wonder, for all three religions are controlled by the General of the Jesuits through Shriner Freemasonry.)
Such was the plan. The following is how it was accomplished. The Jesuits, using Scottish Rite Freemasonry, first divided the country into geographical sections, North and South, with the Missouri Compromise. The Freemason used to that end was the centralist, Henry Clay. The Jesuits then brought in thousands of Irish Roman Catholics and settled them predominantly in Northern cities! In the 1820s British Secret Service agents under Jesuit control then fomented “the anti-slavery agitation,” as President Buchanan called it, branding slavery as “immoral and evil,” while neither the Bible nor the Constitution forbade it. Then a new political party, consisting of the centralizing, old Federalists, was created in the North called “the Republican Party.” The Jesuits used it to intensify their “anti-slavery agitation” with the Lincoln-Douglas debates, claiming “America could not endure half slave and half free.” This created a tremendous hatred between Northerners and Southerners. Meanwhile, the Jesuits with their Freemasonry created the radical secessionists in the South. They would hotly promote the withdrawing of the Southern States from the Union. Two Freemasons who were radical secessionists were John C. Calhoun and Robert Toombs. Ah, Yes! Enough hatred had been created to justify a war!
The greatest and most powerful American Freemason at this time, however, was the evil Albert Pike. As the Sovereign Grand Commander of Scottish Rite Freemasonry and Confederate General, Albert Pike was to the War Between the States, what Frederick the Great was to the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars. Both men possessed the sovereign power over all “the Craft.” Both men instigated horrific wars of decimation, Napoleon I wrecking Protestant Germany and General Ulysses S. Grant (who was later privy to Lincoln’s assassination for which he was rewarded with two terms in the White House) wasting the Protestant South. Both men served the Jesuit General as the Sons of Loyola authored the rites of “the
The Jesuits – 1861 - 1865



Chapter 26 325
Brotherhood.” And since the Jesuits authored Scottish Rite Freemasonry, the Order and the Craft must serve the same god as revealed by Pike who declared:
“To you, Sovereign Grand Inspectors General, we say this, that you may repeat it to the Brethren of the 32nd, 31st and 30th degrees — the Masonic religion should be, by all of us initiates of the high degrees, maintained in the purity of the Luciferian doctrine . . . Yes, Lucifer is God . . . the true and pure . . . religion is the belief in Lucifer . . . ” {10}
The country was now ready for war by 1860. The Jesuits, in control of the “Radical Red Republican Party” insured the election of Lincoln by disrupting the Democratic convention in Charleston with their Masonic tools, Stephen Douglas in particular! Foretold in 1855 we behold:
“Is there no danger to the Democracy of the country from such formidable foes arrayed against it? Is Metternich its friend? Is the Pope its friend? Are his official documents, now daily put forth, Democratic in their character? Oh, there is no danger to the Democracy, for those most devoted to the Pope; the Roman Catholics, especially the Irish Catholics, are all on the side of Democracy! Yes; to be sure they are on the side of Democracy. They are just where I should look for them. Judas Iscariot joined with the true disciples. Jesuits are not fools . . . the Democratic party is and ever must be the strongest party, unless ruined by traitors and Jesuits in the camps. Yes, it is in the ranks of Democracy I should expect to find them, and for no good purpose, be assured. Every measure of Democratic policy in the least exciting will be pushed to ultraism, so soon as it is introduced for discussion. Let every real Democrat guard against the common Jesuitical artifice of tyrants, an artifice which there is much evidence to believe is practicing against them at this moment, an artifice, which, if not heeded, will surely be the ruin of Democracy: it is founded on the well known principle that ‘extremes meet.’ ” {11} [Emphasis added]
Now, with enough hatred in place, the Jesuits needed an incident to ignite the war. Before Lincoln took office, President James Buchanan, a Protestant Freemason, sent a navy vessel, “The Star of the West,” into Charleston harbor to relieve Fort Sumter. This was an act of war in international law, as the Southern States had lawfully seceded, the right of resuming delegated powers having been specifically reserved by the State Ratification Contracts of New York, Rhode Island and Virginia. The Confederate States responded in the person of General Beauregard, a Roman Catholic Freemason, by firing on the Fort and have been wrongfully blamed for starting the war — just like Germany in World War I and Japan in World War II. Thus, the Northern Freemason who incited America’s
The Jesuits – 1861 - 1865



326 Vatican Assassins
bloodiest war was President James Buchanan. And the Southern Freemason who fired the first shot was General Beauregard.
The Jesuit Order was now delighted. It had used the high Freemasons of America to cut the nation in half, to cause hatred and discord between the Northern and Southern peoples using “the anti-slavery agitation,” and then to ignite a war of annihilation against the White Protestant peoples of the South pursuant to the evil Council of Trent! The great Southern Presbyterian, Robert L. Dabney writes:
“The common language [of the North] breathed threatening and slaughter, and demanded the sack, ruin, and extermination of the Southern people . . . Its intention was a wholesale murder and piracy, the extermination of a whole people’s national life . . . With an inhumanity unknown to modern history, they had extended the law of blockade to all medicines and hospital stores; hoping . . . to make the hurts of every wounded adversary mortal . . . The Federal Congress and Executive had . . . ordained that the war should be a huge piracy . . . declaring all tobacco, cotton and labor of slaves, . . . to be ‘contraband of war’ . . . ” {12}
The purpose was to destroy the primarily Protestant States of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia while only lightly afflicting the primarily Roman Catholic States of Louisiana and Florida. And how did truly “the Rebels” of the Radical Red Republican government of the North, backed by the power of the Jesuits’ Holy Alliance, carry out its plan in destroying truly “the Yankees” of the South? Hundreds of thousands of foreign mercenaries were hired “to extirpate the White Southern heretics from the face of the whole earth.” In addition to eleven thousand Germans, the Jesuits used hundreds of thousands of their most devoted Irish Roman Catholics to ransack the South just as they had done in Germany during the ghastly and nightmarish Thirty Years’ War. We read:
“The radicals, the proletaires [like the future Russian communists], the robbers, the outlaws, of all other lands, flocked to their standards, taught by their ready instincts that their cause was the same. One-half of the prisoners of war, registered by the victorious armies of the South, have been foreign mercenaries . . . the Moloch of Federal ambition has already sacrificed two hundred thousand Irishmen to it. And still, as the flaming sword of the South mows down these hireling invaders, fresh hordes throng the shores.” {13} [Emphasis added]
The Jesuits would control both sides of the conflict as they did during the Napoleonic Wars. They controlled the radicals in the North, particularly Thaddeus Stevens in the House, Charles Sumner in the Senate and Freemason Edwin Stanton, Lincoln’s Secretary of War. They also controlled the leadership in the
The Jesuits – 1861 - 1865



Chapter 26 327
South, particularly President Jefferson Davis (educated at Bardstown’s monastery of St. Thomas College) and Judah Benjamin, the Secretary of War. Of Davis we read:
“There are only very few of the Southern leaders who are not more or less under the influence of the Jesuits, through their wives, family relations, and their friends. Several members of the family of Jeff Davis belong to the
Church of Rome.” {14}
To prove the point, a few specifics will be cited. It was for this reason, after the Confederate Army had defeated the Northern invading Army at the first battle of Manassas (Bull Run), that Jefferson Davis would not permit “Stonewall” Jackson to capture Washington, thereby prolonging the war of annihilation against the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant and Baptist peoples of the States’ Rights Democratic Party of the South — Virginia in particular! For the greatest enemies of the Jesuit Order and the Monarchs of the Holy Alliance had been White, Calvinistic, Baptist and Protestant Virginians — George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and James Monroe. These accursed “heretics and liberals,” having defeated King George’s army (under Jesuit control) at Yorktown, Virginia, had authored the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, the Bill of Rights, the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions and the bold Monroe Doctrine. These great men had been used by the risen Son of God to perform the miracle of rendering the Jesuits’ evil Council of Trent of no effect in Protestant North America.
(Dear truth-seeker, eighty years later the Jesuits would order Hitler (a homosexual according to Lothar Machtan’s The Hidden Hitler) to forbid his victorious German Army from destroying the British Army at Dunkirk, thereby prolonging the war of annihilation against Europe’s Jews, Orthodox Serbs and German Lutherans. For the Jesuit General’s dream of reviving the Pope’s Holy Roman Empire – destroyed by the Messiah’s Protestant Reformation – could never come to pass with all these “obstinate heretics and liberals” in the way. Seeker, are you starting to get a feel for the predictable workings of the Jesuit Order and its foot cavalry, the Masonic Lodge?)
It was for this reason that Confederate General James Longstreet was “appointed” to replace General “Stonewall” Jackson after the latter had been “mistakenly” shot by his own men at the Battle of Chancellorsville. The Jesuits greatly benefited from this appointment; Longstreet betrayed General Lee through disobeying orders at Gettysburg and the Wilderness by attacking too late, the Federals having gained the stronger positions. Of Gettysburg we read:
“It is susceptible of the most overwhelming proof that while General Lee, with a magnanimity that rises to the sublime, when moving among his shattered battalions at Gettysburg said, ‘This is all my fault. I have lost this battle, and you must get me out of it the best you can,’ and that while he refrained as long as he lived from any public censure of his lieutenant, he
The Jesuits – 1861 - 1865



328 Vatican Assassins
did not hesitate to say in the intimacy of private friendship that he lost the battle of Gettysburg mainly because of Longstreet’s disobedience to
orders.” {15} [Emphasis added]
(Years later the Jesuits, in control of Hollywood – the modern-day, violent and degenerate Jesuit Theatre, its most successful director being the Roman Catholic fascist and Knight of Malta Frank Capra in directing the Order’s Jesuit Dramas would release a movie depicting General James Longstreet as the stable hero while General Lee – the foremost soldier of the age according to General Winfield Scott, – was portrayed as an idiot. That abomination of a movie was called Gettysburg.)
It was for this reason that Federal General Meade, a Roman Catholic, was directed by a disguised Jesuit to send one third of his Army to quell Archbishop Hughes’ New York City Draft Riots (“a Romish plot from beginning to end” in the words of Lincoln), and therefore did not pursue General Lee’s betrayed and defeated army at Gettysburg. Of the Jesuit influence on the battlefield President Lincoln said:
“It is true, also, that Meade has remained with us, and gained the bloody battle of Gettysburg . . . But it is evident that his Romanism superseded his patriotism after the battle. He let the army of Lee escape, when it was so easy to cut his retreat and force him to surrender, after having lost nearly half of his soldiers in the last days’ carnage. When Meade was to order the pursuit, after the battle, a stranger came, in haste, to the headquarters, and that stranger was a disguised Jesuit. After a ten minutes’ conversation with him, Meade made such arrangements for the pursuit of the enemy, that he escaped almost untouched, with the loss of only two guns!” {16} [Emphasis added]
And why would the Jesuits want Lee’s army to escape? So the war of annihilation could be continued until the Protestant States of the South had been utterly destroyed by General Grant and General Sherman.
In continuing the description of the destruction of the South, the Jesuits sought to create an insurrection of Black Southern slaves against their White masters by way of a mass emancipation. The Emancipation Proclamation, promoted heavily by the Jesuits in control of England through Queen Victoria, was calculated to incite the slaves to murder their masters. The plot failed as the vast majority of Protestant masters had lovingly taught the Bible to their slaves. One such Protestant was General “Stonewall” Jackson. Upon his death, the Black slaves of his Sunday school gathered around his grave and bitterly mourned his departing. For the Biblical doctrine of White supremacy and Negro subordination was universally believed among White Protestant nations in accordance with Noah’s prophecy given in Genesis 9:18-28. Of this prophecy the Baptist Henry Halley comments in 1927:
The Jesuits – 1861 - 1865



Chapter 26 329
“Descendants of Ham [Blacks] were to be servant races; Shemites [particularly the physical descendants of Jacob] were to preserve the knowledge of the True God; Japhetic races [Whites] were to have the largest portion of the world, and to supplant the Semitic races as teachers of God. It was fulfilled when the Israelites took Canaan, when the Greeks took Sidon, and when Rome conquered Carthage; and ever since Japhetic races [White] have dominated the world, and have been converted to the God of Shem [the God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ], while Semitic races have occupied a place of comparative insignificance [during Israel’s Diaspora]; and Hamitic races [Blacks] have occupied a place of servitude. An amazing forecast!” {17} [Emphasis added]
A short summary is given by R. G. Horton, a prominent Northern Democrat, of the attitude of the Southern Whites toward their Negro servants:
“The negro was not a man like the white man. He had never been so elevated at any time in the history of his race as the four millions in the Southern States. Our form of society had civilized and Christianized [Protestant and Baptist] the only Negroes that ever had been civilized or Christianized. This is simple historical fact, which no one dare defy [except the Jesuits using their Masonically-controlled Black “Nation of Islam,” their Rockefeller Center-based “Lucepress,” their Masonically-controlled “Civil Rights Movement,” and their Jesuit Dramas known as “Hollywood movies” in creating Fourteenth Amendment America’s Second Reconstruction (1950 to the Present) using hostile and radical, socialist-communist American Blacks, specifically hating the White Celtic Anglo-Saxon Protestants and Baptists as did the brilliant mulatto NOI spokesman, Malcolm X, prior to his return from Mecca]. . . . It is our duty, as the superior race, to care for these people whom God, in his providence, has given us. We should try to understand their natures, their capacities, and their wants, and then adapt our laws so that they will be in the happiest, the healthiest and best condition it is possible for them to attain. That is what the Southern people [mostly Protestant and Baptist] tried to do, and though no society is perfect, yet all must admit that the negroes were better off every way before the war than now. A million, it is estimated, have died in the effort to make them act like white people. . . . Thousands of these poor creatures have died of small pox and other loathsome diseases. Hundreds have starved to death or died of exposure, and all because of the false teachings of the abolitionists [controlled by the Jesuits], who deceived the people, and told them that society as it existed at the [White male dominant Protestant and Baptist] South was ‘a sin and a crime.’ ” {18} [Emphasis added]

After the war, while under martial law, the Jesuits continued their attempt to destroy the Protestant White race of the South. The unparalleled and farsighted R. L. Dabney, one of the South’s greatest Presbyterian ministers and youngest member of General Jackson’s staff, writes:
“ . . . once abolition by federal aggression came, these other sure results would follow . . . full negro equality: that negro equality thus theoretically established would be practical negro superiority; . . . that this miserable career must result in one of two things, either a war of races, in which the whites or the blacks would be, one or the other exterminated; or amalgamation . . . And this apparently is the destiny which our conquerors have in view [which is in complete agreement with the Order’s Masonic Jewish Zionist Israel Cohen’s A Racial Program for the 20th Century (1912) advocating Negro agitation against the Whites, Negro prominence in sports and entertainment and ultimate interracial marriage]. If indeed they can mix the blood of the heroes of Manassas with this vile stream from the fens of Africa, then they will never again have occasion to tremble before the righteous resistance of [Protestant] Virginian freemen; but will have a race supple and vile enough to fill that position of political subjection, which they desire to fix on the South.” {19} [Emphasis added]
Again R. G. Horton agrees:
“The laws of every State in the Union wisely denied negroes an equality with white people. I say this was a just and necessary provision in order to prevent what is called mulattoism or mongrelism, that is, a mixture of the white and black races, which history and experience have proved to be one of the greatest curses that can befall a society. Every nation on the face of the earth where such a mixture has taken place to any considerable extent, has declined in its civilization, and gradually sunk down in ruin, as if wasted by slow poison. And that is just what it was. God’s punishment upon men for violating his laws.” {20} [Emphasis added]
(Dear truth-seeker, do you now understand why Hollywood – the Jesuit Theatre – is constantly shoving race-mixing and interracial marriages down America’s throat? For the last forty years the “Lucepress,” controlled by the Cardinal’s Council on Foreign Relations in New York, has gone to every extreme to intimidate White and Black people into practicing this sin against the risen Son of God! They have branded us Whites as “haters of the Black race,” describing us with newly defined words such as “racist” and “prejudice” (basically non-hateful terms), if we do not consent to the Order’s program of forced integration, amalgamation and miscegenation. Did not Nehemiah, the man of God furiously rebuke his own Jewish people for race mixing, forcing them to put away their foreign wives (Nehemiah 13:23-31)? Did not Jesus

the Messiah command his disciples, when sent out to preach the good news that the Davidic kingdom of heaven was about to be established on earth, not to enter into any city of the Samaritans (Matthew 10:5) — the racially half Jews?!!)
The Jesuits now sat on top of the ruin of George Washington’s Protestant Republic. America had experienced her atheistic French Revolution. The Radical “Red” Republicans, led by Sumner and Stevens, were like the Jacobins led by Robespierre and Danton. Archbishop Hughes, defending the Temporal Power of the Pope, had visited Europe and Rome in support of the North during 1861-62 at the request of Lincoln and Seward. After the war, Hughes was recommended to Pius IX for a Cardinal’s red hat by the Radical Red Republicans. Brigands Grant and Sherman had led their monster armies, composed of a large number of Irish Roman Catholic and foreign banditti, on a campaign of rapine, plunder and mass destruction, utterly disgracing the noble art of arms. While Sherman’s Crusaders were burning the Protestant cities of Atlanta, Georgia and Columbia, South Carolina to the ground, the honorable Baptist and Confederate General Jubal Early had ordered his men to put out a large fire in Wrightsville, Pennsylvania. (The fire had been set by the inhabitants of Columbia, Pennsylvania, as they had burned the bridge spanning the Susquehanna River in seeking to prevent the Confederates from crossing.)
America, more so than France, lay in ruins as nearly seven hundred thousand of her sons had died, according to the Civil War Museum in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Margaret Mitchell, the author of America’s greatest novel, Gone With the Wind, captures the tragedy of this moment with a poem written on the back of a Confederate Note:
“Representing nothing on God’s earth now and naught in the waters below it As the pledge of a nation that’s passed away Keep it, dear friend, and show it. Show it to those who will lend an ear To the tale this trifle will tell Of Liberty, born of patriot’s dream, Of a storm-cradled nation that fell.” {21}
The Jesuits were now the secret masters of the United States. They had restored absolutism to France with a coup d’etat in 1852, resulting in the dictatorship of Napoleon III. But in the United States they were careful to institute a very deceptive form of absolutism, via a coup d’etat known as the Fourteenth Amendment. This amendment would create the consolidation of the States into the “Holy Roman” American Empire of the Twentieth Century. And it was predominantly the Protestant-Calvinist people of the South who fought the Holy Alliance’s predominantly Roman Catholic people of the North in seeking to prevent

the establishment of the centralized American Empire. For these Protestant Calvinists, in seeking to prevent the Pope from ruling the world once again, did
“ . . . look to the Federative System, between Free [Sovereign and Independent] Democratic States, as the surest means of saving Mankind from ultimate universal Monarchial Rule.” {22} [Emphasis added]
With the destruction of the righteous and noble people of the Protestant South, the Roman Catholic people of the North enslaved themselves to the Jesuits in Washington, D.C. The Jesuits, using their “Republicans” as they had used their “Jacobins” in France, raised a huge “Grand Army,” like that of Napoleon’s, which during the Twentieth Century would be used to restore the Pope’s Temporal Power around the world after it had destroyed the Indian Nations in the West. (When the Jesuits create an Empire there is first always “ethnic cleansing.”) R. L. Dabney, in foreseeing the overthrow of Europe’s Monarchs, wrote of this new Jesuit power:
“History will some day place the position of these Confederate States, in this high argument, in the clearest light of her glory. The cause they undertook to defend was that of regulated, constitutional liberty, and of fidelity to law and covenants, against the licentious violence of physical power. The assumptions they resisted were precisely those of that radical democracy [socialist-communism], which deluged Europe with blood at the close of the eighteenth century [the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars], and which shook its thrones again in the convulsions of 1848 [the Second French Revolution]. . . . This power . . . at the beginning of the century, had transferred its immediate designs across the Atlantic, was consolidating itself anew in the Northern States of America, with a wealth, an organization, an audacity, an extent, to which it never aspired in the lands of its birth, and was preparing to make the United States, after crushing all law there under its brute will, the fulcrum whence they should extend their lever to upheave every legitimate throne [except England’s] in the Old World.” {23} [Emphasis added]
Meanwhile in Rome, the Jesuit General, in anticipating the victory of the Northern Army, caused his servant, Pope Pius IX, to erect the Jesuits’ American College in 1864. We read:
“The pontificate of Pio Nono is likely to become historical from two circumstances, possibly three — the flight of Gaeta [after a Jesuit-controlled assassin sent by Masonic Mazzini murdered the Pope’s “liberal” reforming officer, Pellegrini Rossi], the promulgation of the Immaculate Conception, and, peradventure, the dismemberment of the ecclesiastical territories. Besides this [in seeking to revive the use of the guillotine according to J. A. Wylie) I know of nothing in his administration

that can claim a place in history, except it may be that he has erected a
college in Rome, for the special benefit of American youth.” {24}
And why? It was to train future American priests to rule the American Empire through both political parties. One young Irish American trained by Jesuits at the American College in Rome was none other than “the American Pope,” the dark mastermind behind the Kennedy assassination and sin-hardened sodomite,
Francis Cardinal Spellman!
Meanwhile in Mexico, shortly before our American “Civil War” broke out in 1861, that oppressed nation, plagued with dictators and revolts for nearly forty years, finally began to enjoy the wonderful taste of free, “liberal” government, so condemned by the Jesuits’ evil Council of Trent. The great pro-Protestant, liberal and inspiration of the Mexican people, Benito Pablo Juarez, was proclaimed President upon his triumphal entry into the capital in 1860. For three long years the War of Reform, ignited by the suspension of the liberal Constitution, had raged between the Jesuit tyranny of General Ignacio Comonfort (named after Ignatius Loyola) and the liberals led by Juarez.
And now, with the sweet taste of victory, the risen Son of God having answered their prayers, our hero, Benito Juarez, removed the millstone from around the neck of his beloved people, it having been ruthlessly fastened by the heartless Sons of Loyola. The first thing he did was to break the financial and political power of the Jesuit General’s soon-to-be infallible Pope Pius IX, along with his Hierarchy and Clergy manning his worldwide colossus of wealth – the Vatican Empire – by:
1. Suspending for two years all payments on public debts of every kind; since, they were owed to the Masonic banking agents of the Vatican;
2. Declaring marriage a civil contract and not a privilege granted by the Pope;
3. Suppressing celibacy and the Inquisition’s ecclesiastical courts;
4. Confiscating the Pope’s Church property valued at over one hundred million silver dollars and over one third (thirty-five percent) of Mexico’s choicest land and holdings;
5. Separating the Roman Catholic Church government, with its Pope, Hierarchy and Jesuits, from the government, having expelled the Archbishop of Mexico!
Dear truth-seeker, for the first time in the history of our southern neighbor, the Temporal Power of the Papal-Caesar had been broken. Juarez upheld the Constitution of 1857, which guaranteed freedom of speech and freedom of the press so condemned by the Jesuits’ evil Council of Trent.

We Americans, in two hundred years, have never had such a hero as this!!!
He’s a Mexican Oliver Cromwell!!!! Wow!!!!
Ah, dear truth-seeker, these wonderful works of righteousness never go unresisted by the Devil and his shogun Priest-King, the Black Pope. With their “Holy Alliance” of European despots, England, France and Spain invaded. Our hero, Juarez, fled the capital for his life while the Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian – the tool of the Jesuits’ Napoleon III of France – was made Mexico’s absolutist Emperor in 1864. After three years of stout Mexican resistance coupled with Abraham Lincoln’s enforcement of the Monroe Doctrine, Juarez prevailed, ordering the righteous execution of the Austrian usurper in 1867. This further infuriated the Jesuits! For five more years Benito Juarez remained President, pursuing his “liberal,” anti-Council of Trent policies, until he died at his desk of “apoplexy” — the poison cup!
In spite of our hero’s death however, the risen Son of God chose to deliver the Mexican people, as He accounted them worthy of the liberty for which they had shed so much blood. The following year, in 1873, the glorious Mexican government – one year following the German Parliament’s banishment of the Order from the German-Prussian Empire – expelled the Jesuits from all of Mexico! Praise God! Little did the Mexican people know they would pay dearly for this! Three years later General Porfirio Diaz would come to power who in turn would restore the Jesuits. This merciless, military dictator would then rule Mexico with an iron fist, faithfully serving the Society of Jesus for over thirty years (from 1876 to 1911), while Emperor Meiji was ruling for the Order in Japan. Three years later, in 1914, the Sons of Loyola would bring their Second Thirty Years’ War into Mexico resulting in over one million deaths pursuant to the Jesuit Oath and the wicked and evil Council of Trent!
Dear truth-seeker, by 1945 Mexico would be completely in the hands of the Company’s Black Pope. Today, fifty-seven years later, our southern neighbor has been reduced to a coolie nation with absolutism, crime, poverty and misery reigning supreme. In the midst of this disgraceful, modern day Jesuit Reduction thrives a multi billion-dollar drug trade having absorbed every ruler of the land. One such ruler is Governor Felipe Gonzales of Aguascalientes. And wouldn’t you know it, Governor Gonzales is one of Archbishop Edward Egan’s most faithful and obedient Knights of Columbus!

James Buchanan, 1791 – 1868 #91 Fifteenth President of these United States of America, 1857 - 1861 At first a Federalist and witnessing the alarming centralizing tendencies of the party, James Buchanan switched to Jefferson’s Democratic Party and became a great admirer of President Andrew Jackson. As a Democrat and an advocate of the rights of the States not expressly delegated to the Federal government by the Constitution, President Buchanan refused to make war on the Southern States threatening to leave the Union. Like John F. Kennedy seeking to end Cardinal Spellman’s War in Vietnam, he blamed Southern secession on the radical Red/Black Republican Northern abolitionists and refused to ignite Archbishop Hughes’ War Between the States, as he opposed the conspiracy of Prince Metternich’s Holy Alliance. Therefore, on the 23rd of February 1857 at the Order’s National Hotel in Washington, D.C., the President and his Northern men were poisoned with arsenic sprinkled in their tea. Thirty-eight people died as the Order fulfilled its bloody Oath once again. But Buchanan survived and toward the end of his Presidency, on January 5, 1861, he sent a merchant steamer called the “Star of the West” to reinforce Fort Sumter, it carrying “troops and foodstuffs.” This act ignited the Jesuits’ “American Civil War.” Photograph of James Buchanan, purchased at the Wheatland Mansion, Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

With his Southern lodge-rooms he drew the Protestants of the South into a war during which they were betrayed by their leaders beholden to the fear of death by Masonic masters subordinate to the Jesuit General in Rome. After the War, the Masonic victors erected two of their Masonic idols in celebration of the Black Pope’s newly created “Holy Roman” American Empire. They were the Washington Monument (1885) and the Statue of Liberty (1886), it having been designed by the Roman Catholic French Freemason, Frederic Auguste Bartholdi.

Having studied for the priesthood as a young man, he became the most dreaded enemy of the Society of Jesus while hating the Temporal Power of the Papal Caesar in Rome. He exiled the Archbishop of Mexico along with five Bishops, confiscated all of the Pope’s Church property composing the finest lands of the Nation, expelled the Spanish ambassador and hated Prince Metternich’s Holy Alliance. He enforced the “liberal” Constitution of 1857 securing the Protestant rights of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, utterly condemned by the Black Pope’s Council of Trent. He sought to establish a Middle Class and repudiated the National Debt. In 1867 he rightly executed Mexico’s usurper and tyrant, Ferdinand Maximilian of the Order’s House of Hapsburg, sent by France’s Napoleon III, further outraging the Jesuits! For refusing to uphold the Pope’s Temporal Power, Juarez became a “rebel king” and therefore a “tyrant” according to the Satanic doctrines of the Spanish Jesuit, Francisco Suarez.

C. S. Lewis, 1961 English
Novelist Screwtape Proposes a Toast
The Jesuits had successfully waged a war between two sovereign nations, the United States of America and the Confederate States of America. The despots of the Jesuits’ Holy Alliance had sided with the North, and thus, the Southern people fought the world. The deceived patriots of the North fought to “save the Union” but they in fact destroyed it, and on its ruins the Jesuits, with their Freemasons, would erect a new Union — a new United Socialist States of America.
This new nation would be a Jesuit socialist republic with the President exercising powers of an absolute Monarch. The old Calvinistic Federal Republic of Washington would be converted into a huge centralized Empire with the ten planks of the Masonic Communist Manifesto replacing The Ten Commandments of Moses.
In order to accomplish this, the Constitution had to be amended — “by hook or by crook.” It would be amended in accordance with the Masonic cry of both French Revolutions. “Liberty” would be the Thirteenth Amendment. “Equality” would be the Fourteenth Amendment. “Fraternity” would be the Fifteenth Amendment. We now will examine the forced ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment with all its tyranny and usurpation, as it was the coup d’etat.
The Jesuits – 1868 - 1872



340 Vatican Assassins
On July 28, 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment was declared “ratified” by the Radicals in Washington. Since 1866 the Southern States had been under martial law and divided into five military districts. The districts were governed by five Union Generals beholden to the Jesuits, including General Benjamin F. Butler known as “Butler the Beast.” The wicked Thaddeus Stevens with his “Reconstruction Act” of 1866 had implemented martial law. And why? Because the Southern State governments, having ratified the Thirteenth Amendment, refused to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment. So the solution of the Radicals, to the disgrace of the Protestant ministers and people of the North, was to suspend the lawful State governments and impose martial law (absolutism). The only way the Southern States could be readmitted into this new “Union of North American Socialist Republics,” thereby ending martial law, was to “ratify” this new amendment. That is called “consent at the point of a bayonet” or “forced conversion of heretics.”
Why was the Fourteenth Amendment, forced on the South by the Jacobins of the North, so important to the Jesuits and their despots of Europe, including the Protestant Queen Victoria of England whose policies were dictated by her Jesuit-controlled Prime Ministers, Lord John Russell and Viscount Palmerston? Section 1 of the Amendment reads:
“All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” {5}
The coup d’etat is in the first sentence. It made all persons born in the United States (excluding the Indian nations) citizens of the United States first and citizens of a State secondly. This reversed the original American citizenship. Senator James G. Blaine, one of the Radical Red Republicans of the day, explained:
“In the first place, we ask that they will agree to certain changes in the Constitution of the United States; and, to begin with, we want them to unite with us in broadening the citizenship of the Republic. The slaves recently emancipated by proclamation, and subsequently by Constitutional Amendment, have no civil status. They should be made citizens, and in making this extension of citizenship, we are not confining the breadth and scope of our efforts to the negro. It is for the white man as well. We intend to make citizenship National. Heretofore, a man has been a citizen of the United States because he was a citizen of some one of the States: Now, we propose to reverse that, and make him a citizen of any State where he

Chapter 27
chooses to reside, by defining in advance his National citizenship — and our Amendment declares that ‘all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the States [State] wherein they reside.’ ” {6}[Emphasis added]
Years later our Jesuit-controlled Supreme Court, in describing the effect of the Fourteenth Amendment, would say the same as its radical authors.
“ ‘In reviewing the subject,’ [“Jesuitical”] Chief Justice White [according to our hero Jeremiah Crowley] said in the Selective Draft Law Cases, 245 US 366, 377, 388-389, ‘ . . . it broadened the national scope of the Government under the Constitution by causing citizenship of the United States to be paramount and dominant instead of being subordinate and derivative, and therefore, operating as it does upon all the powers conferred by the Constitution.’ ” {7} [Emphasis added]
Simply put, by reversing American citizenship and making it “National,” all the powers of the government, granted by the Constitution, were greatly increased. A new citizenship created a new government. All the executive, legislative and judicial powers in Washington were “broadened.” So the radicals, pretending to do good to the Black freedman, used these freedmen to centralize and increase Rome’s power in Washington with the Fourteenth Amendment.
(This is exactly what happened as a result of the Civil Rights movement during the 1960s. In seeking to concentrate more power in Washington under the guise of ending segregation in the South, the Jesuits using Freemasonry fomented the Civil Rights Agitation with their Black communist, Martin Luther (Lucifer) King. Once again, the using of American Negroes conferred more power in Washington with the 1964 Civil Rights Act enacted through a perversion of “The Commerce Clause,” written by one of Rome’s most powerful priests in America with over one hundred earned and honorary degrees, CFR member Theodore M. Hesburgh. Race-mixing in the South would gradually become a reality accelerating the destruction of another White Protestant and Baptist “heretic” nation!)
Many Southern statesmen knew the true purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment. The former Vice-President of the Confederacy, Alexander Stephens, was one of them. He wrote:
“These monstrous Reconstruction Measures, with all their enormities and fatal tendencies towards ultimate complete Centralism and Empire, are still based upon the assumption that the States, as separate integral parts, constitute members of what is still, in words, at least, acknowledged to be a
The Jesuits – 1868 - 1872



342 Vatican Assassins
Federal Union! All these bold usurpations of power are, upon their face, nothing but resorts to induce, or to compel, under duress, the Peoples of the several Southern States to go through the forms of adopting the Fourteenth
Amendment . . . ” {8}
The Freemason Alexander H. Stephens knew that the forced ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment would create a centralized Empire out of a federation of sovereign States. The President would exercise powers of a Monarch, the Congress would exercise powers of a Parliament and the Supreme Court would exercise powers of a King’s Bench, having its jurisdiction extended to include anything and everything under the guise of the new “Federal Question Jurisdiction.”
Federal Question Jurisdiction is an alien and foreign jurisdiction to the original Constitution. It created “judicial supremacy” in the Supreme Court, broadening its power to overturn laws and decisions of the several States. There are virtually no judicial decisions, state or federal, that cannot be appealed to the Supreme Court with a “Writ of Certiorari.” With this all-encompassing jurisdiction and the thousands of appeals filed annually, the Jesuits at Georgetown University influence the Supreme Court as to which cases to hear. The ensuing decisions further the purpose of the Order in destroying White, Protestant American culture along with its popular self-government or “liberalism,” as the Jesuits call it. Remembering previous chapters, the Jesuits have avowed to destroy both Protestantism and Liberalism pursuant to their Jesuit Oath and Council of Trent.
In looking back, we Americans can see the evil decisions made possible by the Jesuits’ “Federal Question Jurisdiction.” Among others, it enabled the Supreme Court to force the religion of evolution down our throats, to force the integration of public schools when neither the Whites nor the Blacks wanted it; to legalize abortion and prohibit capital punishment overthrowing laws of the States to the contrary, and to outlaw Bible-reading and prayer in the “accursed public schools.” For in prohibiting Bible-reading and prayer in the public schools, Protestant civilization is destroyed, and with it, popular self-government — to the delight of the Jesuit Order!
The Jesuits are absolutists. Therefore, the governments they control must exercise absolute powers. Since rights limit powers, the rights of the citizens can be no more than privileges granted from absolute governments. Ancient liberties and common-law rights cannot be included. Such is the case with every socialist-communist government of today, be it the monarchy of Queen Elizabeth II, the military dictatorship of Castro or the democracy of Presidents William J. Clinton or George W. Bush, alias “King George II,” being of England’s past Stuart Dynasty.
Therefore, one more nail had to be driven into America’s coffin. The Jesuits would not allow the powers newly given to Washington to be absolutely limited by
The Jesuits – 1868 - 1872



Chapter 27 343
the rights of its newly created national citizens, White and Black. The “privileges and immunities” of this new Fourteenth Amendment citizenship had to be defined by the Supreme Court so as not to include fundamental or common-law rights. This happened on April 14, 1873 (the anniversary of the assassination of President Lincoln in the Ford’s Theater “Slaughterhouse”) with the decision given in the Slaughterhouse Cases, 83 US 36, 80 (1873). The decision truly slaughtered our rights. The court held:
“We are of the opinion that the rights claimed by these plaintiffs in error [fundamental common-law rights] if they have any existence [What arrogance!!!] are not privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States within the meaning of the clause of the fourteenth amendment under consideration.” {9}
The Freemason, Justice Stephen Field, another hero and nearly assassinated by one of his judicial brethren, strongly dissented. He declared:
“The fundamental rights, privileges, and immunities which belong to him as a free man and a free citizen, now belong to him as a citizen of the United States, and are not dependent upon his citizenship of any State. . . . The Amendment does not attempt to confer any new privileges or immunities upon citizens, or to enumerate or define those already existing. It assumes that there are such privileges and immunities, which belong of right to citizens as such, and ordains that they shall not be abridged by state legislation. If this inhibition has no reference to privileges and immunities of this character, but only refers, as held by the majority of the court in their opinion, to such privileges and immunities as were, before its adoption, specially designated in the Constitution, or necessarily implied as belonging to citizens of the United States, it was a vain and idle enactment, which accomplished nothing, and most unnecessarily excited Congress and the people on its passage . . . But, if the Amendment refers to the natural and inalienable rights which belong to all citizens, the inhibition has a profound significance and consequence.” {10} [Emphasis added]
Field was correct but the radical Black Republicans prevailed. Slaughterhouse would be the precedent with which every following decision must agree. The Bill of Rights would not be considered as privileges and immunities of Fourteenth Amendment U.S. citizenship. But the two great dissenters through the years (both being Freemasons according to House Undivided by Allen Roberts (1961)) would be our heroes, Justice Stephen Field and Justice John Marshall Harlan from Kentucky. Harlan’s great dissent in Maxwell v. Dow, 176 US 597, 607, 610, 611 (1899), given just before the turn of the Black Pope’s “American Century” reads:
The Jesuits – 1868 - 1872

“It seems to me that the privileges and immunities enumerated in these [ten] amendments belong to every citizen of the United States. They were universally so regarded prior to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment. . . .I take it no one doubts that the great men who laid the foundations of our government regarded the preservation of the privileges and immunities specified in the first ten Amendments as vital to the personal security of American citizens . . .
But, if I do not wholly misapprehend the scope and legal effect of the present decision, the Constitution of the United States does not stand in the way of any state striking down guaranties of life and liberty that English-speaking people have for centuries regarded as vital to personal security, and which the men of the revolutionary period universally claimed as the birthright of freemen.” {11} [Emphasis added]
This same question was again before the Court in 1908. In Twining v. New Jersey, 211 US 97, 105, 106 (1908), the majority opinion sealed forever the holding of the Slaughterhouse Cases. Proceeding as if it were England’s King’s Bench or the Pope’s Sacred Rota, it arrogantly declared:
“This view is based upon the contention which must now be examined, that the safeguards of personal rights which are enumerated in the first eight articles of amendment to the Federal Constitution, sometimes called the Federal Bill of Rights though they were by those Amendments originally secured only against national action, are among the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, which this clause of the 14th Amendment protects against state action. This view has been, at different times, expressed by justices of this court . . . (Mr. Justice Field . . . and Mr. Justice Harlan . . . ), and was undoubtedly that entertained by some of those who framed the Amendment.
[The Court then gives its Jesuitical, absolutist, tyrannical decree, opening the door for the Empire’s future fascist Roman Catholic, military dictatorship.]
It is, however, not profitable to examine the weighty arguments in its favor, for the question is no longer open in the court. The right of trial by jury in civil cases, guaranteed by the 7th Amendment . . . and the right to bear arms, guaranteed by the 2nd Amendment, have been distinctly held not to be privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, guaranteed by the 14th Amendment . . . the same decision was made in respect of the guaranty against prosecution, except by indictment of a grand jury, contained in the 5th Amendment . . . and in

respect of the right to be confronted with witnesses, contained in the 6th Amendment . . . In Maxwell v. Dow, supra, where the plaintiff in error had been convicted in a state court of a felony upon an information, and by jury of eight persons, it was held that the indictment, made indispensable by the 5th Amendment, and the trial by jury, guaranteed by the 6th Amendment, were not privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, as those words were used in the 14th Amendment. The discussion in that case ought not to be repeated. All the arguments for the other view were considered and answered . . . the decision rested upon the ground that this clause of the 14th Amendment did not forbid the states to abridge the personal rights enumerated in the first eight Amendments, because those rights were not within the meaning of the clause ‘privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States’ [And if the states are not forbidden to abridge the personal rights enumerated in the first eight Amendments, then, logically, neither is the National government forbidden to do likewise! What a sly accomplishment was this deceptive coup d’etat of the Black Pope!]” {12} [Emphasis added]
Dear truth-seeker, the rights of the people limit the powers of the government. If the people have no absolute rights of citizenship, the rulers have absolute powers of government. This is precisely what the Radical Red Republican Supreme Court accomplished for the Jesuit Order when it overthrew the absolute rights of American citizens, secured by the pen and sword of Calvinist freemen.
The Slaughterhouse Cases reduced each one of us to the status of a feudal, Roman Catholic serf to whom, upon birth and baptism, is granted privileges and immunities of citizenship from the all-powerful National Government and Church of Rome. The government is ruled by its Commander-in-Chief and the Church is ruled by its “infallible” Papal Caesar of Rome, both of which are mere puppets of the General of the Jesuits, the Black Pope.
Summing it up, by 1868 the Jesuits, with their radicals Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner, had forced the Fourteenth Amendment on the peoples of the States, North and South. They had created a new nation as a result of creating a new citizenship. By 1872 the Jesuits, with their radicals on the Supreme Court, had made the powers of both the Federal (now National) and State governments absolute, limited only by decisions of their respective King’s Benches — the Federal (now National) and State Supreme Courts. The transition from a Presbyterian form of government to a Roman Catholic form of government had been accomplished. And how did they do that? By declaring that the Bill of Rights were not privileges and immunities of Fourteenth Amendment citizenship, thereby overthrowing the ancient liberties of White, English-speaking, Protestant and Baptist freemen.

Indeed, the words of Jesuit-trained Pope Leo XIII have come to pass. The Constitution of the United States has been modeled to the principles of the Roman Catholic Church. This is the foundation of the American Empire’s coming fascist military dictator, martial law, Concordat with Rome and mass execution of a mixed people having corrupted themselves and whose iniquity has come to the full.
The injustice of an absolutist, robbing people of their liberties and giving to them privileges in their stead, is not new. Nimrod, the Black antichrist of the Old Testament, had done this to the people of Babylon. We read:
“Though by setting up as king, Nimrod invaded the patriarchal system, and abridged the liberties of mankind, yet he was held by many to have conferred benefits upon them, that amply indemnified them for the loss of their liberties, and covered him with glory and renown . . . he was the first that abridged the liberties of mankind as the grand ‘Emancipator!’ [Did Rome use Lincoln to be America’s Nimrod?]” {13}
The “New Republic” in a “New Era” deserves a “New Name.” From now on the United States will be called “Fourteenth Amendment America,” “the American Empire” or “the Holy Roman American Empire” composed of “the Union of American/Soviet Socialist Republics” or rather, “the United Socialist States of North America” which apparently now include predominantly Roman Catholic Canada and Roman Catholic Mexico through the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), heavily promoted by Cardinal O’Connor’s Knight of Malta and secret Kennedy assassin, Roman Catholic Lee Iacocca! For as the Jesuits in 1852 overthrew the Second Republic of France and imposed an Empire fully intended to fight the Papal Caesar’s wars led by Napoleon III, so they agitated and overthrew the blessed, White Anglo-Saxon Protestant Republic in America with the War Between the States. On its ruins, the Sons of Loyola erected an Evil Socialist-Communist Empire with the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 and perfected it in 1933 with their Shriner Freemason, FDR, using his socialist-communist New (dirty) Deal endorsed by Jesuit-controlled Charles E. Coughlin along with Priests John Ryan and Monsignor Francis J. Haas of Catholic University of America. The Society of Jesus, with their vile, “Holy Alliance” of White tyrants serving the Pope, had won. As unbelievable as the world’s headlines read in 1960 –“Eichmann in Jerusalem”– even so the world moved ever closer to the same kind of shock and surprise when the Pope, “whose deadly wound was healed” and thus adored by the International Press, will also suddenly appear in Jerusalem as the man-beast!
From this time forward, we, the American people, both White and Black, would never go to war with England again. But rather, we would be brainwashed and incited to fight alongside of our ancient foe in World War I and World War II — the Jesuit General’s Second Thirty Years’ War.

Alexander H. Stephens, 1812 – 1883 #94 Vice President of the Confederate States of America, 1861 - 1865 An invalid from infancy and orphaned at the age of fourteen, this native low-level Freemason of the Sovereign State of Georgia defended the working concept of White Supremacy and Negro Subordination when both races must share the same soil. Therefore he, like James Buchanan, opposed the “Anti-slavery Agitation” in Congress as a usurpation of the Right of Georgia to regulate its own domestic institution of slavery. He consented to the terrible Missouri Compromise of 1850, authored by the centralist and Freemason Henry Clay, which ignored the warning of George Washington’s Farewell Address, the Jesuits effectively dividing the Union in half preparing it for war. Stephens defended the right of any State to secede citing the Ratifications of New York, Rhode Island and Virginia. In his masterpiece, A Constitutional View of the Late War Between the States published in 1867 while Georgia was under martial law, he warned that if the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified it would create a centralized Empire composed of mere provinces out of what had been a Federated Republic of Sovereign Nation States, further preparing the way for the Universal Monarchial Rule of One Man – the risen Papal Caesar.

Charles Sumner, 1811 – 1874 #95 U.S. Senator of Massachusetts, 1851 - 1856 and 1860 - 1874 This heartless criminal was an uncompromising absolutist and the most radical of the Radical Red Republicans and Reconstructionists of the North. The leading voice in the Senate, he advocated the wholesale theft of the Calvinist South during the Jesuit Order’s War of Northern Aggression. Previously, he had toured Europe and personally visited with that monster and continental tyrant of Austria, Prince von Metternich. Controlled by the Jesuits, who teach the canon law doctrine of Pope Gregory VII (1073-1085), that “it is no murder to kill a heretic,” Sumner was sent to the Senate by the Jesuits controlling Boston to advocate a “higher law” than the Bible of our Protestant Republic, The Authorized King James Version of 1611, and the Constitution of the United States, as these sacred documents regulated and protected the master/slave relationship uncondemned by Christ Himself. In leveling the Male-dominant, White Protestant Middle Class, the Jesuits would reduce all Whites, Blacks, Men and Women to medieval political equality by wickedly imposing Satan’s Marxian socialist-communism, the economic system of the Pope’s Dark Ages, resulting in more centralization of power in “Rome on the Potomac.” This evil man holds the distinction of being one of the founders of the Black Pope’s “Holy Roman” Fourteenth Amendment American Empire, having been used to restore the Temporal Power of the Pope around the world by means of deceptive diplomacy and universal war throughout the Twentieth Century.

While living with his Roman Catholic mulatto concubine during his dictatorship in Congress and having obtained a Congressional appropriation of 32,000 dollars for the Order’s “Sisters of Charity,” he was the great tool of the Jesuits in creating their socialist-communist monster of the Twentieth Century, Fourteenth Amendment America. He was called a “traitor” by President Johnson while he “destroyed the government of the Old Union, changed its form and spirit, and made a new Union with new theories and new powers.” Horace Greeley, one of Stevens’ masters, adds, “We have brought all laborers to a common level . . . by reducing the whole working population, white and black, to a condition of serfdom.” On his deathbed this old communist “commoner” was baptized into the Roman Catholic Institution for a job well done in obedience to the Papal Caesar’s tyrannical Holy Alliance and the Black Pope’s evil Council of Trent.

“Jesuits are good haters. Those who are not for them are against them, and are treated correspondingly. It makes no difference whether a man is a Catholic, priest, bishop, or even Pope. Indeed the more influential and orthodox the opponent, the greater the obligation to be on the Jesuit side, and if he is not, so much the greater justification for hating him.” {1}
Count von Hoensbroech, 1911 German Noble & Ex-Jesuit Fourteen Years a Jesuit
“ ‘I am so glad to meet you again,’ he said: ‘you see that your friends, the Jesuits have not yet killed me. But they would have surely done it when I passed through their most devoted city, Baltimore, had I not defeated their plans, by passing incognito a few hours before they expected me . . . ’
‘New projects of assassination are detected almost every day, accompanied with such savage circumstances, that they bring to my memory the massacre of St. Bartholomew and the Gunpowder Plot. We feel, at their investigation, that they come from the same masters in the art of murder, the Jesuits . . . ’
‘So many plots have already been made against my life, that it is a real miracle that they have all failed, when we consider that the great majority of them were in the hands of skillful Roman Catholic murderers, evidently trained by the Jesuits.’ ” {2}

Chapter 28 351
The American bloodbath, begun in 1861 and ending in 1865, had been spawned in Rome and carried out by the Jesuits using Scottish Rite Freemasonry. The Jesuits, with their Archbishop John Hughes of New York, sat atop of the ruins of America’s Protestant Calvinist republic ready to create their new Empire with the Fourteenth Amendment. New York would become “the Empire State” from which the Cardinal would be “the Archbishop of the capital of the world.” Additionally, the Jesuits were ready to amalgamate the races with the purpose of making America a nation of color, reducing it to a priest-ridden Mexico, Cuba and South America.
The Radical Red Republican party had served the Jesuits well. In destroying the South it had nearly decimated Jefferson’s Democratic States-Rights party. Thaddeus Stevens, with his Roman Catholic mulatto concubine, Miss Lydia Smith, hated the Constitution and further overthrew it with his Reconstruction Act of 1866. He also led the impeachment proceedings against the disobedient Freemason President Andrew Johnson. Rome, however, rewarded him for his villainy by baptizing him into the Catholic Church on his deathbed — just like Francis Cardinal Spellman’s obedient Freemason President Lyndon Johnson (who had been initiated into the Johnson City Lodge in Johnson City, Texas, on October 30, 1937). Charles Sumner accomplished in the Senate what Stevens accomplished in the House. And no wonder, for he had been a personal friend of the Holy Alliance’s Prince Metternich and had the highest praise for Rome’s Thomas Aquinas (even as the present Black Supreme Court Justice, Clarence Thomas), the author of the massive Summa Theologica. Since, according to Thomas Aquinas, Pope Gregory VII and Canon Law, “it is no murder to kill a heretic,” Sumner had no problem with the rape, murder and theft committed by Grant and Sherman’s “Grande Armee of the Republic” riddled with foreign-born, bigoted, Irish Roman Catholic banditti.
But Abraham Lincoln did. Even though he acted the tyrant in wrongly declaring martial law as later determined by the Supreme Court, in keeping Maryland from seceding and in raising the Army of the Potomac “to put down the rebellion,” there is evidence that he had had a change of heart. According to many, Lincoln was converted to Christ after viewing the battlefield at Gettysburg in 1863. He later joined the Presbyterian Church in Washington and had several spiritual conversations with his close friend and converted priest, our hero, Charles Chiniquy. We read:
“ ‘I will repeat to you what I said at Urbana, when for the first time you told me your fears lest I would be assassinated by the Jesuits: Man must not care where and when he will die, provided he dies at the post of honour and duty. But I may add, to-day, that I have a presentiment that God will call me to Him through the hand of an assassin. Let His will, and, not mine be done! The Pope and the Jesuits, with their infernal Inquisition, are the only organized powers in the world which have recourse to the dagger of the assassin to murder those whom they cannot convince with their arguments

or conquer with the sword . . . It seems to me that the Lord wants to-day, as He wanted in the days of Moses, another victim . . . I cannot conceal from you that my impression is that I am that victim. So many plots have already been made against my life, that it is a real miracle that they have all failed, when we consider that the great majority of them were in the hands of skillful Roman Catholic murderers, evidently trained by Jesuits. But can we expect that God will make a perpetual miracle to save my life? I believe not. The Jesuits are so expert in those deeds of blood, that Henry IV said that it was impossible to escape them, and he became their victim, though he did all that could be done to protect himself. My escape from their hands, since the letter of the Pope to Jeff Davis [who, as Vice President under President Franklin Pierce in 1856, began the work of erecting a Masonically designed bronze idol of the Virgin Mary, later hoisted upon the White House Dome in 1863] has sharpened a million daggers to pierce my breast, would be more than a miracle.’ ” {3} [Emphasis added]
Chiniquy then concluded his meeting with the President with these words:
“I knew the hour to leave had come, I asked from the President permission to fall on my knees, and pray with him that his life might be spared: and he knelt with me. But I prayed more with my tears and sobs, than with my words. Then I pressed his hand on my lips and bathed it with my tears, and with a heart filled with an unspeakable desolation, I bade him Adieu! It was for the last time! For the hour was fast approaching when he was to fall by the hands of a Jesuit assassin, for his nation’s sake.” {4}[Emphasis added]
Indeed it was! But why? President Lincoln resisted the policy of the Jesuits and the Radicals. For, they sought to create a new government with a new citizenship via the Fourteenth Amendment. Lincoln wanted the Southern States to re-enter the Union with the same status with which they had left the Union. Clearly, he, like Andrew Johnson, would never have promoted the Fourteenth Amendment. (It was this open refusal to promote the Fourteenth Amendment for which Lincoln was assassinated and Johnson was impeached although never expelled from office by the Senate. Being a Southerner, Johnson was openly against the Order’s “anti-Mason” Thaddeus Stevens’ Fourteenth Amendment. But secretly, Johnson served the Company by working with his Masonic brethren who protected Lincoln’s assassin in obedience to their master, Shriner Albert Pike!) This would have frustrated the purposes of the Jesuits in creating a new government with absolute powers.
Further, the Jesuits and the Radicals sought to intermix the Whites and Blacks of both the North and the South. This would make Fourteenth Amendment

Chapter 28 353
America a nation of color, thereby greatly benefiting the Jesuits. For the Jesuits knew that nations of color, Negro or Oriental, can only be governed by absolutists, be they kings, emperors, shoguns, military dictators or tribal chiefs. The history of the governments of South American, African and Far Eastern nations confirms this truth. And if America becomes a nation of color riddled with Bible-rejecting Blacks, mulattoes, Mexicans and Far Easterners, as it apparently will be within fifty years, an absolutist under Jesuit control – like Fidel Castro – most assuredly will govern it.
To the contrary, Lincoln advocated the separation of the races and attempted to repatriate the freed Negroes to Liberia, as Monrovia, named after President James Monroe, had been built for that purpose. The Negro policy of Jefferson, Monroe and Lincoln was the same and it would have thwarted the Jesuits’ plan of amalgamation of both races. It also would have disabled the Jesuits from using the Negro to foment continual agitations resulting in the conferring of more executive power in Washington, ultimately justifying martial law as a result of a contrived race war. Huge, lawless, Black populations would never have grown to such monstrous proportions — financed by the Jesuit New Dealers’ socialist-communist welfare system. Black women would never have been paid to commit bastardies through fornication or adultery; the more illegitimate and lawless children they would bear and raise, the more welfare money they could receive in creating their criminal offspring. The explosion of Black socialism and rampant Black crime would never have taken place, costing the American taxpayers over two trillion dollars during the last fifty years, further destroying the White Middle Class, while fueling the growth of the Pope’s wicked Social Security Numbering System — the forerunner of
“ . . . the number of his name.”
– Revelation 13:17
These hateful, hostile, violent and vulgar Black American populations, who (in the words of Ken Hamlin, a West Coast, Black radio broadcaster known as “the Black Avenger”) ought to get down on their hands and knees and thank God they live in a White nation enjoying blood-bought Protestant liberties, would never have destroyed the country’s industrious inner cities, turning them into vice and war zones, thereby creating the unheard of phenomenon known as “White flight,” as well as justifying national gun confiscation at the mouths of Senators Charles Schumer and Ted Kennedy! (The Black cities of Baltimore and Philadelphia each have over fifty thousand vacant buildings!) Further, there would never have been the birth of amalgamated professional sports glorifying Black athletes, many of which would set the example in marrying White women — the ultimate status symbol in their quest for “equality,” or rather, in repudiating their God-given Blackness, while refusing to perpetuate their race! The whole seething pot of Black racism and iniquity is giving

rise to a massive and murderous, sodomite, homosexual, vicious White supremacist, fascist Roman Catholic, Neo-Nazi movement, ultimately to be used against American Bible-believers and Jews when martial law is declared. This is why Marcus Garvey’s “Back to Africa Movement” was crushed by the tools of the Jesuits in the 1930s. This is why when Black leaders cease to be agitators for the New York Cardinal’s CFR, they lose their influence, like Dick Gregory once did, or are slain, like Malcolm X. Martin Luther (Lucifer) King was also assassinated, as he deviated from his original purpose and began to oppose Spellman’s Vietnam War.
It was clear, Abraham Lincoln, newly reelected in 1865, could not be allowed to stay in office four more years. So the Jesuits, with the help of the Secret Service (as in the Kennedy Assassination), shot him with their tool, a Roman Catholic illegitimate bastard son known as John Wilkes Booth, on April 14, 1865. Lincoln died the following day on April fifteenth. (Years later the Jesuits would make a memorial of that day; for, by April fifteenth all “taxpayers” are required to have made their annual confessions by filing their income tax returns with the Jesuits’ Internal Revenue Service (IRS).) Of the Jesuit hand in Lincoln’s murder we read:
“I feel safe in stating that nowhere else can be found in one book the connected presentation of the story leading up to the death of Abraham Lincoln, which was instigated by the ‘Black’ Pope, the General of the Jesuit Order, camouflaged by the ‘White’ Pope, Pius IXth, aided, abetted and financed by other “Divine Righters” of Europe, and finally consummated by the Roman Hierarchy and their paid agents in this country and French Canada on ‘Good Friday’ night, April 14th, 1865, at Ford’s Theatre, Washington, D.C.” {5} [Emphasis added]
Again we read the words of our hero, Charles Chiniquy:
“But who was that assassin? Booth was nothing but the tool of the Jesuits. It was Rome who directed his arm, after corrupting his heart and damning his soul. After I had mixed my tears with those of the grand country of my adoption, I fell on my knees and asked my God to grant me to show to the world what I knew to be the truth, viz., that the horrible crime was the work of Popery. And, after twenty years of constant and most difficult researches, I come fearlessly to-day before the American people, to say and prove that the President, Abraham Lincoln, was assassinated by the priests and the Jesuits of Rome. . . . Compare the last hours of the Jesuit Ravaillac, the assassin of Henry IV, who absolutely refuses to repent, though suffering also the most horrible tortures on the rack, with Booth, who suffering also the most horrible tortures from his broken leg, writes in his daily memorandum, the very day before his death: I can never repent. . . . Yes! Compare the

Chapter 28
bloody deeds of those two assassins, and you will see that they had been trained in the same school; the same teachers had taught them. Evidently Ravaillac, calling all the saints of heaven to his help, at his last hour; and Booth pressing the Medal of the Virgin Mary on his breast, when falling mortally wounded, are both coming out from the same Jesuit mould . . . the Jesuits alone could select the assassins, train them, and show them a crown of glory in heaven, if they would kill the author of the bloodshed, the famous renegade and apostate – the enemy of the Pope and of the Church — Lincoln.” {6} [Emphasis added]
But the key player in the assassination was a young Roman Catholic and former Secret Service agent for the Southern Confederacy. Having “called time” outside of Ford’s Theatre during the President’s murder, John Surratt escaped from the United States into Montreal, Canada with the aid of the priests. From Montreal to Londonderry, to Liverpool, to Rome, he enlisted in the Pope’s Zouave army. Having been recognized by a boyhood friend, Surratt confessed to the murder stating,
“I have done the Yankees as much harm as I could. We have killed Lincoln, the niggers’ friend.” {7}
As a consequence of this confession, the old acquaintance reported Surratt’s whereabouts to the American Minister in Rome. Having been arrested, he “leapt down a precipice,” made his way to Naples, boarded a steamer and escaped to Alexandria, Egypt. But there, in 1867, he was arrested by U.S. authorities; bound hand and foot; returned to Washington, D.C. via the specially chartered U. S. warship, the Swatara; and was forced to stand trial for the murder of President Lincoln. Chiniquy narrates Surratt’s escape quite clearly:
“It is evident that a very elaborate plan of escape had been prepared by the priests of Rome to save the lives of the assassins and the conspirators. It would be too long to follow all the murderers when, Cain-like, they were fleeing in every direction, to escape the vengeance of God and man. Let us fix our eyes on John Surratt [whose confessor and advisor was the Jesuit B. F. Wiget], who was in Washington the 14th of April, helping Booth in the perpetration of the assassination. Who will take care of him? Who will protect and conceal him? Who will press him on their bosom, put their mantles on his shoulders to conceal him from the just vengeance of the human and divine laws? The priest, Charles Boucher, swears that only a few days after the murder, John Surratt was sent to him by Father Lapierre, of Montreal; that he kept him concealed in his parsonage of St. Liboire from the end of April to the end of July, then he took him back, secretly, to Father Lapierre, who kept him secreted in his own father’s house, under the

Vatican Assassins
very shadow of the Montreal bishop’s palace. He swears that Father Lapierre visited him (Surratt) often, when secreted at St. Liboire, and that he (Father Boucher) visited him, at least, twice a week, from the end of July to September, when concealed in Father Lapierre’s house in Montreal. That same father, Charles Boucher, swears that he accompanied John Surratt in a carriage in the company of Father Lapierre, to the steamer “Montreal”, when starting for Quebec: that Father Lapierre kept him (John Surratt) under lock during the voyage from Montreal to Quebec, and that he accompanied him, disguised, from the Montreal steamer to the ocean steamer, “Peruvian.” The doctor of the steamer “Peruvian”, L. I. A. McMillan, swears that Father Lapierre introduced him to John Surratt under the false name of McCarthy, whom he was keeping locked in his state room, and whom he conducted disguised to the ocean steamer “Peruvian”, and with whom he remained till she left Quebec for Europe, the 15th of September, 1865. But who is that Father Lapierre who takes such a tender, I dare say a paternal care of Surratt? It is not less a personage than the canon of Bishop Bourget, of Montreal. He is the confidential man of the bishop; he lives with the bishop, eats at his table, assists him with his counsel, and has to receive his advice in every step of life. According to the laws of Rome, the canons are to the bishop what the arms are to the body.
Now, I ask: Is it not evident that the bishops and the priests of Washington have trusted this murderer to the care of the bishops and priests of Montreal, that they might conceal, feed, and protect him for nearly six months, under the very shadow of the bishop’s palace? Would they have done that if they were not his accomplices? Why did they so continually remain with him day and night, if they were not in fear that he might compromise them by an indiscreet word? Why do we see those priests (I ought to say, those two ambassadors and anointed representatives of the Pope), alone in the carriage, which takes that great culprit from his house of concealment to the steamer? Why do they keep him there, under lock, till they transfer him, under a disguised name, to the ocean steamer, the “Peruvian”, on the 15th July, 1865? Why such tender sympathies for that stranger? Why going through such trouble and expense for that young American among the bishops and priests of Canada? There is only one answer. He was one of their tools, one of their selected men to strike the great Republic of Equality and Liberty to the heart. For more than six months before the murder, the priests had lodged, eaten, conversed, slept with him under the same roof in Washington. They had trained him to his deed of blood, by

promising him protection, and a crown of glory in heaven [even as Moslem terrorists are promised seventy virgins in “paradise” if they sacrifice their lives for the purposes of “Allah”, having been designated by their Masonic Muftis who are secretly subordinate to the Pope of Rome] if he would only be true to their designs to the end. And he had been true to the end . . . But do you see that man fleeing from Washington towards the north? He has the mark of Cain on his forehead, his hands are reddened with blood, he is pale and trembling, for he knows it; a whole outraged nation is after him for her just vengeance; he hears the thundering voice of God: “Where is thy brother?” Where will he find a refuge? Where, outside of hell, will he meet friends to shelter and save him from the just vengeance of God and men? Oh! He has sure refuge in the arms of that church who, for more than a thousand years, is crying “Death to all the heretics! Death to all the soldiers of Liberty!” He has devoted friends among the very men who, after having prepared the massacre of Admiral Coligny, and his 75,000 Protestant countrymen, rang the bells of Rome to express their joy when they heard that, at last, the King of France had slaughtered them all. But where will those bishops and priests of Canada send John Surratt when they find it impossible to conceal him any longer from the thousands of detectives of the United States, who are ransacking Canada to find out his retreat? Who will conceal, feed, lodge, and protect him after the priests of Canada pressed his hand for the last time on board of the “Peruvian”, the 15th of September, 1865?
Who can have any doubt about that? Who can suppose that any one but the Pope himself and his Jesuits will protect the murderer of Abraham Lincoln in Europe? If you want to see him after he has crossed the ocean, go to Vitry, at the door of Rome, and there you will find him enrolled under the banners of the Pope, in the 9th company of his Zouaves, under the false name of Watson. Of course, the Pope was forced to withdraw his protection over him, after the Government of the United States had found him there, and he was brought back to Washington to be tried. But on his arrival as a prisoner in the United States, his Jesuit father confessor whispered in his ear: ‘Fear not, you will not be condemned! Through the influence of a high Roman Catholic lady, two or three of the jurymen will be Roman Catholics, and you will be safe.’ Those who have read the two volumes of the trial of John Surratt know that never more evident proofs of guilt were brought against a murderer than in that case. But the Roman Catholic jurymen had read the theology of St. Thomas, a book which the Pope has ordered to be taught in every college, academy, and university of

Rome; they had learned that it is the duty of the Roman Catholics to exterminate all the heretics [Summa Theologica, Thomas Aquinas, II-II, Q. 11, A. 3, 4]. They had read the decree of the Council of Constance, that no faith was to be kept with heretics. They had read in the Council of Lateran that the Catholics who arm themselves for the extermination of heretics, have all their sins forgiven, and receive the same blessings as those who go and fight for the rescue of the Holy Land. Those jurymen were told by their father confessors that the most Holy Father, the Pope, Gregory VII, had solemnly and infallibly declared that ‘the killing of an heretic was no murder.’ — [De] Jure Canonico. After such teachings, how could the Roman Catholic jurymen find John Surratt guilty of murder for killing the heretic Lincoln? The jury having disagreed, no verdict could be given. The Government was forced to let the murderer go unpunished.” {8} [Emphasis added]
(Dear truth-seeker, eighty years later Rome’s elaborate system of escape would be used again. On a grand scale it would enable thousands of top Nazis and war criminals to evade capture from Allied authorities. Many would be secreted into the old Jesuit dominion of South America and enjoy the protection of a powerful Knight of Malta and absolute dictator, Argentina’s Juan Peron. Others would be protected by Francisco Franco, the Roman Catholic Freemason and dictator of Spain whose successor would be another Knight of Malta, Jesuit-trained King Juan Carlos of the old Bourbon Dynasty presently negotiating with Israel’s Zionist leaders pursuant to his title as “King and Protector of Jerusalem” which includes the Temple Mount. The cream of the Nazi crop – the SS – would be brought into the Empire of Fourteenth Amendment America to enjoy the protection of Cardinal Spellman’s CIA and FBI, overseen by his American Branch of the Knights of Malta.)
Upon Surratt’s return to Washington, D.C., designed to be the Order’s “Rome on the Potomac” and military headquarters for the Pope’s new “Holy Roman” American Empire, we read of the Jesuit presence during the trial:
“The appeals made by the eminent counsel for the prisoner to the political and religious prejudices of jurors was ably seconded all through the trial by the Jesuit priesthood of Washington City and the vicinity. It will be recalled by scores of people who attended the trial that not a day passed but that some of these [Jesuits] were in the courtroom as the most interested of spectators.” {9}
This ever-present Jesuit influence gave John Surratt (a member of the Order’s Knights of the Golden Circle, the present day Knights of Columbus characterized by the same Mary-worshipping oath of allegiance) the confidence of his ultimate acquittal, that he, like Jesuit-trained Bill Clinton, was untouchable. We read:

“Surratt did not overestimate the protection of his church, for from the moment he had landed in this country, he was greeted and sustained by the priests of that church. When his trial began in Washington June 10th, 1867, the presence of Roman priests and the students from the Jesuit University at Georgetown and the Sulpician Monastery [being a branch of the Jesuit Order] where he had studied three years for the priesthood, were the most noticeable features of the sessions. Although he declared himself a bankrupt, he was furnished the services of the best lawyers. When it became necessary to furnish bail for his final release, it was immediately presented by an Irish woman he did not even know, to the amount of thirty thousand dollars. According to press reports this stood there until his death in 1916. That is some friendship, is it not?” {10}
Dear truth-seeker, the Jesuit Order gets away with murder today just as it did in 1867. One hundred years later CIA agent Clay L. Shaw would be tried for the murder of John F. Kennedy. Shaw, like Surratt, was Roman Catholic. He also would enjoy the protection of the Jesuit Order’s powerful tools in Washington. Shaw, like Surratt, enjoyed the benefit of a hung jury and he, like Lincoln’s murderer, would go free. Thirty years later, President Bill Clinton would be impeached. This Georgetown graduate and darling of the Jesuits would refuse to resign. He would be tried in the Senate knowing full well his protection from the Society of Jesus in control of the CFR, FBI, CIA, the Secret Service and the Mafia. The author predicted that he, like Shaw and Surratt, would never be convicted of his crimes. As it turned out, one of the Senators who voted to acquit Clinton was none other than “Spelly’s evil Jew” of the Kennedy Assassination. Senator Arlen Specter, a Scottish Rite Shriner Freemason of the 33rd Degree according to a most informative and vast website, www.freemasonwatch.freepress-freespeech.com, had been the Junior Counselor on the Warren Commission who concocted the magic single-bullet theory upon which the Warren Report rested its case. These are irrefutable examples of the power – the absolute power in Fourteenth Amendment America – exercised by the Jesuits through the Archbishop of New York, presently Edward Cardinal Egan.
Lastly, certain high-level Freemasons were used to stifle the capture of John H. Surratt. They were President Andrew Johnson, whose son was educated by Jesuits, and whose daughter was educated by nuns and converted to Catholicism, and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, who oversaw the project of placing a statue of Rome’s “Virgin Mary” (Persephone) atop of the Capital Dome. With the knowledge that Surratt was in Liverpool, Stanton’s War Department refused to make the least attempt to arrest him. A few weeks later President Johnson revoked the reward for the arrest of Surratt, greatly increasing the assassin’s chances to escape. A similar story is true of Booth, the brother Freemason of President Johnson. According to The Escape and Suicide of John Wilkes Booth by Finis L. Bates, Booth escaped

Washington with a password — a Masonic password. He settled in Kansas and died there, having confessed to Lincoln’s murder in the presence of his presiding doctor. A confessed conspirator, General Lafayette C. Baker, who was later poisoned with arsenic in 1868, fingered Freemason and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton who had hidden the key to Booth’s “tomb” barring any examination of the body. But if “Booth’s body” was identified, having been shot by Boston Corbett, while the real Booth escaped, who then identified the body? It was a thirty-third degree Freemason, Admiral George W. Baird, USN retired, having been introduced to Booth by Naval Officer Fitch, the brother-in-law to Jesuit Thomas E. Sherman! In 1921 he wrote:
“I was called on board the Montauk [a Navy Gunboat] by Lieut. W.W. Crowninshield, to identify the body of John Wilkes Booth, which I did . . . Surgeon General Barnes arrived at that moment and probed the wound in Booth’s neck. [The probing of the neck wound sounds like the Kennedy autopsy, does it not?]” {11}
It is also incriminating to note that Roman Catholic R. W. Thompson, who was a thirty-third degree Freemason and a contemporary of his Masonic brother, Admiral Baird, wrote The Footprints of the Jesuits extensively quoted in this volume and included on the enclosed CD. Thompson was the ex-Secretary of the Navy in 1894 when he published his historical masterpiece. Baird, as an Admiral, had been Thompson’s subordinate prior to 1894. Nowhere in Thompson’s five hundred-page volume does he implicate the Jesuits in Lincoln’s assassination. He doesn’t even mention Lincoln’s assassination even though that murder was fresh on the minds of millions of Americans; the Freemasons Edwin A. Sherman and Charles Chiniquy had exposed the Jesuit hand in 1883 and 1886. And why does Thompson silently pass by the Lincoln assassination? Because if the Jesuits were to be blamed, that guilt would also surely lead to the door of Shriner Freemasonry. As a result, the Jesuits would have been expelled from the United States and thousands of patriotic Americans would have abandoned the Masonic Lodge in horror and disgust. But as in the Kennedy Assassination so the Sons of Loyola went unpunished for assassinating Lincoln, maintaining a successful cover-up through the years with their prostitute Press, manned by the Order’s Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
“Barring the martyrdoms of Jesus Christ and Joan D ‘Arc [Joan of Arc], the methods used in Abraham Lincoln’s assassination will stand pre-eminent in point of malice and cruelty, and, strange as it may seem, the same diabolical cunning which nerved the hand of the assassin has pursued Lincoln beyond the grave, and has been largely successful in hiding from the public all details of his physical destruction, a crime, in the eye of the writer, which almost outstrips the first, for by this conspiracy of silence on his death, the youth of America are being deprived of the knowledge of the details of the greatest tragedy in their country’s history.” {12}

Chapter 28 361
Years later in 1916, the Jesuits honored John H. Surratt, Lincoln’s real assassin, with a special funeral. Emmet McLoughlin, one of our heroes, tells us:
“A student at Georgetown University, writing a biased whitewash of the role of the Church in the entire Surratt case, described the funeral as being . . . ‘A Solemn High Requiem Mass’ . . . It was indeed a fitting end, a final and significant touch. For as every priest and many observant laymen know, a Solemn High Requiem Mass, with three priests officiating (that is what the word means) is usually reserved for the funerals of bishops, priests, or nuns . . . When it is chanted at the funeral services of a layman, it is a token of recognition and appreciation for exceptional devotion or distinguished service to the Church. It was done for John Harrison Surratt. It must have been deserved.” {13} [Emphasis added]
Both Brotherhoods, the Jesuits and the Shriner Freemasons, worked together as they had in the past and as they would in the future. They carried out the French Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, the Second French Revolution of 1848, the Crimean War, the American War Between the States, the Assassination of Lincoln and Cover-up, and would carry out the Second Thirty Years’ War (1914-1945), the Cold War (1945-1989) and the Assassination of Kennedy and Cover-up (1963). The Jesuits are now ready to use their Fourteenth Amendment American Empire, commanded by Shriner Freemasons and Knights of Malta, for their greatest feat yet. With the Executive Orders in place and a coming predetermined national crisis, the Constitution will be suspended and martial law declared by a military dictator. Possibly, the Jesuits will use this fascist dictator to further the Pope’s American-led Crusade against the Islamic world, somehow resulting in the destruction of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. America, “the Great Satan” in the eyes of the Moslems, will be blamed for the destruction of one of Islam’s most holy places, third only to Mecca, further inciting the nation’s hostile, Black Muslims to murder “Christians” and Jews in accordance with the teachings of the Koran. This anarchy will further justify fascist, mass executions. Then the Pope’s dream will begin to unfold — the rebuilding of Solomon’s Temple (presently being designed by a Toronto Shriner, Jack Diamond) and the ultimate destruction of the American Empire with its “heretic Protestants, pagans and Jews” pursuant to Peter Dens’ Theologia and the wicked Council of Trent! Dear truth-seeker, the next time you visit the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., in gazing into that sublime face, remember the President’s words as you do your duty in resisting the Devil’s Jesuits:
“I know that Jesuits never forget nor forsake. But man must not care how and where he dies, provided he dies at the post of honour
and duty.” {14} [Emphasis added]

Pope Pius IX #97 The “Vicar of Christ” and “King of the World,” 1846 - 1878 To whom every King, President and Dictator owed his Allegiance and with the Jesuits as his penholders, this tyrant put forth the doctrine of “The Immaculate Conception” in 1854, decreeing that Mary was born without the stain of original sin otherwise inherent in every descendant of Adam except the Lord Jesus Christ. This heresy further exalts “the Virgin Mary” to the place of becoming “the Mother of God” and “Queen of Heaven” of the ancient, pagan trinity. Pius IX, having advocated the reuse of the guillotine to fight Protestantism (1855), also condemned modern civilization, including freedom of conscience and freedom of speech, with his Syllabus of Errors (1864). He then called for the First Vatican Council at which the Pope was decreed to be “infallible” becoming God Almighty on earth. His real crime, however, was giving his American Roman hierarchy the order to assassinate President Abraham Lincoln who became a “usurper” and a “tyrant” for refusing to consent to the Order’s Radical Red Republican sponsored Fourteenth Amendment – Rome’s coup d’etat – in converting our Calvinist Republic into a Jesuit “Holy Roman” Empire.

“As I have observed, the Jesuits are a formidable engine of war, devised in the heat of the struggle of the sixteenth century, and used as a desperate resource, full of danger to those who employ it . . . ” {4}
M. J. Michelet, 1843 French University Professor Jesuits and Jesuitism
“From Gaeta he [Pope Pius IX] poured forth his curses on his subjects. And while he was giving these manifestations of his paternal heart, the Jesuits and Cardinal [Giacomo] Antonelli were laying the plan of that infernal compact between the Court of Rome and almost all the despots of Europe, for crushing and annihilating all seeds of civil and religious liberty, and for murdering, with merciless ferocity, all those who shouted for reform [in Italy], in the name and under the auspices of Pius IX.; a just retribution, it should seem, for having trusted in a priest, and thought him capable of being an honest and liberal man. Monsignor de Falloux, a Jesuit, brother of the then all-powerful minister of Louis Napoleon, was notoriously the soul of the negotiation, and it was he who decided for the court of Rome to accept the succour of the French. [Knight of Malta Alexander M. Haig, Jr., the former head of NATO forces in Europe, a key player in President Nixon’s Watergate Scandal, and the Secretary of State under President Reagan — is not his brother, Francis R. Haig, a Jesuit also?] ” {5} [Emphasis added]
G. B. Nicolini of Rome, 1854 Protestant Italian Patriot Exiled to England History of the Jesuits
From 1815 to that fateful year of 1871, the Jesuits, with their Holy Alliance of despots had suppressed every attempt in Europe to create a popular government with limited powers. The Roman Catholic peoples of Spain and Italy were crushed. France’s “Citizen-King” Louis Philippe, having expelled the Company in 1831, was driven into exile and the Jesuits created a French Empire for themselves with Napoleon III. The great Protestant Republic of America had been destroyed with a horrible war and on its ruins the Jesuits had created their “Holy Roman” American Empire. But the risen Son of God raised up a great Protestant leader whose country would be used to destroy the Jesuits’ political power in France, Italy and Germany. He was “the Iron Chancellor,” ironically, the Masonic Prince Otto von Bismarck.

With the Jesuits creating the French Empire in 1852 bringing Napoleon III to power, they now could wage wars for their purposes. Although officially prohibited, the Society of Jesus was the master of France for nineteen years until 1871.
And what did the Jesuits do during that time? They waged war! The first was the Crimean War of 1856. The Vatican’s Jesuits fought against the Orthodox Church. On the side of the Vatican were France, England and Turkey. On the side of the Orthodox Church was Russia. And why was that war waged? It was fought over which “Church” would “protect” the “holy places” in Palestine! One hundred thousand French soldiers were called “martyrs of the faith” by the priests, as that war was a Crusade. The Archbishop of Paris made the following incriminating admission on behalf of the Jesuits and their forever-warring Roman Papacy:
“The Crimean War, between France and Russia, is not a political war, but a holy war; it is not a State fighting another State, people fighting other people, but singularly a war of religion, a Crusade . . . ” {6}[Emphasis added]
(Years later the Jesuits, with their “Holy Roman” American Empire, would launch a massive Crusade in Europe, President Eisenhower later promoting his Jesuit-authored book of that title. Subsequently, the Order would conduct another Crusade in the Far East. Archbishop Spellman of New York would call the American soldiers “the soldiers of Christ;” that Crusade would be the infamous Vietnam War.)
By the 1860s the Jesuits began to experience some serious setbacks particularly at the hand of Protestant Germany. In 1866 the Germans trounced Austria, the heart of the Holy Alliance, with the Prussian and Austrian War. This infuriated the Jesuits! So four years later, the Jesuits used Napoleon III to start a war with Germany. France was shamefully beaten, further enraging the Jesuits! Of the Jesuit influence causing the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 we read:
“While the French army was spilling its blood in the four corners of the world, and getting weaker defending interests which were not hers, Prussia, under the heavy hand of the future ‘iron chancellor’, was busy expanding its military might in order to unite the German states in a single block. Austria was the first victim of its will and power. In agreement with Prussia which was to seize the Danish duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, Austria was cheated by her accomplice. The war which followed, was soon won by Prussia at Sadowa on the 3rd of July, 1866. It was a terrible blow for the ancient Hapsburg monarchy that was declining; the blow was just as hard for the Vatican, as Austria had been for so long its most faithful stronghold within the Germanic lands. From now on, Protestant Prussia will exercise her hegemony

over them. Unless . . . the Roman Church finds a ‘secular arm’ capable of stopping completely the expansion of the ‘heretic’ power. But who can play this part in Europe apart from the French Empire? Napoleon III, ‘the man sent by Providence’, will have the honor of avenging Sadowa . . .
France herself declared war: this war of 1870 was proved by history to be
the work of the Jesuits.” {7} [Emphasis added]
Again we read the Jesuits are guilty of:
“ . . . their complicity in the plots against the life of Queen Elizabeth...their responsibility for kindling the Thirty Years’ War . . . their decisive influence in causing the revocation of the Edict of Nantes . . . and their accountability for precipitating the Franco-German War of 1870.” {8} [Emphasis added]
(Dear truth-seeker, the Jesuit hand in causing the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 must be obvious to you if the catastrophe called “the Twentieth Century” is to be understood. For if the Jesuits caused the War of 1870, they surely caused World War I. And if their armies were victorious in World War I, they controlled the plunder of Germany called “the Treaty of Versailles.” And if they were behind that most infamous treaty, they caused World War II. And if their Allied Armies were victorious in World War II, they controlled the agreements at Yalta, Potsdam, Cairo and Tehran. And if they controlled those conferences, they authored the Cold War the Jesuits’ Communist Inquisition behind the “Iron and Bamboo Curtains.” International socialist-communism was then aided and abetted by the Jesuits’ financial and military colossus, the American Empire, as the Jesuit-controlled John Birch Society – named after a Baptist martyr in China!! – has so ably proven. And if the Jesuits began the Cold War in 1945, they, with the stroke of a pen in the hands of George H. W. Bush (CIA) and Mikhail Gorbachev (KGB), ended it at Malta in 1989, only to continue to “make relentless war on all heretics and liberals.”
Therefore, since the Jesuits have supposedly ended the Cold War, are they ready to strike their next great blow upon the American Empire? That blow will tend to further consolidate Europe into a revived “Holy Roman Empire.” What national crisis will result in the rise of an absolutist, right wing military dictatorship? Would that military dictatorship attempt the annihilation of the American Jewish “heretics” ultimately resulting in a massive Sino-Soviet-Moslem-Mexican-Cuban invasion and occupation, thereby destroying American Protestant and Baptist “heretics”? This is the same agenda the Jesuits used to destroy the Protestant German Empire (its unification having been financed by a Jew, Bleichroder) and the Jews of Europe during World Wars I and II. Whatever the attack may be, it will surely be pursuant to

the Council of Trent! And if President Kennedy had prematurely ended the Cold War and destroyed the CIA, the long range agenda of the Devil ruling the world through his risen Papal Caesar from Jerusalem, would never have been fulfilled within his time frame established through his Jesuit General and High Command.)
As a result of German victories during the war of 1870, Napoleon III had to withdraw his French troops from Rome. They had protected the Temporal Power of the Pope since 1849. When the French withdrew, the Italians took Rome, creating the sovereign Kingdom of Italy. The loss of the Pope’s Temporal Power further enraged the Jesuits as they blamed Germany’s Kaiser Wilhelm I and Prince Bismarck. Both Italy and Germany would pay dearly for this, as the Protestant Kaiser, upon resigning, would be driven into exile (thanks to Grand Orient German Freemasonry) in preparing for World War II — the apex of the “extirpation of heretics and liberals” during the Jesuit General’s Second Thirty Years’ War.
When the jubilant Italians liberated Rome, Victor Emmanuel II became the King of Italy. Pius IX fled Rome and declared himself a prisoner in the castle of St. Angelo. He then excommunicated Victor Emmanuel II with the following words:
“By the Authority of Almighty God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and of the Holy Canons, and of the undefiled Virgin Mary, mother and nurse of our Saviour; and of the celestial virtues, angels, archangels, thrones, dominions, powers, cherubims, and seraphims; and of all the holy patriarchs and prophets; and of the apostles and evangelists; and of the holy innocents, who, in the sight of the Holy Lamb, are found worthy to sing the new song; and of the holy martyrs and holy confessors, and of the holy virgins, and of the saints, together with all the holy and elect of God: we excommunicate and anathematize him, and from the threshold of the holy church of God Almighty we sequester him, that he may be tormented in eternal excruciating sufferings, together with Dathan and Abiram, and those who say to the Lord God, ‘Depart from us; we desire none of thy ways.’ And as fire is quenched by water, so let the light of him be put out forever more. May the Son who suffered for us, curse him. May the Father who created man, curse him. May the Holy Ghost which was given to us in our baptism, curse him. May the Holy Cross which Christ, for our salvation, triumphing over his enemies, ascended, curse him. May the Holy and eternal Virgin Mary, mother of God, curse him. May St. Michael the advocate of holy souls, curse him. May all the angels and archangels, principalities and powers, and all the heavenly armies, curse him. May St. John the precursor, and St. Peter, and St. Paul, and St. John the Baptist, and St. Andrew, and all other Christ’s apostles,

together curse him, and may the rest of his disciples and four Evangelists, who by their preaching converted the universal world, and may the holy and wonderful company of martyrs and confessors, who by their holy work are found pleasing to God Almighty, — curse him. May the Choir of the Holy Virgins, who for the honor of Christ have despised the things of this world, damn him. May all the saints who from the beginning of the world, and everlasting ages are found to be beloved of God, damn him. May the heavens and the earth, and all things remaining therein, damn him. May he be damned wherever he may be; whether in the house or in the field, whether in the highway or in the byway, whether in the wood or water, or whether in the church. May he be cursed in living and dying, in eating and drinking, in fasting and thirsting, in slumbering and sleeping, in watching or walking, in standing or sitting, in lying down or walking mingendo cancando, and in all blood-letting. May he be cursed in all the faculties of his body. May he be cursed inwardly and outwardly. May he be cursed in his hair. May he be cursed in his brain. May he be cursed in the crown of his head and in his temples. In his forehead and in his ears. In his eyebrows and in his cheeks. In his jaw-bones and his nostrils. In his foreteeth and in his grinders. In his lips and in his throat. In his shoulders and in his wrists. In his arms, his hands, and in his fingers. May he be damned in his mouth, in his breast, in his heart, and in all the viscera of his body. May he be damned in his veins and in his groin; in his thighs; in his hips and in his knees; in his legs, feet, and toe-nails.
May he be cursed in all the joints and articulations of his body. From the top of his head to the sole of his foot may there be no soundness in him. May the Son of the living God, with all the glory of His Majesty, curse him; and may heaven, with all the powers that move therein, rise
up against him — curse him and damn him! Amen. So let it be! Amen.”

(Dear truth-seeker, why did not Pope Pius XII excommunicate Adolf Hitler as Papal Caesar Pius IX excommunicated Victor Emmanuel? Simple. Hitler upheld the Pope’s evil Temporal Power, but Emmanuel destroyed it. Further, like Surratt, Hitler was given the honor of “A Solemn High Requiem Mass” upon his “death.”)
Pius IX in 1864 had condemned “progress, liberalism (popular government) and civilization” with his Syllabus of Errors. Since “the penholders of the Pope are Jesuits” those demon-possessed “sons of Satan” wrote the Syllabus. The eighty “errors of civilization” were made part of the teaching of the First Vatican Council of 1870, known as “Vatican I.” Some of those “errors” were and are as follows:
The Jesuits – 1856 - 1871

“Reprobated, forbidden, and condemned is the proposition (No. 15 of the Syllabus): ‘Every man, guided by the light of reason, is free to adopt and to recognize whatever religion he considers to be the true one.’
Reprobated, forbidden and condemned is the proposition (No. 16 of the Syllabus): ‘By the exercise of any religion whatsoever men may find the way to eternal salvation and attain eternal happiness.’
Reprobated, forbidden and condemned is the proposition (No. 18 of the Syllabus): ‘Protestantism is nothing more than another form of the same true Christian religion, and one may be in it as acceptable to God as in the Catholic Church.’
Reprobated, forbidden and condemned is the proposition (No. 55 of the Syllabus): ‘The Church shall be separate from the State, and the State from the Church.’
Finally there is still the proposition (No. 80 of the Syllabus): ‘The Pope of Rome must conform and accommodate himself to progress, to liberalism, and to modern civilization,’ which is reprobated, forbidden and condemned, and therewith is a crown put upon the whole Syllabus.” {10} [Emphasis added]
By 1878, at the time of Pius IX’s death, the freedom loving, liberal Roman Catholic Italians so hated the Pope – this tyrannical puppet of the Black Pope – that they sought to throw the Pontiff’s body into the Tiber the night his remains were being transported to San Lorenzo Fuori le Mura.
Dear truth-seeker, as you can see, the “errors” that the Pope with his Jesuits condemn are freedom of conscience, freedom of worship, Protestantism, salvation outside the Catholic Church, separation of the Catholic Church from the government of any State, limited government and the Modern Era beginning in 1648. The Syllabus is nothing more than a modern restatement of the Jesuits’ wicked and evil Council of Trent. During that Vatican Council of 1870 the Syllabus was not only incorporated into its teachings, but the Papal Caesar was declared to be “infallible” — and no wonder; for, one day when he is risen from the dead, he will sit in Solomon’s rebuilt Temple in Jerusalem,
“...so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.”

Bismarck defeated the Jesuits’ Napoleon III in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, enabled the Italian patriots to take the Temporal Power from the Pope in 1870, and conducted his “Struggle with Rome,” openly arresting certain priests in the pulpit while preaching their high treason against Wilhelm I, Germany’s Lutheran Kaiser, and the Protestant Second Reich. While rightly refusing to persecute the Semitic Hebrew/Jewish Race in the midst of those adhering to Judaism, his greatest accomplishment was in leading the German Parliament to banish the Jesuit Order from all of the Empire in 1872, France following suit eight years later. But the “heretic and liberal” Germans would pay dearly for this, as the Order would use Protestant America and England with France and Russia to encircle, attack and destroy the Second Empire, with all of German Lutheran Protestantism, during the Black Pope’s Second Thirty Years War, from 1914 to 1945.

Baron DePonnat, 1940 French Statesman
The Jesuits were furious! The Second German Empire or “Reich” had just been established. Its Protestant armies had smashed the Roman Catholic Empire of Austria-Hungary in 1866 along with the Roman Catholic French Empire in 1871. Catholic Hapsburg and Bonaparte, both abject tools of the Jesuit General’s Holy Alliance, were greatly humbled. As a result, the Jesuits attempted to assassinate Protestant Prince Bismarck, once in 1866 and again in 1874. The Jesuits were all the more enraged as the necessity of withdrawing the French soldiers from Rome enabled Victor Emmanuel II to take the Temporal Power from the Pope. But the final straw was the official banishment of the Jesuit Order from Prussia. The Jesuits using the Ultramontane political party (which later culminated in Nazism) sought to control the Empire. So on the 4th of July (Oh glorious day!), 1872, the German Parliament expelled them with the following words:

“The Order of Jesus and the societies allied to it, as well as congregations similar thereto, are excluded from the territories of the German Empire. The establishment of settlements of the same is interdicted. The settlements at the present time existing are to be dissolved within a period to be fixed by Diet, which shall not exceed six months.” {3}
And what was the German response?
“Thus the whole of the thinking world, among Catholics as well as among Protestants, repeated the words ‘God be praised that they have gone’; and abroad it was thought that we Germans were indeed fortunate in having such a Government.” {4} [Emphasis added]
“This act remained in force after the end of Kulturkampf [Bismarck’s struggle with Rome], and it was not definitely repealed until 1917 [after the beginning of the Jesuits’ Second Thirty Years’ War and the destruction of the Protestant German Empire].” {5} [Emphasis added]
But the German Parliament or “Reichstag” (destroyed in 1933 by Roehm’s homosexual arson squad) would never have expelled the Jesuits had it not been for the condemnation of the Order by the German Protestant Assembly. Written in 1871 from Darmstadt and agreed with by many German Roman Catholics, we read:
“II. As regards the Jesuit Order. In consideration

(3) that the Society, since its re-establishment by Pius VII (Bull of 7th August 1814), as before its abolition by Pope Clement XIV (Brief [Bull] of 21st July 1773), worked with the sole object of renewing and accentuating the medieval supremacy of the Roman Hierarchy over the human mind, and setting up again the supreme power of the Pope of Rome over princes and peoples;

(6) that it destroys the education of youth by priestly training, by mortification of the love of truth, by the annihilation of conscientious spontaneity, by slavish submission to the authority of the hierarchy, and thereby deeply injures the development of the formation of the character and mind of the nation and of individuals;
(7) that it promotes superstition and the weakness of men for the increase of riches, and wickedly contributes to the extension of its dominion;
(8) that the freedom of union and of religious associations are only rightly constituted in so far as they conform to the ordinances of the State and of law, and are subordinate to the same: – in consideration of all these things, the German Protestant Union expresses its conviction that the security of legal order, and the authority of the laws and the power of the State, the well-being of civil society, the preservation of confessional peace, and the protection of spiritual freedom and spiritual culture, demand the State prohibition of the Jesuit Order in Germany. The Union also looks upon it as an earnest duty of the German Protestants, and of the whole German nation, to act in regard thereto with energy, that all interference in school and church matters, should be put a stop to as regards to those belonging and affiliated to the Jesuit Order.” {6} [Emphasis added]

priests at St. Joseph’s School for Boys; Knights of Malta Lawrence Welk and Danny Thomas were renowned entertainers; fascist Knight of Malta Frank Capra was a successful Hollywood film director; and fascist Knight of Malta Joseph P. Kennedy was a Hollywood movie mogul! Dear truth-seeker, is it any wonder why the priests of Rome are usually presented in a good light, like the priest in The Bells of St. Mary’s, or like the priest in The Old Man and the Sea, or like the Jesuit who saves the Protestant English sea captain from being burnt alive in Shogun, or like the nuns who save the von Trapps from the Nazis in The Sound Of Music (starring Roman Catholic Julie Andrews), or like the benevolent nuns towards the wayward Sidney Poitier (another Black, race-mixing, communist, civil rights agitator) in The Lilies of the Field, or like the priest reciting scripture in the language of the people (Oh, what hypocrisy!) while comforting Roman Catholics as the ship is sinking (due to Jesuit intrigue) in Titanic, or like the repentant homosexual ex-priest in JFK, or like the priest breaking the law of the king by secretly marrying William Wallace in Braveheart, or like the righteous priest killing the evil Bishop in Robin Hood? Are not Hollywood’s leading actors predominantly Roman Catholics portraying a pro-Pope history rewritten by Jesuit-controlled screenwriters? Is it any wonder why White Protestants or Bible-believers are portrayed as being heartless liars and criminal murderers like the English missionary in Hawaii, or Lieutenant Kendrick in A Few Good Men, or the scripture-quoting sea captain as he fornicates with one of the captive Black women on his slave ship in Roots, just to name a few? Apparently, we criminal Bible-believers are the plague of the world and should be exterminated, being the “obstinate heretics” that we are!) Does it matter that your children or grandchildren will be the unhappy slaves of a merciless, absolutist, fascist American dictator guided by the Jesuits of Fordham and Georgetown Universities? In the name of Christ Jesus, sound the alarm, blow the shofar, lift up your voices and cry out,
“Beware of the Sons of Loyola! Expel them from our nation before they torture and exterminate us all in the name of ‘Peace’ and ‘National Security’ just like they did to the Protestants and Jews of fascist Nazi Germany at the hand of their White Roman Catholic ‘Grand Inquisitor’, during the bloody Second Thirty Years’ War (1914-1945) under the second Emperor Ferdinand II, Adolf Hitler!!!”)
The Jesuits were temporarily gone. Little did the German people know that they would pay dearly for this! The Jesuits would cause Prince Bismarck to weaken, as he must have feared for his life after the second assassination attempt in 1874. He reversed his policy called “the struggle with Rome” and repealed his own Falk Laws having rightly acted upon the Catholics in Prussia. He then entered into an alliance with the Jesuit-trained Pope Leo XIII creating “The Center Party” in 1877 — the very year the great Tzar Alexander II broke diplomatic relations with Rome. This alliance with the Papacy opened the door for Papal supremacy in German politics.

A few years after the death of Bismarck, during the reign of pro-Pope Kaiser Wilhelm II, the Jesuits lawfully re-entered the Empire in 1917. In time, the Order successfully used their “Center Party”, led by its Jesuit priest in the Reichstag, Ludwig Kaas, who later became the Pope’s Finance Minister, and Knight of Malta Franz von Papen – the personal advisor to Pope Pius XII – to bring Roman Catholic Nazi Hitler to power creating that homosexual-led hammer of the Devil, the Black Pope’s Third Reich. The Jesuits would then ignite another Thirty Years’ War from 1914 to 1945. The Protestant German Empire would be destroyed and the Protestant Lutheran Kaiser, Wilhelm II, would be driven into exile after World War I. The Jesuits would raise up the sodomite Nazi party from their old Catholic stronghold of Bavaria and erect the Third Empire or “Third Reich” on the ruins of the Weimar Republic. The Jesuits would bring Hitler to power and their formal suppression would be avenged by the burning of the German Parliament known as “the Reichstag fire.” The Jesuits’ SS would persecute the Jews from Spain to Russia, from Italy to Denmark and thereby bring the curses of the world upon the manipulated and disgraced German people to this day. During World War II, Germany would be firebombed by the Jesuit-controlled British and American Air Forces, destroying Protestant populations and non-military targets like Protestant Dresden and the town of the Protestant Union of 1871, Darmstadt. Hitler would be used to betray, defeat, and destroy the German army in Russia, under the command of Protestant Prussian Generals, just like Napoleon! And from a bunker in Berlin every decision the Fuhrer made would further destroy the Lutheran East German people, like the flooding of the underground sewers where thousands sought refuge from Allied bombing.
After the war, the Jesuits would take further vengeance. Germany, as was done to Protestant Virginia during the War Between the States, would be divided — the East being mostly Protestant and the West being mostly Roman Catholic. The surviving Protestants of the East, gang raped and plundered by the brutal, atheistic, Soviet Red Army, would be placed under the Jesuit-trained Grand Inquisitor, Joseph Stalin, and shipped off to the Black Pope’s Siberian concentration camps. Catholic West Germany, occupied by the more benevolent Americans, would be brought under the military protection and financial backing of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) headed by the Jesuits’ Council on Foreign Relations in control of the American Empire. But Protestant East Germany, under the oppression of the Jesuits’ Russian Empire (called the “USSR”), would be kept poverty stricken and undeveloped until the end of the Cold War with the fall of the Berlin Wall. All this was done with the help of those bloody American Shriner Freemasons, Presidents Roosevelt and “Dirty” Harry Truman. They both were members of the Jesuits’ Council on Foreign Relations controlled by Archbishop Spellman and his Knights of Malta, Joseph P. Kennedy, J. Peter Grace, Myron C. Taylor and Henry R. Luce. The origin of all this horror and tragedy was the expulsion of the Jesuits from the German Empire by a united German people, Protestant and Catholic alike.

With the defeat of Napoleon III and the end of the French Empire under the command of the Jesuits, France’s Third Republic was born in 1877. With Deputy Leon Gambetta – a Freemason who righteously warned that universal suffrage (having been conferred upon all “Fourteenth Amendment U.S. citizens” in 1870 via the Fifteenth Amendment) would put any nation “under the yoke of the clergy” – it expelled the Jesuits from France. We read:
“In the spring of 1880 . . . A decree was brought forth by the Ministry dissolving, first of all, the Society of Jesus within the borders of France, and closing within three months from the date of the act, all Jesuitical establishments in the Republic. The declaration of Gambetta, ‘Our enemy is clericism,’ was accepted by the Republicans as a truism which they must regard and act upon under the common-law of self-defense.” {7}
The Jesuits would have their vengeance even as with Coligny, Henry IV, Louis XVI, Louis Philippe, Eugene Sue and now upon the greatest orator and most fearless leader of modern France. Two years later, on the last day of 1882, Prime Minister Leon Gambetta was shot. The Jesuits nerved the hand of his mistress-assassin as Gambetta, during his last hours, suffered terribly from blood poisoning. Pursuant to the Jesuit-authored The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, the Order kills its own Freemasons if necessary as it did with both Napoleon Bonaparte I and Leon Gambetta. Within Protocol No. 15 we read:
“9. Death is the inevitable end for all. It is better to bring that end nearer to those who hinder our affairs than to ourselves, to the founders of this affair. We execute masons in such wise that none save the brotherhood can ever have a suspicion of it, not even the victims themselves of our death sentence, they all die when required as if from a normal kind of illness . . . ” {8}
(Dear truth-seeker, as we have proven, the Jesuits have revived and control the secret society of Freemasonry, its religious and political agenda being in accord with the Council of Trent. It is their greatest tool, appearing to be anti-Pope! But if individual Masons interfere with the plans of the Sons of Loyola they are ignored, silenced or murdered. One American Freemason was President Garfield who had been assassinated one year before our fearless French Freemason, Leon Gambetta.)
Little did the French know they too would pay dearly for their expulsion of the Jesuits, having never been enlightened as to the true authors of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars. The descendants of the brave Blaise Pascal, Admiral Coligny, Henry IV, General Lafayette, “the Citizen King” Louis Philippe, Eugene Sue, M. J. Michelet, M. E. Quinet, Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo and Leon Gambetta – all anti-Jesuit – would be disgraced with the anti-Semitic/Jewish “Dreyfus Affair,” as

Captain Alfred Dreyfus, that innocent Jewish French officer whose Chief of the General Staff had a Jesuit confessor, would be unjustly convicted of “treason” (just like the Rosenbergs in America) and spend ten years of torturous imprisonment at Devil’s Island. Further, the flower of French manhood would fall on the battlefields and would be gassed or buried alive in the trenches during World War I — the beginning of the Jesuits’ Second Thirty Years’ War. But all did not fare well with the Order in France. The King of the Jews, at the right hand of His Father in Heaven, moved His invisible, nail-scarred hand against the Blackrobes who sought to create French anti-Jewish fury. We read:
“In 1901 there began a parliamentary crusade against the Jesuits . . . which had established themselves in France and had become hostile to the Republic. The Associations Bill . . . was no half-hearted measure . . . This was no doubt aimed at those Orders who had entered the commercial sphere and were rolling in wealth. Some of the Orders did large business as . . . patent medicine makers . . . The new Act was administered with severity, largely due to the damaging revelations of the part played by [the Jesuits] in the Dreyfus case [which led to the instigation of the Order’s Zionist Movement led by its Masonic Jew, Theodor Herzl, who, after an audience with Pope Pius X in 1904, pledged protection of Roman Catholic “sanctuaries” in Palestine by his Zionists, who later, under the leadership of Chaim Weizmann and with the secret blessing of Pope Pius XII, established the Zionist government of Israel]. Of course there was the usual cry of religious persecution. To that the best reply was made in the Times as follows. . . . ‘They [the Jesuits] are a political organization working to extend the influence of the Church of Rome over the French Army and the French Legislature . . . [The] French Government . . . is dealing simply with political agents aiming at the subversion of society, employing the most scandalous and immoral methods, and using their ecclesiastical status simply as a cloak to disguise their real character, and a means of envenoming the dagger they seek to plunge into the side of the body politic.’ ” {9} [Emphasis added]
(Dear truth-seeker, the Jesuits plunged in the dagger in 1914 beginning World War I, twisted it in 1940 with Hitler’s successful invasion, and were given formal reentry by Petain’s “Vichy Government” in 1942, manned by Nazis like Klaus Barbie.)
In 1882, the same year Gambetta was assassinated, “the Triple Alliance” was formed in Europe. The nations composing the Alliance would be called “the Central Powers.” And who were the heads of the three nations composing the Triple Alliance? The Lutheran “heretics and liberals” controlling Germany’s “Second Reich” were Kaiser Wilhelm I and his “Iron Chancellor,” Otto von Bismarck, they having expelled the Order from the Empire in 1872. The “liberal” controlling

Austria-Hungary was Emperor Franz Joseph — the Hapsburg who had revoked Austria’s Concordat with the Pope in 1874 and whose Chancellor was a Protestant, Baron-Beust! (The Jesuits’ Holy Alliance was now under “heretic” or “liberal” control to the horror of the Jesuit General!) The son of the excommunicated and “liberal” King Victor Emmanuel II, having rightfully taken the Temporal Power over Italy from the Pope, was Umberto, King of Italy. All three governments – one Lutheran and two Roman Catholic – were anti-Pope and hated the Jesuits! I repeat dear truth-seeker, “the Triple Alliance,” the supposed villain of the Great War, was anti-Jesuit in 1882! Oh, that the German Empire had not been corrupted by Rome’s Central Party! Oh, that the Russian government, having expelled the Jesuits in 1820 and broken off its Concordat with the Pope in 1877, had sided with the Triple Alliance! Oh, that the French government having expelled the Jesuits in 1880, had sided with the Triple Alliance! Oh, that the government of the Protestant British Empire, having legally forbidden a Roman Catholic to sit on her throne, had sided with the Triple Alliance! Oh, that the Serbian government, whose Orthodox people are forever the enemies of the Pope and his Jesuits, had never signed a Concordat with the Papal Caesar on June 24, 1914, but had sided with the Triple Alliance! Oh, had the Protestants and Baptists of the American Empire sided with the Triple Alliance! There would have been no “Triple Entente” financed by the Jesuits’ J. P. Morgan in 1910 and thus no World War I! The four hundred year celebration of the Protestant Reformation would have proceeded as planned. We read and weep:
“The seeds of hate between Germany and England were planted in those two glorious Protestant countries by the Jesuits so that they might develop in time to block the celebration of the Protestant Reformation on its four hundredth Anniversary — an event which was planned to surpass anything of the kind the world has ever seen, a celebration which would have set Protestantism fifty years ahead. The Jesuits, anticipating this, staged the World War which completely sidetracked it.” {10}
The peoples and governments of Europe had revolted against the Temporal Power of the Pope and the Society of Jesus. But by 1939, Germany (dominated by Catholic Bavaria’s Nazi party), Catholic Austria, Catholic Italy and Catholic Spain would be so corrupted by Rome that each would have a Concordat with the Papal Caesar. And by the end of the Second Thirty Years’ War in 1945, the “heretics and liberals” of Europe, especially the Protestant peoples of Holland, Denmark, Finland, Norway and England, would be raped, plundered and murdered, while the Pope and his Jesuit General, sitting atop of a heap of rubble having been prosperous “heretic and liberal” civilizations, and upon a mountain of stolen Jewish and Protestant gold,
would be the masters of all!

Victor Emmanuel II, 1820 – 1878 #101 First King of Italy, 1861 - 1878 In 1870 Rome’s Papal Caesar was declared to be “infallible” at the First Vatican Council, it being under the total control of the Black Pope. That same year, after nearly fifty years of struggle, a united Italy gained its national sovereignty and a place among the nations of the earth. Victor Emmanuel became King, righteously taking the Temporal Power from the Pope residing in Caesar’s Palace, the Vatican. Submitting to Pius IX’s Spiritual Power, Emmanuel declared he would wield Italy’s political or rather “Temporal Power” over the Italian people. This loss infuriated the Pope; he declared himself a prisoner and viciously excommunicated the King, cursing every part of his body. The Papal Caesar would be deprived of his Temporal Power for nearly sixty years when, in 1929, the Jesuits would raise up their “man of destiny” and “Defender of Islam” (aiding Saudi Arabia’s King Ibn Saud), fascist Benito Mussolini. The Duce would formally restore the Pope’s right to be “the infallible Vicar of Christ, the Supreme Governor of the World on Earth, and the Father of Nations and Kings” so stated in Latin on his Papal Triple Crown, in creating the sovereign nation-state of Vatican City with a treaty called a “Concordat.” The Life and Times of Cavour, William Roscoe Thayer, (New York: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1911) Vol. I, p. 467.

The Jesuits’ Paul de Cassagnac was its most rampant foe and our hero, Leon Gambetta, was its greatest defender. A stranger to fear, the popular idol and first man of France, he was truly a condemned “liberal” according to the Papal Caesar’s Council of Trent. As the greatest orator of the French, he hated the Jesuits’ Holy Alliance in suppressing freedom of conscience enforced by Napoleon III. Therefore he decentralized power in Paris and spread national friendship amidst a spirit of toleration and good will. Declaring the Jesuits to be the enemy of France, in 1880 he brought forth the Disestablishment Act abolishing the Society of Jesus, approved of by his fellow republicans under the common law of self-defense. Two years later, on November 27, 1882, during the height of his power and about to become the next President of the French Republic, he received “the leaden bullet” from the hand of his mistress-assassin “by accident.” True to form, the Order was readmitted by Henri Petain’s pro-Nazi, Vichy government in 1942, during the Black Pope’s Second Thirty Years’ War.

“It must be borne in mind that Rome, of all things, desiderates the ruin of heretic England, and endeavours, to the utmost of her power, to create troubles and difficulties to that free country . . . And this renders the Jesuits more dangerous than any other religious community. Indeed, I would rather see all the various species of those parasite animals called monks transplanted into the English soil than let one Jesuit live in it a single day; and it is not without good reason that we speak so in this Protestant country. The order of the Jesuits was purposely instituted to combat, to extinguish Protestantism...The extirpation of heresy is their principal occupation, the work which renders them meritorious in the eyes of Rome . . . Plots and machinations against Protestants, and against all civil and religious freedom, are the characteristics of the Jesuits . . . and if Protestant England does not soon awake to a sense of her danger, we fear she will repent, too late, of having fostered in her breast these poisonous vipers. Behold what is going on! . . . Behold the utmost uninterrupted state of rebellion in which the priests keep the fanatic Papists of Ireland, and be sure that such would not be the case if you had not Jesuits among them . . . I trust to be believed. I have been born and brought up among monks and Jesuits; and it is because I thoroughly know them, that, grateful for the hospitality afforded me, I warn England to beware of all monks, but especially of Jesuits.

The Jesuits in advancing their plans – their Great World Conspiracy of One World Government under their “infallible” and risen Papal Caesar ruling all the nations of the earth from Jerusalem pursuant to the devilish teachings of St. Augustine’s City of God, – encountered serious resistance throughout the glorious Nineteenth Century. This resistance resulted in many expulsions from a host of nations around the world. Jesuit Thomas J. Campbell, President of the Order’s Fordham University from 1885 to 1888 and again from 1896 to 1900, notes in his highly detailed history, The Jesuits, 1534 to 1921, that, between 1555 and 1921, the Order was expelled from at least eighty-three countries, states and cities for engaging in political intrigue, subversive plots and treason against the state!
By 1900, nearly all of Europe, most of Asia and many South American nations had had enough of the Jesuit Order. Pope Clement XIV had suppressed the Company with a Bull in 1773; England had expelled it in 1579, 1581, 1586, 1602 and 1604; Venice in 1606, 1612 and 1768; Denmark in 1606; Japan in 1587 and finally in 1614 having executed 111 Jesuits by 1651; China in 1623 “for leading the ignorant people towards rebellion,” 1716, 1753 and again in 1775; India in 1623; Holland in 1596 and 1816; Malta in 1634 and 1768; the Duchy of Parma in 1768; Belgium in 1818 and 1826; Russia in 1723, 1776 and “forever” in 1820; Spain in 1767, 1820, 1835, 1854, 1868 and 1932; Britain and Ireland in 1829, Portugal in 1598, 1759, 1834 and 1901; Switzerland in 1847; Bavaria in 1848; Italy in 1848 and 1859; Austria and Galicia in 1848-1852; Paraguay in 1733 and 1858; Germany in 1872; France in 1594, 1606, 1764, 1804, 1806, 1828, 1831, 1845, 1880 and 1901; Guatemala in 1872; Mexico in 1873; Brazil in 1874; Ecuador and Colombia in 1875; and Costa Rica in 1884. And to where did the Jesuits go? To the disgrace of English-speaking Protestants we read:

“The only countries where the Jesuits lived in peace were the States where Protestantism was in the majority: England, Sweden, Denmark, the United
States of America.” {11} [Emphasis added]
Hector Macpherson tells us in The Jesuits in History:
“So hurtful was the Jesuit Order found to be that, up to 1860, it was expelled no fewer than seventy times from countries which had suffered from its machinations . . . In spite of Continental warnings, England [under Queen Victoria (1837-1901) who opened up communication with the Vatican in 1877 and enabled the Order co carry out its Second Irish Massacre (1845-1850] has become a Jesuit dumping-ground. Those whom other countries have found from sad experience to be enemies, Britain allows to land on her shores, and to carry on unmolested their work of iniquity. We are carrying toleration to excess, and unless there is a change of policy, this nation will one day pay a heavy penalty.” {12}
Of Fourteenth Amendment America, David Mitchell declares:
“America . . . was a Mecca for fugitive Jesuits throughout the nineteenth century.” {13} [Justin D. Fulton is in full agreement with this statement, as he declared the same in his Washington In the Lap of Rome (1888).]
Yes, dear truth-seeker, the Jesuits fled to their new “Holy Roman” Empire of Fourteenth Amendment America. We read in 1890:
“But where did the banished Jesuit go? Whither, when under the suspicion, and flying from the hatred of the rising spirit of freedom in Europe, does he betake himself, and where is he now? I answer, In America, in the United States [Americans now comprising twenty-five percent of the Order]. Our country is the paradise of Jesuits. Unwarned by the experience of other lands, regardless of the bands they weave about the limbs of liberty, we have permitted their presence in this country, until, almost ready to throw off the disguise, they now threaten our institutions with ruin . . . It is the Jesuit who is decrying free speech and liberty of conscience and a free press; who is doing his utmost in conformity with the constitutions of the society of which he is a sworn adherent, and of the Papacy of which he is at once the dictator and the slave, to reduce free America to the subjection of an absolute monarch [a fascist military dictator]. What will be the result? Strange and wonderful to say, misfortune and disaster to themselves seems to follow their designs against government. In 1870, it was their influence which assembled and directed the Vatican Council, which should exalt still higher dogmas of the church, and overthrow the growing spirit of freedom.

It was their plan, at the same time, to declare the Pope infallible, and to subjugate Italy and Europe to his power. Napoleon III of France, the favorite son of the church, whose bayonets were the guard and support of the Papal throne, was led, through Jesuit influence, to declare war upon Protestant Prussia. But behold while they debated the infallibility of the Pope, the monarch on whom Pius IX had shed the blight of his blessing surrendered himself, his army and his empire at Sedan, and free Italy began to march on Rome. Many prelates fled the Imperial City, and the thunder of the guns of Prussia at Sedan was answered by the cannon of free Italy, turned against the gates of Rome. Into their long degraded capital swept the hosts of freedom; the Quirinal became the palace of the King of United Italy, Victor Emmanuel, and when the few hundred Ecclesiastics of the Papacy, only a fraction of the Council, passed the decree which made the Pope an infallible prince, it was answered by the huzzahs of liberty throughout France and Italy. Since then, the Infallible has whined and protested, begged and threatened, but he is an Italian subject against his will, and must be, while he stays in Rome. God grant that the machinations of the Roman hierarchy may result in the emancipation of their followers from Papal tyranny in America, as in France and Italy! Let Jesuitism which has fled to America, to found an Empire on the ruins of the Republic, having been swept by edict from the Old world, here find a grave; while American Catholic Christians, Romanist and Protestant, open the Word of God, and by it the gates of progress, here, in the free Republic of the west.” {14} [Emphasis added]
Yes indeed! The Jesuits, having fled to Fourteenth Amendment America from Europe, would build a huge commercial Empire with its powers consolidated in Washington. The Indian Nations, being a barrier to the Empire’s development, would be betrayed and destroyed during the last half of the Nineteenth Century, while millions of Bible-rejecting Roman Catholic and Jewish immigrants would be brought from Europe to repopulate the Eastern Seaboard, becoming “the liberal Eastern Establishment.” Nearly fifty percent of all the Roman Catholic institutions of higher learning would be in Fourteenth Amendment America.
The power of the Jesuit Order was now absolute in Washington. Charles Chiniquy, one of our heroes, the friend of Abraham Lincoln and converted Roman Catholic priest, wrote in 1886:
“The great, the fatal mistake of the American Government in the prosecution of the assassins of Abraham Lincoln was to constantly keep out of sight the religious element of that terrible drama. Nothing would have been more easy, then, to find out the complicity of the priests, who were not only coming every week and every day, but who were even living in

that den of murderers. But this was carefully avoided from the beginning to the end of the trial. When not long after the execution of the murderers, I went, incognito, to Washington to begin my investigation about its true and real authors, I was not a little surprised to see that not a single one of the Government men to whom I addressed myself, would consent to have any talk with me on that matter, except after I had given my word of honor that I would never mention their names in connection with the result of my investigation. I saw with a profound distress, that the influence of Rome was almost supreme in Washington. I could not find a single statesman who would dare to face that nefarious influence and fight it down.” {15} [Emphasis added]
In 1901 the Jesuits assassinated the Freemason, President William McKinley, while Theodore “Rex” Roosevelt, their most obedient Freemason and friend of Knight of Malta William R. Grace (whose son, Joseph P. Grace, financed the Bolshevik Revolution, whose son, J. Peter Grace, participated in the Kennedy Assassination), became President and the Empire’s first real Papal Emperor. We see:
“Theodore Roosevelt was the first of the modern Imperialists – American version – blatantly advocating economic expansionism by the use of violent economic and financial aggression supported by brute force, and diverting the government of the United States into the first instrument of the big American [Vatican controlled] corporations’ grandiose schemes of world exploitation . . . As usual, the American people knew very little or nothing of what was going on. Not so the little hired hand in the pay of Big Business [controlled by the Jesuits’ J. P. Morgan] — namely Theodore Roosevelt.” {16} [Emphasis added]
Further, we must remember that the Jesuits, in control of President Franklin Pierce, had forcibly opened up Japan to foreigners in 1854, using the American gunboats commanded by Commodore Perry. The Jesuits proceeded to reenter Japan in 1865 (according to Andrew C. Ross’s A Vision Betrayed {17} ) and then assassinated Emperor Komei. The young Emperor Meiji then lifted the “Christian ban” in 1873, the Order having been expelled for over two hundred and fifty years. Payback time was now in the making for “the Land of the Rising Sun,” as well as China including its Manchu Dynasty having also expelled the Jesuit Order. From the moment Theodore Roosevelt the Freemason became the American Emperor (who then erected the statue of the devil-worshipping Albert Pike in Washington, D.C.), the Jesuits would have absolute control of the White House through Georgetown University. Indeed, the arrogant and bombastic words of priest Isaac Hecker were fulfilled when he declared in the late Nineteenth Century:

Chapter 31 389
“In 1900 Rome will take this country and keep it.” {18}
By 1912 it was said of the Jesuits:
“To-day they are stronger in the United States than they ever were in any of the countries of Europe which expelled them as a menace to the
government.” {19}
The Jesuits would mold the ruined Republic of Protestant American freemen into a functioning, centralized Catholic Empire of Fourteenth Amendment enfranchised slaves – both White and Black – for the purpose of using American military might to restore and maintain the Papal-Caesar’s Temporal Power, not only in Italy, but throughout the world. Our hero, Jeremiah Crowley warned:
“Strange as it may seem to the casual observer, it is true . . . that . . . the papal policy of power and pelf . . . is embraced . . . by the credulous non-Catholic people; and this is especially true in the English-speaking countries – England, Canada and the United States. These unscrupulous politicians, high and low, are only too willing to serve the Pope in his ungodly efforts to regain Temporal Power.” {20} [Emphasis added]
Meanwhile, the Jesuits would overthrow the governments of the nations having expelled the Order from their borders. Absolute “republican” communist dictatorships would be imposed, which then would submit to the Temporal Power of the Pope as a matter of “foreign policy.” A classic example is the Jesuit-trained, Roman Catholic communist and bastard son of a Nazi, Fidel Castro, the dictator of Cuba for the last forty years. The American Empire would continue the policies of “the Holy Alliance” preventing the establishment of popular governments around the world. In 1908 the Empire would be given a secret inquisitional police, the Bureau of Investigation, known today as the FBI. Its Director would protect the Papal-Caesar’s Mafia from prosecution, denying its existence for years. In 1913 the Jesuits, in preparing to finance the coming Second Thirty Years’ War, would saddle the Empire with a privately owned national bank — the Federal Reserve System. Those wealthy Jews, who would not consent to the Jesuits’ “King’s Bank,” would find themselves on the deathship Titanic. In the 1930s the Jesuits, with Boeing Aircraft, would build thousands of long-range bombers, B-17s and B-29s, financed by their national bank in whose hands all credit had been centralized after the Great Depression. With these aircraft they would bomb the civilian populations of Germany and Japan into submission to the dictates of Washington, controlled by the Jesuit General in Rome. By 1941 the Order would be ready to punish the nations that had driven its soldiers out of their lands. With the planned destruction of Pearl Harbor, Congress would declare war for the last time and the Jesuits would be ready for their ultimate vengeance – pursuant to the evil Council of Trent – World War II!

Victoria of England, 1819 – 1901 #103 Queen of the Protestant British Empire, 1837 - 1901 Again, we are at a loss in describing this most careless of European Monarchs. Deceptively portrayed as an enemy of Rome by the English Cardinal Wiseman, Queen Victoria, like George III, was completely in the hands of the Militia of the Black Pope. During “the British Century” her Prime Ministers, Viscount Palmerston and Benjamin Disraeli, used the diplomatic and military might of Protestant England to restore and maintain the Temporal Power of the Papal Caesar around the world. London never came to the aid of struggling peoples as they resisted the continental tyrants enforcing the Jesuits’ Holy Alliance, but rather secretly opposed their efforts. England refused to give asylum to the Italian patriots when they fled to British Malta in 1849, conducted the opium wars against the Order’s hated Chinese Manchu Dynasty, approved of the Jesuits’ coup d’etat creating Napoleon III’s French Empire in 1852, sided with the Jesuits’ Crimean War against Orthodox Russia in 1856, fired the American “anti-slavery agitation” causing the merciless annihilation of our White Southern Protestant culture with the War Between the States and pro-Negro Reconstruction from 1861 to 1876, and invaded the “liberal” Mexican republic of our hero, Benito Pablo Juarez, in 1864.

A personal friend of New York Knight of Malta William R. Grace (after whose Order he named his Maltese Cross Cabin in North Dakota), Jesuit Thomas Sherman, Cardinal Gibbons of Washington and Cardinal Satolli (the Vatican’s secret diplomatic agent in the White House), the Jesuits used their Shriner Freemason to begin building their corporate-fascist-masonic Empire throughout the western hemisphere. Under this apostate Protestant, having erected the statue of President Andrew Johnson’s occult Masonic master and White House advisor, Albert Pike, in Washington, D.C., Rome’s huge corporate monopolies, managed by J. P. Morgan, a Shriner Freemason, and Nicholas F. Brady, a Knight of Malta, began to be built and to work in unison preparing the Order’s massive Military Industrial Complex for the Jesuit General’s Second Thirty Years’ War. Meanwhile, Jesuit-controlled Protestant America would be deceived into abandoning President George Washington’s wise policy of isolation, and begin to enforce the Temporal Power of Satan’s Papacy upon every nation on earth pursuant to the Black Pope’s wicked and evil Council of Trent.

The Tzars, although the protectors of the Knights of Malta, had become a problem for “the Company.” Alexander I expelled the Jesuits from Moscow and St. Petersburg in 1816; and, with a ukase in 1820, like Peter the Great, expelled them from Russia declaring that all their efforts:
“ . . . were directed merely to secure advantages for themselves and the
extension of their power . . . ” {7}
Five years later, Tzar Alexander I, in good health, died suddenly. He, like Napoleon, had been poisoned.
Upon the death of Alexander I’s successor – Tzar Nicholas I – Tzar Alexander II ascended the throne. He greatly outraged the Jesuits! Remembering that he was one of the key Monarchs obligated to enforce the policies of the Jesuits’ “Holy Alliance,” Alexander II enacted many liberal reforms. He abolished espionage and emancipated the Serfs. As a result, the Jesuits incited the Polish rebellion for which the Tzar revoked his predecessor’s Concordat with Rome. The Tzar also broke diplomatic relations with Satan’s Papacy in 1866, and again in 1877, further outraging the Jesuits while fueling their conspiracy to ultimately overthrow Russia’s Romanoff Dynasty. Finally in 1882 – the very year the anti-Jesuit Triple Alliance was formed – Tzar Alexander II, in laying the capstone of his reforms, had attached his signature to the proposed Constitution of Russia. This the Jesuits would not tolerate! It violated the absolutism of the Holy Alliance and infringed on the Temporal Power of the Papal Caesar. If the Tzar’s absolute monarchy became a Constitutional monarchy with express limitations upon its powers, how could the Jesuits’ “infallible” Pope eventually rule Russia in accordance with the Council of Trent? Those limitations would restrain the Pope’s Temporal Power, disabling him from ruling the Russian people through the Romanoffs. With a free Russia, the Jesuit General’s grand design of submitting the Orthodox Church to the Vicar of Christ would never come to pass.
The Jesuits had to act quickly. As they had used Masonic Mazzini to punish Pope Pius IX for proposing a Constitution for Italy in 1846, so they would use the Masonic nihilists to punish the Tzar for nearly succeeding in establishing “liberal” government in Russia. Pius IX was forced to flee from the Vatican to Gaeta but Alexander II, who maintained liberty of conscience, would be assassinated. We read:
“Alexander II had progressed well with his great reforms and had attached his signature to a Constitution to be adopted by Russia. The next day a bomb was thrown at his carriage, which killed and wounded a number of Cossacks, who accompanied the carriage. The Emperor in deep sympathy left the carriage to look at the dying men, when a second bomb blew him to pieces.” {8} [Emphasis added]

Chapter 32 395
Alexander III, in coming to power became a fierce absolutist. Though formally suppressed, the Jesuits used this tyrant to fiercely persecute the Jews with their many pogroms. Of one we read from the great Pierre van Paassen:
“But more frequently the conversation turned to the persecutions that the Jews were undergoing in Russia. The Great War lay still in the future . . . I vividly recall that Sunday evening when a Russian Jew with a long white beard, who kept his hat on, ascended the pulpit and in broken German, told us the whole harrowing story of his people’s persecution. His own wife and children had perished in the bloody attack. Before her death, the woman had seen the mob throw her two children into a burning oven . . . he went on to say that thousands of young Jews all over Russia had begun to arm themselves with revolvers, determined to defend themselves if the attacks should be repeated. ” {9}
The pogroms produced the desired effect. The deceived Jews developed a great hatred for the Tzar — just like the Jesuits! And when the time arrived for the overthrow of Nicholas II and the purging persecutions of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Jews would rally to the cause in overthrowing Rome’s old enemies. (Remember Fiddler on the Roof ?) Little did they know they had been “framed” by the Sons of Loyola and would be blamed for the atrocities of Russian communism. Part of the set-up was the circulation of The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion. Laying the blueprint for a world socialist-communist state, it was very much like the Order’s secret meetings at Chieri, Italy exposed by Abate Leone’s The Jesuit Conspiracy: The Secret Plan of the Order in 1848. Its authorship was attributed to the Jews but the true source was the Society of Jesus. We read the words of our ex-priest, Bible believer and evangelist to the Roman Catholic people of New York City, Leo Lehmann:
“Although first published in Russia in 1903, the Protocols of Zion had their origin in France and date from the Dreyfus Affair, of which the Jesuits were the chief instigators . . . These Protocols of supposedly Jewish leaders are not the first documents of their kind fabricated by the Jesuits. For over a hundred years before these Protocols appeared, the Jesuits had continued to make use of a similar fraud called The Secrets of the Elders of Bourg-Fontaine against Jansenism — an anti-Jesuit French Catholic movement among the secular clergy [later outlawed by a Jesuit-authored papal Bull].” {10}
Alberto Rivera, one of our fearless heroes and a converted Jesuit, agrees:
“We were instructed that the Jesuits directed certain Jews who were loyal to the Pope, to write a document called The Protocols of Zion. When it was
published the Europeans went wild.” {11}

Additionally, in the little town of Fatima, Portugal three young children, ages seven to fourteen, supposedly saw “Mary” appear six times between the spring and fall of 1917. This unbiblical, Jesuit-contrived, “Lady of Fatima” Hoax, calling for the “conversion” of Tzarist Russia to Catholicism, was the religious propaganda used to incite and then unite the superstitious masses of Europe to attack Rome’s ancient Orthodox foe with fire and sword! As a result, from 1917 to 1989 Russia would be conquered and then reduced to obedience to the Jesuit General’s “infallible” Pope, using the Russian branch of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta! The Society of Jesus would launch the Bolshevik Revolution and brutal Civil War (1917-1922); it would then negotiate a secret Concordat (a treaty between Lenin and the Pope) and establish the Inquisition through its “Grand Inquisitor” – the thug – Joseph Stalin, using his Jesuit-admiring hatchet man and head of the Cheka, Felix Admundovich Dzerzhinsky, whose father, Admund Dzerzhinsky was a Jesuit-controlled, Polish Roman Catholic priest. Stalin would purge the nation of its Protestant and Baptist churches and, toward the end of his life, attempt to kill every Russian Jew (1922-1953). The Company, using the Lady of Fatima Hoax and Hitler, would also ignite a huge anti-Russian Orthodox /anti-“Russian Jewish Communist” Crusade called “Operation Barbarossa” (1941-1945; named after Germany’s Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick I Barbarossa (1152-1190), having led his cruel armies through Orthodox lands during Rome’s Third Crusade due to the Great Schism in 1054); and then, the Black Pope would create “the Cold War” (using CFR/CIA Knights of Malta) enabling his KGB to continue his Order’s Communist Inquisition in its new papal dominion, the “USSR” (1945-1989), won for its Roman Priest-King.
Dear truth-seeker, all this heartbreak, desolation and mass-murder – imposed by the evil Council of Trent and Jesuit Oath – would be financed by the Jesuit General’s Federal Reserve Bank in New York City — the home of “the Archbishop of the capital of the world.” And God help any American President who would dare to be a Daniel and put a stop to it! His life had better be pure while making his plan bathed in prayer with strong crying and tears – guided by the Spirit of God through the Word of God. Constrained by a love for his endangered people and admonished by loyal advisors, he must be surrounded with fearless bodyguards, all these men being serious seekers of the risen Son of God! For on Jesus the Messiah they must fully trust, knowing that:
He holds all political power, over all the kingdoms of men, And will invisibly intervene, for our Daniel and his friends. Yet in the fire none shall burn, yes, they have met Him on His terms. Their earnest prayers He has heard, for they have rested on His Words. Then known to all they shall be, as those who sought Him on their knees. Cromwell’s words will be their story, Indeed, “For thus I came to glory!”

With no man “valiant for the truth in the earth,” the time for Jesuit payback had arrived for Russia. The Romanoff Dynasty would end while Rome’s old enemy, the Orthodox Church, would be purged of its anti-Pope leadership. The October Revolution would accomplish this, heavily financed by the Knights of Malta and Jewish Freemasons on Wall Street. Stanford University professor Anthony Sutton writes in his no-nonsense style:
“We find there was a link between some New York International bankers and many revolutionaries, including Bolsheviks. These banking gentlemen – who are here identified – had a financial stake in, and were rooting for the success of the Bolshevik Revolution.” {12}
Two of those men were Knight of Malta, Joseph P. Grace (Director of National City Bank) and the Jewish Freemason, Otto H. Kahn (Partner in Kuhn & Loeb).
The parallels between the Jesuits’ French and Russian Revolutions are striking. They are as follows:
1. Both revolutions were based on communist writings of Freemasons Voltaire and Marx. Did not the Jesuits perfect communism on their reductions in Paraguay?
2. Both revolutions plundered the state churches. Were not the Jesuits the enemies of the Catholic Church in France and the Orthodox Church in Russia when the revolutions broke out?
3. Both revolutions ended the monarchies. Were not the Jesuits enemies of both the Bourbon and the Romanoff dynasties? Had not both monarchies expelled the Jesuits from their countries?
4. Both revolutions produced Jesuit Republics — republics in form, but absolute monarchies in power. Are not the Jesuits absolutists?
5. Both revolutions declared atheism as the religion of the state. Evidenced by their deeds, are not the Jesuits truly atheists?
6. Both revolutions carried out a reign of terror by an inquisitional secret police. Are not the Jesuits the greatest of Inquisitors?
7. Both revolutions resulted in military dictators who punished the enemies of the Jesuits. Did not the Jesuits benefit even though Napoleon and Stalin, in deceiving the nations, openly banned the Order from France and Russia?

The Jesuits began the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. Having recruited Russian Jews aided by American Jews from New York, the Jesuits made the revolution to appear to be of Jewish origin. We read:
“A short time after the U.S. Consul in Moscow had given his report, our Government instituted an investigation through the Overman Committee in 1919 . . . Dr. George A. Simons, former superintendent of the Methodist Mission in Russia, was one of the chief witnesses before this committee . . . Dr. Simons gave some interesting information:
‘We were told that hundreds of agitators had followed in the trail of Trotzsky [Trotsky]-Bronstein, these men having come over from the lower east side of New York . . . and it soon became evident that more than half of the agitators in the so-called Bolshevik movement were Jews . . . I am not in sympathy with the anti-Semitic movement . . . I am against it. But I have a firm conviction that this thing is Yiddish, and that one of its bases is found in the east side of New York . . . I was impressed with this, Senator, that shortly after the great revolution of the winter of 1917 there were scores of Jews standing on the benches and soap boxes, talking until their mouths frothed, and often remarked to my sister ‘well what are we coming to, anyway? This all looks so Yiddish.’ Up to that time we had very few Jews, because there was, as you may know, a restriction against having Jews in Petrograd; but after the revolution they swarmed in there and most of the agitators were Jews.
I might mention this, that when the Bolsheviki came into power, all over Petrograd we at once had a predominance of Yiddish proclamations, big posters and everything in Yiddish.” {13} [Emphasis added]
The Jesuits succeeded in making the Bolshevik Revolution appear to be of Jewish origin by using Jewish Freemasons whose masters (like Shriners Jacob H. Schiff, Otto H. Kahn – whose mansion was given to the Jesuits’ Order of the Sacred Heart – and Armand Hammer, the bosom friend of Hollywood actor Cary Grant and whose Occidental Petroleum aided by the Pope’s Roman Hierarchy own the American coal industry) were loyal to the Jesuits through the House of Rothschild. This deception was so successful that most of the Europeans aided Hitler, the Friend of Islam, in the destruction of European Jewry. But the truth is in the details and often overlooked. The following details evidence the Jesuit “black hand” during the October Revolution, the Civil War, Stalin’s Reign of Terror and World War II.
1. The Jesuits secretly participated in the Bolshevik Revolution. According to the Jesuit-trained, Irish Roman Catholic, John Loftus in his Unholy Trinity, a Hungarian Catholic priest was a player in the revolution.
The Jesuits – 1882 - 1917



Chapter 32 399
“Between 1932 and 1937 the top NKVD ‘illegal’ in England was Father Theodore Maly . . . ‘when the revolution broke out I joined the Bolsheviks’ Maly once told a friend, explaining how service with the Cheka and Red Army during the brutal civil war against the [Orthodox] whites had hardened him.” {14}
Dear truth-seeker, Maly fought against the Orthodox Whites; for, he was a Professed Jesuit under Oath who perished by the very dictator he had helped to set up. Further, as a Jesuit with the Cheka and then the Russian Civilian Intelligence (NKVD), the Soviet Secret Police was in fact an arm of the Jesuits’ Holy Office of the Inquisition. The great Messianic Jew, Arno Gaebelein, tells us:
“A police system was inaugurated, the Cheka, with the commission to torture, to kill without mercy . . . The bloody work of the Cheka was carried on in a certain large building. There the victims, men, women, and children, were cruelly tortured before a shot ended their misery. In order to drown the despairing cries of the unfortunates, the building was surrounded with a number of powerful motor trucks; their motors were started and for hours they were kept a going. Then night after night, week after week, for months, the almost countless hundreds of corpses were thrown into the trucks and carried away.” {15}
2. The Bolsheviks never expelled the Knights of Malta from Russia. Surely if this was truly a revolution and not the secret Inquisition that it was, the wealthy Knights would definitely have been driven from Russia without question! Instead, business continued as usual between American and Russian Knights through their joint venture, the Grace Russian Company. Of this interlock between American and Russian big business Anthony Sutton in his Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution writes:
“The American International Corp. (AIC) [now the American International Group (AIG) headed by CFR Vice Chairman Maurice Greenberg] was organized in New York on November 22, 1915, by the J. P. Morgan interests, with major participation by Stillman’s National City Bank and the Rockefeller interests . . .
Everybody coveted the AIC stock, [Knight of Malta] Joe Grace (of W. R. Grace & Co.) wanted $600,000 in addition to his interest in National City Bank . . . In January 1917 the Grace Russian Company was formed, the joint owners being W. R. Grace & Co. [of New York] and the San Galli Trading Co. of Petrograd. American International Corp. had a substantial investment in the Grace Russian Company [with] an interlocking directorship . . . As the Bolshevik Revolution took hold in central Russia,
The Jesuits – 1882 - 1917

Secretary of State Robert Lansing requested the views of American International Corp. on the policy to be pursued towards the Soviet regime. On January 16, 1918 – barely two months after the takeover in Petrograd and Moscow, and before a fraction of Russia had come under Bolshevik control – William Franklin Sands, executive secretary of American International Corp., submitted the requested memorandum on the Russian political situation to Secretary Lansing . . .
In brief, Sands, as executive secretary of a corporation whose directors were the most prestigious on Wall Street, provided an emphatic endorsement of the Bolsheviks and the Bolshevik Revolution, and within a matter of weeks after the revolution started. And as a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Sands had just contributed $1 million to the Bolsheviks [Wow!!!].” {16} [Emphasis added]
Of the Irish Catholic Grace family more needs to be said between its connection to Rome’s Jesuits, the Knights of Malta in Russia and the Bolshevik Revolution. We read from the Executive Intelligence Review Special Report of 1987:
“The Irish Catholic Grace family was overlord of the British royal house, driven out successively by Cromwell, then William [III] of Orange [Praise God!], joining the Stuart cause in exile. In 1850 William R. Grace arrived in Peru at age 18, where he acquired a British guano-trading firm as the lynchpin for future major acquisitions in shipping, rail, banking, minerals, sugar plantations, and so forth. Perhaps the greatest increase in Grace family holdings in Peru occurred after the War of the Pacific, where the Grace family had supplied material to both Chile and Peru. Then the Earl of Donoughmore, heading the Committee of Peruvian Bondholders, tapped William Grace to make a debt-for-equity settlement that led to foreign acquisition of most Peruvian agro-industry and infrastructure. Leaving a brother in Peru, William Grace relocated to New York, where he was mayor from 1880-1888 [and one of the powers behind Theodore Roosevelt].
In 1907, Joseph P. Grace joined the board of the First National City Bank [along with Cardinal Spellman’s benefactor Nicholas F. Brady] then owned by Rockefeller-Stillman interests – and set up Grace National Bank in 1915. Joseph Grace became a member of the American International Corp., founded principally by Frank Vanderlip of City Bank, which traded extensively with Russia before and after the Bolshevik Revolution. It was located at 120 Broadway, the office of a complex of firms representing every major Wall Street financial group involved in similar dealings.” {17} [Emphasis added]

Joe P. Grace and Nicholas F. Brady were both multimillionaires and Papal Knights of Malta. (In 1930 Brady financed the building of a costly Jesuit Novitiate in Wernersville, Pennsylvania. Childless upon his death, his wife Genevieve America’s foremost Dame of Malta and Jesuit matron called “the Duchess” donated their fabulous Long Island estate and mansion, Inisfada, to the Sons of Loyola.) Both continued to trade with companies owned by the Russian Branch of the Knights of Malta before and after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. Were the Masonic Jews responsible for that Inquisition or were they merely “attention-getting” foot soldiers for the Jesuits with their Knights of Malta, they being the true culprits behind the plot? The Jesuits, as masters of New York, used the Knights of Malta, “the great merchants of the earth,” to finance the Bolshevik Revolution. This is why the Russian “Tongue” or “Branch” of the Knights of Malta in Moscow was never expelled by the Bolsheviks or by bloody “Uncle” Joe Stalin, as FDR called him.
3. After the five-year Civil War, the Jesuits were given permission by the Bolsheviks to reenter Russia after having been expelled for over a century. Catholic priest James J. Zatko, with grants from the Ford Foundation and the University of Notre Dame (both Roman Catholic institutions being affiliated with the Jesuits’ Council on Foreign Relations) wrote in 1965 in his Descent Into Darkness, pages 111 and following:
“An atmosphere of apparent good feeling having been established, Monsignor Pizzardo met Vladimir Vorovskii [in mid-1922] to define points of an accord between the Holy See and Russia for a papal mission in Russia . . . Still this informal meeting did not have any effect on the conference, and the only result was the accord for the papal relief mission. This accord provided for the work of three Catholic “orders” in Russia, the Redemptorists [secret Jesuits] to work in northern Russia, the Society of Jesus to work in central Russia, and the Society of the Divine Word [secret Jesuits] to work in southern Russia.” {18}
(Dear truth-seeker, is it not a strange coincidence that the Society of Jesus was secretly permitted by Jesuit-trained Joseph Stalin and his Bolsheviks to reside openly in central Russia which included Moscow and Petrograd? Did not the revolution originate in these cities from which proceeded the Cheka’s merciless inquisition? Indeed, all of Russia was now to be openly invaded by Professed Jesuits under Extreme Oath “to wage relentless war, against all heretics . . . to extirpate and exterminate them from the face of the whole earth . . . in order to annihilate forever their execrable race.” The Jesuits with their Communist Bolsheviks, many of whom were Masonic Jewish Zionists, must have truly had a “bloody good” ball! A few years later the Black Pope would again be aided by his Zionists, such as Chaim Weizmann and America’s foremost Rabbi, Stephen S. Wise, in carrying out the “Final Solution to the Jewish Question” and in establishing his Zionist Israel!

This is why Israel’s leaders of today, including Shimon Peres, NEVER EXPOSE the Vatican’s Jewish Holocaust but rather use it as an industry to support the Pope’s Zionists who in turn will use it as the ultimate agitation in creating worldwide anti-Jewish fury, driving millions of Jews to Israel!) Priest James J. Zatko continues:
“In the communist strategy Catholic propaganda was to cause the whole Orthodox structure to crumble . . . The instruments of this new alliance between the Soviets and the Vatican were to be the Jesuits, described as the hereditary enemies of the Orthodox Church. Reportedly, there were, and had been for a considerable time, large numbers of representatives of the Jesuit Order in Moscow [during the revolution] including Bishop [Edward] Ropp. The Pope, [Pius XI] who is said to have left the Jesuit Order before being elected Pope, acted entirely on the instructions of [not] Count [but Wlodimir] Ledochowski, the superior general of the Jesuit Order! According to the same report [in maintaining the illusion that the Order was not in full control of the Bolsheviks], the Vatican felt it could bring the Russian [Orthodox] Church under papal domination only if Tikhon [Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church] were eliminated, a condition which the Bolsheviks thought had been fulfilled. The Jesuits and the Vatican, on their part, promised that after a conclusion of a concordat, they would do all in their power to put pressure on the governments of Italy, France, and Belgium to hasten their recognition of the Soviet government [which was done].” {19} [Emphasis added]
Edmond Paris, one of France’s greatest authorities on the Jesuits, rightly concludes:
“The Russian Revolution, by eliminating the Czar, protector of the Orthodox Church, had it not decapitated the great rival and helped the penetration of the Roman Church? We must strike while the iron is hot! The famous ‘Russicum’ [Russian College in Rome] is created [in 1929] and its clandestine missionaries will take the Good News to this schismatic country. One century after their expulsion by Czar Alexander the First, the Jesuits will again undertake the conquest of the Slav world.” {20} [Emphasis added]
Dear truth-seeker, the Jesuits were the secret masters of the Bolsheviks!
They brought the Russian Orthodox Church under Papal domination, concluded a secret Concordat between the Papal Caesar and the Bolsheviks in the person of Jesuit-trained Joseph Stalin — just like Napoleon! Then the Sons of Loyola conducted a massive Inquisition, partially financed by Armand Hammer, that Masonic Jewish Zionist and billionaire Director of Occidental Petroleum, speaking fluent Russian and having access to enter and exit the Soviet Empire whenever he wished. And thus, from 1917 to 1989 Satan’s Black Pope, in the name of

“Communism,” used his “Holy Roman” American Empire in the West and his “Holy Roman” Soviet Empire in the East, “to liquidate” eighty-five to one hundred million “heretics and liberals” pursuant to the Jesuits’ evil Council of Trent!
4. The Bolsheviks with the Cheka put two and one-half million “heretics” to death pursuant to the Jesuit Oath and Council of Trent. Of this mass genocide our Messianic Jew, Arno Gaebelein, continues:
“Among the 1,766,188 victims up to the beginning of 1922, figures obtained from the Soviet documents, nearly five thousand were priests, teachers, nuns, etc. of the Greek Church . . . But soon the persecution extended to the millions of Lutheran, Reformed, Baptist, Methodist and especially Mennonite Christians . . . Nearly 100,000 Lutherans live banished; in semi-starvation in Siberia . . . Perhaps the greatest sufferers as Christians have been the Mennonites. For many years they had in southern Russia prosperous settlements, they were law abiding and earnest believers . . . What horrible sufferings, torture and death, these good people have passed through! Whole villages were wiped out. And today [1933] hundreds of them are confined in miserable prison camps, suffering untold agonies. And in the wilds of Siberia, in the far north, hundreds of other banished ones are still living enslaved, deprived of all the needed simple comforts of life, degraded and half starved. The suffering of the thousands of women is simply indescribable [massive gang rape]. Thousands of churches of the different branches have been demolished and the work of destruction goes on, so that as stated before by 1937 not a single church building or meeting house is to be left . . . Needless to say, the printing of religious periodicals, the advertisement of religious books, the circulation of the Bible . . . is not only strictly forbidden, but punishable with exile. [The Jesuits further benefited by using their Bolsheviks to execute Monsignor Budkiewicz against the wishes of President Harding and the evil Federal Council of (Protestant) Churches. This murder eliminated an enemy and united Catholics and Protestants against the Jews.]” {21} [Emphasis added]
Dear truth-seeker, is this not exactly the same religious oppression that occurred in Spain during the Dark Ages and all throughout Europe with the dawn of the Reformation? Is this not the same persecution the French Huguenots suffered under King Louis XIV, guided by his Jesuit confessor, Pere La Chaise? In fact, this is the same scenario enacted by the Jesuits in the 1600s that caused the Thirty Years’ War in Germany of which Griesinger, in his greatest of Jesuit histories, describes:
“ . . . the Jesuits proceeded for five long years, and during that space of time they consigned to the flames more than forty thousand Lutheran

Bibles, while they also occasionally, to make short work of it, converted a number of Protestant churches into ruins by means of cannon or by blowing them up into the air with gunpowder.” {22}
The Jesuits, with their Masonic Jewish Bolsheviks financed by the Knights of Malta on Wall Street, restored the Temporal Power of the Pope in their “USSR” by means of a secret Concordat, enforced by the Russian arm of the Jesuits’ Holy Office of the Inquisition — the merciless Cheka. With it came the Dark Ages and a vast system of concentration camps called “the Gulag.” The Jesuits, with their infernal Inquisition under the name of “communism,” were delightfully, in the loving spirit of “Saint” Ignatius Loyola, grinding their victims to dust.
(Dear truth-seeker, out of this terrifying crucible of Jesuit inquisition, the Son of God brought forth one of the greatest musicians ever to bless Bunyan’s “Eargate” of the human race’s “City of Mansoul.” The magnanimous and compassionate heart of Sergei Vasilievich Rachmaninoff spawned his mesmerizing masterpieces as he was the greatest pianist-composer of his day. A faithful husband and father, this wellborn, Orthodox Russian was driven from his homeland at the age of forty-four, as a result of Rome’s Bolshevik Revolution. He died in 1943 while an exile in the United States, having enjoyed Protestant liberties for the remainder of his life. Indeed, his great Symphony No. 2, Adagio enables the author to envision the triumph of good over evil with a preview of the coming millennial reign of Jesus the Messiah as the greatest Son of David sits on the Throne of His Glory. He will rule the world from His spectacular Temple, to be erected in Jerusalem as a House of Prayer for all the Gentile Nations, out of which will flow a supernatural river of water giving life to the Dead Sea, as foretold by the prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel and the Apostle John.)
In 1933, with the backing of Knight of Malta Joe Kennedy and Cardinal Hayes of New York, FDR, the Shriner Freemason, was “elected” President of the Pope’s American Empire. He sent Knight of Malta and CFR member Myron C. Taylor to Rome as the American ambassador to the Vatican without the approval of Congress. Another act of high treason was to formally recognize the bloody, Jesuit-controlled “USSR.” This in turn unleashed the huge American corporate monopolies under Vatican control (like Ford Motor Company and General Motors) to finance and build Stalin’s Red Army, which in turn would be used to totally destroy Bible-rejecting, Protestant East Prussia and East Germany during and after World War II.
By 1939 the Jesuits, with their tools Hitler and Stalin, acting in concert under Papal Concordats, would be ready to purge western Russia of her most hated population – the supposed culprits of international communism – the Jews. It was for this reason that in 1941 the Red Army, purged of its finest Generals and officers by Stalin in the mid-thirties, had been deliberately weakened, forcing its retreat at the

advancement of the German Army during “Operation Barbarossa.” This enabled the Jesuits’ Order of the Death’s Head – the SS – to round up hundreds of thousands of Russian Jews, only to be gassed and then buried in mass graves, like Babi Yar in Kiev. This not only pleased Hitler but Stalin as well; for “Koba” fiercely hated all Jews. (Is it not poetic justice that Stalin’s daughter would marry a Jew?) And among the SS, which according to Walter Schellenberg (head of the SD of the SS)
“ . . . had been organized by Himmler [whose father, Professor Gebhart Himmler, was a Jesuit coadjutor who tutored Bavaria’s Prince Heinrich Wittelsbach] according to the principles of the Jesuit Order . . . ,” {23}
were the Jesuit “missionaries” from the Russian College in Rome
“ . . . with the special object of organizing Catholic missions among the
Russian Orthodox population of the Soviet Union.” {24}
After the war, the Jesuits’ Russian NKVD “head hunters” became the KGB. The Jesuits’ American OSS became the CIA. The Jesuits’ German SS and Nazi Intelligence were merged into them both. Working together at the top, as they had during their Crusade in Europe (as Eisenhower titled his book), both agencies were controlled by the Knights of Malta destroying popular governments (liberalism) around the world while erecting dictators (absolutists) loyal to Rome. The Jesuits, with their unified international intelligence agencies, were restoring the Pope’s Temporal Power as “Master of the World” via revolution and assassination.
This is why we should not be surprised to see the high command of the KGB and CIA working together. For during World War II it was the Jesuit General’s head of the OSS, Knight of Malta “Wild” Bill Donovan, working with the American Empire’s Ambassador to the Papal Caesar in the Vatican, Knight of Malta Myron C. Taylor (whose “diplomacy prevented Europe’s Jews from escaping Himmler’s SS), who initiated the formal relationship. Anthony Cave Brown, the world’s foremost authority on Intelligence Operations, tells us in his great work, “C”:
“Donovan had flown to Moscow at Christmas 1943 to meet with General P. N. Fitin, head of the Soviet external military intelligence service, and General A. P. Ossipov, who was responsible for Soviet guerrilla, sabotage, and subversion operations in German-occupied territory. At that meeting, Donovan . . . proposed a full alliance between the OSS and the NKVD (the Soviet secret service), in which they would establish missions in each other’s capitals [which they secretly have established today]. This exchange of missions did not take place . . . Yet until long after FDR reluctantly directed that the exchange not take place “for the time being,” Donovan sent the NKVD large quantities of U.S. intelligence about

Germany along with technical devices such as microfilm, cameras, readers
and printers.” {25} [Emphasis added]
This Papal Knight, the man who murdered General George Patton, the man who gave high technology to the KGB further enslaving the Russian people, the man who betrayed us Americans in constantly plotting with the dastardly, Papalized Irish American Jesuit of mind and heart – Francis Cardinal Spellman – was rewarded for his loyalty to the Jew-hating, Antichrist in Caesar’s Vatican Palace:
“Donovan toward the end of his life, covered with honors already, visited Pope Pius XII to receive the Medal of St. Sylvester, the Vatican’s highest award for a lifetime of public and secret services to the [hierarchical] Catholic Church.” {26} [Emphasis added]
Dear truth-seeker, could the “lifetime of secret services to the [hierarchical] Catholic Church,” overseen and controlled by the Society of Jesus, include the founding of the American OSS and merging it with the Soviet NKVD, thereby aiding in the creation of Rome’s International Intelligence Community — the Holy Office of the Inquisition? If “Communist Russia” is truly an enemy of the Vatican’s Jesuits, why was Donovan given the Pope’s highest honor?
The policy of cooperation between these two agencies continued throughout the Cold War. For it was the traitor, “the mole,” the chief of counterintelligence, the Knight of Malta and “Cold Warrior” who manned the CIA’s “Vatican Desk” and “Israeli Desk” – James Jesus Angleton – who betrayed America’s loyal CIA agents into the hands of the KGB. Again, Anthony Cave Brown writes:
“Angleton . . . demonstrated his confidence in Golitsin by making available to him the CIA files on the personnel of the main operating section of the CIA in the Cold War with Russia, the thousand-odd men and women of the Soviet Division. He settled in an apartment in New York City, where he was permitted to receive and read the files. During this period perhaps three years – many of the personal and operational files were delivered to him . . . We’re talking about careers ruined, about mass resignations of counterintelligence people convinced that the CIA has been irrevocably penetrated by KGB pawns, about men we thought were our moles in Moscow — arrested and shot . . . [American patriot, is your blood boiling yet? In the name of Jesus Christ don’t ever give up your Swords of Just Defense! We are going to need every gun and every round when fighting the forces of our coming fascist dictator as well as our savage and merciless foreign invaders! In the words of our great and gallant Southern noble and Protestant American hero, General George Patton, recorded by

his fellow battlefield commander, Harry H. Semmes, in his Portrait of Patton on pages 153 and 157: “I pray daily to do my duty, retain my self-confidence and accomplish my destiny. No one can live under the awful responsibility I have without Divine help . . . Any man who still has a weapon in his hand and who surrenders it is a coward. But he is worse than a coward; he is foolish. It is far better to fight it out and probably win than it is to surrender and surely starve [in North American concentration camps, especially the one million acre Death Camp in Alaska].”] Golitsin was evacuated suddenly to a farm in upstate New York. The files were sent to him there but he never returned them. . . . When this was discovered, an operation was undertaken to retrieve them and, according to a CIA officer involved, ‘two vans were required to return them to the Agency — two van loads of our most secret files in the possession of a Russian in the boonies somewhere north of Albany! You can imagine what the FBI thought when they were told about what had happened to some of the most secret files!’ ” {27} [Emphasis added]
Later, top CIA officials who dared to resist Angleton’s power were murdered. According to Anthony Cave Brown three of them were Eric Timm, Desmond Fitzgerald and member of the Order’s Opus Dei, Knight of Malta William Colby.
In conclusion, the Jesuit General controls both the CIA and the KGB through the American and Russian branches of the Knights of Malta. The American Knights, in control of Wall Street, financed the Bolshevik Revolution. Both the OSS and NKVD worked together during World War II and later, as the CIA and KGB, secretly continued to collaborate while destroying the world’s “heretics and liberals” during that hoax called “the Cold War.” This is why we should not be surprised to see the CIA agent, Lee Harvey Oswald, having been trained in the Russian language by the Office of Naval Intelligence while a U.S. Marine, pose as a communist defector to Russia when in fact he was under orders, unknowingly being set-up to be a “patsy” for the assassination of President Kennedy. We now understand why Lee Harvey Oswald, the Pope’s future human Protestant Lutheran sacrifice, could enter the Black Pope’s “Holy Roman” Soviet Empire, have an enjoyable time, and easily depart (being unheard of in those days) with his Russian wife, Marina Oswald, who was the niece of KGB Colonel Vasili Khritinin, who in turn was overseen by the British SIS/KGB Knight of Malta, Kim Philby, the bosom friend of the American CIA/KGB/Mossad Knight of Malta, James Jesus Angleton (the bosom friend of Nazi collaborator, David Ben Gurion), who in turn was the most devoted slave to his master in St. Patrick’s Cathedral, the “Archbishop of the Capital of the World” and “Prince of the Church,” Knight of Columbus Francis Cardinal Spellman, who in controlling FDR’s State Department and America’s New York Masonic Jewish leadership, prohibited the rescue of European Jewry from the Black Pope’s Nazi SS!

Jesuit Coadjutors Rasputin, Bishop Hermogen and Iliodor, 1905 #110 Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin, the demon-possessed, glassy-eyed, licentious, mad monk, came to Bishop Sergius, rector of the Theological Seminary of St. Petersburg in 1903, with a powerful letter of introduction from Chrysanthos, Archminandrite of the Orthodox Kazan eparchy within the Order’s stronghold of Siberia. Immediately well received, this “Caesar Borgia of Russia” was introduced into the court of Tzar Nicholas II and his German Empress, Alexandra – the darling of the Jesuits. Years later and for a job well done, the Order’s Masonic Joseph Stalin would restore the “Orthodox Papacy” in 1942 by appointing Sergius the first Patriarch of All Russia. All of Rasputin’s political enemies, including Prime Minister P. S. Stolypin, were removed or assassinated and by 1916, while the Tzar was away at the war front, Rasputin, in controlling the Empress, became the virtual ruler of Russia, abolishing the Russian Parliament (the Duma) and, in the name of the Tzar, promoting anti-Jewish laws and pogroms thereby igniting the Order’s Zionist Bolshevik Revolution. Both Rasputin and Stalin had a common mentor – Bishop Hermogen – the rector of Tiflis Theological Seminary at which several Jesuits were instructors. Iliodor, a typical Jesuit agitator of states, was the great promoter of this “man of God,” preaching to huge crowds about the mad monk’s life and powers while secretly playing the spy for his master, Hermogen. In 1916 Rasputin was rightly assassinated; later his body was exhumed and publicly burned. The Rasputin File, Edvard Radzinsky, (New York: Anchor Books, 2001).

Jesuit Rector and Students at the Order’s Russian College in Rome, 1979 #111 We are deeply sorrowful and at a loss for words in comprehending this great Russian tragedy of the Twentieth Century. Always an enemy of the Papacy, Orthodox Russia, both its Patriarch and Tzar, refused to recognize the supremacy of the Pope of Rome as the “Universal Bishop, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Servant of the Servants of God, Rector of the World upon Earth and Father of Princes and Kings.” Expelled by Tzars Peter the Great in 1723 and Alexander I in 1820, the Black Pope’s relentless Militia of Jesus continually agitated the people against its rulers while having infiltrated the Church hierarchy and the Court of each succeeding Monarch. This ceaseless war finally culminated in the Order’s violent and bloody overthrow of the Romanoff Dynasty with the success of its Bolshevik Revolution. In full control of both sides during the five-year Civil War ending in 1922, the Bolshevik Red Army emerged victorious over the betrayed, anti-Jew, White Russian Army. Upon that defeat the Company of Jesus was formally readmitted into Russia after over 100 years of suppression. In 1929 the Jesuits erected their Russian College in Rome for the training of Jesuit priests to rule the Black Pope’s U.S.S.R.

Walsh, the Jesuit who founded the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University and led the mission as “an expert” on the internal affairs of the Soviet Union, appointed Jesuit-trained Joseph Stalin as the Secretary of the Communist Party. During the 1930s, while Freemason Stalin was outraging the world with his Purges murdering millions of his own countrymen, the Order pretended to be the foe of the very communism it had created and perfected on its Reductions in Paraguay. The Society of Jesus launched the illusion of its “worldwide systematic warfare against the common enemy of Christianity and civilization,” all the while financing it through its Papal Knights on Wall Street manning the Federal Reserve Bank and the Chase Manhattan Bank. After the Second Thirty Years’ War, in following the footsteps of Charles Coughlin, the ex-Basilian (secret Jesuit) priest – christened “the father of hate radio” while leading a church near the Jesuit Order’s University of Detroit – Francis Cardinal Spellman would continue to campaign against “godless Jew communism” throughout the Black Pope’s Cold War during which the Inquisition’s secret International Intelligence Community was financed, perfected and subordinated to the Papal Caesar in Rome.

For a time all trade between the United States and Soviet Russia passed through his hands. Working with the Jesuits’ Irish “Episcopalian” Roman Catholic Henry Ford (who circulated the Jew-hating Protocols of Zion and whose son, Henry Ford II, formally converted to Catholicism upon his marriage into the McDonnell family), Fordson tractors were brought into Russia as early as 1923. As the head of Occidental Petroleum, he freely entered and exited the Black Pope’s Russian police state whenever he wished. He greatly contributed to the Jesuit-authored illusion that international communism was Jewish, making Jesuit-controlled Bernhardt Stempfle’s Mein Kampf believable, justifying Hitler’s “Final Solution to the Jewish Question” first introduced in 1880 by the Order’s Professor Heinrich von Treitschke. Speaking fluent Russian, Hammer was up close and personal with every Soviet leader from Lenin to Gorbachev, greatly building the Empire’s commerce evidenced by his “Hammer House,” the international trade center and hotel, financed by the Jesuit Order’s Chase Manhattan and Bank of America, built in the heart of Moscow. He also helped to finance the creation of Zionist Israel, its Masonic leaders secretly aiding the Jesuit Order as it continually strains every nerve to bring the world to its knees in worship of the risen Papal Antichrist from Solomon’s rebuilt Temple in Israel’s beloved Jerusalem.

O’Brien, James G. Fair, John W. Mackay and James C. Flood who willed his gorgeous mansion in Menlo Park, California to the Jesuits’ Order of the Sacred Heart of Jesus) . . . Its richest bank (Nevada Bank) is in their hands, and so are all the street railways . . . Their compact unity, in the hands of the Jesuits (who swim in a golden sea), with their enormous wealth, make them almost supreme masters of the mines of California and Nevada.” {4}

and Nazism] bought, syndicated, and featured in his Sunday papers essays by Benito Mussolini, the former journalist who was now the Italian premier [whose confessor was a Jesuit] . . . and German political leaders, among them . . . Herman Goering, [Knight of Malta] Franz von Papen, and [the Jesuit-controlled] Adolf Hitler.” {5}
David Nasaw, 2000 American
Historian The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst
The Jesuits were now supreme in Washington, D.C. They had assassinated Lincoln on “Good Friday” with the help of their Freemasons, Andrew Johnson and Edwin Stanton while “brother” Booth escaped the city with a password. They employed the finest attorneys for the defense of the arch-villain, John H. Surratt, the obedient son of Jesuit Bernard F. Wiget. Through Jesuit influence the jury was hung, thus unable to convict Surratt and ultimately the murderer went free. The same Jesuit machine that aided Surratt, assassinated Garfield and McKinley. We read:
“ . . . the aid that this young traitor received from the priests in Washington, Canada, England and Italy was sufficient to have held them as actual conspirators and to have brought them to justice by hanging them on the same scaffold with their dupes. Had this been done, it might have saved the assassination of the other Presidents of this Republic, Garfield and McKinley!” {6}
The plan of the Jesuits for their new American Empire was to make it the instrument of vengeance on the European and Asian nations that had expelled them while subordinating every country to the Temporal Power (earthly rule) of their “infallible” Papal Caesar in Rome. At the same time, the Jesuits would destroy the historic Protestantism of Washington’s Republic pursuant to the Council of Trent. And how would the Jesuits do this in a country that was still predominantly Protestant and Baptist, whose inhabitants were of the White Celtic-Anglo-Saxon Race enjoying the Bill of Rights and well armed with an Authorized King James Version of the Bible in one hand and a gun in the other? The Jesuits would gain control of every State government as well as the National Government, and then pass legislation to further their nefarious ends. To do this the foreign and naturalized Roman Catholic populations, enjoying the communist maxim of universal suffrage since the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment since 1870, must be increased through immigration and then manipulated to vote “en masse” for the candidates whom the Hierarchy endorsed. This would be done for the benefit of the Pope, his Hierarchy and his Jesuit Order, not the lowly Catholic priests or people.
The Jesuits – 1880 - 1913



Chapter 33 419
While in the process of this great scheme they would use the U.S. Constitution to protect every piece of Roman Catholic Church property in America as a result of the treaty settling the Spanish-American War of 1898. We read from Black’s Law Dictionary, Fifth Edition:
“Roman Catholic Church. The juristic personality of the Roman Catholic Church, with the right to sue and to take and hold property . . . It was formally recognized between Spain and the Papacy and by Spanish laws from the beginning of the settlements in the Indies, also by our Treaty with Spain in 1898, whereby its property rights were solemnly safeguarded.” {7}
Concerning immigration, this is precisely what the Jesuits did. We read:
“Big Catholic population gains were made between 1881 and 1890, when 1,250,000 Catholic immigrants reached American shores. In 1890 there were nearly 9 million Catholics in the United States. From 1891 to the close of the century another 1,225,000 arrived and the total Catholic population grew to 12,041,000. From 1901 through 1910 the number of Catholic new comers was almost 2,320,000 and the total Catholic population leaped to 16,336,000. In a brief two-decade period the Roman Catholic numbers had been increased by more than 7.3 million.” {8}
Upon arriving in the American Empire, the Roman Catholics were used by the priests to control the elections. One of our heroes, Jeremiah Crowley, quotes “The Catholic World” in 1912:
“The Roman Catholic is to wield his vote for the purpose of securing Catholic ascendancy in this country. All legislation must be governed by the will of God unerringly indicated by the Pope. Education must be controlled . . . and the utterances of the press are included . . . ” {9}
This means that within thirty years, from 1880 to 1910, the Catholic population had doubled, thereby enabling the Jesuits to further control the powerful political machines of both parties using their junior Jesuits, the Knights of Columbus, along with the Mafia and their dupes — the Roman Catholic people. The control of Tammany Hall in New York City is but one example. In the works of Col. L. Fletcher Prouty portrayed in Oliver Stone’s great movie JFK, Director’s Cut,
“Politics is power, nothing more!” {10}
About this time during the years of 1900 to 1910, the American Protestants became alerted to this great conspiracy and warned both Catholics and Protestants of past and present Jesuit intrigues. The Protestant minister, B. C. Oggel, declared in a series of Middle West Meetings:
The Jesuits – 1880 - 1913



420 Vatican Assassins
“I would remind you of Webster’s definition of a Jesuit: a designer, an intriguer. If the Church of Rome prevailed, the Pope would be the Universal King . . . The Jesuits are here to plot and scheme and, if possible, take from us the noble heritage of our civil and religious freedom. The rules of the Jesuit Order justify theft, licentiousness, lying, false-witness bearing, suicide and the murder of parents and other relatives. The greatest crimes in history committed against individuals and nations have been committed by the Jesuits . . . Wherever Jesuits are they have the torch to burn, the sword to slay, the inquisition to torture. They are the enemies of [Bible-believing] Christianity. They live for conquest, fortune and glory.” {11} [Emphasis added]
To oppose the spreading of the truth about the Jesuit Order and Rome’s quest to destroy America’s Protestant liberties, the Jesuits used Thomas Sherman, the son of that disgrace to the art of arms, General Sherman whose wife was a most devoted Roman Catholic. Thomas Sherman, the Jesuit, defined the purpose of the Society with one breath and then defended it with the next, while condemning the ex-priests who were exposing Rome’s true colors. We read:
“It was Ignatius who conceived the daring plan of forging the weapon to beat back the Reformation . . . He organized an Order expressly to fight and down Protestantism. He considered all outside the Church as doctrinally his enemies and so do we now . . . I have been for thirty years under the influence of the Jesuits . . . and that to condemn the Order of Jesus is not only to condemn progress and thought and culture and virtue, and all that is sweet and beautiful [???], but to condemn Jesus Christ Himself [the Pope], with whom and for whom the Jesuit is crucified . . . These ex-priests are anarchists of the worst stamp. They appeal to free speech. If free speech means the right to debauch the minds of women and children at pleasure [by telling the truth about the confessional and private lives of the priests], then I, for one, say better free bullets than free speech.” {12} [Emphasis added]
Priest Thomas Sherman, the Jesuit deceiver, was the contemporary of two of our heroes, the ex-priests Charles Chiniquy and Jeremiah Crowley. He never faced them! Ultimately, his lies and bad conscience drove him to an attempted suicide. Confined in the Milwaukee sanatorium he wrote these most pitiful words to his Jesuit Provincial master:
“I have not the faintest gleam of any hope of salvation since July 30, 1911 . . . Repeated confessions but no peace. Have said the Mass the last few weeks, an agony to drag myself to the altar. No hope whatever of eternal salvation — continual effort to choke back blasphemies against

God. Blind obedience has brought no amelioration. I will have no instant of peace in time as in eternity. Of this I am most positive. Still my vows press on me and I will continue to obey blindly [the blind obedience mandated by the Fourth Vow] . . .
In utter despair, T. Sherman
P.S. In 1910 no general confession. Afraid to face my conscience.” {13} [Emphasis added]
Meanwhile, with the immigrants came the Italian Mafia, subordinate of course to the Jesuit Order. The Mafia would first be used to oppress the Catholic populations of the large Northern cities, forbidding the people to settle in Protestant communities or allowing their children to attend the Bible-reading public schools. The Mafia would control crime in an organized fashion, establishing monopolies in the traffic of liquor, prostitution, gambling, pornography and drugs, further enriching the coffers of Rome. Later, in accumulating wealth and power, it would be used politically for controlling both the Republican and Democratic parties to the extent of high-level assassination. Amazingly, the Jesuits would be so bold as to use their Mafia in conjunction with the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) during World War II. We read from The Luciano Project:
“Not only did Lucky Luciano and his Mafia associates help the Navy protect New York Harbor from espionage, sabotage, and labor strife; their influence reached across the Atlantic Ocean to the port cities of Sicily and Italy during the critical invasions of Hitler’s Mediterranean frontier . . . [The story] was kept secret for twenty-three years, with a cast of hundreds of naval officers, Mafia grandees, and racketeers, judges, district attorneys, corrections officers and parole personnel, not to mention secret agents of all services, working from Great Meadow Prison to the front lines of the Italian campaign.” {14}
The Jesuits would also use their Mafia soldiers alongside the agents of the OSS in World War II, remembering that the head of the OSS was an Irish Roman Catholic whose brother, Vincent Donovan, was a Dominican priest. We read:
“During World War II, William Donovan, chief of U.S. Intelligence (OSS), decided that a “corps of skilled safecrackers, housebreakers and assassins” could further the war effort. Donovan secured the best – Mafia boss: Charles “Lucky” Luciano – who used his influence to protect Mafia infested American docks from Axis sabotage. In return, Luciano was granted a commutation of a long prison sentence [convicted of compulsory prostitution], and was deported to Italy in 1946.” {15}

(Dear truth-seeker, the collaboration between the Mafia and OSS is important to grasp, enabling us to understand the Mafia/CIA assassination of President Kennedy.)
In returning to the 1880s, the Jesuits, with the plan of “making America dominantly Catholic,” through immigration and control of politics, needed more than the Mafia, Shriner Freemasonry (including the “Royal Order of Jesters” to which actor John Wayne belonged) and Rothschild’s Illuminati. They needed a new domestic order to further control Fourteenth Amendment America’s political power and financial might. This new order would also pretend to be the enemy of the Jesuits’ old war-horse, Shriner Freemasonry, creating further agitations between unsuspecting Catholics and Protestants. So in 1882, one year after the Garfield assassination, an organization was born, having derived its name from a Spanish Jew, who was a notorious slaver and pirate. Of the Knights of Columbus we read:
“The Knights of Columbus, founded at New Haven, Connecticut, February 2, 1882, by Rev. Michael J. McGivney, curate of St. Mary’s Church . . . had on January 1, 1905 a total membership of 127,206 persons . . . they are now (1912) said to be over 300,000 strong . . . an adroit feature of this organization, to which Roman Catholics only are eligible, is the initiative service of four degrees . . . they work in collusion with the Hierarchy, and are heart and soul in politics. This fact is well known to political machines and non-Catholic politicians, whose candidates must receive the approval of Rome and the Knights before they dare nominate them for either dog pound or presidency. The Knights of Columbus’ . . . principal business is politics, aye, Jesuitical politics. . . . ” {16} [Emphasis added]
And to what end are the Knights of Columbus and their Jesuitical politics bringing us? Remembering that both President Kennedy and his killer, Francis Cardinal Spellman, were both members of the Order, could it be the erecting of a fascist tyranny? Is not one of the symbols used within the emblem of the Knights of Columbus a fascis, it being a bundle of rods bound together about an axe with the blade projecting? Is not that most sinister symbol (like the Company’s Masonic swastika of Bavaria’s upper crust Thule Society (the swastika having been adopted by a Jesuit “missionary” to India, Robert di’ Nobili, in 1605 while attempting to win to the Order the ruling-class Brahmans) its chief architect having been Baron Rudolf von Sebottendorff who had been born in the Order’s Silesia and raised by a Roman Catholic Austrian noble while in Turkey) promoting the raw, unrestrained and centralized power of the Black Pope’s Roman Papal Caesar, prominently displayed at the front of the chamber of the Senate of the Order’s “Holy Roman” Fourteenth Amendment American Empire? The end to which these oath-bound soldiers of a foreign power are working can only be the destruction of popular liberty, so condemned by the Jesuits’ Council of Trent, while submitting the American Empire to the absolute Temporal Power of the Pope. Written in 1924, we read:
The Jesuits – 1880 - 1913



Chapter 33 423
“The process of destruction has gone on steadily from the assassination of the five presidents in the United States, (Harrison, Taylor, Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley), which began in 1841 and has continued at intervals, and which finds us without a semblance of a free press. After sixty years of activity by these foreign enemies within our borders what do we find? We find subversion of free speech; a subversion of a free press; we find a denial of the right of the American people to peaceable assemblage. . . . And by whom is this concerted plan of destruction being carried on, principally? By the priests and lay members of the Roman Catholic Church. . . . During the Wilson administration, the Army, the Navy, the Treasury, the Secret Service, the Post Office, the Emergency Fleet, Transports, Printing, Aircraft and dozens of others were presided over by the Fourth Degree Knights of Columbus! The PLUNDERS of Hog Island and the Emergency Fleet under E. N. Hurley are matters of Congressional Record, which mounted up into the millions. Mr. Hurley is a Roman Catholic and Knight of Columbus. The “Aircraft Scandal” under the supervision of John M. Ryan, an ardent Roman Catholic and Fourth Degree Knight of Columbus, ran into the billions and was also subject to investigation . . . One of the aims of the Knights of Columbus is to restore the Temporal Power of the Pope.” {17} [Emphases added]
(We may also add that the apostate Protestants and Freemasons, FDR and J. Edgar Hoover, held public offices during the administration of another notorious American traitor and apostate Presbyterian, President Woodrow Wilson (1913-1921) who was later poisoned, having died of so-called “apoplexy,” for a job well done.)
As we can see, the Jesuits, with their Roman Hierarchy and Knights of Columbus, owe allegiance only to the Pope as he obeys their Jesuit General. They intend to submit every human government to the earthly rule or Temporal Power of the Pope. David S. Phelan, a priest in St. Louis, wrote in 1913:
“Tell us we are Catholics first and Americans or Englishmen afterwards; of course we are. Tell us, in the conflict between the church and the civil government we take the side of the church; of course we do. Why if the Government of the United States were at war with the church, we would say tomorrow, To Hell with the government of the United States; and if the Church and all the governments of the world were at war, we would say: — To Hell with all the governments of the world . . . Why is it the Pope has such tremendous power? Why the Pope is the ruler of the World. All the emperors, all the kings, all the princes, all the presidents of the world are as these altar boys of mine.” {18} [Emphasis added]
The Jesuits – 1880 - 1913



424 Vatican Assassins
Our benevolent “Father” Phelan’s opinion is in complete agreement with the settled doctrines of Rome espoused by their “Angelic Doctor,” Thomas Aquinas:
“The Pope, by Divine Right, hath spiritual and Temporal Power, as supreme King of the World . . . ” {19} [for] “ . . . the Pope of Rome, as the Head of the Papal Government, claims absolute sovereignty and supremacy over all the governments of the earth.” {20}
And in subordinating the United States to the Temporal Power of Rome’s Papal Caesar, the Jesuits fully intend to destroy Protestantism. The ex-priest and one of our heroes, Jeremiah Crowley, quotes the same priest, David S. Phelan:
“Protestantism – We would draw and quarter it. We would impale it and hang it up for crow’s meat. We would tear it with pincers, and fire it with molten lead, and sink it in a hundred fathoms of hell-fire.” {21}
When Jeremiah Crowley was a priest in 1902 he asked Cardinal Martinelli that if the Catholics in this country numbered about seventy million and if the Protestants numbered about ten million, what would he do to the Protestants? He replied:
“Oh, Christ, I’d crush ‘em!” {22} [Emphasis added]
Rome’s attitude towards “heretics” has never changed even as the Jesuits and their Council of Trent have never changed! It is for this reason that the great Protestant preacher Isaac Lansing declared in 1890:
“I do not hesitate to say that, in all candor and reason, every Roman Catholic who confesses this allegiance to the Papacy, ought to be disfranchised in the United States, and forbidden the right to participate, as a citizen, in either holding an office or casting a ballot.” {23}
Having doubled the Catholic population of the American Empire from 1881 to 1910, having brought the Italian Mafia into the major cities to control the Catholic populations and organized crime, and having established the Knights of Columbus to implement “Jesuitical politics,” the Society of Jesus, in control of the Pope and his Hierarchy, had now subordinated the civil power of the American Congress to the Papal power — the will of the Black Pope. We read in 1894:
“Jesuits At Washington
The Romanism at Washington is of the Jesuit type. Jesuit Colleges, Jesuit Clubs, Jesuit Churches, Jesuits prominent in the judicial, legislative and departmental branches of the government, with Jesuit principles and methods protruding everywhere! It is more than likely that there is no

other capital city in the world having so many Jesuits. And yet the number does not run up into the hundreds for the order is not a large one in the world. The European capitals will not tolerate them. The German Parliament has just said that the Jesuits must stay out. Our own government extends to them a bid to strangle our national life and overthrow our hard earned and popular institutions . . . Several years ago when an important piece of legislation was before the House; which had been before the Country and generally approved, the press of all sections and the religious press as well (except the Roman Catholic papers) sustaining it; and which had in Congress the support of members of all parties, suddenly and unexpectedly, met, in vote a most disastrous defeat. ‘How is this to be accounted for?’ asked a member. His friend replied ‘I will show you,’ and taking his friend by the arm he led him on a tour of the lobby rooms of the House, and pointed out nine Jesuit Priests. Will this condition be continued indefinitely, and to the great detriment of the country, and the independence of National Legislation?” {24} [Emphasis added]
(Dear truth-seeker, as the Jesuits in control of Nazi Germany were behind the legislation requiring gun registration in 1935, even so their agents in Washington are busy attempting to destroy the Second Amendment in 2003. Senator Edward “Ted” Kennedy, a Knight of Columbus under the oath of the Fourth Degree and a trustee of the Order’s Boston College in Massachusetts, is one of their key tools.)
By 1912 Jeremiah Crowley writes:
“I know and assert without fear of successful contradiction that the Vatican system – the Roman Catholic Hierarchy – has a grip upon all the departments of our Government, from the President to Department Clerks, including Legislative, Judiciary and Executive Departments, both Federal and State — and the accommodating politicians, Catholic and non-Catholic, particularly the latter are to blame for it all.” {25}
The Jesuits in Crowley’s day controlled Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Taft and Wilson. And being in control of the Presidency, the Order could control the Supreme Court as the President has the power of appointment. The Supreme Court with its new, evil “federal question jurisdiction” could then on appeal reverse or uphold decisions of the fifty State Supreme Courts as well as the decisions of the ten federal Circuit Courts. The Court’s decisions would be pursuant to Rome’s plans for Fourteenth Amendment America which included the denial that the Bill of Rights were privileges of Fourteenth Amendment Citizenship, approving the replacement of the English Common Law procedure with the Roman Civil Law procedure in both State and Federal Courts, the abolition of segregation, the destruction of the

426 Vatican Assassins
Public School System through the forced integration of Whites and Blacks while abolishing Bible-reading and prayer, the forbidding of capital punishment, the legalization of abortion and voiding possible legislation targeted against the Jesuits just to name a few! Of this control of the Presidency and Supreme Court, Crowley writes:
“In case of an adverse decision in the lower Courts, through the influence of Rome, the case should be appealed, and, if needs be carried to the Supreme Court of the United States, over which Chief Justice White, a Jesuitical Roman Catholic, presides by the favor of President Taft [a Skull and Bones member since 1878].” {26} [Emphasis added]
Further, it was obvious to all that the nation’s most powerful Freemason, President William Taft, was intimate with the Hierarchy in America and sent his personal aide Major Archibald Butt – who, thanks to the Jesuits, went down on the Titanic made of substandard steel – to confer with the Pope in Rome. Taft was also the bosom friend of General Sherman’s son, the Jesuit, Thomas Sherman. Additionally, an English Jesuit and foremost advisor to King George V, Fr. Bernard Vaughan, converted Taft’s sister to Romanism.
And it was President Theodore Roosevelt, with his “Maltese Cross Ranch” in the Badlands of North Dakota, who branded American Protestants as “bigots” over their concern of Rome’s ascending power in Washington. He also began the continuing centralization of power in the presidency. One of his acts was the creation of the Bureau of Investigation:
“From the time of Theodore Roosevelt’s accession to the presidency, American presidents of the twentieth century had begun to assert unprecedented claims to centralize power in the executive office. As part of this new federalism, President Roosevelt’s Attorney General, Charles Bonaparte, by executive order had created the Bureau of Investigation in 1908 as a full-time investigative division of the Justice Department [America’s Holy Office of the Inquisition].” {27} [Emphasis added]
And by which Order and to what end is the control of the Legislative, Executive and Judicial branches of the federal government? Crowley tells us:
“Rome’s Jesuitical emissaries, agents and missionaries are everywhere. They have no conscience but the Pope’s dictation. They are allowed to assume whatever dress they please; for their better disguise, any occupations in church or state; they are in the highest and lowest conditions, and have been known to appear as active and zealous members in non-Catholic associations and churches — sometimes filling

prominent Protestant pulpits . . . Their object is to engender strife, to influence party spirit, to produce faction, to counsel rebellion, to plot and
plan assassinations.” {28} [Emphasis added]
Understanding both the control and plans of the Jesuit Order in Washington is imperative if we are to understand the Kennedy Assassination. For the Jesuits produced their Chief Justice Earl Warren to cover-up the assassination with his Warren Commission as well as defend the Knight of Malta, Clay L. Shaw during his trial in New Orleans, initiated by Jim Garrison. The Jesuits used President Johnson to appoint the Warren Commission and, with the Justice Department, used J. Edgar Hoover and his FBI to suppress evidence of a conspiracy. The Jesuits, with their agents in Congress, such as Thomas “Tip” O’Neill, did all they could to thwart the proceedings of the Assassinations Committee in 1976, which concluded there was a conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy thanks to Robert Groden, the author of High Treason.
The words of our hero, Charles Chiniquy, were now fulfilled. Jeremiah Crowley, America’s Martin Luther of the Twentieth Century, proved, without refutation, Rome’s control of both federal and state governments. But the warnings went unheeded. The Protestants, with their Jesuit-infested Federal Council of Churches, did nothing. The liberty-loving Americans – Protestants, Baptists, Jews and “liberal” Catholics – for the most part had forgotten they were truly in a holy war initiated by those ever-present warlords, the Sons of Loyola. Priest Isaac Hecker was right. Rome, controlled by the Jesuits, took the American government away from the American people in the early 1900s, and have kept it! Since that time the Jesuits have used the military and financial might of their Fourteenth Amendment “Holy Roman” American Empire as “the Sword of the Church,” to subordinate the nations of the world to the Temporal Power of the cannibalistic Papal Caesar. May God help us to repent that He may forgive us!!!
Of the year 1913 we ask in retrospect, “What would the Jesuits do now that they were in control of every President from Theodore Roosevelt to Woodrow Wilson?” They would further develop their American Empire patterned after their Reductions in Paraguay. In preparing for the Second Thirty Years’ War (1914-1945) they would create a national, inquisitional police force and implement two pillars of The Communist Manifesto. In 1908, the very year Rome declared the American Empire no longer to be a missionary country (it was now conquered), they founded the FBI. In 1913 they created their privately owned national bank, called “The Federal Reserve System,” established a “heavy progressive income tax” with the Sixteenth Amendment and created the IRS to collect it. Rome would now have a police state with its corporate monopolies while destroying the White Protestant Middle Class. Rome’s seeds of absolutist, Jesuit corporate fascism had been successfully planted.

In 1917, the Jesuits, contrary to Washington’s Farewell Address, brought Fourteenth Amendment America out of isolation – to be used like the nations of the Holy Alliance – to intervene in the affairs of foreign countries via military invasion in restoring and maintaining the Pope’s Temporal Power.
This would be the true purpose of the American Empire during World War I. President Woodrow Wilson, the apostate Protestant and self-confessed traitor, would be used to punish the Protestant German Empire. For Kaiser Wilhelm I and Prince Otto von Bismarck’s government of the Protestant Second Reich had banished the Jesuits in 1872 and, in 1907, threatened to immediately expel every Catholic priest from the Empire in retaliation for Pope Pius X’s “infallible” Decree, “Ne temere.” (That Decree, simply put, declared that any Catholic not married by a Roman Catholic priest was living in adultery and their children were bastards. Humiliated, the Pope modified the Decree so as to not apply to Germany!)
President Wilson would also be the tool in commencing Rome’s vengeance on Orthodox Russia. In aiding the Bolshevik Revolution, he would be used to punish Russia’s Romanoff Dynasty and Orthodox Church. The Jesuits’ new Russian Empire, called the “USSR” would be greatly expanded under the Order’s Grand Inquisitor, Joseph Stalin. For Tzar Alexander II, who maintained religious toleration for all creeds professed in his dominions, abolished Russia’s Concordat with Rome’s High Priest and King, the Papal Caesar (who practices cannibalism through the Bible-rejecting and Baal-worshipping doctrine of “Transubstantiation” when drinking the blood and eating the flesh of his false, dead and unbiblical “Christ” still hanging on the cross of his occultic Crucifix), and the leaders of the Orthodox Church had refused to attend the Vatican Council of 1870. In 1880 Dostoyevsky’s prophetic words warned of the power of the Jesuits in Russia. Again, we repeat his war cry:
“ . . . those are the worst of the Catholics, the Inquisitors, the Jesuits! . . . They are simply the Romish army for the earthly sovereignty of the world in the future, with the Pontiff of Rome for Emperor . . . that’s their ideal, but there’s no sort of mystery or lofty melancholy about it . . . its simple lust of power, of filthy earthly gain, of domination – something like a universal serfdom with them as masters – that’s all they stand for. They don’t even believe in God perhaps.” {29} [Emphasis added]
“Jesuits sue for the favor of the great and powerful. To obtain this, they decry faith in God, join in attacks on Rome, play the atheist or the infidel [as they would do in the Bolshevik Revolution].” {30} [Emphasis added]
The Jesuits were further enraged with the response of Tzar Nicholas II (who was influenced by the Patriarch of the Orthodox Church) to the Pope’s Decree, “Ne temere,” of 1907. Like Germany, Russia utterly condemned it. Crowley writes:
The Jesuits – 1880 - 1913



Chapter 33 429
“Why do not the rulers and governments of all non-Catholic countries step in to protect the rights of the people from such a dangerous and infamous invasion by the Pope of Rome, as did the government of Russia which recently prosecuted Bishop Casimir Ruszkiewiez, suffragan bishop to the Archbishop of Warsaw, and Father Cisplinski on the charge of declaring a legal marriage null, and thus infringing civil authority? The result was a sentence of sixteen months’ imprisonment for both priest and bishop. The term is to be passed in a fortress and the bishop is to be deposed from his diocese. Russia knows Rome and therefore nips her in the bud in order to prevent her gaining supremacy over civil authority.” {31} [Emphasis added]
Jeremiah J. Crowley then asked this very penetrating question:
“Why do not the Governments of the British Empire and the United States prosecute and punish according to law priests and prelates guilty of similar, and far worse, crimes?” {32}
The answer, Brother Crowley, is that in 1912, like today in 2003, the Jesuits controlled both Protestant Empires, Fourteenth Amendment America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain. The Jesuits, in turn, used these two Protestant Empires to punish Rome’s two greatest enemies, the Protestant German Empire and the Orthodox Russian Empire beginning with World War I.
The Great War, begun in 1914, would commence the punishment of both Germany and Russia for thirty years. The populations of both countries, especially Protestant East Germany, would suffer terribly under the Jesuit Inquisition of Russian Communism during “the Cold War,” heavily promoted by CIA Knights of Malta Henry R. Luce of Time Magazine and William F. Buckley, Jr. of National Review. That Cold War, properly understood to be Rome’s old “Inquisition” killing “heretics, liberals and pagans” on both sides while conducted by the Jesuit General’s International Intelligence Community, supposedly ended in 1989 with the fall of the Berlin Wall, the reunification of Germany and “the fall” of the “USSR.” Time will tell if the Company’s Cold War truly ended or if Russia is still our undying foe despite the illusion that President George W. Bush and President Vladimir Putin are temporary allies, as were Stalin and Hitler, in fighting the Black Pope’s “War on Terrorism!” Meanwhile, the shots that rang out at Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, four days after Pope Pius X had entered into a Concordat with Serbia to the astonishment of the Orthodox Serbian people, would begin the Jesuits’ Second Thirty Years’ War. And a deceived American and British populace, Protestant and Catholic alike, would unite to fight“ . . . the war to end all wars . . . against the [Lutheran] Hun . . . making the world safe for [Papal socialist corporate] democracy . . . ‘Over There’.”

Jesuit Thomas Ewing Sherman, 1856 – 1933 #115 General Sherman’s Son Jesuit Thomas Sherman was the son of that disgrace to the military art of arms, Federal General William Tecumseh Sherman, who, under the advisement of Jesuit Peter De Smet and with the blessing of Thaddeus Stevens, embarked on his murderous Crusade through the American South destroying the White Protestant civilizations of Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia pursuant to the wicked Council of Trent. Jesuit Sherman was a close personal friend of the Order’s Masonic American President Theodore “Rex” Roosevelt, serving as a Chaplin in the Spanish American War ignited by Masonic J. P. Morgan (1898) and, while at a dinner in honor of the Shermans (1906), was invited by Roosevelt to accompany a unit of U.S. cavalry to reenact General Sherman’s raping and thieving march to the sea. An outraged Protestant Georgia forced the President to withdraw Jesuit Sherman’s military escort, thus ending his journey of infamy. Sherman became one of the Order’s most influential Jesuits of the Black Pope’s “Holy Roman” Fourteenth Amendment American Empire, hating two of our heroes, Charles Chiniquy and Jeremiah Crowley, who dared to expose the designs of the Papal Caesar’s Society of Jesus against the Calvinist Republic of our beloved Washington.

Before we begin to discover how the Jesuit Order converted their American Empire into a police state with Hoover’s FBI, we must first be reminded of its past commercial power with its ability to gather intelligence on virtually anyone. We read from the work of a great English Protestant, William Howitt, published in 1833:
“They entered into trade, and were scattered all over the world, wearing no outward appearance but that of merchants; yet keeping up a secret correspondence with one another, and with their General, and transmitting intelligence and wealth from all quarters of the globe . . . They evidently had formed the bold design of acquiring the spiritual and political sovereignty of the world . . . Let us imagine twenty thousand traders, dispersed over the world, from Japan to Brazil, from the Cape of Good Hope to the north, all correspondents of each other, all blindly subjected to one individual, and working for him alone;” {3} [Emphasis added]
The Jesuits – 1908



Chapter 34 433
So here was the international Order of the Society of Jesus conducting worldwide trade while gathering intelligence at every port. All information was then sent to the General in Rome where massive files were kept on everyone and everything. Eugene Sue, the world-renowned author of The Wandering Jew, tells us in 1844 of the Black Pope’s International Intelligence Community yet in its infancy in comparison to the monstrosity it would become in the bloody Twentieth Century. In quoting Letters on the Clergy written by Libri, a member of the French Institute, we read in bold type of this subtle serpent’s most ghastly description:
“The principal houses correspond with that in Paris; they are also in direct communication with the General, who resides at Rome. The correspondence of the Jesuits, so active, various, and organized in so wonderful a manner, has for its object to supply the heads with all the information they can require. Every day, the General receives a host of reports, which serve to check one another. In the central house, at Rome, are immense registers, in which are inscribed the names of all the Jesuits, of their adherents, and of all the considerable persons, whether friends or enemies, with whom they have any connection. In these registers are reported, without alteration, hatred or passion, the facts relating to the life of each individual. It is the most gigantic biographical collection that has ever been formed. The frailties of a woman, the secret errors of the statesman, are chronicled in this book with the same cold impartiality. Drawn up for the purpose of being useful, these biographies are necessarily exact. When the Jesuits wish to influence an individual, they have but to turn to this book, and they know immediately his life, his character, his parts, his faults, his projects, his family, his friends, his most sacred ties. Conceive, what a superior facility of action this immense police-register, which includes the whole world, must give to any one society! It is not lightly that I speak of these registers; I have my facts from a person who has seen this collection, and who is perfectly well acquainted with the Jesuits. Here, then is matter to reflect on for all those families, who admit freely into their houses the members of a community that carries its biographical researches to such a point.” {4} [Emphasis added]
(Dear truth-seeker, we wonder how many Jesuits man the Black Pope’s Federal Bureau of Investigation, how many work for the Attorney General’s inquisitional Justice Department, and how many labor deep within the intricate apparatus of the Central Intelligence Agency, including its secret worldwide underground facilities, and its gigantic partner employing 25,000 people, the National Security Agency!)

An article, nearly identical to the narration of Eugene Sue, appeared in “Harper’s Weekly” of May 21, 1870. We read of the Jesuit command post in Rome:
“The operations of this powerful Society embrace every part of the world, and are carried on by means of the most intricate machinery ever contrived by man. The Society is divided in five classes:
1. Professed [Fathers]Members (Professi) [priests who have taken the three perpetual vows and the deadly Jesuit Extreme Oath of the perpetual Fourth Vow administered by the Jesuit General himself] 2. Spiritual Coadjutors [priests of the perpetual three vows] 3. Lay [Temporal] Coadjutors [lay brothers of three perpetual vows] 4. Approved Pupils [Juniors and Scholastics of three perpetual vows] 5. The Novices [training, concluded by taking three perpetual vows]
From his Residence in Rome the General directs the movements of the Society in every part of the world by means of a system in which the art of ‘espionage’ is brought to perfection. Every month or every quarter he receives reports from the heads of all the subordinate departments; and every third year the catalogues of every province, with detailed reports on the capacity and conduct of every member, are laid before him. Besides this, the most active correspondence is maintained with all parts of the world, in order to supply the Offices of the Society with the information they require. In the central house at Rome are kept voluminous registers, in which are inscribed the names of all Jesuits, of their adherents, and of all the considerable persons, whether friends or enemies, with whom they have any connection. In these registers, we are told, are reported without alteration, without hatred, without passion, the facts relating to the life of each individual. It is the most gigantic biographical collection that has ever been formed. The frailties of a woman, the secret errors of a statesman, are chronicled in these books with the same cold impartiality. Drawn up for the purpose of being useful, these biographies are necessarily exact. When the Jesuits wish to influence an individual, they have but to turn to these volumes to know immediately, his life, his character, his faults, his family, his friends, his most secret ties. By the use of such machinery the Order has attained its high position and widespread influence.” {5} [Emphasis added]
As we can see, by the beginning of the Twentieth Century the Jesuit Order had this all-pervading power of intelligence. To know everything about everyone was one of its chief goals. We must remember that the Jesuits had been in control of England no later than 1800 during the reign of King George III. Over the years, with the aid

Chapter 34
of the Knights of Malta and Shriner Freemasonry their power became supreme and was therefore in control of the British Secret Service. We must also remember that the Jesuits were in control of the Vatican with its Hierarchy since their restoration by Pope Pius VII in 1814. That means all correspondence of every priest, bishop, archbishop and cardinal from around the world was subject to Jesuit review. Even the Pope’s confessor was and is today a Jesuit. Nino Lo Bello tells us:
“The Pope’s confessor, an ordinary priest, must be a Jesuit: he must visit the Vatican once a week at a fixed time, and he alone may absolve the Pope of his sins. [How can an unsaved man commit daily acts of sin who at the same time is “infallible” when speaking “ex cathedra” for a brief moment of time while decreeing the doctrine of the Papal Institution?]” {6}
But how would the Jesuits expand their police registry, lists and indexes on individuals, into the United States? They would use the Bonapartes once again. For as the Freemason Napoleon I was their tool during the Napoleonic Wars, and his nephew, Napoleon III was their tool during the Crimean War and the Franco-Prussian War, even so was Charles Joseph Bonaparte their tool in creating the Bureau of Investigation. Bonaparte, a Masonic Papal Knight and grandnephew of the Emperor, created what became the Federal Bureau of Investigation — the Empire’s “Holy Office of the Inquisition.” It was made subject to the Empire’s “Grand Inquisitor,” the Attorney General and his Department of Justice (to be later manned in 1984 by Jesuits like U.S. Attorney John MacCoon) newly established in 1870. The Empire’s “Grand Inquisitor” was set up in the middle of a national crises called “the Reconstruction” (1865-1876) – during martial law including the rape, pillage and plunder of the Southern people by Northern soldiers and carpetbaggers two years after the forced ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868.
Dear truth-seeker, the Empire’s “Holy Office of the Inquisition,” the FBI, would experience massive growth during the Jesuits’ Second Thirty Years’ War under the all-seeing eye of its Shriner Freemason, J. Edgar Hoover. Hoover would recruit most of his Roman Catholic inquisitors from Jesuit Universities. We read:
“So Catholics were ultimately preferred. Hoover reportedly favored Irish Catholic youths, finding them generally clean-cut and good-looking and earnest about their religion. He actively sought them out and later, after Notre Dame and Marquette [Jesuit] granted him honorary degrees, recruited heavily at those universities.” {7}
Despite the Constitution, Bonaparte’s Bureau would come to exercise truly inquisitional powers not only domestically but also around the world. The FBI would keep the Jesuit registry of police indexes on individuals within the American Empire and would be a vital link in the Jesuits’ International Intelligence Community
The Jesuits – 1908

based in Rome within the Jesuit General’s “War Room” — Borgo di Santo Spirito. Concerning the creation of the FBI, including its founder, Charles Bonaparte, we read from Curt Gentry’s masterpiece:
“It had, for starters, been born illegitimately, on July 1, 1908. It was, as one congressman had correctly labeled it at the time, a ‘bureaucratic bastard,’ the issue of a union unsanctioned by the Congress of the United States. However, its father was known. He was Charles Joseph Bonaparte, American-born grandnephew of Napoleon I, and attorney general of the United States from 1906 to 1908.” {8} [Emphasis added]
From The Boss we read:
“From the time of Theodore Roosevelt’s accession to the presidency, American presidents of the twentieth century had begun to assert unprecedented claims to centralize power in the executive office. As part of this new federalism, President Roosevelt’s attorney general, Charles Bonaparte, by executive order had created the Bureau of Investigation in 1908 [an all-male secret society] as a full time investigative division of the Justice Department [against the expressed wishes of Congress and while it had gone into recess!].” {9} [Emphasis added]
(Dear truth-seeker, in reflecting upon the last two quotes, do you “smell a rat” in the creation of the FBI? Should we not demand that it be abolished immediately?)
The Bureau was established to “detect and prosecute crime against the United States.” So the Jesuits – the masters of socialist-communism and authors of the Bolshevik Revolution – created “the straw dog” called “the Red Scare” and then empowered their American Cheka to shoot it down. The Bureau, in one of their mass roundups in 1918, arrested fifty thousand ordinary American citizens!
In 1921, J. Edgar Hoover was appointed assistant Chief of the Bureau; in 1924 he was appointed Acting Director and in 1935, the Bureau became “the FBI.” Until his murder in 1972, Hoover was a virtual dictator for nearly fifty years as the Bureau had been patterned after the monarchial government of the Jesuit Order. For Hoover, like the Jesuit General, wielded the power of an absolute monarch.
During the years of World War II, the FBI grew enormously in power and influence under the supervision of the Empire’s most formidable Freemasons, J. Edgar Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt. Both were apostate Protestants as neither accepted the Bible as their final authority of faith and practice. This gave the appearance that American tyranny was Protestant! We must not forget that Charles

Bonaparte – a Freemason (whose father, Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte (1784-1860), in addition to being a high-level French Freemason, had been an officer on the staff of the Jesuits’ Napoleon III) – created the Bureau that would enthrone Hoover the Inquisitor; and Joe Kennedy – one of Archbishop Hayes’ Knights of Malta – would be responsible for the election of FDR. As always, the Freemasons are in the foreground while the Jesuits and their Knights of Malta are in the background.
Like the Jesuit “police index” in Rome, Hoover established indexes and lists on thousands of individuals illegally, investigating their private lives without authorization from the Department of Justice. That is an Inquisition! Hoover also compiled other lists anticipating the erection of Concentration Camps. We read:
“Hoover had also – on his own initiative and without any statutory authority – set up a Custodial Detention list, of persons to be rounded up and imprisoned in concentration camps, should the need arise. The list included . . . journalists critical of the administration, writers critical of the FBI, and certain members of Congress.” {10}
Hoover, like his Nazi counterpart Himmler, hated the Jews. He resisted Jewish immigration and blamed notorious crimes of the Jesuits on the Jews. For example, Emma Goldman was blamed and deported for inspiring President McKinley’s assassination and the Rosenbergs were convicted and electrocuted for giving Stalin nuclear secrets. The truth is the Jesuits murdered McKinley with one of their foreign born, fanatical Roman Catholic assassins and they used FDR to give Stalin “the nuclear device” in 1943. This treason, committed through the Company’s International Intelligence Community (the OSS and NKVD), furthered the illusion of “the Cold War” and “the Communist threat.” Using the Jews as scapegoats is nothing new: we are familiar with the Dreyfus Affair and the Protocols of Zion.
Lastly, the FBI had a working relationship with the MID and ONI that would be perfected over the years. Of this beginning in 1939 we read:
“During Hoover’s meeting with Roosevelt and [Cordell] Hull, the president had ordered him to coordinate the FBI investigation with the Army’s Military Intelligence Division (MID) and the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). Roosevelt’s request simply formalized what was already an ongoing relationship . . . On June 26, 1939, Roosevelt sent a confidential presidential directive – drafted by the FBI and Justice Department officials – to the heads of the relevant departments stating, ‘It is my desire that the investigation of all espionage, counterespionage and sabotage matters be controlled and handled’ by the FBI, MID, and ONI, and that no investigation in these areas be conducted ‘except by the three agencies mentioned above.’ ” {11}

After the end of World War II a host of FBI agents resigned resulting in their replacement with many Jesuit-trained Roman Catholics. (Two such agents and Opus Dei members were Louis J. Freeh, FBI Director and tied to the Order’s British MI5 through its Director-General Stella Rimington, and Robert Philip Hanssen, “Counterintelligence” – whose idol was the traitor Kim Philby – and America’s most treasonous spy, tied to the Order’s KGB via Vladimir Kyruchkov.) We read:
“During the Bureau’s early years, there had been few Catholics in the upper echelons of the FBI, although there was an abundance of Masons. Although Hoover denied being prejudiced, not until the mid-1940s did the FBI begin recruiting agent applicants at Catholic universities such as Georgetown [Jesuit], Fordham [Jesuit], and Notre Dame. Two things were responsible for the change; the FBI director’s realization that the Catholic Church was strongly anti-Communist, and thus could be a valuable ally; and the need to replace the special agents who had defected en masse at the end of the war. [Why the defection?] In addition to soliciting Catholics as agents, informal liaison was developed with various church officials, such as Francis Cardinal Spellman*, Monsignor Fulton J. Sheen, and Father John F. Cronin. *The FBI maintained close ties with Spellman, largely through Lou Nichols and, later, the New York SAC John Malone, even though Hoover’s files contained numerous allegations that Spellman was a very active homosexual.” {12}
When Lou Nichols retired in 1957, the man who took his place as the head of Crime Records Division and therefore became the liaison between the FBI and Cardinal Spellman was Cartha DeLoach — a Knight of Malta! We read:
“ . . . Cartha DeLoach . . . succeeded Louis Nichols as head of the Crime
Records Division on the latter’s retirement from the Bureau in 1957.” {13}
The ties of the Jesuits with the FBI, and thus the KGB, are obvious. Through the Jesuit-trained “American Pope,” Cardinal Spellman, and the graduates of Jesuit Universities, the Order had intimate ties with Hoover. The Director not only hired graduates from the Jesuits’ Georgetown and Fordham Universities, he was given an honorary degree from the Jesuits’ Marquette University and maintained close ties with that powerful Jesuit and Georgetown University Dean, Edmund Walsh! And it was Walsh, “an expert” on international politics and the Soviet Union, who led a team of Jesuits into Russia in 1922 on a supposed “mission of relief.” Soon after Walsh’s arrival, the Jesuit-trained Joseph Stalin was appointed Secretary of the Communist Party and thus the head of the Order’s KGB, remaining so until the day the risen Son of God sovereignly intervened with a word from His lips and brought about the tyrant’s premature death. For Satan, in attempting to nullify the promises given to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and David, inspired Stalin in 1953 with “the Doctors’ case” to justify the attempted execution of every Jew in Russia!

Chapter 34 439
And because of the Jesuit control of the FBI, Hoover denied the existence of the Roman Catholic Italian Mafia. In fact, he consorted with New York Mob boss Frank Costello, the personal friend of Knight of Malta, Joe Kennedy. We read:
“There was no such thing as ‘organized crime’, Hoover insisted, no such thing as a ‘Mafia’, while the claim that there existed a ‘national crime syndicate’ was itself ‘baloney’ . . . ” {14}
There were theories as to “Why?” Many suspected the reason was personal.
“They concluded that J. Edgar Hoover himself was on the take, that he had reached an accommodation with the syndicate, and in particular with the New York crime boss Frank Costello . . .
According to one tale, Hoover and Costello met regularly on a bench in Central Park – hardly a secret meeting place – to discuss mutual interests . . . Other accounts had the pair socializing at the Waldorf, where both had complimentary suites, or, in most versions, at the Stork Club . . .
Like Hoover, Costello was a Stork Club regular, as were numerous other mob figures . . .
Yet there is no question they met or that they reached an accommodation, of sorts . . . and, Hoover, for his own still mysterious reasons, refused to admit that a national criminal organization existed.” {15} [Emphasis added]
The Jesuits, in control of the FBI through Hoover, and the Mafia through its “Commission” (one of its members being Frank Costello), were virtually unchallenged in 1946. In control of both the Government and Organized crime, the Jesuits would create the United Nations and the Cold War with their Masonic tools, “Dirty Harry” Truman and “Smokin’ Winston” Churchill. Why? To carry out the Jesuit Oath in fulfilling the Council of Trent, restoring the Temporal Power of the Pope around the world, and to create Zionist Israel, for the purpose of rebuilding Solomon’s Temple and the final attempted mass-murder of the Jewish Race. For if “the holy seed” (the physical descendants of the sons of Jacob, including the tribe of Manasseh, Ephraim being another name for the tribe of Joseph) can be destroyed

– Isaiah 9:7; Luke 1:32, 33 – Matthew 19:28
Israel’s Messiah is to rule all nations in a worldwide earthly kingdom bringing safety, peace and honor to his repentant Jewish people of whom He said,
“ . . . we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.”
– John 4:22
Knowing this, the Devil, with his “infallible” Pope using Zionism, is attempting to keep these unconditional promises of God, given to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and David, from being fulfilled in the future.
In conclusion, the Jesuits have been the great intelligence gatherers of the past and by 1870 had the largest intelligence apparatus in the world. In 1908, the Jesuits extended that apparatus into the United States with the creation of the BI through one of their Masonic Papal Knights, Charles Joseph Bonaparte. In order to give the impression that the BI, which later became the FBI, was not a Roman Catholic secret police, an apostate, homosexual, Presbyterian Protestant and Shriner Freemason was appointed as the Director for nearly fifty years. The Bureau exercised inquisitional powers from the beginning. Mass roundups, lists, secret Divisions, secret indexes, plans for concentration camps, etc., all betrayed the true colors of “the bureaucratic bastard.” It was the American secret police with powers as sweeping as Stalin’s NKVD that would later prove as ruthless as Hitler’s Gestapo. Without mercy, it would cunningly murder women and children of a Protestant religious sect in Waco, Texas, that was anti-Pope, as well as the wife and son of Randy Weaver, the Green Beret and Vietnam vet, while living peaceably in the backwoods of Idaho. (The FBI sharpshooter who murdered Vicki Weaver and repeatedly fired into the Branch Davidian Compound was a Japanese Roman Catholic and Papal Knight, Lon Horiuchi, whose subsequent superior was FBI Director, the Roman Catholic Papal Knight and member of Opus Dei, Louis J. Freeh. (Louis Freeh, working in conjunction with the Black Pope’s Israeli Mossad in planning for the demolition of the World Trade Center, further cemented the Bureau’s relationship with the Masonic Jewish Zionists’ Anti Defamation League by declaring that the FBI/ADL partnership had “reached new heights!”) The master of both Freeh and his Opus Dei brother, John Freeh, was the American Empire’s “Military Vicar” and the New York “Archbishop of the capital of the world,” John Cardinal O’Connor.)

Chapter 34 441
With the authority of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, advised by Archbishop Francis Spellman and the (Jesuit-controlled) priest, Charles E. Coughlin, Hoover’s FBI forged alliances with the Army’s Military Intelligence Division as well as the Office of Naval Intelligence. Openly the FBI denied the existence of the Mafia, secretly the Bureau and the Mob cooperated together pursuing their mutual interests. Later, the FBI/ONI would forge an alliance with Roman Catholic Luciano’s Italian Mafia. Irish Roman Catholic “Wild Bill” Donovan’s Office of Strategic Services would likewise collaborate with Luciano’s Mafia. During the War, the OSS would aid and abet – without presidential authority – Roman Catholic Stalin’s NKVD as well as establish a working relationship with Sir Stewart Menzies’ British Secret Service. After the War, the OSS would help in evacuating the Jesuit General’s Nazi SD, Waffen SS and Intelligence Group out of Europe via the Vatican Ratlines, simultaneously used by the Masonic Jewish Zionists in leading Europe’s surviving and unsuspecting Jews to Palestine, merging Hitler’s best with the CIA in the West and the KGB in the East.
By 1963, the International Intelligence Community was firmly in place. The CIA, FBI, ONI, MID, the Mafia, former Nazi SS within the CIA, the German BND, the British Secret Service, the Mossad and KGB were all working together just as they had throughout the Jesuits’ Second Thirty Years’ War (excluding the Mossad as there was no Israel at that time). And in the interest of continuing the American Crusade in Vietnam called “Spelly’s War,” Rome’s International Intelligence Community assassinated the Emperor of the “Holy Roman” American Empire, its Commander-in-Chief. The assassination was executed by anti-Communist warriors of the Cold War — certain and select American Knights of Malta collaborating with certain and select Shriner Freemasons specifically. These warriors were guided by the unseen hand of Francis Cardinal Spellman – the American Pope – as he had personal contact with every faction of the Intelligence Community including the KGB, and thus Fidel Castro’s Cuban Intelligence, through one of his Knights in the CIA, James Jesus Angleton. The Jesuits then successfully covered it up, killing over one hundred witnesses within a thirty-five year period.
Indeed, “the arm of the Church is long”; for, it is

Masonic Papal Knight Charles Joseph Bonaparte, 1851 – 1921 #118 United States Attorney General, 1906 - 1908 This sinister man was put in power by President Theodore Roosevelt, the Order’s most obedient Shriner Freemason and first real Emperor of the Black Pope’s “Holy Roman” Fourteenth Amendment American Empire. As an American-born French Roman Catholic, the grandnephew of the great Jesuit-controlled avenger, Napoleon I, and the son of Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte who was a Masonic officer on the staff of the Jesuits’ Napoleon III, this Attorney General created the Bureau of Investigation in 1908 on his own accord and against the expressed will of Congress, it fearing that “the bureaucratic bastard” would become a “spy system of espionage conducted by the National Government to dig up the private scandals of men.” The resultant FBI has become exactly that. Even worse, the “Order of the FBI” is nothing more than an extension of the Papal Caesar’s Holy Office of the Inquisition with all the powers of Hitler’s Gestapo or Stalin’s NKVD. The FBI would be perfected under the leadership of the Jesuits’ Shriner Freemason, J. Edgar Hoover, who constantly attacked the false enemy of “communism.” Later the FBI was used in the assassination of Knight of Columbus President John F. Kennedy and murderous cover-up overseen by the Bureau’s Assistant Director, Cardinal Spellman’s Knight of Malta, Cartha D. DeLoach. The FBI: A Comprehensive Reference Guide, Athan G.

Recruiting from the Jesuit institutions of Georgetown, Fordham and Marquette Universities, many Irish and Italian Roman Catholics filled the ranks of Hoover’s Federal Bureau of Investigation, including Ray Abbaticchio and his nephew, G. Gordon Liddy. As Hoover, Spellman, and CFR Press lord Henry R. Luce intrepidly mesmerized the mind of the duped American public in carrying out the Black Pope’s anti-Communist agitation, secret CFR connections forged between the Mafia and the CIA (admitted to by CIA agent, Army Intelligence Colonel and Gambino family member, the deceased Knight of Malta Albert Vincent Carone), as well as the FBI, ONI and Secret Service became absolute. The cooperation among these agencies overseen by Georgetown Jesuits and Cardinal Spellman’s Papal Knights would be necessary in carrying out the Kennedy Assassination. Further, each successive Archbishop of New York would continue to use the CFR’s Attorney General, with his Justice Department and “Order of the FBI,” in maintaining the Great Jesuit Cover-up through the years.

“There is no record in history of an association whose organization has stood for three hundred years unchanged and unaltered by all the assaults of men and time, and which has exercised such an immense influence over the destinies of mankind . . . ‘The ends justify the means,’ is his favorite maxim; and as his only end, as we have shewn, is the order, at its bidding the Jesuit is ready to commit any crime whatsoever.” {2}

From previous chapters we know the purpose of the Jesuit Order. But before we begin to peer into the abyss of the tragedy called “the Titanic,” involving the largest ocean liner of its time having been built to be treacherously sunk by the combined thunderbolts of the Olympic Jesuit Order, known to itself as “The Company of the Perfect,” we must review how these mind-controlled, soldiering, international Marine Corps of Loyola carry out their deeds of blood while under orders from their “Father General.”
“ ‘ I should regard myself as a dead body, without will or intelligence, as a little crucifix which is turned about unresistingly at the will of him who holds it, as a staff in the hands of an old man, who uses it as he requires it, and as it suits him best.’ ” {3}

offense.’ ” {4}

“The General possessed the secrets of every member . . . He knows the character, the inclinations of every member . . . He is made acquainted with the consciences of all who must obey him, particularly the provincials and others to whom he has intrusted functions of great importance . . . Every year, a list of the houses and members of the Society, the names, talents, virtues, failings of all are there recorded . . . ‘and [in the words of the General] we have men for martyrdom, if they be required.’ ” {5}
The year is 1909. The building of Titanic has begun at a shipyard in Belfast, the capital of Northern Ireland. Belfast is the Protestant haven of the Irish and is hated by the Jesuit Order. By 1912, nearly five hundred thousand Ulster Protestants would sign the Ulster Covenant pledging “to defeat the conspiracy to set up a Home Rule [Rome Rule] Parliament.” Ireland is still part of the British Empire but most of the Island will be severed from the British Crown as a result of the Jesuits’ World War I. The Panama Canal is in building and will be completed in time to begin its usefulness during “The Great War.” The Company’s planned destruction of the Protestant British Empire is at hand and will be completed by the end of the Jesuit General’s “Cold War.” The destruction of the Protestant German Empire, having courageously expelled Loyola’s Blackrobes, has already been put in motion with a secret treaty between the Order’s agents in France and Russia. The overthrow of the Orthodox Russian Empire has already begun, the Jesuits having provoked a war in 1905 using Emperor Meiji of Japan. The destruction of Imperial Japan is in the making as payback for the Emperor’s shogun expelling the Jesuit “missionaries” for over two hundred and fifty years. The atrocities of the Jesuits’ Bolshevik Revolution and subsequent Inquisition by Jesuit-trained Joseph Stalin will be blamed on the Jews, converting the Europeans into the unwitting tools of Rome’s Third Reich. The Jewish Holocaust will be used to justify Rome’s creation of the Zionist nation of Israel, paving the way for an even greater “burnt offering” of Jews, as the majority of these descendants of Jacob, due to worldwide anti-Jewish fury, are to be driven from the nations to one geographical location. The land of Palestine, being necessary to that end, England’s General Allenby will take Jerusalem from the Moslem Turks in 1917, enabling Solomon’s Temple to ultimately be rebuilt for the “infallible” Pope,
“ . . . the prince that shall come . . . ”
– Daniel 9:26
To finance this grand design, the Jesuits must put their privately owned “Federal Reserve Bank” in place before the war begins. That bank must be established in the greatest wealth-producing nation on earth composed of mostly White Anglo-Saxon Protestants and Baptists. Remembering that the Order has been expelled from Europe, having taken refuge in the Protestant American and British Empires, its Masonic tools are in place and ready to obediently execute the plan.

But there are those in government and high finance within both Empires who are not willing to participate. Their power and fortunes will not be used to this end. So, they must be ushered out of this world in a most terrifying way! Death by drowning, amidst the screams, yells, shrieks, wailing and weeping of helpless men, women and children floundering in the North Atlantic, the innocents will plunge ten thousand feet to their nightmarish doom!
Therefore, the White Star Line is created to bring the immigrant traffic – Irish, French and Italian Roman Catholics – into the United States pursuant to Rome’s plan of “making America dominantly Catholic.” But the deathship Titanic is built, in hated Protestant Belfast, to be sunk and will be used to entice three hundred and twenty-five of the world’s richest and finest to board “the unsinkable” man-made monster, loaded with an additional nineteen hundred Protestant and Catholic “animals.” With the first-class fare being fifty thousand Federal Reserve Notes by today’s standard, multi-millionaires board the ship, three of them Jewish Benjamin Guggenheim, Isidor Straus, the head of “Macy’s” department stores, and Freemason John Jacob Astor – a frequent passenger on the White Star line and the richest man in the world other than the Pope of Rome residing in Caesar’s Palace.
The Captain of the ship is Brother Edward J. Smith, S.J., the world’s greatest pilot and master of the North Atlantic waters, seasoned with twenty-six years on the high seas. Captain Smith is indeed one of the Black Pope’s unseen and unknown Temporal Coadjutors. This means he was not a priest but a “Jesuit of the short robe,” as the French would call him, serving the Order in his profession. He “without will or intelligence” will commit this crime – this shameless and heartless atrocity – at the will of his master who holds him “as a little crucifix” and “who uses him as it suits him best.” Edward Smith has been required for “martyrdom.”
Departing southern England from the port of Southampton at 12:00 noon on April 10, 1912, the Captain’s master had boarded. This man was the most powerful Jesuit in Ireland and answered directly to the Jesuit General, Francis Xavier Wernz. The Captain’s master was the Provincial-Superior of the Irish Province (which includes Australia) of the Society of Jesus, Francis M. Browne. The presence of Ireland’s most powerful man on board the ship was made publicly known in the video, Secrets of the Titanic, in its “Acknowledgments,” released in 1986.
The Jesuit Father Provincial (of which there are only ten for the American Empire) spent a day on the deathship taking pictures of the passengers, knowing full well their fate! After stopping at the French port in Cherbourg from which Astor boarded, the video, narrated by Hollywood actor (a pro-Bill Clinton activist and now aiding Janet Reno’s bid to be Florida’s next governor) Martin Sheen (who renamed himself after Bishop Fulton J. Sheen), another darling of the Jesuits having visited their former Novitiate of St. Isaac Jogues in Wernersville, Pennsylvania, reveals:
The Jesuits – 1912



Chapter 35
“A vacationing priest, Father Francis Browne caught these poignant snapshots of his fellow passengers, most of them on a voyage to eternity. The next day Titanic made her last stop, pausing off the coast of Queenstown, Ireland. Here tenders brought out the last passengers, mostly Irish immigrants headed for new homes in America. And here, the lucky Father Browne disembarked . . . Father Browne caught Captain Smith peering down from Titanic’s bridge poised on the brink of destiny . . . ” {6} [Emphasis added]
Ah, the final eye contact between Captain Smith and the Jesuit Provincial in the midst of doomed Irish Catholics boarding the steamer is indeed “a Kodak moment.” Remembering that according to Jesuit Pietro Alagona, “it is lawful to murder the innocent,” and according to Jesuit Luis de Molina, “Priests may kill the Laity to preserve their goods,” both of these criminals were fully persuaded in their brainwashed minds that they were righteous in their mayhem. This scene portrayed with the brush of a Rembrandt or a Thomas Kinkade, would serve as a crushing rebuke to any nation that would give the Sons of Loyola access to their shores.
For here is Jesuit treachery at its finest. Provincial Browne boards Titanic, photographs the victims, most assuredly briefs Captain Smith concerning his Oath as a Jesuit, and the following morning bids him farewell. He takes a snapshot of the somber Captain peering down from the bridge along with two crewmembers probably involved in the plot, as “the lucky” Provincial disembarks on the eleventh of April while the cheerful greetings of boarding Irishmen fall upon his ear but never reach his heart. Possibly, a little red-headed girl runs by and cries with eager optimism,
“Good morning, Father!”
A young man approaches and quietly asks:
“Will you hear my confession before I leave, Father?”
A man with his large family approaches and quietly asserts:
“You have been a good priest to us. We wish you well, Father Provincial.”
And lastly comes Danny, a little orphan boy named after the great Irish ballad, Londonderry Air, who slowly limps forward, tightly holding his mother’s hand. With tears in his eyes for the love of this priest who had been a father to him, he whimpers:
“Thank you for helping me. Good-bye, Father.”
Indeed it was Good-bye — forever! Little Danny would perish amidst the horrifying pandemonium of the locked down helpless innocents in Titanic’s lower decks!

Dear truth-seeker, if Francis Browne had been a man, his heart would be breaking! But he, like Rodin the Jesuit of The Wandering Jew, is one of “the Borg” of Star Trek, named after a past Jesuit General, Francis Borgia, as well as the General’s present headquarters being Borgo di Santo Spirito in Rome. He is a Jesuit of the Fourth Vow under Extreme Oath. He is a machine in a man’s body, the perfect Manchurian Candidate and one of the Commanders of The Engineer Corps of Hell. He would betray his own mother to further the worldwide political power of a tyrannical sinner who calls himself “the Vicar of Christ”!! So he goes through his religious motions and so passes by. As “Father” Browne watches Titanic disappear over the horizon with a fire below in bunker number 10, he has no regrets. He knows “the law of the Church” and, having no “fear of offense,” is convinced that this crime shall be “for the greater glory of God” — the god who sits in St. Peter’s Chair!
On board the ship, the Jesuit Captain Smith knows his duty. He is under Oath. There is no recanting. The ship has been built for the enemies of the Order. He, after three days at sea, with only one pair of glasses for the bridge, propels full steam ahead – twenty-two knots – on a moonless, dark night through a gigantic ice field, nearly eighty square miles in size, despite at least eight telegrams of warning as well as many other cautions. He refuses to listen. Hell-bent on destruction, upon approaching the iceberg, first officer Murdoch – another conspirator – has been instructed by the Captain what to do. He orders the engines to be thrown in reverse while swinging the ship sharply to the left, its starboard side. Had the captain not reversed his engines the Titanic would have turned much more quickly the greater the forward motion. This error was a violation of one of the cardinal rules of safety, which is to never turn a ship’s broadside to danger! (Are we to believe that Captain Smith, the master of his profession, would make such a basic blunder in addition to steaming full speed ahead through the up-and-coming icebergs that he had been warned about? Obviously, he wanted to break the ship in half! This is nothing more than a repeat of Napoleon’s performance at Waterloo deliberately sacrificing his army, and a preview of the violation of the most basic rules of security in Dallas, Texas in 1963 resulting in President Kennedy’s death.) Titanic grazes the iceberg at 11:40 PM, April fourteenth. Knowing full well the ship’s inadequate number of lifeboats and the crew having no boat assignments in case of an emergency evacuation, Captain Smith walks back to the radio room and instructs his officer to send a CQD; then later, an SOS. Smith, the Jesuit Coadjutor, has fulfilled his intended purpose in obedience to his Jesuit master, “Father” Jesuit Provincial Francis M. Browne, pursuant to the Jesuit Oath.
Amid the innocence of its passengers the brutal crew begins to evacuate the ship. But the Jewish multi-millionaires Astor, Guggenheim and Straus are forbidden to board a lifeboat. A few hours later in the midst of horror and panic, with the musicians playing the inspirational Protestant hymn of the Welsh people, Nearer My God To Thee, the Titanic splits in half, plunging to the bottom of the ocean along

with over fifteen hundred souls. Astor’s young second wife survives and the Jesuits most likely acquire the use of her fortune through their “Money Trust” in accord with their Secret Instructions. (Did not the Jesuits benefit when Harvard’s Widener Library was built with a donation from Titanic survivor, Eleanor Widener? Did not both her husband George and son Harry perish in the disaster, leaving her in charge of the largest fortune in Roman Catholic Philadelphia? Did not the Jesuits benefit by eliminating Astor, Guggenheim and Straus as they were in agreement with the Jewish American Supreme Court Justice, Louis Brandeis, in opposing the passage of the Order’s Federal Reserve Act? Was not J. P. Morgan – the “infallible” Pope’s financial agent within the American Empire and the man who lured these Jews onto the Titanic – the true sponsor of the Federal Reserve Act with his “Aldrich Commission?” Was not the Jesuits’ President Taft – the servant of the Archbishop of New York as well as the betrayer of his military aide, Major Archibald Butt, having sacrificed him on Titanic – an avid supporter of the Federal Reserve Act, urging the country to “take up seriously the problem of establishing a central bank,” according to Jean Strouse in her masterpiece, Morgan: American Financier ?)
This leads the author to believe there were more than two Jesuits on board the deathship. There were probably at least ten of the ship’s officers and crew who were “Professed” and under “Extreme Oath.” There were probably several Knights of Columbus under the Oath of the Fourth Degree, as well as a few Freemasons loyal to the mark “I.H.S.” — the seal of the Black Pope! This explains why a Jesuit Provincial would personally board the vessel! He must have leisurely finalized the plan with his soldiers charging this select group of the ship’s yeomen – hired at the last minute as a result of a contrived strike in England – that upon the Jesuit Captain Smith’s order to abandon ship, to quickly lower the inadequate number of lifeboats, less than half full with only women and children, into the water while forbidding the men who were the wealthy targets from boarding. The poorer passengers within the lower levels were to be locked down so as to prevent the Order’s wealthy victims from escaping its watchful eye and possibly boarding a lifeboat amidst the hysteria and confusion on deck. (Jesuit Captain Smith’s deliberate sinking of Titanic was a preview to the sinking of the doomed U.S.S. Indianapolis overseen by the Order’s CFR member and Commander of the Pacific Fleet, Admiral Chester William Nimitz, along with several devious subordinates including Captain Oliver Naquin. The ship’s captain and “patsy,” Captain Charles B. McVay III, having been the Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee of the combined Chiefs of Staff in Washington, D.C., must have known too much and was to be “silenced.” But Captain McVay survived one of the greatest disasters in the history of the American Navy. Predictably, in 1968, unable to cope any longer with his mental agony, the innocent and good Captain took his life, to the shame and disgrace of the High Command of the U.S. Navy!) To prevent nearby freighters from responding with help, the distress flares were seen to be white (party time!) when they should have normally been red!

It was for this reason that only one of the lifeboats returned to retrieve those freezing in the darkness, as the temperature of those waters was only twenty-eight degrees! Like the “selections” at Auschwitz, those “selected” to board the lifeboats would live. The rest, on the ship or in the water, must die the death including several Jesuits, Masons and possibly Knights of Columbus.
This leads us to another question. Who owned the White Star Line? For, its management was ultimately responsible for choosing the men who would man the ship. And with the money involved in financing those luxury liners (Titanic, Britannic and Olympic), only select Knights of Malta and the modern day Knights Templar – select Shriner Freemasons
“ . . . the great men . . . and the merchants of the earth . . . ”
– Revelation 18:3, 23
could have been the movers and shakers of this attack on the private fortunes of wealthy Jews enjoying the blessings of Protestant-Calvinist liberty secured by William I of Orange, Oliver Cromwell and George Washington. The Knights knew that the Hebrews of both the American and British Empires had never suffered formal persecution for over two hundred years, and as a result, invested their wealth in great industries bringing financial prosperity to both Protestant peoples. About the time of Titanic the renowned composer Gustav Mahler, directing the Vienna Court Opera and having composed his immortal and magnificent Symphony No. 5 “Adagietto,” abandoned Roman Catholic Austria and settled in New York in 1909 to enjoy Protestant liberty while conducting the New York Philharmonic — as a Jew. Thirty years later, his symphonies were banned by Rome’s Nazis as “degenerate Jewish music.” Indeed the Bible is still true, the pre-incarnate Son of God declaring to the Nations His promised response to their treatment of His servant Abraham, later reaffirmed to Isaac and finally to Jacob, including his twelve sons and their physical descendants — the House of Israel:
“And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee . . . ”
– Genesis 12:3
“ . . . for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.”
– Zechariah 2:8
“For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.”
– Malachi 3:6

Chapter 35
So the Jesuit General used his Papal Knights to essentially destroy this happy relationship between American Protestants, Baptists and Jews as he created his monster monopoly called “the Federal Reserve Bank.” One of his Masonic Knights Templars was the multi-millionaire, J. P. Morgan! This evil and sinister man, operating the largest bank in the world, would be responsible for the suppression of Nikola Tesla’s brilliant inventions including worldwide free energy. According to Anthony Sutton in his Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution, after Morgan’s death in 1913 a portion of his massive wealth invested with the American International Corporation in New York would finance the Bolshevik Revolution that Jesuit Inquisition in Russia! According to an Arts and Entertainment documentary video, this J. P. Morgan, his International Mercantile Marine (IMM) having financed the White Star Line and thus the building of Titanic, had designed a cabin specially furnished and reserved for himself (suite B52), his promised presence serving as bait for those marked for death. And at the last moment just prior to the Titanic’s departure from Southampton, this spiritual bastard cancelled his reservation (citing ill health) in addition to fifty-four other men of wealth and power {7}, abandoned his friend and president of IMM, J. Bruce Ismay (the American scapegoat who later was fired from his job after he managed to survive his intended death by jumping into a lifeboat), and returned to New York on another ship. We wonder if Jesuit Browne and Shriner Freemason Morgan threw a party and toasted the Temporal Power of the “infallible” Pope as they viewed the priest’s pictures of the murdered men of wealth and power, the net worth of Titanic’s passengers being over five hundred million dollars in 1912! Another high-level Freemason who also “cancelled” his reservation on the Titanic was Milton Hershey, Pennsylvania’s chocolate king! He had much to gain, as American soldiers would be issued “Hershey chocolate” on which they would fight the Jesuits’ Second Thirty Years’ War, bankrolled by their Federal Reserve Bank. Other White Masonic Gentiles who “cancelled” their reservations at the last minute were Robert Bacon (Morgan’s former business associate), Henry C. Frick (America’s steel baron), and George W. Vanderbilt (America’s railroad and shipping tycoon whose family’s 1895 “Breakers” mansion facing the Atlantic Ocean in Newport, Rhode Island is now controlled by the Order via the Knights of Malta).
As usual, the Sons of Loyola got away with mass-murder and grand theft once again, as their power in the American and British Empires was controlling. In spite of a most revealing Senate hearing at New York’s Waldorf Astoria Hotel, the formal gaiety house for all of the Archbishop’s dinner parties, not a soul was prosecuted!
“The Senate’s investigation, and another by the British Board of Trade, found an appalling series of human and technical errors, but brought no charges against Ismay or the IMM...private damage claims against White Star amounting to $16 million were eventually settled out of court in 1916 for $664,000.” {8} [Emphasis added]

Dear truth-seeker, those Jews had dared to block the creation of the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank by which the Order would finance World War I and World War II the Second Thirty Years’ War, which would include Europe’s Jewish Holocaust.
This horrible tragedy, rivaling Shakespeare’s King Lear, could have been prevented had both the British and American governments been doing their biblical duty of punishing evil! Had the English Crown expelled the Jesuits and Knights of Malta even as Queen Elizabeth I had done in the Sixteenth Century, and had the Masonic Lodges been closed even as Cromwell had done in the Seventeenth Century, the heartbroken Irish Catholics and Protestants, whose sons and daughters were sacrificed by Ireland’s Jesuit master, would have never shed their Titanic tears over lost loved ones, further staining the pages of Irish history.
Ah, beware of the ides of April! Titanic was sunk on April fifteenth, the same day Lincoln had called out troops on the Protestant South, the same day Lincoln died at the hand of his Jesuit-controlled assassin, and the same day all Fourteenth Amendment citizen-serfs of the Jesuit General’s “Holy Roman” American Empire make their annual “confessions” to the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to demon-possessed Pope Innocent III’s Fourth Lateran Council of 1215. (Indeed, the code of law governing the American Empire has been modeled after the code of law governing the Pope’s Vatican Empire!)
If the Jesuits would sink a ship full of people just to get to one man, would they not do the same with an airplane? Was it not a coincidence that Congressman Larry McDonald on board flight KAL 007, “the lucky” 33rd degree Freemason Senator Jesse Helms having boarded the untargeted sister flight in Alaska, was shot down by a Russian MIG-25 jet fighter in 1983, killing all two hundred and sixty-nine innocent passengers, as he was calling for a congressional investigation of the Jesuits’ New York Council on Foreign Relations and Trilateral Commission? Was it not a coincidence that John F. Kennedy, Jr. “lost control” of his aircraft (having had its tail internally blown off) and plunged into the Atlantic, killing his wife and sister-in-law (all three bodies being full of shrapnel according to Cincinnati radio host and Baptist Pastor Ernie Sanders), as he sought to find his father’s real killer? As a possible U.S. Senator from New York, a multimillionaire, a successful publisher and loved by the people, he would have solved “the crime of the century.” These are no accidents! Through such tragedies, like the deliberate sinking of the U.S.S. Indianapolis during World War II, the Jesuit Order benefited and had the power to cover it up with their key men responsible for investigating the murders. We also must conclude that somehow “the Borg” Jesuit Order absorbed the fortunes of the wealthy for its use in destroying the Protestant Reformation while reducing the nations to serving dictators loyal to the Pope, who in turn hate the Jews. Years later, the Jesuits, controlling “the Jesuit Theatre” (or “Hollywood,” the wood from which magic wands were made) through their Masonic Jewish Zionists, would release the

most expensive and most profitable movie of all time, commemorating their great sacrifice in the North Atlantic to their “god” who sits in St. Peter’s Chair. That movie was, Titanic. Another movie would also be released reenacting another one of their great human sacrifices in North America. That movie was, JFK, Director’s Cut.
Dear truth-seeker, if we do not learn our lesson from the past with the deliberate wrecking of the Titanic, we are doomed to repeat it with more national tragedies like the Stock Market Crash of 1929 (America’s Titanic), the Kennedy Assassination, the Watergate Scandal, the Iran-Contra Affair, the Whitewater Fiasco, the Chinagate Scandal (Opus Dei’s Justice Department having blamed the innocent Dr. Wen Ho Lee for the high treason of the Order’s CIA) and now the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. For the Jesuit General,
“ . . . is the god of the society, and nothing but his electric touch can galvanize their dead corpses into life and action. Until he speaks, they are like serpents coiled up in their wintry graves, lifeless and inactive; but the moment he gives the word of command, each member springs instantaneously to his feet, leaving unfinished whatsoever may have engaged him, ready to assail whomsoever he may require to be assailed, and to strike wheresoever he shall direct a blow to be stricken.” {9}

Indeed, 1913 was “a very good year” in the words of that Catholic Mafioso and Knight of Malta, Frank Sinatra, along with his sidekick, America’s first Black Knight of Malta, Sammy Davis, Jr. The Jesuits, using the cronies of J. P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, Jr., sneaked through Congress the Federal Reserve Act during Christmas (Baalmas) Break on December 23, 1913. That same year, the Sixteenth (Income Tax) Amendment was declared to be “ratified” and, with the passing of the Internal Revenue Act, the Order created “the Commercial Inquisition.” And why were these planks of The Communist Manifesto put in place? To finance the up-and-coming Crusade – the Second Thirty Years’ War – to begin in 1914. This Crusade would be financed just like the Crusades of old. We read:
“In 1166 and again in 1188 the kings of England and France levied from their lay and clerical subjects for the support of a crusade a tax assessed on their incomes . . . The collectors . . . appointed assessors, who made the assessments themselves . . . or on the oaths of the taxpayers themselves.” {9} [Emphasis added]
Dear truth-seeker, the Federal Reserve Bank is the American Empire’s Vatican central bank requiring a slave (Social Security) number with which to do business. The Income Tax is a Peter’s Pence, a tax to finance the Vatican’s Crusades — they being World War I, World War II and every conflict during and after the Cold War. That wicked Income Tax was put upon us Americans in 1942 during World War II and was called “the Victory Tax.” That wicked Internal Revenue Service was unleashed upon a trusting public, the Service, like the Inquisitors of the Dark Ages, demanding a full “voluntary” financial confession once a year at our expense. For, in the words of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., “It is a sin to make a profit!”
With the Jesuit General’s American Empire in a continual state of war since Truman’s executive order of 1950, the Fourteenth Amendment citizen must continue to pay his “war tax” or it will be collected by force in the “war courts” flying the “war flag” of the Empire’s Commander-in-Chief. To have more productivity for the Vatican’s “war effort,” the American serf was given more daylight hours to perform his tasks. Therefore, during World War II, the Jesuits’ Council on Foreign Relations, in control of the Empire’s government, began “daylight savings time,” properly called “war time”! When the hour arrives for the “taxpayer” to pay his “war tax” he is either assessed by the IRS assessor priests or voluntarily assesses himself under oath, just as in the Dark Ages when Rome’s Priest-King and Papal Caesar was the Theocratic Universal Monarch of the World!
With these three planks in place, all the nation’s business could now be monitored and regulated by the Board of Governors of a private Corporation — “the King’s Bank.” This Corporation would never be required to file a tax return nor

would it ever be audited. Ultimately every “person” having “income” would have to “file” a “return,” making a confession of every Federal Reserve Note earned and every Federal Reserve Note spent in “itemizing deductions.” (Federal Reserve Notes are not “dollars” or “lawful money” but are “fiat money” or “legal tender,” backed by nothing except the “confidence” or rather the “faith” of the people. This makes Federal Reserve Notes identical to the historic paper currency of the Roman Catholic Church – another private Corporation – called “indulgences.”) All good confessions to the priests of the Internal Revenue Service must be made no later than the anniversary date commemorating Rome’s destruction of George Washington’s Calvinistic Confederate Republic of Sovereign States — The Federal Republic of these United States of America. That date on which the Jesuits instigated their criminal “War of Northern Aggression” with their Federalist “Radical Red/Black Republican Party” – that date of infamy – was April fifteenth!
Indeed, the Jesuit General’s Fourteenth Amendment “Holy Roman” American Empire is the Pope’s warhorse, extending the Pope’s Temporal Power around the world while enforcing the Pope’s Council of Trent. And Woe, Woe, Woe be to the Pope’s Fourteenth Amendment Roman citizen who refuses to fight the Pope’s wars (every war since 1898), who refuses to participate in the Pope’s war crimes (mass-murdering “heretics, liberals, Protestants, Jews and pagans”), who refuses to pay the Pope’s war tax (the income tax), in support of the Pope’s war debt (the national debt), who refuses to be identified with the Pope’s war number (the social security number), who refuses to be financed by the Pope’s war chest (the national credit system), who refuses to live by the Pope’s war time (daylight savings time), who refuses to use the Pope’s war courts (both federal and state courts), who refuses to use the Pope’s war name (given to him by the Pope’s war courts — a proper name spelled with all capital letters), and who refuses to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the Pope’s war courts (using a statutory abatement), evidenced by the presence of the Pope’s war flags (both federal and state) trimmed with gold fringe!
Dear truth-seeker,
“ . . . the prince that shall come . . . ”
– Daniel 9:26
who being
“At first no more than a king of men, commanding the allegiance of the Roman earth, he afterwards claims to be divine, and demands the
worship of Christendom.” {10}

“ . . . in his estate shall he honour the God of forces . . . ”
– Daniel 11:38
The god of war!
And why? Because
“ . . . the organizing principle of any society is for war. The [absolute] authority of the state over its people resides in its war powers.” {11}
And for what purpose?
Because absolutist war waged by the Roman Papal Caesar with his Society of Jesus destroys all religious and political liberties so accursed by the evil Council of Trent, as all “heretics and liberals” can be mass-murdered without due process of law. Presently in the warring Jesuit General’s American Empire it is called “Emergency War Powers” which have created a monster called “the National Security Agency” with its hired assassins — select CIA agents, Green Berets and Navy Seals.
By the middle of the Twentieth Century, American Protestant and Baptist freemen would be reduced to the existence of a “taxpayer.” Robbed of their status by the Jesuits’ Fourteenth Amendment, every “taxpayer” would be subject to an inquisitional audit, arbitrary bank account seizure or a dictatorial wage levy, as every “person” would be presumed guilty of “tax fraud” or “evasion” until he proved his innocence to a hostile and prejudiced auditor. Thus, the controlling emotion between the citizen and his government would be FEAR! (The Dominicans, like the IRS and its subordinate State collection agencies, ran the Holy Office of the Inquisition during the Dark Ages in the same manner, controlling the people with FEAR.)
These sweeping new powers would begin to fulfill the Jesuit quest of submitting the United States to the Temporal Power of the Pope. The Jesuits’ ancient enemies – the White Celtic-Anglo-Saxon Protestant Middle Class – would be reduced to credit card poverty, trillions of dollars would be driven to offshore banking havens and the people would fearfully submit to the absolute powers of an inquisitional bureaucracy.
By 1914 the Jesuits were now ready to begin their vengeance – the Second Thirty Years’ War – on a Europe, Russia, China and Japan having banished the Company “forever” from their shores. The Order would use the Federal Reserve Bank, their financial “Frankenstein,” to pay for it. The “Fed” was given the exclusive privilege to create credit with no collateral, that is, “out of thin air.” Like the

Chapter 36 463
Bolshevik Revolution – also financed by the Fed – the Jesuits would use their Masonic Jewish Zionists such as Paul Warburg (yearning to rebuild Solomon’s Temple) as the visible leaders of the Fed. This would enable the Order to justify American anti-Jewish fury at the later date in the person of the ex-Basilian (secret Jesuit) radio-priest, Charles E. Coughlin, “the father of hate radio.” Being the personal friend of J. Edgar Hoover and FDR, he would blame the Jews for the Order’s Great Depression and the New Deal, calling it “the Jew Deal.”
This Jesuit credit was extended to the American Congress, controlled by the Jesuits’ Council on Foreign Relations, to build a vast war machine with which to fight the Jesuits’ Second Thirty Years’ War. This Jesuit War Machine became Fourteenth Amendment America’s “Military Industrial Complex.” Thus the American Empire’s Military Industrial Complex, financed by the Federal Reserve Bank and enslaving the American people to repay the debt from credit created out of nothing, would be directed against the Russian and German Empires, the enemies of the Jesuit General and his “mouthpiece,” the “infallible” Pope. (Remember, the Russian Empire was composed of Orthodox “heretics,” accursed by the Council of Trent. That Empire had expelled the Order from its borders in 1820. The German Empire was composed of Lutheran “heretics,” accursed by the Council of Trent. Likewise, that Empire had expelled the Order in 1872. Both Empires were dead set against the Jesuits establishing the Pope’s Temporal Power within their borders.)
The Jesuits waited from 1913 to 1929 to make a virtual monopoly out of their “Frankenstein Fed.” The Great Depression put all the smaller banks out of business and made the Federal Reserve Bank “lord of all.” And who caused the Great Depression? According to FDR’s son-in-law, Curtis Dall, it was the Knight of Malta, Joseph P. Kennedy. We read:
“The feeling around the Street, in succeeding months, was that there were, in particular, three large short-sellers of stock, allegedly, Tom Bragg, Ben Smith, and Joe Kennedy . . . Of the three mentioned well-known short-sellers, Joe Kennedy was allegedly the most important, the most powerful and the most successful. This service . . . made him invaluable . . . Was Joe Kennedy carefully selected by world money leaders to sell short?” {12}
Rome, in creating the Great Depression with Joe Kennedy, enthroned its Federal Reserve System in Fourteenth Amendment America as its international keystone to restore the Pope’s Temporal Power around the world. The Empire’s privately owned central bank, created by the Jesuit General’s J. P. Morgan at the Millionaire’s Club off the coast of Georgia on Jekyll Island, became the master of both the Northern and Southern American people while they became its slaves. But

the living Son of God, to Whom has been given all authority in earth, raised up a mighty voice heard by all true statesmen in Washington. The Great Pennsylvania Congressman Louis T. McFadden, Chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Currency, addressed the House of Representatives on June 10, 1932 as follows:
“Mr. Chairman . . . We have been dealing with the effect of things rather than with the cause of things . . . we have in this country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known. I refer to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks . . . the iniquities of the Federal Reserve Board and Federal Reserve Banks acting together have cost this country enough money to pay the national debt several times over . . . This evil institution has impoverished and ruined the people of the United States. It has done this through . . . the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it . . . The Federal Reserve Banks . . . are private credit monopolies which prey upon the people of the United States for the benefit of themselves . . . The Wilson administration, under the tutelage of those sinister Wall Street figures who stood behind [the “holy monk”] Colonel House, established here in our free country the worm eaten monarchial institution of the “king’s bank” to control us from the cradle to the grave . . . In other words, the imperial power of elasticity of the public currency is wielded exclusively by these central corporations owned by the banks . . . Why should our national-bank depositors and our government be forced to finance the munitions factories of Germany and Soviet Russia? . . . The United States has been ransacked and pillaged. Our structures have been gutted and only the walls are left standing . . . This is the John Law swindle over again. The theft of Teapot Dome was trifling compared to it. What king ever robbed his subjects to such an extent as the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks have robbed us? . . . I have singled out the Federal reserve currency for a few remarks because there has lately been some talk of her ‘fiat money’ . . . Fiat money indeed! . . . Every effort has been made by the Federal Reserve Board to conceal its power but the truth is the Federal Reserve Board has usurped the Government of the United States. It controls everything here and it controls all our foreign relations [The Council on Foreign Relations]. It makes and breaks governments at will . . . when the Federal Reserve Act was passed the people of the United States did not perceive that a world system was being set up here which would make the savings of an American schoolteacher available to a narcotic-drug vendor in Macao. They did not perceive that the United States was to be lowered to the position of a coolie country which has nothing but raw materials and heavy goods for export; that Russia was destined to supply man

power and that this country was to supply financial power to an international super state — a super state controlled by international bankers and international industrialists acting together to enslave the world [to the Pope] . . . ” {13} [Emphasis added]
Ah, dear truth-seeker, the warnings of this great American went unheeded and one terrible day, on the fifth attempt, Congressman McFadden was murdered — given “the poison cup” by the masters of the Federal Reserve Bank, those Sons of Loyola!
The Jesuits’ “infallible” Pope ruling from Solomon’s rebuilt Temple in Zionist Jerusalem would govern that world super state. This is why the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank, storing Vatican gold, financed the overthrow of Orthodox Russia in 1917. This is why the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank financed Adolf Hitler’s Third Reich, thereby purging Europe and Western Russia of its “heretic” Jews. This is why the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank financed the building of Stalin’s Red Army, thereby purging Russia, the Baltic States and East Germany of its “heretic” Protestants. This is why the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank financed the building of the American Empire’s Military Industrial Complex resulting in the mass bombing, bastardizing and partitioning of Germany. We repeat, what the Jesuits did to the American Protestant State of Virginia they did also to Protestant Germany.
Today, William J. McDonough, a member of the Jesuits’ Council on Foreign Relations (along with his friend and President of the Jesuits’ Fordham University, a Professed of the Fourth Vow, Joseph O’Hare, who recently influenced the election of Michael Bloomberg – another Masonic Jewish Zionist – in becoming the mayor of New York City), is an Irish Papal Knight, a member of the Order’s Trilateral Commission, a Jesuit-trained economist and President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which, along with its member banks, is the biggest bank in the world! With the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank and the Sixteenth Amendment in place, two pillars of Marx and Engels’ The Communist Manifesto were now active in Fourteenth Amendment America. With the passing of the Internal Revenue Act, the IRS “Business Inquisition” was beginning its ultimate destruction of the White Protestant Middle Class along with its high culture, private rights and wealth.
World War I could now begin. Eight months after the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank, “The Guns of August” began to roar. The Great War, aye, the beginning of the Jesuits’ Second Thirty Years’ War – the “Crusade in Europe” as Freemason Eisenhower called it – was on. Payback time had arrived for the anti-Pope, anti-Jesuit, Russian and German Empires. The great disgrace to the Protestant and Baptist peoples of the West would be that the Jesuits would use the strongly Protestant Empires of America and Great Britain to punish the homeland of the greatest and most liberal of the Tzars, Alexander II, as well as the homeland of Europe’s bravest hero – the Reformation’s champion of the Bible – Martin Luther.

As Wilson’s advisor and “alter ego,” he pressed for the passage of Morgan’s Federal Reserve Act put forth by the Order’s token Masonic Jewish Zionist, Paul Warburg. House, as the supposed author of Philip Dru, Administrator, sought to convert America into a socialist-communist state “as dreamed of by Karl Marx.” Democrat and Knight of Columbus Al Smith, New York’s four term socialist Roman Catholic Governor, paved the way for FDR’s socialist New Deal of the early 1930s, advocated by the Jew-baiting, pro Nazi, corporate fascist, “father of hate radio,” ex-Basilian (secret Jesuit) priest, Charles Coughlin, as the means for recovering from the Great Depression caused by the greatest short seller of stock, Patrick Cardinal Hayes’ Knight of Malta, Joseph Kennedy. House was also responsible for bringing the Protestant American people into the Great War on the side of Rome’s Triple Entente through the sinking of Morgan’s British liner, Lusitania, loaded with arms and ammunition.

“In our country, there was a time when the proudest appellation a man could bear was that of American Citizen. ‘I am an American citizen,’ implied liberty and safety — protection and justice. Then, the national shield was, indeed, a shield with arms – a shield which defended the citizen against every act of tyranny and usurpation – a shield which guarded him on land and sea, at home and abroad. Then, personal liberty was a citizen’s birthright. Then, free speech was unshackled. Then, Mr. Webster could exclaim: ‘It’ (free speech) ‘is a homebred right — a fireside privilege. It has ever been enjoyed in every house, cottage, and cabin in the nation. It is not to be drowned in controversy. It is as undoubted as the right of breathing the air and walking on the earth. It is a right which cannot be invaded without destroying constitutional liberty. Hence, this right should be guarded and protected by the freemen of this country with a jealous care, unless they are prepared for chains and anarchy.’ ” {1} [Emphasis added]

Dear truth-seeker, you have now finished your Third Block of Jesuit history. Well done! You have acquainted yourself with a greatly misunderstood epoch of the past. For in understanding the past, you are now able to comprehend the present. The Nineteenth Century, in which the peoples of Europe freed themselves from Jesuit tyranny, paved the way for the events of the Twentieth Century. The Jesuits, expelled from Germany, Spain, France and Russia in the Nineteenth, would be readmitted in the Twentieth. The Pope, losing his Temporal Power as well as all respect from the nations in the Nineteenth, would amazingly regain them both in the Twentieth after his worldwide Crusade, first named herein as The Second Thirty Years’ War. In observing these events we can begin to comprehend the immense, the gigantic, the far-reaching international Network of Brotherhoods directed by an invisible “black hand” through which THE POWER of the Devil’s Black Pope continually flows over every nation on earth. But let us not lose heart, knowing that
“ . . . for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.” (Galatians 6:7)

Indeed, from President Theodore Roosevelt to President William Clinton, “the American Century” would be wholly the Pope’s and his Militia, the Company of Jesus. For we must agree with the words of Satan spoken by the Roman Catholic actor, Al Pacino, in the movie The Devil’s Advocate:
“Who in their right mind could possibly deny the Twentieth Century
was entirely mine? All of it!” {4}
The Jesuits, in command of both the British and American Empires, would go on to far surpass their previous universal power exercised prior to their Suppression in 1773. They would crush the “heretics” and “liberals” of Europe during the Second Thirty Years’ War from 1914 to 1945. The Jesuits would create two “superpowers” for their “Cold War” from 1945 to 1989 (the age of “Violent Peace”), during which they would continue to murder millions of “heretics” and “liberals,” while perfecting their International Intelligence Community — the Holy Office of the Inquisition! The Jesuits would use every evil device known to man to restore the Pope’s Temporal Power around the world, pursuant to the wicked Council of Trent.
Indeed, during the Cold War, the foreign policy of the British, American and Soviet Empires would be the Council of Trent, installing dictators, loyal to the “Vicar of Christ,” throughout Central and South America, Africa, Asia and Europe. And at the pinnacle of Jesuit Power, the Order, with the Knights of Malta on the Island of Malta, would formally end the Cold War. This would give the Jesuit-controlled government of the American Empire the justification, in deceiving the people, to close many military installations while further disarming the nation with more gun control (confiscation) legislation, thereby inviting a race war between Whites and Blacks, anarchy, a fascist dictatorship, death camps and foreign invasion. Further, the Sons of Loyola would agitate the peoples of the world through American intervention in the private affairs of foreign nations. The assassination of leaders, mass-bombings, military invasion and economic destruction of civilian populations would be the means by which the Company would enslave every nation to its ends worldwide Jesuit-controlled, Anti-Christian tyranny headed by “the King of kings” in Rome. This would cause all the foreign nations of the world to hate Americans and to hate the Jews of America, remembering there have always been prominent “court Jews” in every President’s Administration. At the right time the Jesuit General will marshal his Militia bringing a coalition of hostile nations against his disarmed American Empire, finally destroying the last stronghold of the Protestant Reformation, and with it, America’s Protestants, Baptists, Jews and refugee Pagans, these foreign immigrants having sought to escape the merciless absolutisms of their own nations installed and financed by the Pope’s “Holy Roman” American Empire. The Jesuits will then concentrate on making their “infallible” Papal Caesar “the Universal Despot of the World” ruling from Solomon’s rebuilt Temple in Jerusalem.

But in the pursuit of this quest, an American President interfered with the Temporal Power of the Jesuits’ “infallible” Pope. He was murdered for it and the truth as to:
• Why? • Who benefited? and • Who has the power to cover it up?
was suppressed for nearly forty years. However, the answers to these questions have been finally published in this book with an enclosed CD, which is available to a worldwide audience, via the “Internet” at www.vaticanassassins.org.
The Fourth Block of our diabolical Jesuit history, dear truth-seeker, gives you these answers with the hope that you will also do your duty in resisting the Jesuits, those servants of Satan. For the Sons of Loyola would deprive you of all that makes life sweet and worth living – the freedom of worship, the freedom of conscience, the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press and the right to bear arms – while serving the biblical Lord Jesus Christ with a pure conscience and a sincere heart.
And in serving Satan, the Militia of the Black Pope, in attempting to deluge the American Empire with “bibles” translated from an evil pro-Greek Septuagint (LXX) Old Testament Hebrew text and a wicked pro-Latin Vulgate Greek New Testament text in accordance with the Fourth Session of the evil Council of Trent, has most assuredly endeavored to deprive us of our Standard by which we judge ourselves and all things whatsoever. That Final Rule of Faith and Practice is the truly infallible Word of God, the Bible of the Waldenses during Rome’s Dark Ages and the Keystone of the Protestant Reformation, the Hebrew Masoretic Text and the Greek Textus Receptus as faithfully translated into the English language, in opposition to the Jesuits’ evil Council of Trent, by “the forty-seven learned and godly Englishmen” — The Authorized King James Version of 1611 in its present edition of 1769.
Dear truth-seeker, will you permit the Jesuits to destroy America, the last stronghold of the Lord’s grand and glorious Protestant Reformation? Will you allow them to use their political prostitutes to deprive you of your Sword of the Spirit – the Word of God – and your Sword of Just Defense — the gun? The ending of this Fourth and last Block will be written by you my brother. May you stand fast in resisting Anti-Christian tyranny, fighting this good fight of faith,

“Its [the Jesuit Order’s] objective was, and is still, to destroy the effects of the Reformation and to re-establish the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation . . . A Greater Germany, in other words, must be made again the center of a revived Holy Roman Empire.” {7} [Emphasis added]

The Secret History of the Jesuits
“One may say quite specifically that in 1914, the Roman Church started the series of hellish wars. It was then that the tribute of blood which she has always taken from the peoples began to swell into a veritable torrent.” {11}
Edmond Paris, 1964 French Historian
The Vatican Against Europe
“A clever masquerade has always been characteristic of the political activities of Jesuit Catholicism. Jesuitry is a word in all our dictionaries that is defined as synonymous with subtle duplicity . . . History is witness to the undeniable fact that the Jesuit Order, founded in 1540 for the express purpose of counter-Reformation, has excelled in the art of Machiavellian duplicity. It is an organization founded on military lines to fight for the political restoration of the Roman Papacy, and is the only order in the Catholic Church that binds its members by special oath for this purpose . . . [The] counter-Reformation activities of Jesuit Catholicism . . . led to the rise and present successes of Nazi-Fascism against the liberalizing effects of the Protestant Reformation . . . .Hitler himself admits that he was helped by the methods of the Jesuit counter-Reformation to carry on his ideological war . . . [We] have witnessed Catholicism’s open support of every step taken by Nazi-Fascism to impose authoritarian regimes upon all peoples . . . the Fascist regime in Italy...Hitler’s National Socialism . . . Mussolini’s conquest of Ethiopia . . . Japan’s invasion of China . . . its [the Vatican’s] alliance with Franco . . . After Pearl Harbor the Vatican accepted General Ken Harada as Ambassador from Tokyo to the Holy See . . .
We can go even so far as to state that Nazi-Fascism had its origin in the Society of Jesus, and that, like other movements in the past analogous to Fascism today, it was planned to serve the traditional aims of the disciples of Ignatius Loyola.” {12} [Emphasis added]

Chapter 37 479
“This man [Adolf Hitler, who violated his oath to preserve the Protestant German Constitution, tripled the subsidies to the Roman Catholic Churches within Germany as a result of his Concordat with Pope Pius XI having been negotiated by Knight of Malta Franz von Papen, and never closed down a single Roman Catholic Church], the bearer of high ideals, will do all that is necessary to save the nation from catastrophe.” {13}
Ludwig Kaas, 1933 German Jesuit
The Black International – Number 3; The Pope Helps Hitler to World Power
The Jesuit General with his Second Thirty Years’ War achieved victory after victory for Rome, hastening the ultimate enthronement of the Pope as the Universal Despot of the World in Jerusalem. His victories, in returning the world to the Dark Ages, were won as the Professed Jesuits obeyed their bloody Oath pursuant to their Council of Trent. It will be attempted to enumerate but a few.
The Jesuits had decided that absolutist socialist-communist military dictatorships (fascism) would replace absolutist divine right monarchies, as the dictators were easier to control and replace than the Monarchs. The Holy Alliance was to be replaced with an International Intelligence Community controlling the leaders of all nations. Any attempt at popular liberty or national sovereignty would be met with assassination, revolution or betrayal.
To begin with, the core of the Holy Alliance of 1815 consisted of the Monarchs of Russia, Prussia and Austria. But by 1914, all three dynasties had revolted from Rome and had departed from the purpose of the Holy Alliance. We shall examine the policies of the Romanoffs, the Hohenzollerns and the Hapsburgs.
The Romanoffs were the first to revolt. In 1820, Alexander I had expelled the Jesuits from Russia for which he was poisoned. By 1882, Alexander II had emancipated the serfs, abolished the secret police and was about to sign a Constitution creating popular liberty. He had also broken with the Vatican, nullifying the Concordat with Rome entered into by Nicholas I. After six attempts on his life he was finally blown to pieces. Clearly the Orthodox Romanoff Dynasty must go, as it resisted the tyranny imposed by the Council of Trent and the Holy Alliance. So in 1917, the Jesuits, with their Federal Reserve Bank, financed the Bolshevik Revolution resulting in the abdication and secret escape of Knight of Malta, Tzar Nicholas II, whose cousin was George V. The Romanoff Dynasty begun in 1613 was history!
The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945



Vatican Assassins
The second monarchy to revolt was the Hohenzollern. Wilhelm I, with his “Iron Chancellor” Bismarck, defeated the Jesuits’ Napoleon III during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. Further, he enabled Victor Emmanuel II to take the Temporal Power from the Pope for nearly sixty years. He then expelled the Jesuits from the German Empire in 1872, further enraging the Order! For this the Jesuits, ever true to their bloody Oath, attempted his assassination with their “nihilists” but failed. In 1907, Wilhelm II threatened to expel every Roman Catholic priest from his Empire for interfering with his civil power regulating marriage, having previously refused to be “the sword of the Church” at the insistence of Pope Leo XIII! Clearly the Lutheran Hohenzollern Dynasty must go!
So in 1914, the Jesuits, with their Grand Orient Masonic Lodge, criminally forced the World War on the Protestant German Empire and drove its Lutheran Kaiser into exile, resigning in 1918. We read from the pen of Wilhelm II himself:
“The whole war is plainly arranged between England, France and Russia for the annihilation of Germany, lastly through the conversations with Poincare in Paris and Petersburg, and the Austro-Serbian strife is only an excuse to fall upon us! God help us in this fight for our existence, brought about by falseness, lies and poisonous envy!” {14}
Kaiser Wilhelm II continues his brave confrontation with and exposure of the Order’s treasonous German Grand Orient Masonic Lodge, while having been betrayed by his own Jesuit-controlled mother, Queen Victoria of England:
“I have been informed that an important role was played in the preparation of the World War directed against the monarchial Central Powers by the policy of the international “Great Orient Lodge.” The distinguished German Freemason . . . said that in 1917 an international meeting of the lodges of the “Great Orient” was held, after which there was a subsequent conference in Switzerland; at this the following program was adopted . . . elimination of the House of Hapsburg, abdication of the German Emperor . . . ” {15}
And so it came to pass. The Hohenzollern Dynasty, begun in 1415, was also history.
The last dynasty to revolt was the Hapsburg. The Jesuits had punished this family during the French Revolution with the beheading of Queen Marie Antoinette and later, in 1898, assassinated Elizabeth, the Empress of Austria. Why? Franz Joseph, her husband and Emperor brought to power during the Order’s Second French Revolution in 1848, had enraged the Jesuits. He revoked the Austrian Concordat with Rome nullifying the Pope’s Temporal Power. Austria of all places! The Hapsburgs of Austria – the tools of the Jesuits’ Thirty Years’ War killing over

Chapter 37 481
ten million people in the attempt to exterminate Protestantism – breaking with Rome! Clearly the Catholic Hapsburg dynasty must go! So, in 1908 Austria annexed Kosovo outraging the Orthodox Serbian people. In 1914, six years later at Sarajevo, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was murdered in his coach, shot point blank in the chest by Oskar Potiorek, the Governor General of Sarajevo. By 1918, the Hapsburg dynasty begun in 1278 was finally history along with the Holy Alliance of European Monarchs. Four years later in 1922, Jesuit priest Ignaz Seipel became Chancellor of Austria. (That same year, Jesuit Edmund Walsh, aided by the secret power of Jesuit Edward Ropp (1851-1939), installed Joseph Stalin as the Secretary of the Communist Party. At the time Ropp was openly in exile in Warsaw, Poland, being the Archbishop of Mohylew in Russia (1917-1939)). Seipel – nicknamed “the merciless cardinal chancellor” (although not literally a Cardinal) according to Edmond Paris in his masterpiece, The Vatican Against Europe, – destroyed every ounce of Austrian resistance to Hitler’s Nazism paving the way for the Anschluss (the union of Germany with Austria). The Order’s Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss, although pro-Mussolini and a dictatorial fascist, ignorantly opposed the Jesuit General’s Anschluss for which he was assassinated by the Company’s Austrian Nazis.
But the suppression of popular liberty and national sovereignty, as well as the extermination of “heretics” while increasing the Pope’s Temporal Power over the nations, would continue. The Holy Alliance of Monarchs would be replaced with the Holy Alliance of the International Intelligence Communities, financed by the Knights on Wall Street and the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank. That unified Community would be born during the Second Thirty Years’ War and finely tuned during the Cold War. This perfected International Intelligence Community would be nothing more than the Jesuit General’s “Holy Office of the Inquisition” operating under different names while implementing the despotism of the Council of Trent. The various intelligence agencies would be controlled by the Pope’s Knights of Malta in New York, London, Moscow, Washington, D.C., Paris and Constantinople overseen by the Jesuit General from his headquarters, Borgo di Santo Spirito, (“Village of the Holy Spirit” — what blasphemy!), in Rome.
In addition to overthrowing the monarchies while protecting the apostate Protestant English throne, the Jesuits accomplished the following from 1914 to 1945:
In 1914
The Jesuits brought Venustiano Carranza to power in Mexico, igniting the Mexican Civil War. Coupled with The Guns of August in Belgium, this year began the Great Jesuit Vengeance of the Twentieth Century.
In recalling the past, the Mexican people with their great Benito Juarez had provoked the Jesuits to anger! They defended their “liberal” Constitution of 1857
The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945

with the “War of Reform” from 1858 to 1861. President Juarez then broke the Temporal Power of the Pope over Mexico and later executed the Austrian usurper, Ferdinand Maximilian, in 1867, further enraging the Jesuits! Although the Order murdered our hero Juarez in 1872, the Mexican people expelled the Jesuits in 1873. Can you imagine the unbridled rage of Satan’s Jesuit General — the Black Pope?
Three years passed when in 1876 the Company punished the freedom-loving Mexican people. As the Jesuits had overthrown the Second French Republic with the dictatorship of Napoleon III, even so they overthrew the Mexican Republic with the dictatorship of general Porfirio Diaz. He readmitted the Sons of Loyola and for thirty years oppressed the people, robbing them of their land and liberty. But by 1910 the people had had enough of the Jesuit-controlled dictator’s “altar and throne.” A revolution broke out as a result of rigged elections and Diaz fled the country. Francisco Madero was elected President in 1913 but was quickly assassinated by the Jesuits who then installed another tyrant, Victoriano Huerta. This gave rise to the resistance of Pancho Villa in the north and Emiliano Zapata in the south — the Revolution’s greatest enemies of the Jesuits! As a result, that same year Huerta was defeated and fled.
The Mexican people would now begin to pay dearly for their desire to be free from the dictators controlled by the Jesuit priests. In 1914, the Order brought Venustiano Carranza to power and used its Fourteenth Amendment American Empire to recognize his de facto rule! What a disgrace to us Americans! Our two heroes warred with Carranza for six years until Zapata was murdered and Villa surrendered. From the years of 1910 to 1920 Mexico ran red with blood, the Revolution claiming one million lives — thanks to the Jesuits! From the years of 1921 to 1928 the great anti-Jesuit Presidents Alvaro Obregon and Plutarco Elias Calles, honestly attempted to maintain a liberal government for the Mexican people. Calles at one time deported two hundred Spanish Jesuit priests and had to subdue murderous Catholic guerrilla bands leading the Cristero Rebellion. From the beginning of the revolution to this time Avro Manhattan writes:
“The result was one of the most deadly civil wars ever experienced, which cost Mexico nearly one million dead. The civil war was conceived, provoked, and openly carried out by the [hierarchical] Catholic Church, encouraged and financed by North American Big Business [just like the Bolshevik Revolution]. Catholic armies sprang into the field and, shouting the name of Jesus, went to assault for the overthrow of the “anti-Christian,” anti-Catholic Mexican Government [of President Calles].” {16} [Emphasis added]
The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945



Chapter 37 483
Though the great Mexican Revolution was valiantly fought by its patriots and provided inspiration for the Spaniards waging their Civil War with Franco in the 1930s, by the end of 1945 Mexico was clearly in the hands of the Jesuit General.
Dear truth-seeker, this terrible suffering of our southern neighbors was a part of the Jesuit General’s Second Thirty Years’ War brought into Mexico. And why? Because the people of Benito Juarez broke the Temporal Power of the Pope, expelled the Jesuits and asserted their national sovereignty — three deadly sins! And how did the Vatican’s Jesuits punish Mexico? They used their “Holy Roman” American Empire – “the Sword of the Church” – to foment a bloody Civil War which ultimately cost the Mexican people rivers of blood, its earthly treasures and national life. Today poverty-stricken and demoralized Mexico is the great haven for the Black Pope’s International Drug Trade overseen by his International Intelligence Community managed by the Knights of Malta.
In 1917
The Jesuit General in Rome, using the British Army, took Palestine away from the Turkish Moslems paving the way for creating his Weizmann/Ben-Gurion Labor Zionist Israel and the rebuilding of Solomon’s Temple for the “infallible” Pope.
In 1918
1. The Protestant German-Prussian Empire was destroyed.
2. The evil Treaty of Versailles plundered Germany thereby guaranteeing war in twenty years. This time the German Army would be under Jesuit control.
“The German people surrendered and agreed to the Armistice on the promises to them through the President of the United States acting as a spokesman of the Entente Allies . . . These pledges made to the German people upon which they agreed to lay down their arms and upon which the Emperor of Germany resigned and left Germany, are commonly known as the Fourteen Points . . . The Treaty of Versailles violated these pledges, and put the United States in the attitude of having betrayed the German people through the President of the United States [controlled by the Pope’s Archbishop of New York] . . . The Allies, led by Clemenceau, compelled them to sign the Treaty at the point of the bayonet [just as the Fourteenth Amendment was forced on the Protestant Southern States] when the German people were disarmed [and robbed of much of their land composing the Protestant Prussian Empire]. . . giving five days for

acceptance under penalty of a rupture of the Armistice and
recommencement of the war.” {17}
3. Roman Catholic Croatia and Orthodox Serbia – two ancient enemies, one Roman Catholic while the other was Orthodox and thus bitter enemies since the Jesuits’ Thirty Years’ War – were forcibly united creating Yugoslavia. This enabled the Jesuits’ Roman Catholic Croatian Ustashi to murder hundreds of thousands of Orthodox Serbs during World War II. We read:
“In June 1941, within a few days, more than one hundred thousand men, women and children were either killed or tortured and massacred in their homes, on the roads, in the fields, the prisons and the schools and even in the Orthodox Churches . . . we discovered babies who had been impaled on the pointed slats of an enclosure, their small limbs contorted by pain, like pinned insects. The most ferocious of cannibal rites have never equaled this . . . the Ustashis gouged out their victims’ eyes, which they wore as garlands or carried in bags, to be given away as mementos.” {18}
4. Roman Catholic Slovaks and Protestant Bohemian Czechs were also united creating Czechoslovakia. This later enabled the Jesuits’ Msgr. Jozef Tiso to murder thousands of Protestant Czechs and Jews, deporting them to Auschwitz.
5. England was used to take Palestine away from the Turks. This resulted in the creation of a national homeland for the Jews with the Balfour Declaration. During World War II the Jesuits would not allow the trapped European Jews to emigrate to Roosevelt’s American Empire, Churchill’s Great Britain or Stalin’s Russian Empire. Rather, the Order permitted many to enter Palestine while the majority perished in the Death Camps located deep in the woods of Roman Catholic, Jesuit-controlled, Poland.
In 1921
1. The agents of the Jesuits created the Council on Foreign Relations. The locations would be in the two most powerful Roman Catholic Dioceses in the American Empire — New York and Chicago. The CFR would control the Empire’s finance, government, industry, religion, education, and press. No one could be elected to the Presidency of the United States without the Council’s consent, as the office would be a tool for the Archbishop of New York subject to “the Vicar of Christ” in Rome. (One of the founders of the CFR also aided in the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank. He was Edward M. House —“the holy monk,” a Shriner Freemason and agent of the Jesuit General.) Its purpose was to return the world to the Pope’s Dark Ages with an economically socialist world police state. We read:
The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945



Chapter 37
“I am convinced that the objective of this [absolutist] invisible government is to convert America into a socialist state and then make it a unit in a one-world socialist system . . . Socializing the economies of all nations so that all can be merged into a one-world system was the objective of Colonel Edward M. House, who founded the Council on Foreign Relations, and has been the objective of the Council, and of all its associated organizations, from the beginning.” {19}
At the time of the Kennedy Assassination two of Cardinal Spellman’s Knights of Malta were powerful members of the Council. They were,
“J. Peter Grace . . . [and] Henry [R.] Luce.” {20}
J. Peter Grace, an international shipping tycoon and industrialist, became the head of the American Branch of Spellman’s Knights of Malta while Henry R. (Lucifer) Luce controlled the American Press from Rockefeller Center in New York, across the street from the Cardinal’s palace, St. Patrick’s Cathedral. Both were multimillionaires!
At the zenith of Luce’s power John Swinton, Chief of Staff for the New York Times and considered “the Dean of His Profession,” made a most brave confession. In 1953 following a toast before the New York Press Club he declared:
“There is no such thing, at this date of the world’s history, in America, as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is not one of you who dares to write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinion out of the paper I am connected with. Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be so foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my paper, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone.
The business of the journalists is to destroy the truth; to lie outright; to pervert; to vilify; to fawn at the feet of mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it and what folly is this toasting an independent press? We are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes. We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes.” {21} [Emphasis added]
The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945



486 Vatican Assassins
And it was Henry R. Luce who used his media empire to shape American culture and religion. Both Luce and the Masonic Jew, Bernard Baruch, recruited the young Billy Graham for ecumenical purposes, as Luce was an active participant in the Jesuits’ World Council of Churches. (Now you know why Freemason Graham, having received an honorary doctorate from the Jesuits’ Belmont Abbey College and thus approved by the Vatican’s Jesuit Charles Dullea, receives such good press!)
The Jesuits, in creating the Council on Foreign Relations as their “trusted third party,” were following the instructions of their founder. Loyola commanded:
“ ‘The chief aim’– thus runs the order – ‘of all our efforts ought to be to procure the confidence and favor of princes and men in places of distinction, to the end that no one might dare to offer opposition to us, but on the contrary, that all should be subject to us . . . In short, the Jesuit order looks upon it as their highest aim and object to seize upon the place of Father Confessor at all the different Courts and among all persons of distinction, well knowing that enormous power lies hidden therein; at the same time the making publicly known of this earnest striving after power must be carefully avoided, especially as regards those princes who operate somewhat beneficially by their worldly might. Assurance must often and earnestly be given,’ proceeds the same above document, ‘that it is not sought in any way to interfere with the affairs of the State, and it is recommended to those who might be pleased to see themselves at the rudder not to make it evident that they are manifestly in that position. This ought rather to be effected through means of some trusted third party, that then the opinion of the rulers’ Father Confessor might be asked; when by this means all appearance of direct interference is avoided, then will be the reality of the influence all the more effectually secured.’ ” {22} [Emphasis added]
Dear truth-seeker, the Jesuits at Georgetown are the Father Confessors to the President. The trusted third party is the Council on Foreign Relations sending its advisor, usually the Secretary of State, who in 1963 was the traitor, Dean Rusk.
2. The agents of the Jesuits created the Royal Institute for International Affairs in London. The RIIA, working in conjunction with the CFR at 58 East 68th Street in New York, would continue to use the Protestant British Empire as the Order had directed it for the entire duration of the Nineteenth Century, known also as “the British Century.” The Empire, usurped by the Jesuits during the reign of King George III, would be guided by the Black Pope through the English Monarchy and “Smokin’ Winston” Churchill as another one of the Order’s “Swords of the Church” during the Jesuit General’s Second Thirty Years’ War and his ensuing Cold War.
The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945



Chapter 37 487
In 1922
1. The Jesuits established their Inquisition in Russia called “Communism,” appointing their Jew-hating, Roman Catholic Grand Inquisitor, – Joseph Stalin Secretary of the Communist Party. Indeed, it was common knowledge in Russia that “Koba” was a Roman Catholic. To the contrary, it was a well-kept secret that he, like Hitler, Mussolini and Franco had a Concordat with the Pope. It was also known that he, like President Clinton, was educated by the Jesuits. That training transpired in Tiflis, Georgia, just outside of Russia, as the Tzar’s ukase of 1820, banning the Order from Russia, was not in force there. Of Stalin’s Jesuit training we read:
“Then [1894], being nearly fifteen, he entered the Tiflis Theological Seminary on a free scholarship . . . [Stalin then states] ‘In protest against the humiliating regime and the Jesuitical methods that prevailed in the seminary, I was ready to become, and eventually did become, a believer in Marxism . . . [The Jesuits] are methodical and persevering in their work. But the basis of all their methods is spying, prying, peering into people’s soul, to subject them to petty torment.’ ” {23}
2. The Jesuits with the help of the Mafia brought fascism to Italy in the person of Benito Mussolini. In 1929 their absolutist dictator signed a Concordat with the Pope, restoring his Temporal Power along with a gift of 20,000,000 dollars in specie! In 1932 Mussolini gave military aid to the Order’s Masonic King Ibn Saud, then ruling the Black Pope’s newly created oil bonanza called Saudi Arabia (the home of the late exiled Muslim “Butcher of Uganda,” Idi Amin). This Italian Catholic Fuhrer, known as “Il Duce,” was declared the “Defender of Islam” and given the “Sword of Islam” by Libya in 1937, evidencing the Black Pope’s rule of Mecca. Of Mussolini’s greatest crime and betrayal of the Italian people we read:
“The signing was to take place in the same room in which Charlemagne had been the guest of Leo III over a thousand years earlier . . . The 1929 treaty was actually a unity of three separate agreements: the Lateran Pact, which provided for the creation of the new State of Vatican City; the Financial Convention, which granted payments to the Church for the loss of its Temporal Powers [massive grand theft]; and the Concordat . . . According to the articles of the Lateran Pact, the State of Vatican City was set up as a sovereign entity . . . And Italy agreed to accept the Church’s canon law [including the evil Council of Trent] . . . The Concordat also stipulated that Protestant Bibles could no longer be distributed in Italy [like Stalin’s Russia], that evangelical meetings in private homes were forbidden [like Stalin’s Russia], and that Catholicism was to be Italy’s official religion. [Could it be that Stalin (the “son of a Jew” as indicated by his Georgian name, Djugashvili), like Mussolini,
The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945



Vatican Assassins
also had a Concordat with the Pope — secretly restoring ‘the Vicar of
Christ’s’ Temporal Power in “heretic” Russia?]” {24} [Emphasis added]
Mussolini was simply carrying out the plans of his Jesuit confessor, Pietro Tacchi-Venturi. Pius XI, in praise of Il Duce and his regime described Mussolini as,
“ . . . the man whom Providence allowed us to meet.” {25}
The “ex-Jesuit” sovereign Pontiff, Pope Pius XI, further stated:
“Mussolini . . . will conquer all in his path. Mussolini is a wonderful man
– Do you hear me? – a wonderful man! . . . The future is his.” {26}
Thus Fascism and Jesuitism go hand in hand. Pierre van Paassen declared in 1939:
“For today Rome considers the Fascist regime the nearest to its dogmas and interest. We have not merely the Reverend [Jesuit-led] Father Coughlin praising Mussolini’s Italy as ‘a Christian democracy,’ but Civilta Cattolica [“the purest journalistic organ of Church doctrine” says von Dollinger], house organ of the Jesuits, says quite frankly . . .
‘Fascism is the regime that corresponds most closely to the concepts
of the Church of Rome.’ ” {27} [Emphasis added]
In 1927
The American Branch of the Knights of Malta was established in New York, one of the founding members being John J. Raskob, the head of General Motors and builder of the (Fourteenth Amendment) Empire State Building, also in New York.
In 1929
1. The Jesuits caused the Great Depression in the American Empire with their short-seller, Knight of Malta, Joe Kennedy. This enabled the Jesuits’ FDR, through CFR member and “Jesuit of the short robe” Harry Hopkins, to begin the building of the Empire’s Military Industrial Complex with the socialist-communist New Deal, strongly promoted by priest John Ryan and the secret Jesuit, Charles E. Coughlin.
2. The Jesuits established their Russian College in Rome enabling scores of Jesuits to invade and rule the “USSR,” advising Joseph Stalin while following in the wake of the Nazi SS Einsatzgruppen (SS/SD execution squads) during Rome’s Nazi Crusade against “Russian Communism” called “Operation Barbarossa.”
The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945



Chapter 37
In 1933
1. The Jesuits, using Knight of Malta, Joseph P. Kennedy, brought Franklin Roosevelt to power in Fourteenth Amendment America. We read:
“Following a night of wild celebration, Kennedy set to work raising money for the campaign . . . Beyond the $50,000 he himself contributed, it is said that Kennedy raised over $150,000 for Roosevelt in the space of four months . . . On election night Kennedy celebrated Roosevelt’s victory over Hoover as though it were a personal triumph, staging a lavish party that spilled through two floors of New York’s Waldorf Astoria . . . The merrymaking continued in Florida as FDR took a postelection cruise aboard Vincent Astor’s yacht [whose father had been murdered with the sinking of Titanic] with his top backers and associates, including Kennedy. Even Josie . . . exclaimed,
‘ . . . my son-in-law Joe Kennedy has made FDR President.’ ” {28}
In obedience to his Ordinary, the secret Jesuit Charles E. Coughlin endorsed FDR:
“[In 1932] I coined the phrase ‘Roosevelt or Ruin’ . . . Today [1936] it is
‘Roosevelt and Recovery’ . . . ” {29}
For:
“No [secretly admitted] Jesuit dare write or publish any book which he has not the full and free [or secret] imprimatur of his superiors.” {30}
Friends with Fordham’s Robert I. Gannon, occult Jesuit Coughlin, the political fascist and economic socialist, had direct access to the White House. We read:
“In early September [1935] Coughlin . . . received a phone call from [Knight of Malta] Joe Kennedy [subject to Cardinal Hayes] . . . ‘The Boss wants to talk to you.’ . . . An instant later Coughlin heard the distinctive voice of the [Shriner Freemason FDR] President of the United States at the other end of the wire say ‘Hiya Padre.’ ” {31}
The Knights of Malta, led by Patrick Cardinal Hayes, put FDR, the thirty-third degree Freemason, in power creating an obligation to fulfill the desires of the Jesuits ruling New York and Rome. The person who would have continual access to FDR and act as his international agent during World War II was the Jesuit-trained and future “American Pope,” Archbishop Francis Spellman. We read:
The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945



Vatican Assassins
“Thus . . . Spellman was offered an unprecedented opportunity by Roosevelt that would necessitate leaving his archdiocese for months on end . . . The astounding proposal Roosevelt put forth was that Spellman act as a clandestine agent for him in the four corners of the world. It would be the archbishop’s job to contact chiefs of state in the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and Africa. He would carry messages for the President . . . and act as Roosevelt’s eyes and ears . . . the President offered him an opportunity to wield more power than any other American religious figure had ever had. Spellman would move as an equal among the greatest figures on the world political stage . . . But few people were certain about what the archbishop did during his far-flung travels. His clandestine work raised questions at home about the role of a religious figure involved deeply in governmental affairs . . . ” {32} [Emphasis added]
So this Jesuit at heart, Archbishop Spellman, as FDR’s personal agent owing his first allegiance to the Jesuit General’s Pope Pius XII (another Freemason according to our hero and ex-Jesuit, Alberto Rivera) acquired the skills necessary to succeed in international intrigue. These skills and connections with people of power would come in handy when carrying out the Kennedy Assassination.
2. Upon being put in office by the Knights of Malta, FDR’s first act of high treason was to recognize bloody Joe Stalin’s communist “USSR.” This enabled American businessmen to legally build Stalin’s Military Industrial Complex as they had illegally begun prior to FDR’s election! One of those men was the Jew-hater and personal friend of the ex-Basilian (Jesuit-controlled) priest, Charles Coughlin, “Episcopalian” Irish Roman Catholic Henry Ford. Of Ford and Gorki we read:
“In May 1929, the Soviets signed an agreement with the Ford Motor Company of Detroit. According to its terms the Soviets agreed to purchase $13 million worth of automobiles and parts before 1933 and Ford agreed to render technical assistance until 1938 to construct an integrated automobile-manufacturing plant at Nizhni-Novgorod. Actual construction of this plant was completed in 1933 by the Austin Company for production of the Ford Model-A passenger car and light truck . . .
In brief, the Gorki plant, built by the Ford Motor Company and the Austin Company and equipped by numerous other U.S. companies under the policy of “peaceful trade,” is today – and always has been – a major producer of Soviet army vehicles and weapons carriers.” {33} [Emphasis added]

3. The Jesuits with their Knights of Malta on Wall Street, along with the Federal Reserve Bank, financed Adolf Hitler bringing him to power. We read:
“Joseph J. Larkin resembled [Senator Nelson] Aldrich in his immaculate tailoring, perfect manners, austere deportment, and in his dedication to The Fraternity. A distinguished member of a Roman Catholic family, he had received the Order of the Grand Cross of the Knights of Malta from Pope Pius XI in 1928. He was an ardent supporter of General Franco and, by natural extension, Hitler.” {34} [Emphasis added]
Again we read of the Knights of Malta financing Adolf Hitler:
“On May 3, 1941, J. Edgar Hoover sent a memorandum to Roosevelt’s secretary, Major General Watson which read as follows:
‘Information has been received at this Bureau from a source that is socially prominent and known to be in touch with some of the people involved, but for whom we cannot vouch, to the effect that [Knight of Malta] Joseph P. Kennedy, the former Ambassador to England, and Ben Smith, the Wall Street operator [two of the short sellers having caused the Depression] some time in the past had a meeting with Goering in Vichy, France and that thereafter Kennedy and Smith had donated a considerable amount of money to the German cause.’ ” {35}
Of the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank financing Adolf Hitler we read:
“Immense sums belonging to our national-bank depositors have been given to Germany on no collateral security whatever . . . Billions upon billions of our money has been pumped into Germany by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks . . . On April 27, 1932, the Federal Reserve outfit sent $750,000, belonging to American bank depositors, in gold to Germany. A week later, another $300,000 in gold was shipped to Germany in the same way. About the middle of May $12,000,000 in gold was shipped to Germany by the Federal Reserve banks. Almost every week there is a shipment of gold [stolen from Fort Knox, Kentucky] to Germany.” {36} [Emphasis added]
4. The Jesuits, using Knight of Malta Franz von Papen, brought Hitler to power in Catholic Bavaria’s Third Reich. Edmond Paris tells us:
“Franz von Papen thought of dictatorship. In order the better to prepare for it and to complete the break-up of the [Weimar] Republic, he forcibly suppressed the democratic [Protestant] government of

Prussia . . . Thanks to von Papen, member of the Zentrum [Germany’s Roman Catholic political party] since 1920 and owner of the party’s
official paper, Germania, Hitler came into power on 30 January 1933.”
{37}
The Jesuits’ Knights of Malta not only financed Hitler, but Franz von Papen, the Knight of Malta who negotiated the Concordat between Pope Pius XII (formerly known as “the German Pope”) and Hitler, declared on January 14, 1934:
“The Third Reich is the first power which not only recognizes, but
which puts into practice the high principles of the papacy.” {38}
5. The Jesuits, having put FDR into office with Knight of Malta Joe Kennedy, attempted to make the President a fascist, military dictator. To make this happen, the Jesuits used the Knights of Malta, John J. Raskob in particular. Raskob was Chairman of the Board of General Motors and the major financier of the Jesuit-controlled Democratic party. The plot was stopped by the great American hero and two-time winner of the Medal of Honor, General Smedley Butler. We read:
“Raskob was one of the 13 founding SMOM [Sovereign Military Order of Malta] members in the U.S. and was also the treasurer of the SMOM’s U.S. component when he was implicated in a military plot to seize the White House in the early 1930’s. (The goal was to turn President Franklin Roosevelt into either a Mussolini-type strongman or a figurehead. But the scheme was exposed when General Smedley Butler, U.S. Marine Corps commander, blew the whistle on Raskob and coup plotters.) [In Jesuit Temporal Coadjutor Oliver Stone’s home movie JFK, Director’s Cut, it is intriguing to see Knight of Malta Clay L. Shaw referring to his ‘butler’ as ‘Smedley’.]” {39}
The full story is given by Jules Archer in The Plot to Seize the White House.
In 1939
1. The Jesuits brought Generalissimo Francisco Franco the fascist to power after he destroyed the Spanish republic that expelled the order in 1932. Rome called Spain’s quest for popular liberty a “communist revolution.” One of our heroes, the converted ex-Jesuit priest, Alberto Rivera tells us:
“In the last half of the 1800’s Spain was going through political convulsions. Her Roman Catholic monarchy was tottering and the queen was dethroned in 1868 [and the Jesuits were expelled]. Spain became a republic, which only lasted for two years. Then the monarchy was restored until 1923. As political conditions grew worse, Spain again

became chaotic. The Vatican was outraged when Spain chose once more to become a republic, and immediately the [hierarchical] Catholic Church moved to sabotage it.
During this time, from 1931 until 1936, about five presidents came and went. Spanish Roman Catholics were showing their contempt for the Vatican’s power (never dreaming what was in store for them). They taxed church property and removed priests and nuns from teaching in public schools . . . [The Order was dissolved in 1932 driving the future Jesuit General Pedro Arrupe to the United States.] Three presidents . . . (all Jesuit-trained) had demanded five laws passed in Spain to block the Vatican’s interference in the Spanish republic. [They were:]
A. All Roman Catholic Church property to be nationalized. B. All Roman Catholic churches to be taxed. C. No more schools in the hands of the priests. D. All schools, convents, and monasteries to be under the control of Spain. E. To recognize the Protestant religion. [Emphasis added — this is not Communism!]
[And why these laws?]
This was a result of discovering bodies of babies under the convents. [Because] the governments of President [Admiral Juan Bautista] Aznar and President Manuel Azana [y Diaz] demanded a national investigation be made of all monasteries, convents, Roman Catholic schools and church buildings. Many gravesites containing baby skeletons from nuns who had become pregnant were found in Spain and in Rome. By 1936, the Catholics of Spain were outraged and they attacked and destroyed many church buildings where these tunnels existed. Government doctors checked the bodies and reported that in most cases death was by suffocation . . . It triggered a bloody Catholic war against the Vatican. The Pope hired several divisions of Moslem mercenaries to fight under Franco (a good Freemason) to kill all Roman Catholics, Jews and Protestants who opposed them . . .
The Islamic leaders were contacted. They owed a debt to the Vatican for double-crossing Rome over Jerusalem. [The Seventh Century agreement was that the Pope through his agents would help Mohammed in exchange for Jerusalem after his armies had taken it. The Islamic leaders reneged on their promise, refused to give Jerusalem to the Pope, built the Dome of the Rock on the Temple site and called the Pope “an infidel.”] When they

had signed a concordat, they promised to help the Pope in a time of need, even to raise an army if he so desired. Now was the time. The Jesuits had done their work. The poor Spaniards would now suffer. Through secret negotiations, a huge Arab army was raised up under the command of General Franco. The Vatican financed this war machine [from Wall Street in New York] to teach the Spaniards a lesson.
In 1936 the new Spanish inquisition exploded. It was called “The Spanish Civil War,” secretly orchestrated in the Vatican. To keep the world from knowing the truth, it was made to look in the news as if the Vatican was fighting the Communists in a holy war. In actuality, there were only a handful of Communists in Spain. The Roman Catholic Institution had ordered a blood bath on her own followers . . . The Pope excommunicated the heads of the Spanish republic and declared spiritual war between the Holy See and Madrid . . . Under the banner of the Vatican [flying the Vatican’s flag] the Muslim forces invaded the Canary Islands and then attacked southern Spain . . . The Spaniards watched in shock as Cardinal Pedro Segura led the Islamic army in slaughtering unfaithful Roman Catholic men, women and children without mercy. The Muslim troops were getting their revenge at last, under the blessings of the Pope. When I was three years of age, I can remember seeing Muslim troops invade our home. My family survived that terror, and we were fortunate . . . When the inquisition accomplished its goals, Spain was in ruins, bleeding and beaten, but safely back in the hands of the Vatican . . . General Franco eventually became the Roman Catholic dictator of Spain. Franco’s government was recognized Aug. 3, 1937, by the Vatican, just 20 months before the civil war ended . . . About four million Muslim troops occupied Spain as the protectors of the Roman Catholic faith. Islam had paid her debt to the Antichrist sitting in the Vatican.” {40} [Emphasis added]
(Dear truth-seeker, would the Vatican’s Jesuits use a huge Moslem Army to invade the southern border of the American Empire as they invaded Spain? Would the Pope use Cuba as a stopping point before the attack as he used the Canary Islands? What great Jesuit agitation could be used to fire the Moslem heart to invade “the Great Satan”? Would Masonic Osama bin Laden (being one of fifty children to his Masonic, Islamic, multimillionaire, cartel constructionist, Saudi Arabian father, Mohammed bin Laden) the visible head of the Black Pope’s Masonic Islamic Terrorist Network (originally created by the CIA’s Operation Cyclone during the Carter Administration, which Network includes the high-level Islamic Freemason and dictator of Libya, Muammar al-Qaddafi as revealed by one of his former intelligence chiefs during the trial involving the sabotage and downing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland) blame America for his future implosion of Jerusalem’s Muslim mosques and quite possibly the destruction of Mecca and Medina?)
The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945



Chapter 37
Mr. Van Paassen adds further light to Franco’s Vatican alliance and the Fascist/Islamic persecution of Spanish Protestants. We read:
“The Vatican and the Catholic hierarchy took the side of Franco, Hitler and Mussolini [all defenders of Islam] against the Spanish democratic regime, invoking the pretext that Madrid was Bolshevistic . . . What Franco was doing in Spain, the Duke of Alva and the Cardinal de Granvelle had tried to do in the sixteenth century in Holland and Flanders and Catherine de’Medici and the Duc de Guise in the savage night of St. Bartholomew’s in France . . . This was the oppression against which Calvin and William [I] of Orange and the Beggars of Holland and Zeeland had revolted, and to escape which the Puritan Fathers had founded a new Republic in America . . . The struggle that Franco unleashed had nothing to do with Marx or Lenin. It was by virtue of our own Protestant logic and principles . . . that the Spanish people decided spontaneously on a defense to the death against the Fascist usurper . . . Rumors that Franco, who gloried in the expulsion of the Jews by Ferdinand and Isabella . . . was singling out the Protestants in Spain for special torture and the most ignominious death came not as a surprise to me . . . At Saragossa, Fascist troops pillaged the Protestant chapel, befouling the Bible and the pulpit with their own ordure . . . The pastor and local liberals . . . had their hands and feet tied and were left in the middle of the street to face two oncoming forty-ton tanks [Made in U.S.A.] . . .
At Granada, the two Protestant pastors . . . were seized and shot . . . The wife of Dr. Fernandez faced the firing squad with her husband . . . after she had been raped by a number of Moslem troopers . . . In Ibahernando, in the province of Coceres, the Protestants were executed en masse: pastors, men, women and children . . . In Badajoz . . . three thousand persons were machine-gunned in the bull ring . . .
From the day general Franco attacked the democratic Republic . . . the Spanish hierarchy, with its Jesuitical and contra-Reformation traditions [pursuant to the Council of Trent] . . . shows that Rome has severed its last remaining link with [Biblical] Christianity.” {41} [Emphasis added]
Indeed, the words of John F. Kennedy spoken in 1963 were true:
“Their [the Loyalists] attitude towards the Church was just a reaction to the strength of the Jesuits who had become much too powerful — the affiliation between church and state being much too close.” {42}
The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945

(Dear truth-seeker, would the Jesuits use millions of occupying Moslem troopers, having united with the American Black Muslims, to gang rape and murder the White Protestant and Baptist “heretics” of the American South? Would the Jesuits use these troopers, along with “the Fruit of Islam,” to murder hundreds of thousands of “liberal” White Roman Catholics even as they did to the Basques in Spain? Could it be that the true intent of the Jesuit General’s creation of the American Black Nation of Islam, along with the simultaneous and ceaseless Negro/Slavery Agitation, is to mold the nation’s hostile Negro population into a savage, U.S. anti-Jewish crusade working in conjunction with their foreign invading Arab Moslem brothers?)
Of Roman Catholic Franco’s tyranny we conclude:
“When Franco marched on Madrid nearing the close of the late civil war in Spain, when he was reinstating the Catholic government and over-throwing the people’s government the Protestants had set up a few years before, he said, ‘I have four columns of soldiers with me. I also have a fifth column in the city of Madrid who will betray the city into my hands when I get there.’ At the fall of Madrid and the recapture of Spain the Pope put his blessings on Franco, and Franco with his blessings, immediately went forth and put to death 150,000 Masons [low degree], Baptists, Methodists, and Presbyterians in the first 18 months and only God knows how many since.” {43}
As the Jesuits’ Holy Alliance had used France to invade and destroy the Spanish republic in the 1820s; so the Jesuits’ used their Federal Reserve Bank to finance the Moslem and Fascist Spanish Civil War again destroying Spain’s attempt at self-government in the 1930s, those patriots having driven King Alfonso XIII into exile along with his confessor, Jesuit Lopez!
The Jesuits now had pro-Moslem fascist Franco in Spain, pro-Moslem fascist Mussolini in Italy, pro-Moslem fascist Hitler in Germany, Stalin in Russia, Churchill in England and FDR in America to carry out the grandest Crusade in Rome’s history orchestrated by the Jesuit General, Wlodimir Ledochowski, from his headquarters in Rome, Borgo di Santo Spirito. Further, to make matters even more deadly, the Jesuit General’s brother headed “the Holy Office of the Inquisition.”
2. Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler, now in power, patterned his pro-Moslem fascist SS after the Jesuit Order. He used Bavarian Roman Catholic and Jesuit Temporal Coadjutor, Heinrich Himmler, to carry out the plan. Hitler declares:
“I have learnt most of all from the Jesuit Order . . . So far, there has been nothing more imposing on earth than the hierarchical organization of the Catholic Church. A good part of that organization I have transported direct to my own party . . . The Catholic Church must be held up as an example . . .
The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945



Chapter 37 497
I will tell you a secret. I am founding an Order . . . In Himmler I see our
Ignatius de Loyola!” {44} [Emphasis added]
Walter Schellenberg, Chief of the Nazi Sicherheitsdienst (SD), who after the war was protected by Sir Stewart Menzies, Chief of the British Secret Intelligence Service (Menzies having faked the death of Heinrich Himmler after his arranged “escape and capture”), reveals:
“The SS had been organized by Himmler according to the principles of the Jesuit Order. The rules of service and spiritual exercises prescribed by Ignatius de Loyola constituted a model which Himmler strove carefully to copy. Absolute obedience was the supreme rule; every order had to be executed without comment.” {45} [Emphasis added]
Edmond Paris then asks this most penetrating question concerning Himmler:
“Was it not his uncle, the Jesuit father, who had been promoted to a high-ranking officer of the SS? And was not the latter the very eye and arm of [not Cardinal] Halke von [but Wlodimir] Ledochowski, General of the Order, in the so . . . famous police services: Gestapo [America’s FBI], the Security Service SS [America’s CIA], the Central Jewish Emigration Office (execution of the scheme for exterminating the Jews) [Knight of Columbus Tom Ridge’s Office of Homeland Security – controlling twenty-two federal agencies and manned by the Jesuit Volunteer Corps – and America’s NSA, its inner sanctum being called “the Jew Room” in which no Jew is allowed unless he is a high-level, CFR member and Masonic Jewish Zionist having worked with the Nazis, like Henry Kissinger, the perennial foreign traitor]? Who then, was sending so many million deportees to death? Was it Heinrich Himmler or his uncle, the former Bavarian canon? It would really seem that here lays the conducting wire linking [Borgo] Santo Spirito No. 5, office of the Jesuit Fuhrer [headquarters of the Jesuit General], and Leipzigerstrasse No. 86, office of the SS Reichfuhrer [Heinrich Himmler’s command post]? After the capitulation of the Third Reich, Heinrich Himmler’s uncle was arrested and transferred to the prison of Nuremberg. But he never appeared before the international tribunal which tried war criminals. One morning he was found dead in his cell. One never knew whether this was a case of suicide or of opportune execution. The conspiracy of silence was such that nothing ever transpired of this strange death.” {46}
[After two years of searching the author believes that Edmond Paris was given wrong information regarding Himmler’s Jesuit “uncle.” Himmler had no uncle, thus there was no Himmler at Nuremberg. Heinrich Himmler, working with his brother Jesuit Coadjutors Bormann and Goebbels, was the Jesuit master of the SS!]
The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945

Knowing that Roman Catholics Hitler and Himmler as well as Jesuit-trained Goebbels were mere tools of the Order, the German youth, hypnotized by fear of the “Jewish Anti-Christian Communist Conspiracy” created by the Jesuits’ Mein Kampf and The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, were encouraged by the Company to join the SS. In 1942 Jesuit Verschaeve wrote in his “Jong Europa”:
“In this struggle, we have to be on Germany’s side: That is why the young
people must join the SS.” {47}
And it was the SS, working with the Jesuit General that secured the protection of Jesuit “missionaries” in Russia during Operation Barbarossa. Walter Hagen, a high-ranking SS officer, reveals:
“The General of the Jesuits, [not] Count Halke von [but Wlodimir] Ledochowski, was ready to organize, on a common ground of anti-Communism, a certain degree of collaboration between the German ‘Secret Service’ and the Jesuit Order . . . Ledochowski considered the forthcoming bellicose settling of accounts between Russia and Germany as inevitable; for this reason, he did all he could to obtain German assurance that the [Jesuit] priests of the ‘Collegium Russicum’ would not be impeded in their activity in territories that might be occupied by the Wehrmacht. For years, the ‘Collegium Russicum’ had been preparing [Jesuit] priests, with the special object of organizing Catholic missions among the Russian Orthodox population of the Soviet Union.” {48}
3. The Jesuits, in control of Hitler’s occultic and homosexual Third Reich (ironically murdering thousands of homosexuals as documented in Scott Lively and Kevin Abrams’ The Pink Swastika (1997)), installed puppet Roman Catholic dictators throughout the Empire. They were:
1. Bavarian Germany and the Third Reich Adolf Hitler 2. Italy Benito Mussolini 3. “Vichy” France Henri Petain 4. Spain Francisco Franco 5. Austria Artur Seyss-Inquart (Jesuit-trained) 6. Poland Hans Frank 7. Slovakia Msgr. (Priest) Jozef Tiso 8. Croatia Ante Pavelic 9. Belgium Leon Degrelle (Jesuit-trained)
All these Roman Catholic, Jesuit-controlled, Jew-hating dictators were loyal to the greatest war criminals of all, Papal Caesar Pius XII and his master, the infamous and diabolical Jesuit General Wlodimir Ledochowski — the Black Pope!
The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945

4. According to Heinrich Himmler, the “Order of the Death’s Head” – the SS was created to murder European and Russian Jews (pursuant to the Council of Trent) — that atrocity totaling from six to seven million as sustained by the late Alberto Rivera (an ex-Jesuit under Extreme Oath as validated by Gerard Bouffard, an ex-Bishop of Guatemala) despite the Order’s Nazi-fascist assertion that the Jewish Holocaust (though its remembrance has been used by the Order’s Masonic Jewish Zionists as an industry to oppress the surviving German People while building its Zionist Israel) is a myth, the true number of murdered Jews being only 600,000!
5. As previously referenced, the Jesuit and Franciscan led Croatian Ustashi murdered the Orthodox Serbs and Jews of Bosnia and Serbia. As the Croatian dictator, Ante Pavelic, declared in 1941:
“He who could not cut away a child from his (Serbian) mother’s womb is
not a good Ustashi.” {49}
(Have the Jesuits used Bill Clinton to exterminate the Orthodox Serbs in the 1990s even as they used Ante Pavelic in the 1940s?)
6. As previously stated, the Catholic Slovaks, led by their dictator, Pope Pius XII’s priest Jozef Tiso, murdered Czech Protestants and Jews.
“ ‘The period of the Tiso regime, in Slovakia, was particularly distressing for the country’s Protestant Church, which comprises only one-fifth of the population. Monsignor Tiso was seeking to . . . eliminate it . . . influential members of the Protestant Church were sent to concentration camps . . . ’ The prelate-dictator attacked not only Protestants. He earned another glorious title: that of being the first to deport the Jews.” {50}
7. Between Catholic Hitler and Catholic Stalin the Jesuits not only eliminated Catholic Poland’s resistance to Nazi occupation, they massacred the Protestants of Prussia and East Germany. The Order then used Allied bombers to destroy Germany’s mostly Protestant cities including Dresden.
8. The Order, in control of the Japanese Emperor Hirohito and his warlord, Tojo, used the Imperial Army to persecute Protestants but bless the Catholic missionaries. The Jesuits declared in their review America in January of 1944:
“ . . . the American and English citizens arrested in the Pacific Islands, and in particular all the Protestant missionaries, were interned there in concentration camps which were in no way inferior to those of Germany. But . . . the 7,500 Catholic missionaries remained free, they received help and were officially protected by the Japanese military authorities.” {51} [Emphasis added]

9. Payback time had now come for Japan. The American Army Air Force fire-bombed the island and totally destroyed Nagasaki and Hiroshima. The future Jesuit General, Pedro Arrupe was near Hiroshima at the time of its destruction. Could he and his Jesuits have been involved in a nuclear detonation on the ground, as no tested atomic device had ever been detonated in the air while in motion?
“At 8:151⁄2 that August morning, every window in Arrupe’s residence at Nagatsuka was shattered by a roaring shockwave, and the sky was filled with a light he later described as [“a gigantic flare, like a magnesium flash” {52} being] ‘overwhelming and baleful’! By the time he and his community of Jesuits ventured out some thirty minutes later, a firestorm driven by a scorching 40 mph wind had enveloped Hiroshima . . . That evening, one of the first survivors to reach his house in Nagatsuka was a theological student sent by a fellow priest, Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, who had somehow survived the blast in the middle of Hiroshima [???]. From him, Arrupe got his first eyewitness accounts.” {53} [Emphasis added]
(Whether the atomic bomb detonated in mid-air – a technical feat which was unknown to human history as of August 1945 – or secretly on the ground (the device having been carefully constructed inside a closed building), the future Jesuit General knew all about it. For Pedro Arrupe greatly contributed in the laying of the “Nuclear War Hoax” – it being the foundation for that greatest of Jesuit Inquisitions called “the Cold War” – for which genocidal reason he became the Jesuit General in 1965!)
10. Like the first Thirty Years’ War when the Jesuits murdered Roman Catholic occultist Wallenstein, any General who refused to “play ball,” that is, follow orders from his superiors no matter how treasonous, was murdered by the Vatican’s intelligence agencies. Protestant Canaris sought to end the reign of Catholic Hitler and Protestant Rommel sought to bring his panzers to Normandy; both were murdered by the SS. Protestant Patton sought to attack the Jesuits’ Grand Inquisitor, Catholic Stalin, and was murdered by the OSS. Orthodox Vlasov, having united with the German Army on the Eastern Front, led his Russian patriots to fight the Red Army. For this he was betrayed by the OSS and murdered by the NKVD in 1946.
Dear truth-seeker, mathematics, the mother of all sciences, indicates that a central power controlled every intelligence agency during the war. In light of history and the maxims of the Council of Trent that power could only be the Jesuit General.

The Grand Finale of the Jesuits: The Second Thirty Years’ War
The stage is now set. The players are in position. The Jesuit General, Wlodimir Ledochowski, gives the order and war begins. By this time all the

Chapter 37
intelligence agencies are working together, overseen by the Vatican’s Jesuits. Roosevelt’s FBI and OSS, Hitler’s SS/SD, Churchill’s British Secret Intelligence Service, and Stalin’s NKVD are all working together to insure a successful extirpation of “heretics and liberals” pursuant to the Council of Trent.
It is to be a “Crusade in Europe” as Eisenhower called it. If any generals do not cooperate they will be relieved of command or murdered. To insure a prolonged European war the Jesuits will order Hitler not to destroy the British at Dunkirk. To give the Nazis ball-bearing plants the Jesuits will order pro Sinn Fein Churchill, given charge of the Admiralty, not to intervene timely when Norway is invaded. Having purged the Red army of its best Generals, officers and intelligence analysts from 1937 to 1940, including seventy-five of the eighty members of the “Military Soviet,” forty thousand officers, including nearly all the Jewish officers (indicating that the Jews did not rule Russia), half of the brigade commanders and over 400 of 456 staff colonels, the Jesuits’ Joseph Stalin will insure before the war begins that the “heretic” Orthodox Russians will retreat with twenty million being slaughtered during the largest continuous land war in the history of the world — the Nazi/SS Crusade of “Operation Barbarossa” (named after the famous German Emperor of Rome’s Third Crusade). In addition to providing thousands of tons of grain and petroleum to Hitler’s three million invaders, Stalin’s betrayal of the Russian people will also guarantee the extermination of hundreds of thousands of Russian Jews by the Jesuits’ four SS Einsatzgruppen. Indeed, Stalin and Hitler worked together both having Concordats with the Pope! To keep the Order’s Communist Russia from falling, the Jesuits will not allow Hitler’s Generals to easily capture Moscow, “snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.” To insure a successful western advance by Stalin’s Red Army, the German High Command will limit the shipment of arms to the retreating German Army. In “retaliation” for the Jesuits’ assassination of Heydrich (“the Blond Homosexual Beast” and “Butcher of Prague”) using Stephenson’s Secret Service, the Jesuits’ SS will murder the entire male population of the Protestant city of Lidice. (The Order controlled both sides.) The Jesuits’ Croatian Ustashi will carry out an open inquisition in Yugoslavia led by Ante Pavelic, murdering one million “heretic” Orthodox Serbians. To keep the Jews from escaping Europe the Jesuits will not allow Jewish immigration into Protestant England or America as well as Stalin’s Russia. To keep the mass murder of Jews as secret as possible, the forests of Roman Catholic Poland will be chosen to be the locations for the Nazi Death Camps. To eliminate organized resistance to Hitler’s plans for Poland, the Jesuits will use Stalin’s NKVD to murder fifteen thousand Roman Catholic Polish officers in the forests of Katyn. (Again, Stalin and Hitler worked together remembering the Jesuitical artifice of tyrants that “extremes meet.”) To keep Rommel the Protestant from opposing the Allied invasion at Normandy, he will be ordered back to Berlin and murdered by the Jesuits’ SS. To keep the Protestant Admiral Canaris from successfully ending the disastrous reign of Hitler and
The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945

prematurely surrendering Germany, he will be betrayed by the American OSS to the Vatican’s Jesuits, to the Nazi SS, only to be cruelly tortured to death. We read:
“Admiral Canaris, as a result of his patriotic and brave humanitarian efforts, was captured and hanged by Hitler, with an iron collar around his neck. It took thirty minutes for him to die!” {54} [Emphasis added]
To insure that the Battle of the Bulge would be fought, General Patton will not be allowed to capture the German Army by closing the Falaise Pocket in France. Thus two hundred thousand Germans would be allowed to escape, as the war must continue and more Jews must be killed in the East. To keep General Patton from talking after the war he will be murdered by an agent of the Jesuits’ OSS. We read:
“General Patton knew the score but he died ‘early’.” {55}
“In 1979, a former undercover agent for the Office of Strategic Services, the OSS, [now the CIA], gave an interview in which he claimed that he had been asked to kill Patton. This agent was ‘ . . . Douglas Bazata, a veteran intelligence agent, who said he received a contract on Patton’s life in 1944. According to Bazata, the order for the ‘hit’ came down to him from none other than the legendary Office of Strategic Services direct from [its administrator, Archbishop Spellman’s “most devoted” Irish Catholic Knight of Malta] ‘Wild Bill’ Donovan.’ It was Bazata’s contention that, although he collected more than $10,000 for the death of Patton, he was not responsible for Patton’s actual death. He claimed that he knows, however, who did kill him, and that Patton was killed by a dose of cyanide in the hospital where he was taken after the automobile accident, and that it was the cyanide rather than the accident that took his life.” {56} [Emphasis added]
To keep the valiant Russian General Andrei Vlasov and his Russian patriots from fighting against the Jesuits’ Red Army, the Order’s most obedient Freemason and future American President, General Dwight Eisenhower, will betray these disarmed men into the hands of the Grand Inquisitor — Joseph Stalin. We read:
“ . . . Roosevelt and Eisenhower approved of the forced repatriation of some six million [Orthodox] people back to Russia, many of whom were tortured or killed after they reached their destination. Two Russians who have written about this abominable decision of these American leaders are Nikolai Tolstoy and Alexander Solzhenitsyn. The Americans called this repatriation ‘Operation Keelhaul,’ after the naval form of punishment or torture where the prisoner is hauled under the keel of a ship by a rope tied to the prisoner’s body. These six million individuals were not only soldiers

who had fought on the side of the Germans against the Russians, but they were women and children as well. 700,000 of this total were soldiers under the command of the Lt. Gen. Andrei Vlasov, a brilliant Soviet officer and one of the heroes of the battle of Moscow in 1942. In April of 1945 [four months before the end of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War], General Vlasov led his troops to the American lines so that they could surrender and then volunteer to return to communist Russia and attempt to oust the Bolshevik government. They laid down their arms and considered themselves to be American Prisoners of War. Vlasov was informed that permission to pass through the American lines had been refused, so he had to order his unarmed men to save themselves as best they could. Most of them were forcibly repatriated back to Russia and executed. General Vlasov himself was taken from an American escort by Soviet troops and spirited to Moscow where he was later executed [tortured and hanged in the Jesuits’ Lubyanka] . . . Even though it was [33rd Degree Freemasons] Churchill and Roosevelt who made these incredible decisions to repatriate millions of anti-Communist Russians back to certain death, it was General Dwight Eisenhower who enforced ‘Operation Keelhaul,’ with no apparent pangs of conscience.” {57} [Emphasis added]
Further, General Eisenhower, Rome’s Supreme Allied Crusader in Europe, would murder nearly two million unarmed, anti-Communist, Lutheran Germans. We read:
“As this Second World War came to an end...Eisenhower, in his capacity as the supreme commander, expressed his life-long hatred of the German people by ordering war prisoners to be reclassified as “unarmed combatants” to evade the humane obligations of the Geneva Convention, and so committed one of the crimes of the century holding German prisoners behind barbed-wire stockades exposed to the elements without food or water, sanitation or medical supplies, in an ocean of mud and excrement. Over 1,700,000 soldiers died of deliberate exposure and starvation in this merciless act of savage barbarity.” {58} [Emphasis added]
(Yes, dear truth-seeker, Jesuit-controlled Churchill – who betrayed the Jewish People by creating the Arab/Moslem nation of Jordan – and FDR eliminated millions of anti-Communist, Orthodox Russians along with millions of anti-Communist, Lutheran Germans. If these condemned soldiers had been led by the murdered Generals, Patton, Rommel and Vlasov, they would have successfully overthrown the Jesuit-trained, bloody Joe Stalin and his Inquisition overseen by the Jesuit General. Because Dwight Eisenhower was Pope Pius XII’s willing tool through the Vatican’s Council on Foreign Relations, the Jesuits made him the President of the United States with the blessing of their puppet, Francis Cardinal Spellman.)

To further destroy Europe’s Protestant heritage, the Jesuits will order Hitler to steal all of the Protestants’ gold from the central bank in Lutheran Denmark. The Jesuits will also order the mass bombings of non-military targets such as the Protestant cities of Coventry and Dresden. To further the Council of Trent, having decreed “Accursed be all heretics,” all the military dictators with their intelligence agencies will act in concert to destroy European Jewry. After the war, Rome’s financial colossus, using their international traders in London, will rebuild and reunite Europe, its surviving populations being predominantly Roman Catholic.
In the Far East the Jesuits had a score to settle with Japan. Remembering that the shogun Iyeyasu had formally expelled the Jesuits in 1614, the Order had been barred from reentry for over two hundred and fifty years. So the Jesuits forced the shogun to resign, obtained control over Emperor Meiji, were formally readmitted in 1865 and ultimately orchestrated a war with the United States. We read in 1924:
“The next step in the Vatican’s Great scheme is to make war between this country and Japan after the latter country has been placed under full dominance of the Jesuits. The priests, monks and nuns of the Roman Church have been pouring into Japan from all over the world now for many years with that purpose in view. The writer was told by a Christian Japanese minister in charge of a Protestant mission in Los Angeles in reply to the question as to why the Jesuits, who had been barred for years from Japan had now been permitted to enter. He answered that the Roman Church had gotten into his country under the guise of Mohammedanism, and that after it was well entrenched threw off its disguise, and his country learned to its astonishment that it was to the Roman Church and its monastic orders it had opened its doors.
That the Roman-Catholic-controlled trade unions in California are at the bottom of most of the agitation against the Japanese in that State is a fact; that the Roman Catholic politician, James Phelan, was sent to the United States Senate in 1913 by the solid Roman vote, and has been the prime mover in the anti-Jap agitation, is also a fact.” {59} [Emphasis added]
By 1941, the Japanese and American governments, controlled by the Jesuits, were ready for war. Twenty-five years of anti-Jap agitation was ready to yield its bitter fruit. On December 7, 1941 the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor crippling the majority of the American Fleet — except the carriers. According to a Japanese Baptist Missionary, the late Daniel Fuji, he told the author the attack was provoked by a blockade of Japan called “the A, B, C, D line.” The American, British, Canadian and Dutch fleets blocked Japanese shipping, cutting off its oil, which, in International
The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945



Chapter 37 505
Law, was an act of war! So, the Japanese attacked, as FDR knew they were coming and did nothing, giving Congress a legitimate reason to declare war. We read:
“Roosevelt now knew that Japan planned on attacking the United States, but still he did nothing about warning the American forces at Pearl Harbor . . . Admiral Husband Kimmel, the commander of the naval forces at Pearl Harbor, clearly places the blame for Pearl Harbor’s unpreparedness on President Roosevelt. He has written: ‘We were unready at Pearl Harbor because President Roosevelt’s plans required that no word be sent to alert the fleet in Hawaii.’ ” {60}
The Jesuits were now ready to use their American Empire to destroy Imperial Japan and its Dynasty. Iwo Jima, Guadalcanal and Tarawa were some of the great bloody sacrifices “offered up” by the Jesuits. But the greatest burnt offering to the Jesuits’ “Queen of Heaven” – the Virgin Mary – was the firebombing of Japan and the atomic destruction of the old Jesuit dominions of Nagasaki (where, in 1622, many Jesuit traitors and their followers were rightfully executed) and Hiroshima.
On the ruins created by Boeing’s B-29 bombers, Japan was disarmed and rebuilt as a commercial colony to serve the interests of the Jesuits’ Fourteenth Amendment American Empire. The Company’s great tool in accomplishing the reorganization of Japan, as well as creating the hoax called “the Cold War,” was their thirty-third degree Freemason, General Douglas MacArthur.
The one who doubts that World War II was “managed” by an unseen hand, must deal with the following facts that have baffled historians for years. The “blunders” or “failures” by those in power, always benefiting the purpose of the Vatican’s Jesuits, are not by accident. A friend and graduate from Princeton has written the following for you, dear truth-seeker.
“In books on Europe during World War II you can find many maps. But the one that would tell you the most about what happened, and in my judgment why it happened, exists in no book I have seen. That is a religious map of Europe before and after World Wars I & II. Now in viewing such a map, for all you hear about the holocaust of millions of Jews, you would immediately see a greater religious consequence of the wars: The complete suppression of the Orthodox peoples under the Inquisition of the Atheistic ideology of Communism along with that bulwark of Lutheran Protestantism — Prussia and East Germany.
Many decisions against peace and victory were made on both sides. The religious results indicated in such a map were predetermined, evidenced by the course of the war. Therefore, it is worth briefly listing

Vatican Assassins
chronologically a few of the major ‘blunders’, so that one may, out of them, better evaluate the likelihood of a guiding hand directing the results of the war.
1919
The Treaty of Versailles imposed such an unfair burden of war repercussions on Germany, that when Clemenceau of France was asked by the press what they had given the world through the treaty, he said, ‘We have guaranteed another war in twenty years.’
1919
The United States, whose presence in the League of Nations could alone have prevented the Second World War, stayed out of the League.
1934
After the Reich’s Concordat with the Vatican, Hitler’s military planners made a mistake. This blunder occurred on the Russian front where two-thirds of the fighting took place and it proved to be fatal. Unlike the Brits, Hitler’s military planners ‘failed’ to build a long range, thousand-mile bomber to knock out Russian factories in the Urals.
1939
During the lull after the German invasion of Poland, and before the invasion of France known as “the phony war,” the negotiations conducted by Admiral Canaris of German Intelligence’s ‘Abwehr’ with England, through the Vatican as intermediary using the Pope’s diabolical Jesuit confessor and future Zionist, Robert Leiber, were disclosed through a Swiss newspaper, contributing to their ‘failure’.
1939 - 40
Knowing Norway was the geographical key to maintaining Swedish neutrality, whose steel was critical to the continuing of the German War Machine, and although in possession of intelligence, Churchill, as Lord of the Admiralty, ‘failed’ to attempt to defend Norway for over six weeks, doing too little, too late, and so Germany gained control of the Swedish steel needed for a long, protracted war.
The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945



Chapter 37
1940
When The British Expeditionary Force, key to the defense of the British Isles, was cornered at Dunkirk on the French coast for three days it could have been wiped out, making Britain an easy prey for invasion. But Hitler ‘failed’ to do so, as he personally countermanded the requests of his Generals to attack and allowed three hundred and fifty thousand British to escape by boat changing the whole course of the war. [As “Stonewall” Jackson was forbidden by Jefferson Davis to capture Washington after the First Manassas, so the German Generals were forbidden by Hitler to destroy the British at Dunkirk indicating that both wars were to be Crusades – Papal wars of annihilation – against historically and predominantly White Protestant peoples.]
1940
In North Africa the Brits were defeating the Italians and looked to rout them entirely, but ‘failed’ in that they paused long enough to let the Germans reinforce the Italian positions, insuring a long North African Campaign and thereby preventing the invasion of Italy for years.
1941
Russia — We can hardly even try to do justice in a few lines to the colossal ‘stage set’ where most of World War II was fought, in the ‘former Soviet Union’; we will only try to state three points. First, one military analyst has written that despite the six-week delay in the invasion of Russia caused by the uprising of the Serbian people, the Germans had in August-September of 1941 a ninety-seven percent chance of conquering the Soviet Union and would have done so had it not been for ‘decisions’ or ‘blunders’ made by Hitler from Berlin over the objections of his Generals. Secondly, the German invaders were at first welcomed as liberators in much of the Soviet Union, notably the Ukraine. And, if they had intelligently enlisted the support of the peoples, rather than brutalize them via the Jesuits’ SS, they would have defeated Stalin in spite of Hitler’s wrong military decisions. Thirdly, Stalin had several intelligence sources telling him Hitler was about to invade and refused to act to prepare the defense, allowing a quick, deep penetration by the Nazis and the death of millions of Orthodox Russians and Jews. With Hitler’s subsequent ‘failure’ to follow up on this military position or bring the peoples enslaved to communism to his side, the combination of ‘blunders’ led to the maximum death and

Vatican Assassins
destruction to the mostly Lutheran German Army and many millions of Orthodox peoples. The ‘blunders’ were made in obedience to and in accordance with the Jesuits’ Council of Trent and Extreme Oath.
December 7, 1941
Much has been written about FDR’s foreknowledge of the attack plans of the Japanese and his ‘failure’ to warn the Admirals at Pearl Harbor to insure that the United States could get into ‘the war’ on the side of England against Hitler. The significance of a very basic point is always neglected in these discussions. The United States declared war on Japan after Pearl Harbor, not on Germany! If Hitler, whose forces had just been bogged down and iced-in by the Russian winter, had not proceeded to commit one of the rashest acts in the history of world diplomacy, by unilaterally declaring war on the United States, Roosevelt would have been hard put to drag America into the war in Europe, which was not seen as necessarily closely connected to the War in Asia. Hitler got nothing for Germany out of his ‘foolish’ declaration. He ‘failed’ to even attempt to get Japan to declare war on Russia in the East, though that, by opening up a second front, would have made much more likely a German victory in the West over Russia. It was a staggering mistake, strongly indicative that Hitler danced to someone else’s tune — the tune of the Jesuits’ ‘infallible’ Pope with whom he had a Concordat.
1943
Churchill talked about “the soft underbelly” of Europe but instead directed the Allies up what amounts to “a porcupine ridge” in Italy. A rapid invasion could have been made through Montenegro and Serbia, which, being the only active guerilla war in Europe, was already holding down fifteen to twenty German Divisions, and was without the general uprising, which would have occurred immediately upon an Allied assault. This, however, would have brought the war to a close in early 1944, and would have put Eastern Europe in the hands of the West, neither of which was intended. Instead, Italy was invaded in about the hardest and most ignorant way. If victory had been the object, the Generals would have gone for the capital, Rome, landing amphibiously on any number of close shore points and driving straight to the city, taking the enemies’ natural base and mopping him up from there. Circling Sicily to take its capital, then letting the German army escape by boat unimpeded to the main peninsula [as Meade allowed Lee to escape from Gettysburg unimpeded] was only the beginning of the

Chapter 37
follies – ‘the blunders’ – tragic to so many allied soldiers and their families (including Shriner Freemason Bob Dole). For much of the next year, the Allies fought against stiff resistance up the spine of the mountains, an excuse being made that they lacked boats to make the strategically obvious landing near Rome. But that such was just an excuse is made plain by the way in which the one major amphibious landing in Italy at Anzio was conducted. They landed, and waited on the beach for forty-eight hours for the Germans, caught by surprise, to arrive. Reconnaissance jeeps went out, reaching the outskirts of Rome and the invasion force could have followed; but instead, the force stayed put so they could have several months of World War I style trench warfare which resulted in the deliberate sacrifice of all but six of Darby’s seven hundred U.S. Rangers, betrayed by their High Command.
The policies of Roosevelt and Churchill [Churchill, like Hitler, also advocated the 19th Century Jesuit doctrine of an “International Jewish Conspiracy”] – who throughout the war maintained an active personal correspondence with Mussolini (the man who restored the Temporal Power to the Jesuits’ “infallible” Pope) – were carried out to perfection, and the taking of Rome with its Vatican, the second capital of the Axis, was delayed until June 5, 1944, one day before ‘D-Day’. So rather than the Roman Catholic hierarchy being embarrassed for its support of the Axis, its shame was quickly driven off the front pages by the Normandy Invasion, the Allies having ‘failed’ to timely capture Rome.
July 1944 to April 1945
The Division of Europe, placing Lutheran Protestant Prussia and East Germany under the Inquisition of Atheistic Communism.
At least three major ‘blunders’ had to take place to keep the American-English Allies from taking Berlin and Eastern Germany. First, there was the failure to destroy the critical core of the German army in the West by the basic maneuver of an encircling action, the closing of ‘the Falaise Pocket’ in France allowing two hundred thousand Germans to escape while ensuring the blood-bath called ‘The Battle of the Bulge’. Secondly, there was the complete intelligence ‘breakdown’ on the side of the Allies that ‘failed’ to recognize that the beefed up and returned German Army was about to attempt the breakthrough known as ‘the Battle of the Bulge’. Thirdly, there was the prevention of General Patton’s Army from blitzkrieging into Berlin and East Germany (where the German people were ready to welcome Americans and surrender to them, as this was the hope of the German Army in the East, fighting

fiercely against Stalin’s Red Army.) This deliberate forbidding of Patton to take Berlin (which would have resulted in surrender) combined with the all-out suicide assault by the Soviet Armies to take the Nazi capital (raping, pillaging and plundering all along the way), resulted in the slaughter of 600,000 more Russian soldiers than a sensibly conducted campaign would have killed, according to recent estimates by Russian intelligence sources.” {61} [Emphasis added]
All these “failures” and “blunders,” causing all this heartbreak and unnecessary death, were deliberately committed in fulfilling the Jesuits’ Council of Trent – the heart of the Counter-Reformation – in mass-murdering the “heretics” of East Germany, Prussia and Russia — the Lutheran and Orthodox peoples. The remainder were subjugated or exiled to the concentration camps of Siberia, overseen by Jesuits like the American Walter Ciszek, being under the iron heel of the Jesuits’ Roman Catholic, Communist Grand Inquisitor – the savage – Joseph Stalin.
Indeed, from 1914 to 1945, the Jesuits, pursuant to their Oath, killed nearly eighty million people through war, starvation and disease. Using their Masonic dictators, they waged relentless war on the Jews of Europe, Spanish Protestants, Catholic liberals, German Lutherans, Serbian and Russian Orthodox, Baltic Lutherans – in short – on all Protestant, Jewish and Orthodox “heretics and liberals” regardless of how many liberal Roman Catholic priests and people perished.
(Dear truth-seeker, this exact same scenario has been planned for the people of the American Empire and is presently in the making right here in our midst, within the last and greatest stronghold of the Protestant Reformation, the heart of the Lord Jesus Christ’s mission work in spreading the grand and glorious gospel to the uttermost parts of the earth, the last bulwark of Protestant liberties including the rights of privacy, freedom of conscience, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of movement and gun ownership secured by our Bill of Rights.)
Upon Hitler’s “death,” faked by the SS, and “funeral,” the Fuhrer being honored with “A Solemn High Requiem Mass” approved of by Pius XII (according to Eric Zuesse’s WHY the Holocaust Happened: Its Religious Cause and Scholarly Cover-Up) for a job well done, he subsequently escaped through the Vatican Ratlines to South America. Meanwhile, Franco’s Jesuit-controlled press declared:
“Adolf Hitler, son of the Catholic Church, has died defending Christianity [Romanism]. It is understandable that our pen cannot find words with which to deplore his death, when it was able to find so many to extol his life. Above his mortal remains rises his victorious moral figure. With the crown of martyrdom, God [the “infallible” Pope] gives to Hitler the laurels of Victory.” {62} [Emphasis added]
The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945



Chapter 37 511
This brings us to our final point. The Jesuits, in attempting to totally destroy the risen Son of God’s Protestant Reformation on the Continent, blamed the Nazi Holocaust of European and Russian Jewry on the German Lutheran Church. Over the years the Sons of Loyola, while secretly teaching at the German Lutheran Tubingen University during their formal suppression by the Pope, altered some of the writings of the Bible-believing Martin Luther. They sought to and succeeded in portraying the great Reformer to be a rabid, Jew-hating religious bigot, as though he was Ignatius Loyola himself! The Masonic Jewish Zionists, being “the altar boys of the Pope,” promote this lie throughout their Memorial to the Jewish Holocaust in Washington, D.C., while never revealing the Jesuit hand shaping and directing Pope Pius XII (through his Jesuit confessor, Cardinal Bea), the SS, Europe’s concentration camps, and Roman Catholic Poland’s death camps hidden deep within her forests.
This is one of the greatest and boldest effronteries with which historic Protestantism – wrought by the Spirit of God through the Word of God – has ever been attacked, outraged or assaulted. For we Bible-believing Protestants and Baptists know that White Protestant nations have never persecuted the Jews racially or religiously unless our governments, secretly or openly, have been usurped by the Militia of the Papal Caesar. Did not the Calvinist, William I of Orange, give refuge to the persecuted European Jews in his Dutch Republic, as those homeless and tempest-tossed outcasts from Roman Catholic nations flocked to Amsterdam calling it “the New Jerusalem”? Did not Oliver Cromwell, England’s Defender of the Protestant Faith, readmit the Sons of Jacob into his Commonwealth? Was not White Protestant South Africa the safest haven on that savage and filthy Black Islamic Continent for the descendants of Abraham? Has not George Washington’s Calvinistic United States, founded upon The Authorized King James Version of the Bible of 1611 and with its Constitution securing Protestant and Baptist liberties, become the greatest haven in the history of the world for the wandering Jews during the worldwide Diaspora, foretold by Moses the prophet during which time Israel is “the tail of all nations” (Deuteronomy 28:13, 44), until their final regathering and restoration in Messiah’s Kingdom? Of that Diaspora, during which we Bible-believers should bless and not curse the Jews, Hosea the prophet wrote:
“For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim [no Nation and no Temple]:
Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days . . . for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.

After two days [possibly two thousand years] he will revive us:
in the third day [possibly one thousand years in Messiah’s Kingdom] he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.”
– Hosea 3:4, 5; 6:1, 2
Further, did not Lutheran Denmark deliver all of her Jews from Rome’s Nazis by secretly ferrying them across the waters to neutral Lutheran Sweden? Did not Reformed Holland do all she could to save her Jews from being deported to Auschwitz and Treblinka? Did not Luther himself read and believe the Apostle’s Letter to the Romans teaching love and forbearance to the unbelieving Jews, while God the Father has temporarily set aside His elect and beloved Nation, in declaring:
“Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved . . .
I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin . . .
[“Mordecai the Jew” was also of the tribe of Benjamin. (Esther 2:5)]
Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles [prosperous Bible-believing Gentile nations], how much more their fulness [in Messiah’s Kingdom]?
For if the firstfruit [Abraham] be holy, the lump [the Jewish Race] is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches . . .
Boast not against the branches [the Jewish Race] . . .
For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in . . .
As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ [Abraham, Isaac and Jacob’s] sakes . . .
For as ye [Gentiles] in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief . . .
Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision [the Jewish Race] for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers [Abraham, Isaac and Jacob]:

Chapter 37 513
And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.”
– Romans 10:1 – Romans 11:1, 12, 16, 18, 25, 28, 30 – Romans 15:8, 9
Are we to believe this fearless man of God, the great champion of the doctrine of Justification by Faith alone, the center of attention at the Diet of Worms where he courageously made his immortal confession before the Papal Legate, the Emperor and hundreds of nobles ruling the Pope’s Holy Roman Empire, would hatefully malign the Jewish Race of the Lord Jesus Christ revealed in both the Old and New Testaments as opposed to the false Christ of Rome? Would this man, knowingly enjoying the protection of the risen Son of God from the hands of a multitude of Papal assassins, advocate murder and theft clearly condemned by the very Bible he had so diligently worked to translate into the language of his beloved German people? We read the following supposed words of Luther authored by his Jesuit slanderers and feel our blood begin to boil as we reach for our Swords of Just Defense:
“What shall we Christians do with this rejected and condemned people, the Jews? . . . I shall give you my sincere advice:
First, to set fire to their synagogues or schools and to bury and cover with dirt whatever will not burn, so that no man will ever again see a stone or cinder of them . . .
Second, I advise that their houses also be razed and destroyed. For they pursue in them the same aims as in their synagogues. Instead they might be lodged under a roof or in a barn, like the gypsies . . .
Third, I advise that all their prayer books and Talmudic writings . . . be taken from them . . .
Fourth, I advise that their rabbis be forbidden to teach henceforth on pain of loss of life and limb . . .
Fifth, I advise that safe-conduct on the highways be abolished completely for the Jews [the very safe-conduct which saved Luther’s life from the kidnappers of the Papal Legate who would have brought him to Rome for his trial and execution?] . . .
The Jesuits – 1914 - 1945

Sixth, I advise that all cash and treasure of silver and gold be taken from them and put aside for safekeeping . . .
Seventh, I recommend putting a flail, an ax, a hoe, a spade, a distaff, or spindle into the hands of young Jews and Jewesses and letting them earn their bread in the sweat of their brow, as was imposed on the children of Adam [forced labor] . . .
Accordingly, it must and dare not be considered a trifling matter, but a most serious one, to seek counsel against this and to save our souls from the Jews, that is, from the devil and from eternal death [Rome’s Jesuit doctrine of salvation by works so hated by Luther? How crazy!] . . .
Burn down their synagogues, forbid all that I enumerated earlier, force them to work, and deal harshly with them, as Moses did in the wilderness, slaying three thousand lest the whole people perish [Moses never slew them!] . . . There it would be wrong to be merciful and confirm them in their conduct. If this does not help we must drive them out like mad dogs, so that we do not become partakers of their other vices and thus merit God’s wrath and be damned with them [again, the Jesuits’ heresy of salvation by works whereby they can make a man commit the most horrid of crimes for which he will be rewarded in the heaven of Jesuit making].” {63} [Emphasis added]
(Did not Jesuit Generals Ledochowski (1915-1942) and Janssens (1946-1964), using their Society of Jesus in control of Roman Catholic Hitler’s Nazis and the Jewish Zionists, do all these things to the pitiful Jews of Europe only sixty years ago?)
Dear truth-seeker, Martin Luther never wrote these words, as they do not comprise his style nor contain his Biblical convictions. These are the cruel words of the Jesuits betraying their doctrines championed by their evil Council of Trent! These doctrines were further advocated in Hitler’s Mein Kampf, the volume having been secretly authored by a priest working for the Company, Bernhardt Stempfle. This was further calculated to unite Bible-rejecting Lutherans, corrupted by the rationalism of the Jesuits having penetrated their seminaries, and Roman Catholics of Germany against the Jewish Race — even as the Jesuits are doing in Fourteenth Amendment America at this very moment! Indeed, the Society of Jesus is presently doing the exact same thing right here within the post-Reformation, apostate, Bible-rejecting, atheistic, socialistic and Jesuitized American Empire. From the beginning of World War I to the end of World War II, the Jesuit Order turned these Jew-hating doctrines into deeds while taking vengeance on a Europe and an Asia having expelled the Company during the Nineteenth Century — its “Century of Disaster.”

Yes, dear truth-seeker, this was the Jesuit General’s Second Thirty Years’ War, fought and paid for by his Fourteenth Amendment “Holy Roman” American Empire and Federal Reserve Bank! Yes, the two greatest mass-murderers of the Twentieth Century, Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler, were financed by us, the American People, through our American banks in New York! What in the name of Jesus Christ will be our horrendous coming retribution? A great English Bible believer, through his farsightedness, gave us the answer in 1899 when he wrote:
“We should tremble for the safety of that nation whose leading men banished Christ from their councils, and denied . . . the providential interference of God. We should shortly expect to see Him visiting that land with His four sore judgments, laying bare His arm in anger, and casting it down from the high place which it may now occupy among the nations of the earth.” {64} [Emphasis added]
We must conclude with the words of the Roman Catholic Shriner Freemason R. W. Thompson, an ex-Secretary of the American Navy and the only American to write an extensive history of the Jesuit Order, proclaimed in 1894:
“[The Jesuit General] occupies the place of God, and must be obeyed, howsoever the peace and welfare of the multitude may be imperiled, or the nations be convulsed from center to circumference. The society of Jesuits must obtain the mastery, even if general anarchy shall prevail, or all the world besides be covered with the fragments of a universal wreck!” {65} [Emphasis added]
Oh my Father! We deceived Americans, Protestant and Baptist blind patriots, fighting the Pope’s wars, paying the Pope’s income tax and believing the Pope’s press for the last one hundred years, have provoked to wrath the risen Son of God once again! Oh when shall it end? Or has the Son of God determined upon our great nation’s just annihilation – at the hand of the Black Pope whom we have served – in order that “the gates of hell,” manned by the Devil’s Jesuits, might not prevail against His beloved, elect, Bible-reading Church within other countries? May we repent of our sins, may we return to the old paths of our righteous, White Celtic-Anglo-Saxon Protestant and Baptist-Calvinist forefathers, and may we resist Satan’s evil
“...mystery of iniquity...,”

The Jesuit Order had agitated all of Europe with “the Jewish Question” for nearly fifty years.

Ex-Basilian (Jesuit-controlled) Charles E. Coughlin, 1891 – 1979 #140 Calling at FDR’s White House Early in 1936 A powerful speaker successfully agitating the desperate American people during the 1930s, Jesuit-controlled Coughlin was a past member of the communist “Community of St. Basil” having been formed by “ex-Jesuits” during their Suppression from 1773 to 1814. This Jew-hating, corporate socialist fascist, was a close advisor of President Franklin Roosevelt. Although later openly critical of FDR during his second term, pro-Nazi Coughlin was a backer of FDR’s socialist New Deal, even as his brother Jesuit and New Deal Democrat, Robert Hartnett. Intended to further destroy the nation’s White Anglo-Saxon Protestant Middle Class, the New Deal included the numbering of every American with a “Social Security Number,” the forerunner of the number of the beast. Like all good Jesuits under orders, he blamed the evils of the Federal Reserve Bank on the Jewish Race. But the bank’s true master, managed by the New York Knights of Malta, was his secret “Father General,” the Black Pope. Father Coughlin and the New Deal, Charles J. Tull, (Syracuse, New York: Syracuse University Press, 1965).

Harold Macmillan at the Vatican, 25 May 1945 #145 British Minister Resident in the Mediterranean At Yalta, with the fate of all displaced Soviet citizens having been decided, the Western Allies (1945-1947) handed over two million anti-communist Soviet refugees who were then shot or shipped to the death camps of the Black Pope’s Gulag Archipelago. According to Nikolai Tolstoy in his masterpiece, The Minister and the Massacres, presently banned in England and for which he was sued over one million English pounds, Harold Macmillan was the villain who gave the betrayal order carried out by the Supreme Allied Commander, Field Marshal Alexander. Being identical to the Order’s Katyn Forest massacre during which the Soviet NKVD shot and buried 15,000 anti-communist, patriotic, Roman Catholic Polish officers, this infamy resulted in nothing less than mass-murder, including 40,000 pro-Tsarist Cossacks and thousands of anti-communist, patriotic, Roman Catholic Slovaks. For his obedience in eliminating the political enemies of Jesuit-trained Joseph Stalin, Macmillan went on to become the Prime Minister of England with the blessing of Pope Paul VI. Above, this English “Jesuit of the short robe” has met with Pope Pius XII with whom he had “a long and moving talk.” Most assuredly, Macmillan was well received and well rewarded for obeying the Order’s evil Council of Trent.

“The Jesuits are one of the largest stockholders in the American steel company, Republic and National. They are also among the most important owners of the four greatest aircraft manufacturing companies in the U.S., Boeing, Lockheed, Douglas and Curtis-Wright.” {3}
Avro Manhattan, 1983 “Protestant” Knight of Malta English Historian The Vatican Billions
The Great and Terrible Second Thirty Years’ War was now over. Europe, Russia, North Africa, China and Japan were “a universal wreck” thanks to the Company of Jesus. Millions of “heretics and liberals” had been “extirpated” pursuant to the Jesuit Oath and the Council of Trent. Unlike the Treaty of Westphalia ending the First Thirty Years’ War, the agents of the Jesuits controlled the negotiations at Yalta and Potsdam ending the Second Thirty Years’ War. The Protestant British Empire, having founded modern missions, including the China Inland Mission, was fragmented and would be destroyed after World War II.
It was time to apply the Jesuits’ Hegelian Dialectic worldwide. It would be known as “the Cold War.” The thesis and antithesis would be “the Free World” in the West versus “the Communist Block” in the East. The American Empire would head the West and the Russian Empire would lead the East. Both sides would be financed by the Jesuits’ International Banking Cartel centered in London and New York, the Federal Reserve and Chase Manhattan Banks in particular.
The synthesis would be the destruction of the American Empire through the so-called “ending of the Cold War.” The illusion of ending the Cold War would legally enable Rome’s Corporate Monopolies, federated together in New York City under the leadership of the Council on Foreign Relations, to give Russia and China high technology and financial backing. The giving of these necessities would perfect the War Machines of both economically communist and politically fascist giants for the purpose of invading North America, it containing the majority of the world’s Protestants, Baptists and Jews. (Remember dear truth-seeker, the Jesuit General has used his American Empire throughout “the American Century” to restore the Pope’s Temporal Power and to exterminate “heretics” and “liberals” around the world. That task being completed, the ending of the Cold War signaled the beginning of the destruction of Fourteenth Amendment America in dead earnest!) It is for these reasons that the financial might of Hong Kong was given to Red China along with an American Naval Base in Long Beach, California. (In 1998 the China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO) signed a backroom deal to take over the strategic Long Beach

Naval Station in Southern California.) It is for these reasons that the Panama Canal, built with American blood, sweat, tears and Yellow Fever, was given away to Panama to be operated by a Chinese corporation, imperiling the American Navy. It is for these reasons that the Jesuits in control of Washington have established nationwide gun registration for the purpose of nationwide gun confiscation just as they did in Hitler’s Germany. It is for these reasons that the Jesuits, with their fascist, international, cartel-capitalist corporations managed by the Knights of Malta, have financed and continue to build both the Russian and Chinese War Machines, while influencing American Presidents to close down scores of military installations across the country. These facts spell invasion – massive invasion – by millions of foreign soldiers with no God and no mercy. And if the Jesuits can manage to blow up the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem and blame their American Empire for it, the Arabs will declare “a jihad” – a Moslem holy war – against the “infidels” of “the Great Satan.” (For, if the Jesuits used the Moslem Turks to massacre two million Orthodox Armenian “heretics” in the 1890s/1910s; and if the Company used the Moslem Arabs to mass-murder the Protestant and Catholic Spanish “liberals” in the late 1930s; and if the Sons of Loyola used the Moslem Albanians to destroy the Orthodox Serbian “heretics” in the late 1990s; then would not those sons of Satan hire a huge, agitated, invading Moslem host to pillage and destroy the Protestant and Baptist American South — the last great fortress of Protestantism in the world excepting Northern Ireland and South Korea? Indeed they would!) The private wealth of Americans using International Business Corporations with bank accounts in the Bahamas will be seized just as they were in Castro’s Cuba. (The Knights have moved all their wealth into European banks denominated in Franks and Marks as well as in the Pope’s Euros, thereby escaping the coming American social catastrophe and economic collapse.)
Meanwhile as the Jesuits, with their American dictator’s internal police – the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) – and foreign invaders, are “extirpating the execrable race” of American “heretics” and “liberals,” the European nations will be driven to lay down their historic differences and unify. This unification will restore the Holy Roman Empire for which reason the Jesuits are rapidly rebuilding Berlin. When the smoke clears, China will control the East, Russia will control the North and a unified Roman Catholic Europe will control the West. Further, the Jesuit General’s International Intelligence Community, overseeing the United Nations while controlling Israel’s Masonic Jewish Zionists through the CIA/Mossad, will see to it that Jerusalem is declared to be an international UN city with Solomon’s rebuilt Temple in her midst. This Third Temple will be rebuilt by the International Brotherhood of Shriner Freemasons – the modern-day Knights Templars – many of which having feigned themselves to be the descendants of the House of David through King Solomon or James, the half-brother of the Messiah (Messiah’s name being “salvation” according to Isaiah 62:11), despite Rome’s destruction in 70 AD of all legitimate genealogical records within Herod’s Temple.

The Lord Jesus Christ will secretly appear for His true, Bible-believing Church:
“In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound . . . we shall all be changed . . . ”
– I Corinthians 15:51, 52
“For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord.”
– I Thessalonians 4:16, 17
After this specific departure of His Church from the earth, then shall
“ . . . that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;
Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.”
– II Thessalonians 2:3, 4
World government will ensue and the Jesuits’ “blessed despotism” of the Dark Ages – the New World Order – will be in force. The risen Pope will rule his “Empire of the World” as revealed in The Secret Plan (1948), being “the King of Israel,” “Patriarch of the World,” “King despot over all the earth,” and “Pope of the Universe,” so vividly described in The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion (1905), he being the “World Authority” of The Documents of Vatican II (1965). Meanwhile the Holy Spirit will restrain Satan’s “man of sin” – the risen Pope – from coming to power
“ . . . until he [the Holy Spirit] be taken out of the way.
. . . that he [the risen Pope] might be revealed in his time.”

In order to achieve the international dictatorship of one man, the nations had to be rebuilt and aligned into “blocks” pitted against each other after World War II. This

would be called “the Cold War.” The rebuilding of Europe and Japan would be financed by the Jesuits’ Wall Street bankers and their Federal Reserve Bank. The government of Fourteenth Amendment America would call this “foreign aid” justifying more taxation, further destroying the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant Middle Class. The historic Catholic and Protestant nations of Western Europe would be “united” into the “North Atlantic Treaty Organization” (NATO) against a common enemy. That enemy, deliberately created by the Jesuits at Yalta, would be Joseph Stalin’s “USSR” and satellite nations called “The Warsaw Pact.” With “the Iron Curtain” (the term having been first coined by the Jesuit-trained Nazi Minister of Propaganda, that “demon of a dictatorship” and “the ultimate Machiavellian” Joseph Goebbels) and “the Bamboo Curtain” erected, these “blocks” would be in a ready state of war for forty-five years. Under the guise of preparing to go to war with the West – the West that built their Military Industrial Complexes – “the Cold War” was in fact conducted against “liberal” and “heretic” populations by fascist-communist, Jesuit-controlled dictators. By the end of 1989 the crimes of the Jesuits’ Holy Office of the Inquisition, under the guise of “communism,” would claim nearly one hundred million victims. We read from Europe’s bestseller, The Black Book of Communism:
“The following rough approximation, based on unofficial estimates, gives some sense of the scale and gravity of these crimes:
USSR: 20 million deaths China: 65 million deaths Vietnam: 1 million deaths North Korea: 2 million deaths Cambodia: 2 million deaths Eastern Europe: 1 million deaths Latin America: 150,000 deaths Africa: 1.7 million deaths Afghanistan: 1.5 million deaths
The total approaches 100 million people killed.” {4}
All this had been planned prior to the beginning of World War II.
This state of affairs called “the Cold War” was a hoax. For, how could the government of Soviet Russia be truly the enemy of the United States government and Western Europe if the Knights of Malta, controlling Wall Street in New York and the Government in Washington, financed the Bolshevik Revolution and the building of the Russian War Machine before, during and after “the Cold War”? The only sane conclusion is that the men who control the government in Washington control the government in Moscow. Both governments were kept in line by the Vatican’s intelligence agencies, the CIA and the KGB (now the SVR), which prevented the

Chapter 38
phony “Cold War” from erupting into a shooting war. The Jesuits’ government in Moscow, in control of the Russian Army, is truly an enemy of the American people, but not the American government! Both governments are bosom buddies controlled by the Knights of Malta subordinate to the Jesuits in control of the Vatican. With regard to post-war Germany, “the Cold War” would justify the merging of Hitler’s intelligence group with FDR’s intelligence group known today as the American CIA and the German BND. This merger would create the Vatican Ratlines enabling fifty thousand Nazis to escape from Europe. Stalin’s “stealing” of East Germany’s industrial base and the “kidnapping” of her top physicists would further the illusion that “the Cold War” was indeed a reality while further building the Jesuits’ Red War Machine. Concerning the building of the Soviet military, in Gary Allen’s The Rockefeller File (prefaced by the late great Congressman Larry McDonald who, in the midst of calling for a Congressional investigation of the Jesuits’ Council on Foreign Relations, was murdered while flying on a civilian jet-liner – shot down by a Soviet MIG fighter aircraft – thereby greatly benefiting the Jesuit Order), we read:
“It is not an exaggeration to say that the USSR was made in the USA . . . In order to rescue the Bolsheviks . . . the Chase Manhattan Bank was instrumental in establishing the American-Russian Chamber of Commerce in 1922 . . . As part of the massive effort to build the Communist economy by looting the United States, on credit, Richard M. Nixon appointed William J. Casey [a Knight of Malta and Director of the CIA during the Reagan Administration] as president of the Export-Import Bank. Casey, a member of the Rockefeller-controlled CFR, is the perfect man for the job that [Masonic Jewish Zionist Henry A.] Kissinger and the Rockefellers have in mind. . . . The first of the giant projects we are inflating our currency to build on credit for our Bolshevik brothers is the Kama River factory, which is to be the largest producer of trucks in the world. . . . The Kama River factory will produce 150,000 heavy trucks and 150,000 heavy engines per year. This output is greater than the combined production of such trucks by all factories in the United States. The complex is being built by a division of the Pullman Company at a cost of two billion dollars. The Soviets are going to put up ten percent of the cash for the project, while David Rockefeller’s Chase Manhattan Bank [headed by Knight of Malta Francis X. Stankard] and the Export-Import Bank will each advance forty-five percent. . . . This cannot be wholly the result of accident. For fifty years the Federal Reserve-CFR-Rockefeller-Insider crowd has advocated and carried out policies aimed at increasing the power of their satellite, the Soviet Union.” {5} [Emphasis added]
Dear truth-seeker, do you now understand why the Jesuits would not allow Hitler’s army in the East to capture Moscow, as a former SS man told the author his

army was only eighteen kilometers away and forbidden to fire a shot! Do you now understand why the Jesuits would not allow Admiral Canaris to prematurely surrender Germany to the Americans? Do you now understand why General Patton, who wanted to unite the surrendered German Army with his Third Army for the purpose of attacking the secret Jesuit Empire of Soviet Russia (just as the Jesuit SS General Heinrich Himmler supposedly sought to do for which he was “stripped of his powers,” ordered “to be shot” by Jesuit-controlled Hitler and was later “poisoned” by the SIS thereby escaping the rage of Allied justice), was murdered by the Jesuits’ OSS? Do you now understand why General Vlasov, who sought to liberate Russia leading his hundreds of thousands of patriotic Russian soldiers, was betrayed into the bloody hands of Joseph Stalin by that filthy pig and coward, General Eisenhower? Do you now understand why every order Hitler gave from his bunker in Berlin served only to destroy the German people, whose grandfathers had expelled the Jesuits in 1872? Do you now understand why the American Empire throughout the entire Cold War has given food, technology and high finance to the “USSR?” The Cold War served tremendous purposes for the Jesuits in control of the Vatican and it had to be maintained until those purposes were fulfilled by 1990. Those purposes were not only the building of the Russian War Machine and its intelligence community, the KGB, with its opposite number, the CIA espionage state in Fourteenth Amendment America, but the using of the staged opposition between these two “superpowers,” in attempting to force nations into alignment with one or the other, creating a United Nations world police state in the hands of the Black Pope. We must not forget that by the end of the Cold War the Protestant British Empire – so hated by the Jesuit General’s “infallible” Pope – had been destroyed and sixty-five nations of the free world had been betrayed into the Jesuit-controlled Inquisitional dungeon of atheistic Communism. These merciless crimes created worldwide anti-Americanism another purpose of the Cold War – as we were and continue to be hated for allowing Rome’s CFR-controlled, socialist-communist, American government to spread and maintain the Jesuits’ Holy Office of the Inquisition.
What scare tactic could be used to force the peoples of the West into accepting as fact the great “Communist Threat” in the East thereby justifying “the Cold War”? It was the splitting of the atom creating a nuclear device that, when carefully detonated, unleashed mass destruction. This device, given to both sides, would justify the establishment of that criminal organization called “the United Nations” in New York. It would also coerce the peoples of the world into sacrificing their national sovereignties into the hands of a World Authority — the Papal Caesar.
Towards the end of World War II, the Jesuits, with their Manhattan Project, detonated a nuclear device. Using the American Army Air Force they destroyed the targets of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Washington, D.C. having refused terms for a Japanese surrender. (It is outrageous to realize that both cities were old Jesuit dominions. The future Jesuit General, Pedro Arrupe, was Rector and novice master

of the thirty-five man Jesuit Novitiate at nearby Nagatsuka when Hiroshima was destroyed. Unscathed, he must have known the devastation was coming – or must have participated in it – being one of the first to enter Hiroshima and to observe the effects of the Company’s terror weapon.) The hoax of “mutual airborne nuclear war” was successfully created. Upon the destruction of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, the devastation was strongly promoted by Archbishop Spellman’s media moguls, Knight of Malta Henry R. Luce and Knight of Malta Frank Capra. The mass destruction “proved” the impending doom of a “nuclear holocaust” justifying the creation of a new “peace-keeping” world authority – the treasonous United Nations – that will one day control Jerusalem’s Holy Mount while overseeing the rebuilding of a glorious new Third Temple — for the Pope! But the facts prove otherwise. At the time the only nuclear devices ever detonated were stationary and on the ground! None had ever been dropped by aircraft in testing. We will grant that objects, represented to the world as being “atomic bombs,” were dropped over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and that atomic explosions followed, as attested to by one of the pilots of Enola Gay while sailing with the author’s mother years later in the San Francisco Bay. But pilots and crews would have no way of knowing whether it was the objects dropped by them that exploded, or different objects already installed and in place at ground level. Further, according to engineer, author and pilot Captain Bruce L. Cathie in his Harmonic 33, nuclear detonations can only occur at certain places on the earth (called “grid points”) and at certain times. After an elaborate discussion he concludes:
“Until I am informed officially otherwise, I will maintain that the destruction of an atom depends on the geometric position of the triggering device, and the geometric position of the Sun [called “a window of opportunity”]. Is it possible to fight an atomic war on this basis? The whole thing would be completely illogical . . . the bomb has to be dropped on a pinpoint geometric position and during a certain instant of time, if it is to explode. [Dear truth-seeker, were the “bombs” dropped on Japan merely ”dirty” uranium and plutonium-laced magnesium flash devices coordinated with technical ground teams below, one of which was located at the Jesuit House in the middle of Hiroshima and from where the underground switch was thrown (after which all five Jesuits emerged having survived the blast), detonating the atomic device just as it was done at the proving grounds in the southwestern United States only a few weeks before? Is Edwin Corley’s fictional The Jesus Factor really true, that nuclear devices cannot detonate if they are in motion?]” {6}
Thus, an airborne thermonuclear war destroying mankind is a technological impossibility, and a pure fiction of Henry Luce’s Cold War propaganda. It is also unbiblical, as the Devil, indwelling his “risen” Papal Caesar turned “antichrist,” could never rule the world from Solomon’s rebuilt Temple and Jesus the Messiah could never fulfill the promises given to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and David.
The Jesuits – 1945 - 1989

Having perfected the fearful illusion of thermonuclear war, the Jesuits had to create a false enemy for the people of Fourteenth Amendment America. Americans, enjoying Protestant and Baptist liberties, must be enslaved to the fear of possible nuclear attacks, justifying more absolutist government. (This is why we American children during the 1960s were drilled to hide under our school desks due to simulated “Soviet nuclear attacks” when the ear-shattering air-raid sirens would sound, instilling in our young hearts fear and terror for the “invincible” Soviet Union.) So the Jesuits, through their Council on Foreign Relations in control of the American Military, gave the nuclear device to their Roman Catholic, Jesuit-trained, Grand Inquisitor Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin whose real Georgian last name, Djugashvili, means “Son of a Jew.” We read:
“Major George Racey Jordan, an officer in the United States Army during the Second World War, was the officer in charge of the transfer of the Lend Lease supplies through the Great Falls, Montana, air base. It was here that the planes were loaded with the transferable goods prior to their being flown to Fairbanks, Alaska, where the planes were flown into Russia by Russian pilots. Major Jordan, curious by nature, opened various briefcases and cartons, and saw various words he was not familiar with on various papers: uranium, cyclotron, proton, neutron, cobalt, and plutonium. In addition, Jordan discovered various reports from ‘Oak Ridge, Manhattan District’ (it was the ‘Manhattan Project’ in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the American scientists were developing the plans for the atomic bomb) containing phrases like ‘energy produced by fission.’ Jordan also discovered ‘ . . . at least three consignments of uranium chemicals . . . nearly three quarters of a ton. Confirmed also was the shipment of one kilogram, or 2.2 pounds of uranium metal at a time when the total American stock was 4.5 pounds!’ These findings meant little to Major Jordan until 1949, when Russia exploded their first atomic bomb. It was then that he realized that he had been witness to the transfer of the materials and plans for construction of Russia’s atomic bomb. And this occurred in 1943. Major Jordan’s charges were corroborated by a [non-fictional] novel written by James Roosevelt, the son of Franklin Roosevelt, in 1980. The dust cover of the book describes the contents of the novel, entitled A Family Matter. ‘President Roosevelt . . . makes a bold secret decision — to share the results of the Manhattan Project with the Soviet Union . . . The novel details how President Roosevelt gave Russia the plans for the atomic bomb in 1943 and 1944.’ [Since the USSR was at peace with Japan, could it be that the Order brought these materials into Japan via its Soviet agents, assembled the bomb in Hiroshima’s Jesuit House (Jesuit Priest Michael DeLisle Lyons having participated in the first A-bomb test at the Trinity site in Los Alamos) and then waited for the American B-29s to drop their magnesium flash bombs loaded with uranium blocks?]” {7}
The Jesuits – 1945 - 1989



Chapter 38 533
The Jesuits, in building their military machine in Russia, used FDR, the pawn of Archbishop Spellman and Knight of Malta Joe Kennedy, to give Stalin the nuclear device. This created a false enemy for the American people justifying huge budgets for the building of the FBI, CIA and the Military Industrial Complex. It would further enable the Jesuits to use their Shriner Freemason, “Dirty Harry” Truman, to suspend the Constitution putting the American Empire under a fascist, military dictatorship with the Emergency War Powers Act of 1950. (So dear reader, if you were worried about an attack by Russian missiles, you should know that the General Accounting Office reported that fifty-six percent of our Minuteman missiles were defective when they were installed in their silos. After decades of routine preventive maintenance it is possible that, in case of war, none of them would have left the ground, much less found their targets or exploded over them. If that is the American level of technique, how bad were the Russian Strategic Rocket Forces that is if the Russian missiles really existed. The only evidence for many of these missiles was the fact that some holes were dug in Siberia – a Russian province in which the Order’s first nuclear detonation was carried out in 1908, the gigantic blast destroying the swamp forest of Tunguska – while our satellites allegedly kept watch.)
Meanwhile, the nation needed a scapegoat for the treason of giving nuclear secrets to Stalin. Blaming the Jews, the Jesuits repeated the Dreyfus Affair using their darling Shriner Freemason, J. Edgar Hoover. Hoover, the Jew-hater and friend of Himmler prior to the war, fingered the Rosenbergs inciting anti-Jewish sentiment. This furthered the illusion of the worldwide “Jewish Anti-Christian Communist Conspiracy”; for, “it was the Jews that caused the Bolshevik Revolution and it was the Jews that gave Stalin the bomb.” To the disgrace of the American people, none came to the aid of the innocents, as the Rosenbergs were tried, convicted and murdered by the American Judicial System controlled by the Society of Jesus through its Council on Foreign Relations. With this war of attrition called “the Cold War,” the Jesuits continued to murder millions of “heretics” and political “liberals” without any declaration of war! Their Roman Catholic, Jesuit-trained, Russian Grand Inquisitor, with the KGB and Russian Military Intelligence (GRU), continued his secret arrests, torture and deportations to Siberia. The Great Russian Patriot, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who fully endorsed Nikolai Tolstoy’s Victims of Yalta, writes:
“Like medieval torturers [the Inquisitors of the Dark Ages], our interrogators, prosecutors, and judges agreed to accept the confession of the accused as the chief proof of guilt . . . After all, for the first time in human history the calculated torture of millions was being undertaken . . . This whole operation was stretched out over many years because it was of primary importance that it be stealthy and unnoticed. It was essential to clean out, conscientiously, socialists of every other stripe from Moscow, Petrograd, the ports, the industrial centers, and later on, the outlying provinces as well. This was a grandiose silent game of solitaire, whose

rules were totally incomprehensible to its contemporaries, and whose outlines we can appreciate only now. Someone’s far-seeing mind, someone’s neat hands, planned it all, without letting one wasted minute go by . . . Patience, overwhelming patience, was the trait of the person playing out the solitaire.” {8} [Emphasis added]
Dear truth-seeker, that person playing out the solitaire was none other than the General of the Jesuits, Wlodimir Ledochowski, as two of his qualifications according to the Society’s Constitutions were “prudence” and “solicitude.”
And who was Stalin’s guiding light while he turned Orthodox Russia into an Inquisitional dungeon? It is a historical fact that Stalin was greatly influenced by a Roman Catholic Cardinal, they both having attended the same Jesuit-controlled Russian Orthodox seminary in Georgia. Avro Manhattan tells us:
“Msgr. Gregory Agagianian, Patriarch of the Catholic Rite of the Armenian Church [was elevated by the ex-Jesuit Pope Pius XI] to the Patriarchate in 1937, a post which he held for 25 years thereafter . . . In 1946, anti-Communist Pope Pius XII made him a Cardinal . . . Cardinal Agagianian was expected to play a major role during the developing Cold War . . . The reason was that Agagianian was the top expert on the Soviet Union, Communism, and the Orthodox Church; . . . He was of Armenian origin, but a Georgian by birth. He had known Communism at first hand, having lived three difficult years as a young priest in Tiflis, Georgia, whilst the Bolshevist Revolution was raging. He spoke fluent Russian . . . Agagianian was also considered very special by Stalin himself [as both Joseph Stalin had been educated by, and Grigory Rasputin had been advised by the rector of the Order’s “Orthodox” Tiflis Theological Seminary, the Jesuit Spiritual Coadjutor and Orthodox Bishop Hermogen], the Cardinal having had the dubious distinction of attending the same Jesuit seminary [though “Russian Orthodox” in name] in Georgia as Stalin had done. This was a small, but significant, fact, . . . ” {9} [Emphasis added]
Indeed it was a significant fact! For in 1946 Pope Pius XII made Gregory Agagianian the Cardinal for the Russian Empire the same year he made Francis Spellman the Cardinal for the American Empire. What Agagianian was to Stalin with his KGB, Spellman was to Truman with his CIA. Both Cardinals were loyal to Jesuit General Jean-Baptiste Janssens as much as Pope Pius XII who had appointed them on the advice of his Jesuit confessor, Robert Leiber, who was later replaced by another Jesuit and pro-Zionist confessor, Augustin Cardinal Bea.
Stalin, who went on to restore the patriarchate so desired by Bishop Hermogen, also established absolute military dictatorships within the satellite nations

Chapter 38 535
loyal to his Jesuit masters in Moscow (from which the Order would train its world communist revolutionaries, like Yassir Arafat and Martin (Lucifer) King). These dictators would suppress the free circulation of the Bible and popular liberty.
So the Jesuits’ Cold War raged through the Fifties and Sixties, overseen by Agagianian in the East and Spellman in the West, murdering millions of “heretics and liberals” pursuant to the Jesuit Oath and the evil Council of Trent.
It is the same story in China, as the Order had a score to settle for their expulsion in 1783. True to form, the Jesuits used the American Empire’s Seventh Fleet to block Chiang Kai-shek’s planned invasion of Mainland China thereby enthroning (via the Black Pope’s CIA) “Chairman Mao,” who then expelled eight thousand Protestant missionaries. This merciless dictator, whose favorite pastime according to his wife was raping young Chinese virgins, murdered at least fifty million “heretic” and “liberal” Buddhist Chinese, including those who read the Bible or advocated popular liberty. He, as the head of the Jesuit Inquisition in the Far East, would also be responsible for the murder of millions in Thibet, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia in conjunction with American B-52 bombers!
To ensure the success of this Jesuit Inquisition against the Buddhists, the Order used Truman, a creature of the Jesuits’ evil Tom Pendergast’s Democratic machine, to relieve General Douglas MacArthur of command during the Korean War. As a result, the American Empire would never seriously resist the Jesuits’ mass murder in the Far East. The Empire’s new policy would be “no win wars” during this age of “violent peace,” further indebting the American people to the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank and destroying all confidence in their so-called “elected” leaders. In creating the false enemy of “Soviet and Chinese Communism” the Jesuits attained one of their ecumenical goals. It united Catholics and Protestants in the West, as it was perceived as a threat to them both. To give the appearance that Communism was a threat to Catholicism, the Roman Catholic nations of Poland and Hungary were put behind “the Iron Curtain.” To give the appearance that Communism was a threat to Protestantism – and it was and still is – the Protestant nations of East Germany and the Baltic States were put under Stalin’s boot, shipping thousands of Lutheran “heretics” to Siberia. This purposed deception did much to unite the Catholics and Protestants of Fourteenth Amendment America, led by Rome’s great Cold Warrior and Military Vicar, Cardinal Spellman. Hoodwinked, thousands of us young American men marched off to fight foreign wars for Rome, believing we were performing our patriotic duties in resisting “the Communist Threat.” The author spent three years in a “nuclear weapons area” in Germany sincerely believing that without our American presence in NATO, Western Europe would be overrun by “the Soviets.” Little did we know that both the Russian and Chinese Communist Empires were being financed by the Knights of Malta in New York and London. What a brazen deception having duped us all!
The Jesuits – 1945 - 1989

In addition to Cardinal Spellman, the Jesuit General publicly fanned the anti-Communist fire in the West. We read:
In a UPI story dated December 27, 1965, Father Pedro Arrupe, head of the Jesuit Order of the Roman Catholic Church [1965-1981], made the following charges during his remarks to the Ecumenical Council: ‘This . . . Godless society operates in an extremely efficient manner at least in its higher levels of leadership. It makes use of every possible means at its disposal, be they scientific, technical, social or economic. It follows a perfectly mapped out strategy: It holds almost complete sway in international organizations, in financial circles, in the field of mass communications; press, cinema, radio and television.’ [Is this not a perfect description of the socialist-communist Jesuit Order itself?]” {10} [Emphasis added]
According to one of our heroes, Alberto Romero de Rivera, C.J. (Company of Jesus – whose ex-Jesuit status has been validated by Jonas Shepherd of the Canadian Protestant League and Gerard Bouffard – Don Marie Bernard de Sienne, O.S.B. the Bishop of Guatemala (1976-1979) in spite of published and unpublished attacks by “Protestant” researchers such as Gary Metz), this same Jesuit General Arrupe was a Mason and a member of the communist party in Franco’s Spain. We read:
“The higher I went into the Jesuit Order, the more corruption I saw within the institution. I was invited to attend a secret black mass by high-ranking Jesuits in a monastery in the northern part of Spain. When I knelt to kiss the ring of a high official I saw a symbol on that ring that made my blood run cold. It was a Masonic symbol! A thing I hated and I had been told to fight against it. Everything was falling apart! I found out the Black Pope (the Jesuit General who actually runs the Vatican in Rome), behind the scenes was also a Mason and a member of the communist party in Spain. My head was spinning as I found out the Jesuit General was closely linked to the Illuminati in London. Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) was a member of the ‘Alumbrados’ which means the enlightened or ‘The Illuminati’.” {11} [Emphasis added]
Since the Jesuits were the masters of Russian Communism as well as the controllers of the Federal Reserve Bank we now understand why their bank in the West financed the Jesuits’ Inquisition in the East. Our fearless hero, Congressman Louis T. McFadden, once again alerted the American Congress in 1933:
“The Soviet government has been given United States Treasury funds by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks acting through the Chase Bank and the Guaranty Trust Company [both controlled by the Knights of Malta] and other banks in New York City . . . Open up the books

Find out what business has been transacted for the State Bank of Soviet Russia by its correspondent, the Chase Bank of New York . . . (Congressional Record, June 15, 1933).” {12}
Thus, the Jesuits, while raising a formal cry against the communist “USSR” and satellite nations, were secretly its masters accomplishing their goals during their Cold War of attrition. Under their communist-fascist dictators there would be no room for the free circulation of the Protestant Bible or the rise of popular self-government. This is why the Hungarian Revolution instigated by Allen Dulles and the CIA, was crushed in 1956, the Jesuits punishing freedom-loving Roman Catholics with their Russian Army. This is why the Jesuits used their CIA to betray freedom-loving Roman Catholic Cubans at the Bay of Pigs. The Dark Ages had been restored in the East as reflected in the doctrines of the Jesuits’ Council of Trent and Holy Alliance. The Jesuits’ fascist-socialist-communist-military dictators around the world were enforcing these doctrines of condemning the circulation of the Bible, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and freedom of conscience and gun ownership. At the same time the dictators secretly established the Temporal Power of the Pope.
The Jesuits’ Cold War of attrition, while suppressing the rise of popular government worldwide, murdered millions of “heretic” Buddhists, Orthodox, Protestants, Baptists and Jews along with the freedom-loving “liberal” Roman Catholics. The murder of Roman Catholic priests of other Orders, as well as a few freedom-loving Catholic people, was necessary to perpetuate the illusion that Stalin’s Soviet Communism was anti-Jesuit/Catholic (having “imprisoned” or rather stationed a ruling American Inquisitor, Jesuit Walter Ciszek, to manage Siberia’s Gulag Archipelago for fifteen years overseen by Cardinal Agagianian, and later returned to the U.S. under John F. Kennedy) while purging the priesthood of its “liberal” element. While Protestants and Catholics in the West were being united against the “Jewish Anti-Christian Communist Conspiracy” in the East, “the Cold War” justified the building of huge military industrial complexes and massive intelligence agencies on “both sides”! The military complexes would be subject to the intelligence communities and both sides would be financed by Vatican-controlled international banks, such as Chase Manhattan. (Is there not a Chase Manhattan Bank in New York and a Chase Manhattan Bank in Moscow as well as in Hong Kong?) Like the banks, the intelligence communities would be controlled by the Jesuits’ Knights of Malta and Shriner Freemasonry working together. (Did not Knight of Malta Lee Iacocca and Shriner Freemason Gerald Ford work together to repair the Statue of Liberty?) As always, the goal was to submit every nation to the Temporal Power of the Pope, as he would ultimately rule the world from Solomon’s rebuilt Temple in Jerusalem.
The Jesuits – 1945 - 1989

But how could the Temple of Solomon be rebuilt in order for Satan’s future Pope to place his throne there, after he destroys the Vatican and becomes “the abomination of desolation” as spoken of by Daniel the prophet and Jesus the Messiah? The Dome of the Rock has been built upon the Temple site and could never be removed as long as Jerusalem was in the hands of the children of Ishmael, so fanatically devoted to their false god Allah, evidenced by the reigning poverty, filth and oppression within Moslem nations. Who would take Jerusalem away from the Moslem, somehow destroy the Dome of the Rock and rebuild Solomon’s Temple — the ancient dream of the Popes having launched the savage and disgraceful Crusades? There is only one Order that would attempt such an undertaking. It is the Society of Jesus commanded by its sovereign god — the Black Pope!
Therefore, the General and his staff plan their work and then work their plan. Realizing that the Protestant British Empire was the most powerful military force in the world, he gained control of the monarchy in the person of King George III no later than 1800. Having absorbed the King, his Court and his Bank, the Order then harnessed the power of the world’s most penetrating intelligence network — the British Secret Intelligence Service. By 1856, the Order completed its Crimean War having used Great Britain, France, Turkey (Shriner Freemasons controlling Islam) and Sardinia to defeat Russia and her Orthodox political power in Palestine. By 1918, the Order, financed by its Federal Reserve Bank and Bank of England, will have completed the first phase of its Second Thirty Years’ War — World War I, including the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 having globally killed from forty to one hundred million people. During that time the Jesuit General will have used his British Intelligence Service and Lawrence of Arabia to unite the Arabs of Palestine in driving out the Ottoman Turks. He will have also used General Allenby to drive the Turkish Moslems out of Jerusalem — a major accomplishment!
And how would the Company maintain control of Palestine and Jerusalem won by its British sword? Enter the House of Rothschild with the Jewish Masonic Zionists. In 1918, the Jesuits would cause their Zionists in England to issue the Balfour Declaration declaring Palestine to be the new homeland for “The Wandering Jew.” Could it be that after nineteen hundred years of Rome’s crusades, inquisitions and pogroms the Jewish Race would now have a place to call its own? Or was Labor Zionism a setup for the greatest betrayal the Jewish Race has ever known?
Having secured Palestine for the Jews, how would the Jesuit General make them willing to return? Ah, he would raise up Adolf Hitler and, during the high point of his Second Thirty Years’ War (1940-1945), he would purge Europe of its “perfidious Jews,” so called by the Jesuits’ Secret Instructions of the Jesuits as well as Rome’s priests for centuries. In control of Roosevelt’s OSS, Churchill’s SIS and Stalin’s NKVD, “the Father-General” would not allow the desperate, persecuted

Israelites to enter the American, British or Russian Empires. They must, like sheep without a shepherd, be driven back to Palestine into the arms of Satan’s Nazi SS Major, the Masonic Moslem Grand Mufti of Jerusalem – Haj Amin al-Husseini (Yassir Arafat’s uncle) –another Grand Inquisitor whose future successor would aid the Order in destroying both Mosques of the city! World War II accomplished its purpose. Using the same Vatican Ratlines through which the Nazis were escaping from the Allied authorities in Europe (illegally, many were brought into America through the complicity of Spellman’s Irish Roman Catholic immigration czar, Edward M O’Connor), the Jews began to flood into their ancient homeland. In 1945, the United Nations was formed in Jesuit-controlled San Francisco. In 1948, Rome’s Masonic Zionists declared Israel to be a sovereign nation. This declaration was acknowledged by President Truman, the Order’s Shriner Freemason, in eleven minutes! And thanks to Cardinal Spellman rallying his South American dictators, Israel was admitted into the United Nations. Of Spellman we read:
“Instead of taking a public stand, he [Spellman] would operate behind the scenes by ‘personally calling on every South American country to cast their votes for Israel’ . . . There was little doubt that Spellman knew U.N. delegates . . . After a bitter struggle, Israel was admitted to the United Nations by a vote of thirty-seven to twelve. The Israelis had turned to a number of men of prominence, including John Foster Dulles [whose son Avery Dulles is a Jesuit Cardinal], to promote their cause. But Charlie Silver was convinced that Spellman had been the deciding factor, . . . ” {13} [Emphasis added]
(Dear truth-seeker, why did the Vatican refuse to formally recognize the nation of Israel from 1948 to 1993 when one of its greatest Jesuit-trained tools, Cardinal Spellman, was responsible for its admittance into the United Nations? Our lesson is that Rome, the two-headed Janus, always has two policies. The first is her open but false policy, intended for public consumption. The second is her secret but true policy, intended to be pursued. In this light, what true policy is Pope John Paul II following – the man who worked for I. G. Farben near Auschwitz during World War II – that would cause him to formally recognize the Jewish State and ask its forgiveness for the Crusades, Inquisitions and Third Reich? The only answer is that the Jesuit General’s “infallible” Pope will say anything and do anything to gain possession of Jerusalem! Ah, dear truth-seeker, “the ends always justify the means.” This principle will surface again when dealing with the Kennedy Assassination.)
Now that Zionist Israel was a member of Rome’s United Nations, she needed a secret police to keep her politicians, like Yitzak Rabin, in line. So the Nazi who helped to set up the CIA was also used to train the Mossad. He was the Pope’s Knight of Malta, Reinhard Gehlen. And if this Jesuit-Nazi-Zionist relationship were ever to surface, the evidence would be “liquidated.” Mark Lane tells us:

“Malchiel Greenwald was an impoverished European Jew who settled in Israel and spent his meager life’s savings to publish self-penned articles of a decidedly dissenting political nature, using an antiquated mimeograph machine. In one article, now known forever in Israel jurisprudence as ‘Pamphlet No. 51,’ he stated that Dr. Rudolf Kastner, then one of Israel’s most honored [Zionist] leaders, was a traitor who had cooperated with the Nazi leaders of Germany, including Adolf Eichmann [who later declared, “I will gladly jump into my grave in the knowledge that five million enemies of the Reich [Jews] have already died like animals.” {14} ] to deport [476,000] Jews from Hungary. Greenwald was charged by the [Zionist] state of Israel with the high crime of having published a criminal libel; in time he was indicted. Before official action could be taken against Kastner, who had embarrassed the state, the good doctor was shot to death in front of his home at 6 Emmanuel Street in Tel Aviv by Zeev Eckstein, who, until a few months before the murder, had been a paid undercover agent of the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service.” {15} [Emphasis added]
Ah, dear truth-seeker, Zionist Israel is a creation of the Jesuit Order!! (Did not Golda Meir publicly honor the Black Pope’s Pius XII who had a Concordat with Hitler?) Its purpose is to secure Jerusalem for the Jesuits’ “infallible” Pope that he may receive worldwide worship from Solomon’s rebuilt Temple. If the Masonic, racially Jewish, Zionists and the Masonic, religiously Talmudic, Orthodox Chief Rabbis betrayed their own Jewish Race into Pius XII’s concentration camps overseen by the Jesuit Order, would they not betray the nation of Israel by giving Jerusalem to the Pope in preparation for the rebuilding of Solomon’s Temple? (Did not Israel’s Chief Rabbi Yonah Metzger meet with Pope John Paul II in 2004?) World War I prepared the Land for the People. World War II prepared the People for the Land. Betrayed by the Zionists and broken by foreign invaders due to worldwide anti-Jewish fury directed by Satan’s Black Pope, Armageddon will prepare the Chosen Jewish People for their Messiah. For in the words of the great Messianic Jew, David Baron:
“Jesus of Nazareth is Israel’s King; and as sure and certain as there was once a cross raised for Him on Golgotha, so certain it is that ‘the Lord God’ will yet ‘give unto Him the throne of his father David,’ and that He will ‘reign on Mount Zion and before His ancients gloriously.’ ”{16}
Then shall come to pass the words of Isaiah the Prophet quoted by the Apostle Paul,
“And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.”
– Romans 11:26
The Jesuits – 1945 - 1989



Chapter 38 541
One of the prime reasons for creating the Cold War was to justify the creation of a huge intelligence community in “the Free World,” replacing Protestant liberties with Rome’s corporate fascism called “National Security.” To do this, the preservation of Hitler’s Nazi intelligence apparatus (financed by the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank) was essential. This Jesuit Inquisition would be merged into the American Empire’s CIA. We read:
“General Reinhard Gehlen, Hitler’s chief intelligence officer against the Soviet Union, had struck a deal with the Americans (called OPERATION SUNRISE) . . . the principal negotiators were Allen Dulles and William Casey of the OSS, Sir William Stephenson for the British, and SS General Karl Wolff . . . Their negotiations enabled Gehlen to bring his entire apparatus ‘unpurged and without interruption, into the service of the American superpower,’ according to [Heinz Hohne and Hermann Zolling] the authors of ‘The General Was A Spy’ . . . ” {17} [Emphasis added]
Further,
“Allen Dulles had been instrumental in arranging, with Gehlen [and with SS General ‘Gestapo’ Heinrich Muller, who met with Dulles in Switzerland, was ushered into the U.S. and given citizenship, worked for the CIA, retired with rank of general and died in 1973, unbothered by any further investigations] for this most unusual conversion of one of Hitler’s most sinister generals into an officer in the U.S. Army, but the details of Gehlen’s personal surrender and subsequent flight to the United States – in General Eisenhower’s own VIP aircraft – were arranged by U.S. Army officers . . . It is important to note the active role of these U.S. Army Officials in this unprecedented move of Hitler’s own intelligence chief, Gehlen, directly into the U.S. Army as an officer by a special act of the Congress.” {18} [Emphasis added]
To make the evacuation of Nazis possible, enabling them to escape Europe, the Vatican established intricate escape routes — the Vatican Ratlines. As the priests helped John H. Surratt escape from the United States after the Lincoln assassination, so they helped thousands of Nazis to escape from Europe after the Second Thirty Years’ War. This would only be possible through a unified, international intelligence community in control of the superpowers’ military machines. This community was and is controlled by the Jesuits in Rome, as they have ruled “the Eternal City” since their restoration in 1814. Of the Ratlines we read:
“Unholy Trinity is the story of the Vatican’s underground Nazi-smuggling networks, code-named ‘Operation Ratline’. The first hints of the existence of the Vatican’s Ratlines emerged in America. This was perhaps appropriate, as

it was U.S. intelligence which gave this name to the Holy See’s escape networks . . . The first half of the book traces the flight of Nazi war criminals to America after World War II. The evidence confirms that a small cabal of Vatican officials coordinated the mass evacuation of Fascist fugitives to Argentina, Australia, Canada, and of course, the United States. Under the direction of Pope Pius XII [whose bloody World War II reign would be whitewashed by Jesuits Pierre Blet, Angelo Martini, Burkhart Schneider with the aid of Pius' former confessor, Robert Leiber], Vatican officials such as Monsignor Giovanni Montini (later Pope Paul VI) supervised one of the greatest obstructions of justice in modern history.” {19} [Emphasis added]
(Dear truth-seeker, Pope Paul VI, the secret Cold Warrior but open Communist, would oversee Cardinal Spellman’s assassination of President Kennedy.)
And who were the key players in this, the most monstrous scandal of the century? Two of them were Knights of Malta, William J. Casey and James Angleton. A third, Reinhard Gehlen, received an award from the Knights of Malta. We read from the National Catholic Reporter:
“Central Intelligence Agency Director William Casey, also a Knight of Malta . . . who declined to comment on his association with the order . . . In 1948, SMOM gave its highest award of honor, the Gran Croci Al Merito Conplacca, to General Reinhard Gehlen, who ran Adolf Hitler’s spy operation against the Soviet Union . . . SMOM gave another award, the Croci Al Merito Seconda Classe, in 1946 to James Jesus Angleton, who ran counter-espionage operations in Rome for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the forerunner of the CIA. Angleton [who advocated an American military Crusade against the Islamic Peoples of the Middle East during the 1970s] later went on to head what has been described as the CIA’s ‘Vatican desk’, but he declines to comment on this activity.” {20} [Emphasis added]
The International Intelligence Community was in place and working. Jesuit-trained William J. Casey, (who later controlled Oliver L. North and FEMA, now the National Homeland Security Agency), Angleton and Gehlen (now working with the Agency’s demon-possessed former head of the Gestapo, Heinrich Muller) were key players in controlling western intelligence, never dealing a true blow to Russian Communism. In the East, the Jesuits also had a most notorious agent. He was KGB agent and Joseph Stalin’s superior, Prince Anton Turkul. This infamous Turkul was also Reinhard Gehlen’s old friend and subordinate. Another Knight of Malta born of Russian nobility, Turkul, along with Myron Taylor and Franz von Papen, was loyal to the Black Pope overseeing the Papal Caesar in the Vatican and therefore further entrenched Stalin in power by eliminating “Koba’s” enemies. We read:
The Jesuits – 1945 - 1989



Chapter 38
“Both the CIA and Gehlen belatedly agreed that Turkul was himself a Soviet agent . . . even Sir William Stephenson agreed that Turkul ‘was in fact a Soviet agent’ . . . No one reinvestigated Turkul’s ‘unimportant’ years in Rome. No one reexamined his role in the Ratline . . . No one remembered the mail intercepts showing that Turkul was coordinating the ‘Yugoslav emigration’ networks. No one suspected a Soviet connection inside the Vatican.” {21} [Emphasis added]
And why not? Because the Vatican’s formal position was public denunciation of Russian Communism. But the facts of previous chapters are clear. The Bolshevik Revolution fulfilled Rome’s ancient objectives against the Orthodox Church in Russia. The Jesuit Order was readmitted by Lenin in 1922 after having been formally expelled forever by Alexander I in 1820; the FBI and CIA gave the KGB high technology to maintain Stalin in power; the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank financed the Bolshevik Revolution and built Russia’s Military Industrial Complex; the Jesuits’ “Episcopalian” Irish pro-Roman Catholic Henry Ford was used to build Gorki; Stalin was given tons of military hardware during Lend-Lease; Stalin was given the nuclear device (bomb) by the Jesuits’ CFR, it controlling FDR and the American Military; and later, Knight of Malta William J. Casey was instrumental in using the American Empire’s Export-Import Bank to finance the building of the Kama River truck factory thereby mechanizing the Soviet War Machine. Why then should we be surprised to see Prince Anton Turkul fulfilling the desires of the Vatican while eliminating Stalin’s enemies? (Turkul’s ancestor – Privy Councillor Turkul negotiated Russia’s Concordat with Pope Pius IX in 1847!) Because the Jesuit Superior General Ledochowski (1915-1942), Vicar Generals Alcessio A. Magni (1942-1944) and Norbert de Boynes (1944-1946), and Superior General Janssens (1946-1964), for whom Turkul worked, were the masters of both the Vatican (since the Order’s restoration in 1814) and the Kremlin (since the Order’s re-entry in 1922)! Loftus gives us the facts; the author gives the interpretation:
“General Prince Anton Vasilevich Turkul [was] the greatest communist agent of them all. In addition to penetrating the Holy See [Turkul deceiving Jesuit Intelligence? How ridiculous!], General Turkul was a communist double agent in German, Japanese, British, French and American intelligence. [All the intelligence agencies worked together — including Russian intelligence.] It was Turkul who splintered the Anti-Bolshevik ‘emigre’ groups after World War I [He further entrenched the Jesuits’ Bolsheviks (Lenin and Stalin) in power], sent Hitler false information that crushed the Nazis on the Eastern fronts [Remember, Hitler did not permit the German Army to capture Moscow. The purpose of Operation Barbarossa was to pave the way for the four mobile gassing units to purge western Russia of its Jews. This having been accomplished, the German Army was then to be betrayed by Hitler and crushed by Stalin with FDR’s

Lend-Lease provisions.], helped turn the Vatican Ratlines into a vehicle for Soviet intelligence during the Cold War [During World War II Vatican and Soviet intelligence worked together. Are we to believe that with the overnight decision to make Soviet Russia an international “bogey man” that this intelligence connection was absolutely severed, especially when we can see Turkul, Gehlen, ‘Gestapo’ Muller, Angleton, Philby, Montini and others, at one time or another, having all worked together?], and culminated his career by prematurely instigating the Hungarian revolution of 1956 [The very patriots – Roman Catholic patriots – incited by Turkul to revolt, were betrayed into the hands of Cardinal Agagianian’s KGB by Cardinal Spellman’s CIA, directed by Knight of Malta “Wild” Bill Donovan! Did this not fulfill the continuing policy of the Jesuits’ Holy Alliance by crushing all movements towards popular liberty and national sovereignty while furthering the Papal Caesar’s universal Temporal Power in governing every nation on earth from Jerusalem?].” {22}
An additional connection between Western and Eastern Intelligence Communities was another Knight, Kim Philby. Like Turkul, he was of noble blood. As an English royal, he was a British SIS agent, an American CIA agent and a Russian KGB agent simultaneously! When it became too evident in England, he “defected” to Russia and participated in the Kennedy Assassination via Lee Harvey Oswald’s connection with the KGB. Another connection to Philby was Anthony Blunt and his Cambridge spy-ring called “The Magnificent Five” of which Philby was a member. Through Blunt, Russian Intelligence was linked to the British Secret Service, the British Royal Family, the White House and American Intelligence. Sir Anthony, who died in 1988 was, like Philby, a British Knight, KGB kingpin and loyal to Sir Stewart Menzies, past head of the British SIS.
Both Blunt and Philby were obviously linked to Vatican Intelligence through Prince Angelo de Mojana — the Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Mojana, holding the status of a Cardinal until his death in 1988,
“ . . . is also member of the Palazzo Giustiniani Freemasonic Lodge, which practices the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Great Britain. He was said to have been imposed as Grand Master by the British Secret Intelligence Services on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II . . . ” {23}
These three men, Blunt, Philby and Mojana (not to mention Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, and John Cairncross who were the other three members of the Cambridge Spy Ring known as “the Magnificent Five”), were Papal Knights tied to the Knights of Malta and Shriner Freemasonry. They were first and foremost loyal to Jesuit Superior General Janssens and his International Vatican Intelligence Network while they all participated in the Kennedy Assassination.

The Cold War of attrition was in full swing. This Inquisition controlled by the Jesuits in Rome, with their “blue-blood” Knights of Malta and their “commoner” Shriner Freemasons controlling the International Intelligence Community, returned the world to the Dark Ages. It destroyed “heretics” by the millions and crushed all movement towards popular liberty. On the ruins of many attempts at liberty it erected absolutist fascist military dictatorships loyal to the Papal Caesar in the Vatican. In establishing these dictatorships we read the words of Colonel James “Bo” Gritz:
“The era of ‘violent peace’ actually got underway in earnest from the day John F. Kennedy was killed. It has been waged against the electoral system in this country [Votescam], and against the entire populations in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, the Congo, Greece, Chile, Guatemala, Angola, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Libya, the Persian Gulf, Korea, Lebanon and other emerging countries we helped overthrow in order to establish either military dictatorships or transparently-fascist ‘democracies’. John Stockwell, one of the highest-ranking CIA case officers ever to go public in his denunciation of the Agency’s covert operations, said recently that the Agency has conducted over 3,000 major campaigns since its official inception in 1947, and the death toll due directly to these operations has risen to over 10 million souls.” {24} [Emphasis added]
In examining the purposes of the Jesuits’ Cold War which were many, the most outstanding were:
1. To kill “heretics and liberals” worldwide pursuant to the Jesuit Oath and the Council of Trent;
2. To destroy their great enemy, the Protestant British Empire;
3. To destroy popular liberty and national sovereignty, erecting in their place dictators loyal to Rome, pursuant to the policies of the Jesuits’ Holy Alliance;
4. To establish the Zionist State of Israel for the purpose of using the Jewish Race to secure Jerusalem for the future world-wide worship of the risen Pope, the “antichrist,” ruling the world from Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem;
5. To build and perfect the International Intelligence Community fulfilling the purposes of the Jesuits’ Holy Office of the Inquisition;
6. To weaken the people of the American Empire for their future destruction using the International Drug Trade and “Orthodox” (allopathic) Medicine;
The Jesuits – 1945 - 1989



546 Vatican Assassins
7. To build the Russian War Machine and merchant marine for the purpose of invading the American Empire from the West, thereby destroying the last haven for the world’s Protestants, Baptists, Jews and “liberal” refugees.
In conclusion, the Jesuits, in creating the Cold War with their Airborne Nuclear War Hoax, enabled the entire Nazi Intelligence apparatus to escape unpunished, while perfecting the inner workings of the Vatican’s CIA/KGB International Intelligence Community. The Order hastened the return of the “Blessed Despotism” of the Dark Ages when the Pope was the “King Despot of the World,” ruling all nations from Rome – “the Eternal City” – in the Vatican. With the coming “New Dark Age” during the Great Tribulation foretold by Jesus “that Prophet” and Messiah, the resurrected Jesuit Pontiff as “the man-beast” whose name may well be “PAN” or “SET,” whose mark may indeed be “IHS,” and whose number will absolutely be 666, one of the three to be displayed on every forehead or right hand of his universal worshippers, shall rule all nations from Jerusalem, “the Holy City,” in Solomon’s rebuilt Temple,
“And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power . . . and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people . . . he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.”
– Daniel 8:24, 25
(Dear truth-seeker, if you are not familiar with the ancient Jewish “hope of Israel” concerning their Messiah coming to “destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem . . . though all the people of the earth be gathered against it,” and rule this world from His spectacular Messianic Temple in Jerusalem described in detail by Ezekiel the prophet, He forever sitting on the ancient “throne of David” as the “Prince of Peace,” while the nations “beat their swords into plowshares” as foretold by Isaiah the prophet, it would be wise to read George Peters’ rare, three volume set, The Theocratic Kingdom, having been written in the mid-Nineteenth Century. Alva J. McClain’s The Greatness of the Kingdom, written in the mid-Twentieth Century, is also superb. If you are not understanding the Prophecy of the Seventy Weeks of Years given to Daniel the prophet (Daniel 9:24-27), Sir Robert Anderson’s The Coming Prince, also written in the late Nineteenth Century, is the greatest treatise on the subject being totally irrefutable. For with the Seventieth Week of Years being yet future, “the prince that shall come,” called “the abomination of desolation” by Jesus the Messiah (Matt. 24:15), is yet to appear in human history. He will greatly persecute the Semitic Jewish Race in attempting their final extinction, “but he shall be broken without hand” by the One who is called “Faithful and True.”)

His Cold War factions fomented the Order’s Middle East Zionist/PLO agitation necessary for the rebuilding of Solomon’s Temple. Therefore, he gave the order to execute President Kennedy for attempting to end the Papal Caesar’s Cold War, including Francis Cardinal Spellman’s war in Vietnam (the Cardinal having visited American soldiers during the Christmas of 1965), and for threatening to “break the CIA into a thousand pieces” before the Papal Inquisition’s International Intelligence Community had been fully financed, completed and perfected including its many deep underground military bases.

Gregory Peter XV Cardinal Agagianian, 1958 #147 Patriarch of the Armenian Church, USSR In 1946 Papal Caesar Pius XII, on the advice of his Jesuit confessor, Cardinal Bea, appointed Jesuit-trained Spellman, he controlling the OSS/CIA, as the Cardinal for the American Empire, and Jesuit-trained Agagianian, overseeing the NKVD/KGB, as the Cardinal for the Soviet Empire. Agagianian and Stalin were fellow Georgians and both attended the Jesuit-controlled Orthodox Tiflis Seminary. Thus, the Black Pope’s “Cardinal of the Kremlin” was “Koba’s” favorite. This man, a personal friend of Cardinal Spellman, ran the Gulag Archipelago, which then and now comprises hundreds of concentration camps within the USSR. The Vatican Moscow Washington

General Prince Anton Vasilevich Turkul, 1956 #148 Knight of Malta Anton Turkul, whose distant relative was Privy Councillor Turkul having contributed to the signing of a concordat between Pope Pius IX and Tzar Nicholas I in 1847, was the Black Pope’s greatest defender of the Papal Caesar’s Temporal Power in Communist Russia. As Stalin’s foremost intelligence officer, using Jesuits like Pere Michel as couriers escorted by the GPU, he broke up the anti-Bolshevik groups after World War I along with Jesuit Theodore Maly; wrecked General Andrei Vlasov’s anti-Stalinist army; crushed the Nazis on the Eastern front aided by the Gehlen Org; used the Vatican Ratlines for Soviet intelligence during the Cold War and, with the help of Allen Dulles’ SS/CIA, incited and then murdered thousands of “liberals” during the Hungarian revolution of 1956 pursuant to the evil Council of Trent.

Knight of Malta James Angleton; Freemason David Ben-Gurion, 1969 #151 According to Loftus in his The Secret War Against the Jews, Reinhard Gehlen trained Israeli Intelligence – the Mossad. With James Jesus Angleton, CIA Chief of Counterintelligence manning both “the Israeli desk” and “the Vatican desk” within the CIA, the Black Pope was now in complete control of his post-war International Intelligence Community, which included the British SIS, the German BND, the Soviet KGB and the Chinese CSIS. According to Ben Hecht in his Perfidy, Ben-Gurion, through Rudolf Kastner – his Zionist agent leading Hungary’s “Jewish Rescue Committee” – had collaborated with the Nazis during the war by refusing to warn Europe’s Jews of their impending doom. SS Colonel Eichmann collaborated with Ben-Gurion each through their agents, SS Colonel Kurt Becker and Rudolf Kastner. Meanwhile, Angleton was not only working in conjunction with the Jesuits in control of Vatican Intelligence, but with two other American Knights of Malta, OSS Director “Wild” Bill Donovan and FDR’s unofficial Ambassador to Pope Pius XII, CFR member Myron C. Taylor. In 1961, as a result of the Kastner Affair, which included the revelation that both Chaim Weizmann and Ben-Gurion betrayed the honest Jewish emissary, Joel Brand, into the hands of the British thus insuring the Nazi murder of 400,000 Hungarian Jews, the Black Pope – in order to bolster his Ben-Gurion-led Labor Zionist government – sacrificed escapee Adolf Eichmann by handing him over to the Israeli people. Hence, the master-servant relationship established between the Papacy’s SS/CIA and the Mossad is in full force today serving the ends of the Jesuit Superior General — the taking of the Temple Mount from the Moslems; the destruction of the Mosques on that Temple Mount; and the building of the Third Hebrew Temple. In that Temple will sit the risen Seventh Roman King/Caesar/Pope (Rev. 17:10-11); the final Pope “whose deadly wound was healed” (Rev. 13:12); “the abomination of desolation” (Matt. 24:15), during the final future Jewish Holocaust — the time of “Jacob’s trouble” (Jer. 30:7).

Chapter 39 553
After the Second Thirty Years’ War in Europe, ending in 1945, the Jesuits, with their mouthpiece Pius XII, began “the Cold War.” The Vatican’s official position during “the Cold War” was “anti-Communism.” This further cemented the formal alliance of the Jesuits’ American Empire and her Military Industrial Complex with the Vatican. Being both a Roman Catholic and a fanatical anti-Communist, James V. Forrestal became the Empire’s first Secretary of Defense or more correctly, “the Secretary of Offense.” Housed in the Pentagon – that “Shrine of War” (designed after a pentagram employed in the symbol of the Baphomet and in the worship of Satan, being the Egyptian SET) whose construction was overseen by Archbishop Francis Spellman’s Colonel Leslie Groves (the controller of the Order’s Manhattan Project), and which was subsequently dedicated to the restoration of the Pope’s Temporal Power – the Secretary would oversee the Crusades of his masters in accordance with the Jesuit General’s wicked and evil Council of Trent. In 1949 an Arch-Catholic and oath-bound Knight of Columbus of the Fourth Degree, became the Secretary of the American Navy. Of this sinister character we read:
“Mr. Francis Matthews was nominated Secretary of the American Navy. On the morning he took the oath of office (in June, 1949), Mr. Matthews, his wife and all their six children contritely heard Mass and received Holy Communion in the chapel of the Naval station in Washington, D.C. The new Catholic Secretary of the U.S. Navy . . . soon afterwards began unusually active contacts with other prominent American Catholics. Among these, Father Walsh, Jesuit Vice-President of Georgetown University [This is the Jesuit who led a “relief mission” into Bolshevik Russia in 1922]; Cardinal Spellman, the head of the American Legion [“the American Pope” ruling from “the Little Vatican” in New York]; and the leaders of the Catholic War Veterans and with Senator McCarthy, the arch-criminal senator [Trained by Jesuits at Marquette University and the darling of their John Birch Society headed by Shriner Robert Welch (who, on his deathbed was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church), Senator McCarthy, unfairly claiming immunity for his inquisitional style hearings directed against those who were indeed traitors and communists (secretly backed by the Archbishop’s Council on Foreign Relations), was used to unite Protestants and Catholics against the Order’s “Jewish Communist Conspiracy” having originated with the Order’s Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. Apparently he went too far and was assassinated by order of the Jesuit General.] . . . Arch-Catholic Matthews was not only a frequent ring-kisser of the members of the Catholic hierarchy in America; he was one of the most active promoters of Catholicism in action in the U.S. In addition to which, this Catholic Secretary of the American Navy was the chairman of the National Catholic Community Service and, more sinister still, the Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, the shock troops of Catholic power in the US . . . ” {4} [Emphasis added]
The Jesuits – 1945 - 1975

This powerful man – the Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus pursuing “Jesuitical politics” in the words of one of our heroes, Jeremiah Crowley, worked with the Empire’s most powerful Shriner Freemason, President Truman. He was aligned with Georgetown’s most trusted agent and favorite of the Jesuit General, Edmund Walsh; and, he was a bosom friend with the Jesuit-trained American Pope, Francis Cardinal Spellman.
And what did these three agents of the Pope – a foreign king – advocate? An attack on the non-communist Orthodox population of Stalin’s “Communist Russia” with a “preventive atomic war.” This was a formal call for an American-led Crusade,
“ . . . as the London Times somberly described ‘what almost amounts to a crusade of Christendom’ and what the Manchester Guardian bluntly called ‘the Pope’s blessing for a preventive war.’ ” {5}
Knowing that an aerial nuclear attack by the Empire’s Air Force was impossible, knowing that the only winner of World War II was Stalin’s Russia, why the call to war? Knowing that the Jesuits used Hitler to prevent the German Army’s Protestant Generals on the Eastern Front from capturing Moscow (even though aided by Catholic enlistments from Italy, France, Ireland, Belgium, Holland, Latin America, the United States, Portugal and Spain’s Blue Division during “Operation Barbarossa”), could Americans expect “The Cold War of Liberation” to succeed in eliminating Russian Communism while the Knights of Malta on Wall Street and the Federal Reserve Bank were financing it? Clearly, the Cold War, led by the American Empire’s most powerful Roman Catholic Cold Warriors had another purpose in view.
That purpose for Vietnam was fulfilled. During the Crusade called “the Vietnam War” nearly two million “heretic Buddhists” were murdered and the nation was destroyed, the American Air force having dropped more bombs than in World War II. On its ruins was erected a unified Vietnam led by a “former” OSS agent and Soviet-trained, fascist-communist dictator loyal to the Pope of Rome — Ho Chi Minh. Saigon was renamed “Ho Chi Minh City.”
Of Ho Chi Minh’s alliance with the Papal Caesar, Avro Manhattan writes:
“Ho Chi Minh began before World War II to maneuver for a communist Vietnam. He received help from the U.S. [like Castro] against the Japanese but used that aid to consolidate his hold on the highlands of Tonkin. In August 1945 he marched into Hanoi and set up the provisional government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam . . . he cooperated in the transplanting of nearly a million Catholic North Vietnamese into the South [pursuant to the policy of Cardinal Spellman and his most supreme

Knight of Columbus being the Secretary of the American Navy, Francis Matthews] . . . After the election of Pope John XXIII, and the turn of the Vatican away from the Cold War toward cooperation with Marxism, Ho Chi Minh, [having] kept diverse Catholic advisors by his side, including a Catholic Bishop [Bishop of Hanoi Trin Nhu Khue who later was made a Cardinal in 1976], made a secret deal with Pope John which eventually led to full control of the country by the North.” {6} [Emphasis added]
Like the American War Between the States, the Jesuits controlled Vietnam’s dictators in both the North and the South. Using the American Navy under the command of a Knight of Columbus, and using Ho Chi Minh advised by a Catholic Bishop (unnamed by Avro Manhattan), the Jesuits moved thousands of Catholics in the North to resettle in the South. Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty writes:
“[The Saigon Military Mission did] all they could to promote the movement of hundreds of thousands of “Catholic” Vietnamese from the north with promises of safety, food, land, and freedom in the south and with threats that they would be massacred by the Communists of North Vietnam and China if they stayed in the north.
This movement of Catholics . . . from the northern provinces of Vietnam to the south, under the provisions of the Geneva Agreement, became the most important activity of the Saigon Military Mission and one of the root causes of the Vietnam War . . .
When one thinks about this enormous man-made problem for a while, he or she begins to realize that much of the Vietnamese “problem” had been ignited by our own people shortly after the Geneva Agreements were concluded. Nothing that occurred during these thirty years of warfare, 1945-75, was more pernicious than this movement of these 1,100,000 “Catholics” from the north to the south at a time when the government of the south scarcely existed . . . They were penniless, homeless, foodless, and unwanted. Inevitably they became bandits, insurgents, and fodder for the war that came later.” {7}[Emphasis added]
(Ah, dear truth-seeker, the Black Pope with his General Staff and Provincials garrisoned worldwide, along with the Papal Caesar and his Hierarchy care nothing for the Roman Catholic people of any nation! Strangers to the true gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ as revealed through the Word of God – the Bible of the Protestant Reformation – and kept in fear of losing their “salvation,” if not obedient to their priests for the whole of their lives, devoted and sincere Catholics will obey their

Bishops, Archbishops, Cardinals and the Pope himself though unknowingly being used to increase the Temporal Power of “the Vicar of Christ” around the globe. As in the case of these terrified and manipulated North Vietnamese Catholics, they will obey, even if it means their certain and calculated deaths!
We wonder how many American Catholics the Jesuit General will kill using his coming fascist American military dictator having entered into a Concordat with the Pope of Rome. Like Roman Catholic Hitler, the Black Pope’s absolutist American dictator will kill millions of Catholics with a two-front war that we will be unable to win thanks to the Panama Canal giveaway and the present downsizing policies of President George W. Bush. That two-front war could possibly be in the Middle East against Soviet and/or Moslem forces, and possibly in the Pacific Far East against the Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese and Koreans in attempting to defend South Korea, Taiwan, Australia or even Hawaii. We wonder how many American Catholics the Black Pope will kill when his CFR-controlled Military Intelligence betrays hundreds of thousands of American soldiers into the hands of the enemy — just like Pearl Harbor! We wonder how many Roman Catholic women and children the Black Pope will rape, sodomize and murder with our foreign and savage, atheistic and pagan, Soviet, Far-Eastern and Moslem invaders, hating the American “NATO Nazi” and “Great Satan” Empire, while they fanatically proclaim with Masonic-Islamic scimitars unsheathed, dripping with our American blood, “GOD HAS NO SON!”
Oh yes, it would be according to Abate Leone’s The Jesuit Conspiracy: The Secret Plan of the Order and to the delight of the Jesuit General, in fulfilling the evil Council of Trent, to annihilate nearly the entire North American population, including the “heretic and liberal” Roman Catholic people and priests — just like those he killed in Europe during World War II!)
Additionally Roman Catholic Diem with his persecutions of Buddhists ignited the war. We read:
“President Ngo Dunh [Dinh] Diem of South Vietnam was a practicing Catholic who ruled South Vietnam with an iron fist. He was a genuine believer in the evil of communism and the uniqueness of the Catholic Church. He had originally been ‘planted’ into the presidency by Cardinal Spellman and Pope Pius XII. He transformed the presidency into a virtual Catholic dictatorship, ruthlessly crushing his religious and political opponents. Buddhist monks committed suicide by fire, burning themselves alive in protest against his religious persecutions. His discriminatory persecution of non-Catholics, particularly Buddhists, caused the disruption of the government and mass desertions in the army. This eventually led to U.S. military intervention in South Vietnam.
The Jesuits – 1945 - 1975



Chapter 39 557
In this terrorization he [President Ngo Dinh Diem] was aided by his two Catholic Brothers, the Chief of the Secret Police [Ngo Dinh Nhu] and the Archbishop of Hue [Ngo Dinh Thuc].” {8} [Emphasis added]
Diem pursued three objectives. He sought the annihilation of a political enemy — Communism; he sought to destroy a religious enemy — the Buddhists; and he installed Jesuit absolutism in the country — Roman Catholic Fascism. And who was the chief promoter of the Vietnam War? It was the great Cold Warrior, Francis Cardinal Spellman, as he controlled the American press through Henry R. Luce and later the American military through President Lyndon Johnson. Of Spellman’s allegiance to the Vatican and his participation in the war we read:
“He was active in persuading the U.S. to select Diem and support him as president of South Vietnam. He was made Vicar General of the U.S. armed Forces and called the GIs the ‘Soldiers of Christ’ [of the Pope] in his frequent visits to the Vietnam war front.” {9} [Emphasis added]
But Kennedy, the new American Commander-in-Chief, posed a problem. He followed the pro-communist policy of Pope John XXIII (who, along with Pope Paul VI and Pope John Paul II, was a high-level Freemason and Rosicrucian according to William Schnoebelen – a former Freemason and author of Lucifer Dethroned, published in 1993 and offered by Chick Publications – who, like Alberto Rivera, had been a Bishop of the Old Roman Catholic Church based in Utrecht, Holland) and not the secret policy of Jesuit General Janssens who promoted the Cold War. Kennedy withdrew the CIA advisor from Saigon and abandoned Diem. Fleeing to the Jesuits’ Church of St. Francis Xavier (the Jesuit “missionary” to the Far East) in Saigon for protection, Diem and his murderous brother Nhu were turned over to Buddhist Generals and promptly executed. Ah, dear truth-seeker, we must never forget the law of the Church written by the Spanish Jesuit, Luis de Molina, in 1600:
“Priests may kill the laity to preserve their goods.” {10}
This must have infuriated Spellman! His Inquisitor was dead, the CIA was expelled and his Crusade was in serious trouble. This meant that Spellman looked bad and was in big trouble with his Master in Rome! So, “the Lion” in New York’s “little Vatican” marshaled his forces and eliminated his opposition – President Kennedy – so fanatically despised by his secret master — the Black Pope! Vietnam went on to be called “Spelly’s War.” And what was the cost of that Crusade? For the American Empire — shame and defeat, including fifty-eight thousand dead and one hundred and twenty thousand post-war suicides, many of whom were Roman Catholics. Rome’s created dialectic so successfully used in World War II – Catholic (Jesuit) Fascism versus Atheistic (Jesuit) Communism – produced the desired results. Millions of Buddhist “heretics” were “extirpated” and the consolidated government was absorbed into THE POWER of the Jesuit General.

In a nutshell, the Vietnam War weakened the nations and strengthened the Temporal Power of the Pope as “Master and Ruler of the World,” as “King of kings and Lord of lords.”
Another goal the Jesuits had accomplished was the explosion of the international drug trade. As the Order – in control of the British Empire – had conducted the drug trade during the Nineteenth Century, even so its General – in control of the American Empire – would continue to expand the Trade during the Twentieth Century. Using the Knights of Malta with the CIA and the Mafia as their agents, the Jesuits would make trillions, further weakening the nations and increasing their financial power so as to bring the world closer to the universal rule of the Pope — from Jerusalem. Of the drug trade and its beginnings we read:
“In 1715, the British East India Company opened up its first Far East office in the Chinese port city of Canton and began trading in opium. Between that time and the First Opium War against China in 1840 . . . the dope trade took over Britain. The vehicle was the 1783 near coup d’etat by Lord Shelburne (the British prime minister who concluded peace negotiations with the American colonies after Yorktown) . . . known as “the Jesuit of Berkeley Square.”
Shelburne’s ruling combination centered on the East India Company, a group of Scottish merchants, and an alliance on the continent with the chivalric order of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem and the Society of Jesus . . . Since the original Jesuit mission had established itself in Beijing in 1601, the Society of Jesus had held the key to the Far East Trade — including the dope trade.” {11} [Emphasis added]
After centuries of progress we see:
“Alfred McCoy had written The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia (published in 1972) as part of his Ph.D. thesis requirement. It provided documentation, undisputed even by the CIA, of how drugs – opium and heroin – were allowed by officials in our government and several others, to do what Congress had officially forbidden — to expand the war into Laos and Cambodia [at the urging of the Jesuit, Dan Lyons] . . .
The thesis that McCoy advanced, which has since become widely accepted as fact [now read this carefully dear truth-seeker], was that CIA operations against China in the early years of Mao’s advance and against the communist movements in Indochina a decade later, were responsible for creating the largest single source of heroin for the

growing U.S. market . . . Legend has it that the CIA’s proprietary airline, Civil Air Transport (later Air America), moved so quickly into the secret Laotian airbase at Long Tien, that there was not a single break in the long-running schedule of flights carrying the opium out of the Golden Triangle . . . the U.S. government – through the Central Intelligence Agency and its wartime predecessor, the OSS – created a situation that made it possible for the Sicilian-American Mafia and the Corsican underworld to revive the international narcotics traffic.” {12} [Emphasis added]
(Dear truth-seeker, the Jesuits’ anti-communist Crusade in Fourteenth Amendment America was an intended public diversion, while the Order created their monopolistic international drug trade to be protected in the future by the Drug Enforcement Agency! This is why J. Edgar Hoover, the fanatical anti-communist, protected the Mafia for years, refusing to publicly acknowledge its existence. For the Mafia and the CIA had worked together since the late forties with their suppliers in the Far East in building Jesuit General Janssen’s drug trade. President Kennedy, if permitted to fulfill the policies he pursued, would have ended the General’s sinful business, intended to secretly finance his International Intelligence Community with its secret underground Military Industrial Complexes — the Holy Office of the Inquisition. How do we know this? President Kennedy began to prosecute powerful Mafia Dons, he sought to break the CIA “into a thousand pieces,” and he began to end Cardinal Spellman’s Crusade in the Far East — the Vietnam War. Clearly the “usurper” and “tyrant” Kennedy, although a son of the Catholic Church, had to go!)
And which banks were used to launder the billions from this terrible drug trade?
“Among the big league financial houses cited in the commission’s report for washing hot money were Chemical Bank . . . Chase
Manhattan Bank . . . ” {13}
Dear truth-seeker, these banks are owned and controlled by the Knights of Malta!
“The SMOM’s U.S. section has approximately 1,000 members including 300 ‘dames’ – who hail from society’s upper crust. Divided into three associations (eastern, southern and western), its roster includes many of the corporate establishment’s movers and shakers: Francis X. Stankard of [David Rockefeller’s] Chase Manhattan Bank [a CFR member who dispatched his banking associate and CFR member, John J. McCloy, to be a member of the Warren Commission. Formally appointed by Jesuit-trained Lyndon Johnson, McCloy greatly contributed in shielding the true culprit and mastermind behind the

Kennedy Assassination — Francis Cardinal Spellman. McCloy had obediently served his Jesuit masters in the past; for, as FDR’s Assistant Secretary of War (1941-1945) in carrying out the order of the President, he refused to bomb Auschwitz — Hitler’s largest Death Camp in Roman Catholic Poland.] and William E. Simon . . . currently a director of Citicorp [and a former Secretary of the Treasury].
Martin F. Shea, an executive vice-president of Morgan Bank, is SMOM secretary in the U.S. At Morgan Bank’s New York headquarters is a telex which links SMOM/U.S. to SMOM headquarters in Rome.” {14} [Emphasis added]
Further, J. Peter Grace, the past head of the American Branch of the Knights of Malta and Chairman of W. R. Grace and Company, conducted his multimillion-dollar business conglomerate through Chemical Bank.
And thus the primarily Irish-American, Roman Catholic Sovereign Military Order of Malta, working in conjunction with their primarily Italian-American, Roman Catholic Mafia Commission, would conduct an International Drug Trade through their CIA war in Vietnam, the profits from which would finance the Order’s clandestine operations around the world to be overseen by the formal “Military Vicar” of the American Armed Forces, Knight of Columbus Francis Cardinal Spellman. Some of those cloak and dagger operations included the building of deep underground military bases, one of them being the Dulce Base in New Mexico, housing a host of secret weapons based on highly developed and suppressed technologies. According to Oliver L. North’s public testimony, Knight of Malta and CIA Director William J. Casey “dreamed of a worldwide intelligence agency not beholden to Congress for its funding.” Well Ollie, we’ve got it. It is the Black Pope’s International Intelligence Community having been manned by men like your friend, the Papal Caesar’s Knight of Malta and traitor to his country, the Jesuit-trained Irish Roman Catholic, and a former darling of the Jesuits at Fordham, William J. Casey.
Dear truth-seeker, by this time we can see that the Vatican’s Jesuits and Cardinal Spellman, in command of the Knights of Malta which in turn were in control of the Council on Foreign Relations, the CIA, the FBI and the Mafia, all had a vested interest in the Vietnam War. For in expanding the drug trade and flooding the American Empire, composed of “heretics and liberals,” with suffering and death pursuant to the Jesuit Oath and the evil Council of Trent, the Sons of Loyola made tremendous progress in finally destroying the greatest cultural blessing in the history of the family of Nations — the Great and Mighty Protestant Reformation!
Woe, Woe, Woe, be to the man who would try to stop it. It would be better for him that he had not been born.

Diem, trained at Maryknoll Seminary in Ossining, New York, was a fascist and greatly persecuted the Buddhists for which he was ultimately murdered. Spellman sought to continue the Black Pope’s crusade; Kennedy attempted to end it. Three weeks after Diem’s death, President Kennedy was assassinated and the Vietnam War raged for over ten years. Spellman, calling American troops “the soldiers of Christ” (the Pope), killed over two million “heretics,” the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank extended 220 billion dollars in credit created out of “thin air” to the U.S. Congress, the Papal Caesar’s CIA/KGB Intelligence Community was perfected and the Italian Roman Catholic Mafia Dons got their massive Drug Trade, further destroying our White Protestant civilization and government.

“No political event or circumstance can be evaluated without the knowledge of the Vatican’s part in it. And no significant world situation exists in which the Vatican does not play an important explicit or implicit role.” {3}

“The Cold War” began overnight. Truman’s Fourteenth Amendment America and Stalin’s Soviet Russia, once allies, were now “abracadabra” mortal enemies. The OSS and NKVD that had worked together were now, “hocus pocus,” bent on each other’s destruction. The Vatican Ratlines had redistributed the Nazi Intelligence men. Some went West into Gehlen’s network within the CIA; others went East into Turkul’s network within the KGB. The Nazis who went into Soviet Russia were known in the West as “Freedom Fighters,” supposedly working for Western Intelligence. They in fact were “Communist agents” working for Stalin’s KGB and GRU. Both Intelligence networks, one loyal to the American Empire, the other loyal to the Russian Empire, were tied together at the top by Vatican “Knights.” Some of these “Knights” were Sir Stewart Menzies, chief of the British Secret Service; Kim Philby, a subordinate of Menzies; “Wild” Bill Donovan, Chief of the American OSS whose brother Vincent was a Dominican priest; James Angleton, an OSS officer in Rome and later, chief of the CIA’s Counterintelligence Division manning both the Vatican and Israeli desks; William J. Casey, an OSS officer in Rome and later Director of the CIA; Allen Dulles, another OSS officer in Rome having worked with Cardinal Montini’s Vatican Ratlines, whose nephew, Avery Dulles, became a powerful Jesuit Cardinal; Prince Anton Turkul (whose distant relative, according to the Catholic priest James Zatko in his Descent Into Darkness, was Privy Councillor Turkul, the state secretary of Polish affairs during the reign of Tzar Nicholas I. He was a great promoter of the Concordat between Pope Pius IX and Russia, signed in Rome in 1847 by the Russian Cardinal Lambruschini — a supposed ex-Jesuit!), Russia’s greatest intelligence officer who spent time in Rome, used Jesuits for couriers and worked with Bormann, Himmler and Schellenberg of the SS; Reinhard Gehlen, head of Nazi Intelligence on the Eastern front, who, after the war, was made a General in the American Army by an act of Congress; Walter Schellenberg, Chief of SS Intelligence – the feared SD – who was given sanctuary in Britain after the war by the British Intelligence Chief, Sir Stewart Menzies; Heinrich Himmler, head of the Gestapo and SS (a personal friend of J. Edgar Hoover before the war) whose death was brilliantly faked by Menzies’ SIS thereby enabling the anti-Jew, Windsor British Monarchy to secretly protect him after the war; J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI, who recruited his agents from American Jesuit Universities, hated Jews and helped with the immigration of Nazi SS war criminals into the United States under the watchful eye of Cardinal Spellman; and Alexander Haig, Commander of NATO forces in Europe and White House Chief of Staff, whose younger brother, Francis R. Haig, is a Jesuit. (The General saved the Vatican’s Zionist State of Israel during the Yom Kippur War in 1973. Intending “only to bleed the Jews,” the Vatican’s Shriner Freemason Henry A. Kissinger nearly destroyed the nation. After waiting for nearly one thousand years to take Jerusalem and possession of the Temple Mount for the rebuilding of Solomon’s Temple, the Jesuits’ “infallible” Papal Caesar was not about to lose it now. So he saved the nation with Knight of Malta, General Alexander Haig and high tech American weapons.)

Dear truth-seeker, the ties between the intelligence communities are simple once you reject the illusion of the Cold War. These ties are not “ironies” as Loftus calls them; but rather, they are cold hard facts leading to the Vatican’s Jesuits as masters of this monstrous Holy Office of the Inquisition. British and Nazi intelligence merge with Menzies and Schellenberg. We read from Loftus’ and Aarons’ The Secret War Against the Jews,
“It was Menzies who ordered British troops to help the Vatican truck the Nazi treasure into hiding . . . It was Menzies who gave Nazi intelligence chief, Walter Schellenberg and the other Nazi negotiators sanctuary in Britain after the war. Menzies also authorized Kim Philby to recruit ex-Nazis as agents and smuggle them through the Vatican to South America . . . ” {4}
American and Nazi intelligence merge with Dulles and Gehlen. We read:
“General Reinhard Gehlen, Hitler’s chief intelligence officer against the Soviet Union, had struck a deal with the Americans (called OPERATION SUNRISE) . . . The principal negotiators were Allen Dulles and William Casey of the OSS, Sir William Stephenson for the British, and SS General Karl Wolff, head of the Gestapo in Italy and former chief of Heinrich Himmler’s personal staff . . .Their negotiations enabled Gehlen to bring his entire apparatus ‘unpurged and without interruption, into the service of the American superpower,’ . . . ” {5}
British and Russian intelligence merge with Menzies, Philby and Turkul. We read:
“One of the great ironies of twentieth-century espionage history is that the right-wing head of the British secret service, Sir Stewart Menzies,
handed the Communists the key to Britain’s secrets on a royal platter.”
{6}
Philby not only worked for the British Menzies but also with Beria’s KGB, for which reason he protected Turkul. We read:
“While American and British intelligence were restructured after World War II, Soviet intelligence executed a plan of smooth integration to protect and promote all their agents in the West. For example, when MI6 discovered German documents proving that Turkul’s friend Ellis was a Nazi agent, Philby ordered that the investigation be closed . . . If Ellis had been exposed in 1945, it would have jeopardized Turkul, who

Chapter 40
was far more valuable than Philby. Because of Philby’s cover-up,
Turkul and Ellis were safe for several more years.” {7}
Later in 1963, Philby “defected” to the Soviet Union to maintain the illusion of “the Cold War” among the patriotic lower level intelligence officers.
American, Russian and Israeli intelligence merge with the pairs Gehlen and Turkul; and Angleton and Philby. We read:
“Dulles had Gehlen set up in a secret compound in Pullach, West Germany, with orders to revive the [Turkul] Max network . . . Gehlen intended to make Turkul’s Max network the centerpiece of his new West German intelligence agency . . . Foisting the Max network on Allen Dulles and General Gehlen turned out to be the key to Soviet supremacy in the first half of the Cold War . . . To this day, the CIA still refuses to declassify its files for ‘Prince’ Turkul’s network. It is just too embarrassing to admit that the Eastern European Fascist groups, [ex-Nazis] whom Dulles had hired turned out to be working for the other side.” {8} [Emphasis added]
“ . . . there is no doubt Angleton fell under Philby’s spell . . . As with Philby, so with James Jesus: his record was riddled with ambiguity and inexplicable actions that resulted in the question asked by a high authority at the CIA: ‘Was Angleton the American Philby?’ . . . It was Philby who taught Angleton the structure of the Secret Service . . . ” {9}
And Philby had been recruited into the KGB by a Jesuit who had been a member of the Bolsheviks’ Inquisition called “the Cheka.” We read:
“One of the first Soviet agents to penetrate British intelligence was a Catholic Priest. Between 1932 and 1937 the top NKVD ‘illegal’ in England was Father Theodore Maly [a Jesuit] . . .
Many of Father Maly’s best recruits were young men from upper class backgrounds . . . The most famous KGB agent was Harold Adrian Russell Philby. As with all of Father Maly’s agents, ‘Kim’ Philby’s upper class British background was impeccable . . . Philby was no longer a peripheral observer, but a principal player with the Vatican. In 1944 he was promoted to head the new anti-Soviet section of [the British] SIS.” {10} [Emphasis added]
The Jesuits – 1959 - 1962



Vatican Assassins
The Dulles-Gehlen network trained Israel’s Mossad, while the Vatican’s CIA agent and head of the Israeli desk, James Jesus Angleton (who openly advocated a Pentagon-directed, American military Crusade against Israel’s surrounding Islamic nations), helped the Israeli government. We read:
“One of our sources, the late John McIntyre, served with American intelligence inside the Gehlen organization from 1948 until 1951. To his amazement, Gehlen’s Nazis were training the Mossad, Israel’s infant foreign intelligence service . . .
Angleton’s mission was to keep the CIA secure from penetration by foreign governments particularly the Soviet Union . . . Angleton spied only for Israel . . . he was flatly accused of being a ‘god_ _ _ _ Israeli mole’ by a number of his fellow CIA officers . . . Angleton alone handled the CIA’s collection of intelligence from and against the Jewish state, almost from its inception as a nation . . . He was unofficially helping Israel [the Vatican’s secret but true policy], which was strictly against the president’s policy.” {11} [Emphasis added]
Menzies, Schellenberg, Donovan, Dulles, Gehlen, Casey, Angleton, Philby and Turkul all had strong connections with the Vatican’s Jesuits. The British SIS and Soviet KGB/GRU were united in Philby. The CIA, Mossad and KGB were united in Angleton. This gallery of traitors, all of them being Papal Knights, unified the International Intelligence Community merging at Borgo di Santo Spirito, the command post of Jesuit General Janssens just outside the Vatican walls in Rome.
With this interlock of men loyal to the General of the Jesuits, the Cold War would be waged but kept under control, that is, from becoming a full-scale war between East and West. The deceived patriots of both sides would be kept in check or eliminated if attempting to truly “win” the Cold War or expose the truth about the intelligence men at the top. The murder of the staunch Roman Catholic, Opus Dei member and CIA Director, William Colby, after forcing Angleton to retire, is a classic example of their policy. The Order will terminate its own disobedient tools!
In 1959 Fidel Castro, the Roman Catholic Communist (who, according to some Cubans, raped two nuns while in Colombia for which he was castrated, as he is never seen with a woman) was put in power with the help of the Jesuit-controlled CIA. Educated in youth and advised when he became Cuba’s dictator, we read of the Jesuits shaping his mind and controlling his actions:
“Fidel and Raul were sent to Santiago de Cuba [St. Ignatius of Cuba] to study under the Jesuits at the Colegio Lasalle, and then to the Colegio
The Jesuits – 1959 - 1962



Chapter 40 569
Dolores, also Jesuit . . . In 1942, Fidel was sent to Havana where he carried on with his secondary education at the Jesuit College of Belen
(Bethlehem).” {12}
“Fidel was significantly influenced by [Jesuit] Fathers Amondo [Armando] Llorente and Alberto de Castro . . . De Castro admired Franco . . . Fidel was very active in a Jesuit organization similar to the Boy Scouts, the ‘Explorers.’ . . .
‘Fidel was trained by the Jesuits to become their representative,’ says Carlos Rafael Rodriguez. ‘The revolution does less propaganda [promoting] for Fidel than the propaganda by the Jesuits.’. . . Fidel spent eleven years in Catholic Boarding schools, seven of them in Jesuit institutions . . . ‘Fidel is a Jesuit first, a revolutionary second, and a Marxist third.’ . . . He promoted the [Jesuit-controlled] Soviet system as a model . . . In a way he was turning Cuba into a giant Jesuit school in which he was the principal . . . It is still the Jesuit school in which he is the principal . . . Fidel has not forgotten that the military invariably holds the ultimate power. It is perhaps significant that Fidel’s first title is commander in chief.” {13} [Emphasis added]
“[Wherever] a totalitarian movement erupts, whether Communist or Nazi [fascist], a Jesuit can be found in the role of ‘adviser’ or leader; in Cuba [it was] Castro’s Father Armando [Amondo] Llorente . . . ” {14}
The Jesuits, in order to bring their illegitimate son of a Nazi and “grease ball” student dictator to power (as he was called by his classmates), used their American press, money, entertainment industry, CIA and Soviet Russia. We read:
“ ‘After the Matthews articles which followed an exclusive interview by the Times [Henry R. Luce SMOM] editorial writer in Castro’s mountain hideout and which likened him to Abraham Lincoln, he was able to get followers and funds in Cuba and in the United States. From that time on arms, money and soldiers of fortune abounded. Much of the American press began to picture Castro as a political Robin Hood.
Also because Batista was the dictator who unlawfully seized power, American people assumed Castro must, on the other hand, represent liberty and democracy. The crusader role which the press and radio bestowed on the bearded rebel blinded the people to the left-wing political philosophy with which even at that time he was already on record . . . ’
The Jesuits – 1959 - 1962

‘Fidel’s secret weapon was money — incredible millions of dollars, with which he bought “victories.” He bought entire regiments from Batista’s officers and, on one occasion purchased for $650,000 cash an entire armored train, with tanks, guns, ammunition, jeeps and 500 men’ . . . The basic reason for defeat of Batista’s armies, he asserted, was that covert United States intervention [CIA] shattered their morale . . . Many share the bloodguilt for the needless death of these people, who were the best element in Cuba. Among the guilty are American correspondents [Cardinal Spellman’s Knight of Malta Henry R. Luce and his Time magazine] who . . . wrote falsehoods about the Castro movement so other people would fight and die for it. . . .
[In 1958 with] the combined pressure of Soviet arms and gold and American propaganda, the Batista regime was beginning to crumble . . . Edward R. Murrow of CBS [CFR-controlled] staged a laudatory TV network program on the Castro movement. The normally hardheaded Ed Sullivan [Roman Catholic] went into the Sierra Maestra for a television interview with his hairy, armed prophet. Sullivan’s technique was to ask leading questions such as ‘You are not a Communist, are you Fidel? You are a devout Catholic, aren’t you?’ — leaving Castro practically no time to answer. The effect was comic in terms of theater; tragic in terms of politics.” {15} [Emphasis added]
Under the guidance of his Jesuit advisor, Fidel Castro’s command post was Havana’s Hilton Hotel. A powerful Knight of Malta, W. Barron Hilton, owned the chain of hotels around the world. We read:
“The SMOM’s U.S. Section has approximately 1,000 members . . . its roster includes many of the corporate establishment’s movers and shakers . . . Barron Hilton of the hotel chain; . . . ” {16}
Freemason Castro (according to a Cuban Freemason who personally saw 33rd degree Freemason Castro in a lodge in Havana) was further entrenched in power by the CIA. It was the high commander of “the Company,” Allen Dulles, who organized the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. The “failure” of the attempt to overthrow Castro resulted in the decimation of the Roman Catholic patriots of Cuba. During the invasion Dulles was conveniently out of town and not at his duty station, as if he knew it would go sour. Two Knights of Malta were involved in the set-up and failure of the invasion. One of them was Roberto Alejos Arzu. Alejos became the Honduran Knights co-chairman in 1985, of whom we read:
“Alejos – a sugar and coffee grower who let the CIA use his plantations as training grounds for the 1960 [1961] Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba [its secretly purposed failure having been intended by the CFR’s Director of the CIA to further entrench the power of the Order’s Fidel Castro].”{17}
The Jesuits – 1959 - 1962



Chapter 40
Further,
“During and after the period of the Bay of Pigs, Alejos Arzu reported that he worked with Irangate principal, Theodore Shackley [CIA], then running “Operation Mongoose” to assassinate Fidel Castro from the JM/WAVE station in Miami, Florida . . . ” {18}
The other CFR/Knight of Malta was Gustavo Cisneros of whom we read in 1987:
“Vice-president of the Venezuelan Association of the SMOM. The Cisneroses are the overlords for the Ibero-American cocaine connection in Venezuela, whose special role emphasizes ‘washing’ part of the billions in annual narcotics proceeds that go through that country . . . The Cisneros got their start in business in Venezuela through sponsorship of the Royal Bank of Canada, one of the world’s largest offshore banks involved in multi billion-dollar drug money ‘washing.’ They are partners in a Florida Finance Corporation with documented ties to Moscow’s Narodny Bank, which is central to KGB-backed terrorism and drug trafficking. Curiously, through the World Finance Corporation the Cisneros are linked to the Bay of Pigs invasion team, which quickly turned to drug trafficking to finance operations and get rich quick. But Oswaldo Cisneros’ wife Ella Fontanals de Cisneros, is a Cuban whose brother, Jose’ Fontanals Perez, currently sits on the board of directors of the Banco Nacional de Cuba in Havana, where he is an economic adviser to Fidel Castro.” {19} [Emphasis added]
Dear truth-seeker, the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion was pure betrayal! This is what Napoleon did to his Grand Army in Tzarist Russia, what Hitler did to his German Army in Soviet Russia, and what the CIA did to the Roman Catholic patriots of Hungary in 1956. The betrayal resulted in the elimination of all resistance to Castro within Cuba, securing the island as a staging base for future use by our invaders. This could never have happened had not the Jesuits controlled both sides.
Now, the Jesuits had to suppress the American and Cuban enemies of their mouthy, little puppet Castro who were outside of Cuba. So their CIA “confirmed” the existence of Soviet “nuclear missiles” in Cuba creating the paranoia of a possible “nuclear first strike attack.” Kennedy demanded their removal and prepared for a joint American and Cuban-exile invasion from Florida. (We strongly believe from our arguments of previous chapters that airborne nuclear war has never been a real threat to the nations, the Jesuits controlling both “superpowers.” We know that the Jesuits’ CFR in control of FDR gave Stalin the nuclear device in 1943. We also know that the Knights of Malta, in control of the Atomic Energy Commission (one of its former Directors having been Knight of Malta John A. McCone) as well as the American and Russian Intelligence Communities, own Chase Manhattan Bank in New

York with a branch at 1 Red Square in Moscow!) The Jesuits in control of Khrushchev (who declared that the CIA and the KGB ought to be combined “because we use the same people”) dispatched a Russian fleet (built with American technology and financed by the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank) towards Cuba. This resulted in “the Cuban Missile Crisis” in 1962 creating more paranoia. Kennedy and Khrushchev struck a secret deal resulting in no invasion, the Russian fleet returning home. Like the Hungarian uprising in 1956, this stage-play and betrayal inflamed the fury of all involved. The low-level CIA agents not “in the know” with Angleton were enraged against Kennedy; they thought he had deliberately betrayed them. Mafia soldiers not “in the know” with Cardinal Spellman’s Mafia “Commission” were enraged against Kennedy, as they had lost their casinos in Havana. The patriotic Cubans were enraged against Kennedy perceiving him as again refusing to end Jesuit-trained Fidel Castro’s merciless, absolutist, Jesuit-controlled dictatorship.
The Jesuits, perfectly creating the agitation, were now ready to eliminate their disobedient son and brother Knight, President Kennedy. Betrayed by Skull and Bones member McGeorge Bundy at the Bay of Pigs and deceived by his Secretary of State – the Cardinal’s Dean Rusk – during the Cuban Missile Crisis, Kennedy the victim now had enough serious enemies among the infuriated CIA, FBI, Military Intelligence and Mafia foot soldiers to be boldly assassinated in broad daylight. The Intelligence Community began the “black operation” called “Operation Mongoose.” Its purpose was to further exhaust and eliminate Castro’s enemies, precisely as Knight of Malta Oliver L. North and Knight of Malta William J. Casey, with their “aid to the Contras,” eliminated all resistance to the Communist government in Nicaragua, John Cardinal O’Connor having warmly embraced Daniel Ortega. The CIA secretly attacked Cuba with regular raids, crop burning and counterfeiting its currency justifying Castro’s devaluation and creation of a new currency further impoverishing the Cuban people. But “Operation Mongoose” was ultimately suppressed by President Kennedy, which resulted in two things. First, it sealed Kennedy’s fate. The assassins within the Cardinal’s Network were eager to eliminate him. Lastly, Castro’s Jesuit despotism was sealed and for the last forty years he has been the perfect puppet of Rome. He has viciously suppressed the free circulation of the Bible as well as any popular movement towards “liberal” self-government – where the people can be more than slaves – pursuant to the Jesuits’ wicked and evil Council of Trent and their “Holy Alliance.”
One final question. Why would the Jesuits go to such extremes to enthrone and maintain Castro in power and thereby close Cuba to a free press and American tourism? What possible benefit would the island of Cuba – that poverty-stricken hellhole specializing in cigars and sugar – give to the long-term plans of the imperialistic Sons of Loyola? Dear truth-seeker, the only answer can be that it has
The Jesuits – 1959 - 1962

been commercially sacrificed and secured by a Jesuit military dictator – advised by the Knights of Malta – to be the staging base for a future Moslem invasion of Fourteenth Amendment America. Is not the American Navy bringing Afghan “prisoners of war” from Bin Laden’s al Qaeda Islamic Terrorist Network into Cuba – only ninety miles away from Miami – at this very moment in 2003?
And if this be true, what real purpose has Guantanamo Naval Base been serving for the last forty years, knowing full well that the Navy always starts our wars? If the Soviets were so powerful in 1962 why did they not demand that we Americans abandon the Base to Castro? Could it be that the Cardinal’s Council on Foreign Relations, in control of the Navy’s top Admirals, are using it as a secret supply line, amassing weapons and equipment underground for the future invasion of the American South, filled with Protestant and Baptist communities providing the majority of the world’s gospel-preaching missionaries? As Protestant East Prussia was destroyed by the Jesuits’ Grand Inquisitor and his Red Army, so will be the Protestant South – filled with the Jesuit General’s occult Freemasonry – unless we repent and return to serve the risen Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ!
And if this is true, when the Jesuit-trained, Roman Catholic Communist, Fascist, bastard son of a Nazi and absolute military dictator, Fidel Castro, dies, Cuba will never be free unless we invade it with a Bible-reading Protestant army free of Jesuit commanders and intrigue. Would it not be wonderful to give back Cuba to the Cuban people having suffered exile, imprisonment and death at the hands of Castro and his advisors — those Sons of Loyola! Dear truth-seeker, the invasion and occupation of Cuba would enable the exiled Cubans of Miami, Florida to return to their native land and aid in our defense in preventing a successful Moslem invasion of the American Protestant South, the Pope’s armada embarking from Africa’s West Coast and landing in Cuba — the shortest distance across the Atlantic Ocean! Now who betrayed those brave men, Cubans and CIA agents attempting to overthrow tyranny in Cuba with the Bay of Pigs invasion? According to Col. Prouty it was not President Kennedy: it was CFR member McGeorge Bundy. We read:
“Why wasn’t that crucial air strike flown, after the President had specifically directed it to be done? . . . A most unusual article, ‘The Brigade’s My Fault’, appeared on the op-ed page of the New York Times on October 23, 1979. It contained an elaborate and confusing confession. Its author was McGeorge Bundy . . . He recalled all those major programs the CIA had under full steam when the Kennedy administration came to Washington in 1961, then wrote: ‘So I have to consider that there was a staff failure – which means mostly me.’ He leaves no question about it as he writes that after eighteen years of contemplation, ‘The Brigade’s My Fault.’ ” {20} [Emphasis added]
The Jesuits – 1959 - 1962

This betrayal was a masterstroke of Jesuit genius! It enthroned Castro in power by eliminating his most dangerous enemies. Plus, it infuriated the lower levels of the CIA, the FBI, the Mafia and Military Intelligence, as they believed Kennedy to be the culprit behind the betrayal. Only the few at the top really knew what happened. And why did this happen? Because prior to “the sacrifice of the mass” at the Bay of Pigs, the Jesuits knew that Kennedy was not going to escalate their “Crusade” in Vietnam, as it was intended to ignite the present multi-billion dollar drug trade. So having enraged the rank and file of the American Empire’s Intelligence Community and having angered every Mafia family, the Jesuits used the leaders of those communities, commanding hundreds of foot soldiers, to murder the President. The Jesuits used their Cardinal of international intrigue from “the Powerhouse” in New York, Francis Spellman, to oversee the assassination and cover-up. The leaders Spellman used were Knights of Malta, Shriner Freemasons and Mafia Dons.
Dear truth-seeker, this is why the Vatican’s Jesuits, with the blessing of their “infallible” Cold Warrior and Roman Caesar, Pope Paul VI, used their foot soldiers under the command of that Roman Senator, Francis Cardinal Spellman, to assassinate the Empire’s only Roman Catholic President and “brother” Knight of Columbus, John F. Kennedy. For he was mortally wounded in the house of his friends — shot in the upper back from behind by a Secret Service Agent in the follow-up vehicle, George Hickey, and shot in the head from the front, within three feet of the bleeding Texas Governor, by the left-handed Secret Service Agent driving the Presidential limousine, Navy Seal William Greer. According to Robert Groden’s most excellent video, JFK: The Case For Conspiracy released in 1993, the gunshot entered above the right eye. While traveling through the President’s head, the bullet blew out and away the flap of flesh and bone from the right temple area and exited the rear of the head. Thus, the path of the trajectory leads directly to the driver, the shot from “the Grassy Knoll” serving as a deliberate distraction for the crowd. Fearing for her life and terrified, with her flight survival instinct in full control of her will, this is why Jackie Kennedy sought to get out of the Presidential limousine by moving away from the murderous driver. (Orders had been given not to harm Jackie, as she was intensely loved by the Company’s Secret Service. She had also attended Georgetown University for a time and her sister Lee’s husband was the Polish Prince Stanislaus Radziwill — another powerful Knight of Malta!) Crawling onto the trunk of the convertible she then retrieved the blown away portion of the President’s brain and later handed it to one of the doctors at Parkland Hospital. (Remember, four American Presidents – Lincoln, Garfield, McKinley and Kennedy – having been murdered by Jesuit-controlled assassins, received their killing shots from a point-blank range!) Both Secret Service agents, Hickey and Greer, were under orders from their boss, Jim Rowley, as he was the Director of the Secret Service in 1963, a former FBI agent and personal friend of Francis Cardinal Spellman’s J. Edgar Hoover, a Papal Knight and a darling of the Jesuit Daniel J. Power at Georgetown University.

Following the example of Knight of Malta William Donovan, this apostate Protestant Presbyterian and Shriner Freemason worked hand-in-hand with the KGB through another Knight of Malta, James Jesus Angleton. In 1956 Dulles betrayed the Hungarians into the hands of the Soviets and in 1961 he sabotaged the Bay of Pigs Invasion, betraying the “liberal” Cubans into the hands of that Jesuit-trained, Roman Catholic Communist Freemason, Fidel Castro. Dulles went on to participate in the assassination of President Kennedy and its cover-up, as he was appointed by Cardinal Spellman’s President Johnson to be on the Warren Commission. This prostitute Protestant Presbyterian, Allen W. Dulles, is one of President Kennedy’s most notorious assassins along with every ensuing Director of the CIA and every subsequent Archbishop of New York; for, “silence is consent.” Crippled by a Jesuit-controlled Justice Department and “the Order of the FBI,” we patriotic American people have no recourse to redress what has rightly been called “the crime of the century.” The Last Hero: Wild Bill Donovan, Anthony Cave Brown, (New York: Times Books, 1982).

Vatican II Pope John XXIII Seeks to End the Cold War Replaced by Cold Warrior Pope Paul VI
“If two opposed blocs [the Jesuit General’s socialist “Communist” East financed by his corporate “Capitalistic” West] should finally succeed in settling their differences . . . what would become of the Vatican? . . . Thus the Vatican threw off its mask and openly recommended the continuance of the cold war — pending the hot one.” {1}
Edmond Paris, 1964 French Historian
The Vatican Against Europe
Vatican II began in October of 1962 and lasted until December of 1965. There were many surface changes to the Roman Catholic Institution. The Mass would no longer be performed in Latin, Protestants were no longer called “heretics” but rather “separated brethren” and the priests’ formal “prayers” for “the perfidious Jews” ceased. After Rome’s Second Thirty Years’ War, the Jesuit masters wanted to deceive the world into believing that the Pope was for peace and religious liberty. But in substance nothing changed. The Pope was to continue to uphold the Jesuits’ bloody Council of Trent. We read from the Documents of Vatican II:
“The salient point of this Council is not, therefore, a discussion of one article or another of the fundamental doctrine of the church which has repeatedly been taught by the Fathers and by ancient and modern theologians, and which is presumed to be well known and familiar to all.
For this a Council was not necessary. But from renewed, serene, and tranquil adherence to all the teaching of the Church in its entirety and preciseness, as it still shines forth in the Acts of the Council of Trent and First Vatican Council [i.e. we must still kill the “accursed heretics” and the Pope is still “infallible”] . . . The substance of the ancient doctrine of the deposit of faith is one thing, and the way in which it is presented is another [i.e. we must carry out the ancient goals of killing “heretics and liberals,” accursed and condemned over one hundred times by the Order’s “sacred Council,” but in another way].” {2} [Emphasis added]
The Jesuits – 1963



Chapter 41
In pursuing Rome’s quest to establish an international World Government under the Pope of Jesuit making, the Council called for an end to the Cold War by calling for universal disarmament, including the abolition of private gun ownership, and the end of war in general. Again we read:
“THE TOTAL BANNING OF WAR, AND INTERNATIONAL ACTION FOR AVOIDING WAR:
It is our clear duty, then, to strain every muscle as we work for the time when all war can be completely outlawed by international consent. This goal undoubtedly requires the establishment of some universal public authority acknowledged by all, and endowed with effective power to safeguard, on the behalf of all, security, regard for justice, and respect for rights . . . Hence everyone must labor to put an end at last to the arms race, and to make a true beginning of disarmament . . . ” {3}
Pope John XXIII followed the Jesuit General’s open and future policy laid down in the Council. We read:
“Pope John XXIII (1958-63) reversed the anti-Communist policies of his predecessor, Pope Pius XII. He commenced dialogue with the communists of Europe and signaled Soviet Russia that the Vatican would be ready to cooperate with her. He fathered the Vatican II Council and ecumenism.” {4}
But while pursuing the policy of ending the Cold War, Pope John XXIII suddenly “died” of a rapidly progressing cancer (according to Gordon Thomas, an Irish journalist, as revealed in his masterpiece on Israel’s Mossad, Gideon’s Spies) in July of 1963. And who replaced him? It was the secret Cold Warrior and kingpin, having operated the Vatican Ratlines, Cardinal Montini who became Pope Paul VI.
Under Pope Paul VI the Cold War would continue but President Kennedy persisted in following the pro-communist, anti-Cold War leading of Pope John XXIII. Therefore, like the Pope, President Kennedy also “died” and was replaced with the Cold Warrior Freemason and servant of Cardinal Spellman, President Lyndon Johnson — who, on his deathbed for a job well done, was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church just like Thaddeus Stevens. As the Cardinal of Lorraine in league with the Jesuits, used the military of Queen Catherine de Medici of France to make war on the French Protestants in 1572, so would Cardinal Spellman, in league with the Jesuits, use the military and Commander-in-Chief of the American Empire to make war on the Vietnamese Buddhists in 1964. The ends of Vatican politics never change, only the means. Thus “for the greater glory of God” – the “infallible” god who sits in St. Peter’s Chair – “the ends justify the means.”

Obviously, the Society of Jesus had planned on ending the Pope’s Cold War in favor of some “universal public authority acknowledged by all.” So in 1989 the Cold War “officially ended” — at least in Fourteenth Amendment America. But why were both Pope John XXIII and President Kennedy removed from their offices for following the Jesuit policy of disarmament as outlined in the Second Vatican Council? Because both sought to end the Cold War prematurely! The International Intelligence Community, the Drug Trade and the Russian War Machine were not yet fully developed. The Hoax of the Moon Landing (www.moonmovie.com) led by 33rd Degree Freemason Neil Armstrong, had not yet been perpetrated on the peoples of the world, as the true purpose of the Space Program was to put spy satellites into orbit enabling Rome’s Intelligence Communities to monitor the actions of all the inhabitants of the earth, while enforcing the evil Council of Trent. The Order’s old enemy, the White, Celtic-Anglo-Saxon Calvinistic Protestant and Baptist Middle Class people of the North American Empire, had not yet been amalgamated and communized or broken in their will, morale, health and finances. Thirty years of “relentless war, secretly or openly, against all heretics, Protestants and Liberals, . . . to extirpate and exterminate them from the face of the whole earth” had not yet taken its deadly toll. For many other reasons it clearly was not time to end the Pope’s Cold War. Thus, the Vatican’s open but false policy was to end the Cold War while its secret but true policy was to continue that most successful of Inquisitions in making “the risen Vicar of Christ” the Theocratic Universal Monarch of the World enthroned in Jerusalem’s rebuilt Temple as “that man of sin”! Francis Parkman, one of America’s greatest Nineteenth Century historians, sustains our conclusion:
“The Jesuits, then as now, were the most forcible exponents of ultramontane principles. The church to rule the world; the Pope to rule the church; the Jesuits to rule the Pope: such was and is the simple programme of the Order of Jesus, and to it they have held fast, except on a few rare occasions of misunderstanding with the Viceregent of Christ.” {5} [Emphasis added]
Indeed, the great and learned M. F. Cusack, the converted Nun of Kenmare and author of The Black Pope, which is the rarest of histories in describing this most sinister world religion to be foisted upon us by the Jesuit Order, so ably concluded:
“The Jesuits offer the world at large a system of theology by which every law, Divine and human, may be broken with impunity, and by which the very bulls of popes may be defied. It is a ghastly religion; it is a religion to be abhorred of all honest and honourable men.” {6} [Emphasis added]
Therefore, in November of 1963, four months after the death of Pope John XXIII, President Kennedy also died — at the hands of Vatican Assassins.

The placing of such authority in the hand of any body of men was tantamount to giving them all power both in heaven and on earth. They could close the gates of heaven with a word by excommunicating those who opposed them, no matter whether justly or unjustly, and they could use the power of the earthly sword to exterminate, and compel obedience to their commands.” {2} [Emphasis added]

“Woe to all who found themselves opposed to . . . [the Jesuit Order]. Sooner or later, directly or indirectly, they felt themselves cruelly stabbed, generally irremediably — some in their dearest connections, others in their credit; some in their honor; others in their official functions; and all by secret action, noiseless, continuous, and latent, in time becoming a terrible and mysterious dissolvent, which invisibly undermined reputations, fortunes, positions the most solidly established, until the moment when all sunk forever into the abyss, amid the surprise and terror of the beholders [like Alexandre Dumas’ secret, calculated actions of his vengeful, Jesuit-General-type, leading character in The Count of Monte Cristo].” {3}
Eugene Sue, 1844 French Historian and Physician The Wandering Jew
“New York was blustery on Wednesday evening, October 19, 1960. Leaves swirled on Park Avenue and the wind whipped the flags outside the Waldorf-Astoria as hundreds of men and women in evening dress scurried in from the night chill . . . Here were the rich, the powerful, and the famous, gathering for an extraordinary affair.
The occasion was the fifteenth Alfred E. Smith [a Knight of Columbus and four term Governor of New York] Memorial Foundation Dinner. Always hosted by [Jesuit-trained] Francis Cardinal Spellman, the archbishop of New York, the annual dinner had become perhaps the most significant political banquet in the nation. . . . the affair functioned as a glittering showcase for the Cardinal’s ties with businessmen, politicians and military leaders. . . . [as] Spellman [was] the most influential religious leader outside the Vatican. As usual, the dinner was attended by wealthy Republicans and Pentagon officers . . . Among them were the incredibly rich: the press lord Henry [R.] Luce, the industrialist J. Peter Grace [head of the American branch of the Knights of Malta], and the financier Bernard Baruch [the most powerful Jew in the history of the American Jewish Establishment and another one of Spellman’s Masonic Jewish Labor Zionists] all sat at the head table, within touching distance of Spellman. The Cardinal had always had a high regard for military men [as they were the teeth of the Order’s Council of Trent enforced by the Cardinal’s Council on Foreign Relations], and generals and admirals in dress uniforms were scattered among twenty-five hundred guests. They had known Spellman on the battlefields of Europe and Asia or at the Pentagon, where the Cardinal was a familiar figure and even attended military intelligence

The Cardinal was the friend of many influential conservatives, including Clare Boothe Luce [Dame of Malta], General Douglas MacArthur [Shriner], and Speaker of the House John McCormack. . . . J. Edgar Hoover [awarded the Scottish Rite’s highest recognition, the Grand Cross of Honor in 1965] and John Foster Dulles [whose son Avery Dulles is a Jesuit and now a Cardinal] were close to the Cardinal. . . . His network encompassed officials of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as many presidents, congressmen, governors, and mayors. His contacts circled the globe and included [Freemason] Winston Churchill, [Jesuit-trained] Charles de Gaulle, and [Jesuit-controlled] Francisco Franco. Spellman’s role was . . . that [i.e. of a policymaker himself] — a pivotal figure in . . . clandestine political and military operations that helped shape the history of his nation and others. . . . He wholeheartedly supported the witch-hunts of Joe McCarthy [the Jesuit-trained American fascist who indeed attacked notorious communist traitors like Alger Hiss, the author of the United Nations Charter, with an inquisitional type of procedure], helped the C.I.A. attack leftist movements around the world, and assisted the F.B.I. at home. . . . To both his admirers and his detractors, Spellman was a man of such enormous influence that he was nicknamed “the American Pope.” {4} [Emphasis added]
John Cooney, 1984 American Journalist The American Pope
As we begin to approach understanding the Kennedy Assassination we shall conduct a brief review of what we have discovered in previous chapters as well as cast some additional light upon our subject.
The Jesuit General has been the most powerful man in the world since Pius VII restored the Order or “Company” in 1814. Because of the Order’s suppression by Pope Clement XIV in 1773, the Jesuits began the Bavarian Illuminati with one of their soldiers, Adam Weishaupt. The Illuminati absorbed the Jewish House of Rothschild creating a colossus of wealth around the world, subject to the Jesuit General. With this financial arm in place the Jesuits then made war on the Vatican including the Pope, the Roman Catholic Monarchs of Europe and the Order of the Dominicans. This Inquisition and Crusade was called “the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars.” For twenty-five years, the Jesuit General’s Masonic agents,

particularly in the person of Napoleon Bonaparte, conducted war. Bonaparte also punished the Knights of Malta, driving them from their island home to Russia.
Shortly before Napoleon’s deliberate loss of the Battle of Waterloo, the Jesuit Order was revived and emerged supreme among secret societies. It controlled the Papacy, the Knights of Malta, Islamic Shriner Freemasonry, Opus Dei and later, in Fourteenth Amendment America, the Knights of Columbus and the Mafia.
It is this Network that controls every nation more or less, restoring and maintaining the Pope’s Temporal Power worldwide. In the American Empire it controls Wall Street, the major corporate monopolies, the Federal Reserve Bank, the Council on Foreign Relations – it commanding the President and every department subject to him – and thus, the country’s Military Industrial Complex. The Network or “Fraternity,” also called “the Octopus,” controls all shipping ports and overland trucking with the Mafia’s Longshoremen and Teamsters. In control of organized crime, including white slavery and the drug trade, it makes billions annually, the CIA and Mafia working together. The Jesuits, being the great agitators of States, control the Press, the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, the anti-communist John Birch Society, and the Black Muslims composing the pro-communist Nation of Islam — all through the Egyptian Mystery Religion of Isis and Osiris culminating in high-level, occult Freemasonry composed of ninety degrees according to a former eighty-eighth degree Freemason, Michael J. McArthur.
With Francis Cardinal Spellman in command of this economic, political and religious colossus we no longer wonder why he was called “the American Pope.” Cardinal Spellman became the most powerful churchman in the history of the nation, as none had ever been his equal. Through his travels during World War II as President Roosevelt’s personal agent abroad, he established worldwide connections with those men who ran the International Intelligence Community. What Cardinal Richelieu was to France during the First Thirty Years’ War, Cardinal Spellman was to the American Empire during the Second Thirty Years’ War.
As the Military Vicar and protector of all the Military Orders in Fourteenth Amendment America, his power reached through every Knight of Malta and Knight of Columbus under his Command. In 1963 some of those Knights of Malta were:
1. J. Peter Grace – Head of the American “tongue” of SMOM, with international business interlocks everywhere through W. R. Grace & Co.;
2. Henry R. Luce – Controller of the American Press, called “Lucepress,” from Rockefeller Center in New York;
3. Myron C. Taylor – FDR’s personal ambassador to the Vatican during World War II who aided Allied leaders in preventing a Jewish exodus from Europe;

The Cisneros got their start in business in Venezuela through sponsorship of the Royal Bank of Canada, one of the world’s largest offshore banks involved in multi billion-dollar drug money “washing.” They are partners in a Florida finance corporation with documented ties to Moscow’s Narodny Bank, which is central to KGB-backed terrorism and drug trafficking. Curiously, through the World Finance Corporation the Cisneros are linked to the Bay of Pigs invasion team,” {6} ;
(The ties between J. Peter Grace (an Irish American nobleman descended from the House of Stuart), Gustavo Cisneros (a Spanish nobleman), Kim Philby (an English nobleman) and Queen Elizabeth II are sufficient to prove the Sovereign Military Order of Malta to be the head of the SIS, the CIA and KGB — the Jesuit General’s International Intelligence Community.)

22. Edward “Ted” M. Kennedy – Not a Knight of Malta but a Knight of Columbus, lifetime U.S. Senator, trustee at the Jesuits’ Boston College and brother to John and Robert Kennedy — both brothers as well as his nephew, John Kennedy, Jr., having been murdered by the International Intelligence Community controlled by Jesuit Generals Janssens, Arrupe and Kolvenbach.
These are but a few of the many “Papal Knights” honeycombed throughout the government of the American Empire. Remember, dear truth-seeker, the American Empire belongs to the Jesuits. They created it with the Fourteenth Amendment, they built it with their Federal Reserve Bank and they use it financially and militarily to restore the Temporal Power of the Pope. If you are a Fourteenth Amendment citizen, they created you in the law, they granted you the privilege to live in their nation and you will perform pursuant to their wishes as made known by their Congress and enforced by their Commander-in-Chief through their Federal and State War Courts. Everything you own was purchased with their fiat money or their credit. You live under a benevolent military dictatorship as created by the Emergency War Powers Act of 1950. The Constitution is a dead letter and has no standing in any State or Federal Court, as there are no Constitutional arguments entertained when it comes to common-law rights of American freemen, originally secured by the Bill of Rights and the U.S. Constitution. The law of the flag trimmed in gold fringe is the law of the land, it being the military flag of the Empire’s Commander-in-Chief, the former President William Clinton, and now President George W. Bush.
As “the American Pope” operating out of “the Little Vatican” in New York – the wealthiest Diocese in the world – his power extended to the Mafia’s “Commission” first revealed by Joe Valachi in The Valachi Papers. Two of those Roman Catholic Commission members were Frank Costello (the friend of Joe Kennedy and J. Edgar Hoover) and Charles “Lucky” Luciano, the foremost crime boss on the East Coast. Of Spellman’s negotiations with the mobster during “the Luciano Project” involving the Office of Naval Intelligence, Martin Lee writes:
“In the early 1940’s, Spellman served as an intermediary in secret negotiations between the Roosevelt White House and high-level organized crime figures in what came to be known as “Operation Underworld.” FDR promised to release mob chief Lucky Luciano from prison if the Mafia could guarantee the protection of American ships based on the eastern seaboard that were vulnerable to German attack.

Spellman turned to his mob contacts in New York to arrange the deal after seeking permission from Pope Pius XII. He went on to serve as Pope Pius’ right arm and was a staunch supporter of U.S. military involvement
in Vietnam.” {7}
The Cardinal’s power also extended to the Empire’s most influential Freemasons. They included Presidents Roosevelt, Truman and Johnson. It also included Allen Dulles, the Freemason and Director of the CIA (who had a direct line to the KGB in the Kremlin), who was also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Dulles’ nephew, Avery Dulles, became a powerful Jesuit at Fordham University and was recently, at the age of eighty-two, created a “Cardinal.” Others were J. Edgar Hoover, who made it a practice to recruit FBI agents from Jesuit (and Mormon) Universities, many of whom became Knights of Columbus. Others were Gerald Ford and Chief Justice Earl Warren of the Warren Commission, as Warren was responsible for the illegal imprisoning of thousands of Japanese Americans in mid-West concentration camps during World War II. Of the Masonic influence involved in Cardinal Spellman’s oversight of the Kennedy Assassination we read:
“Mason Lyndon Johnson appointed Mason Earl Warren to investigate the death of Catholic [Knight of Columbus] Kennedy. Mason and member of the 33rd degree, Gerald R. Ford, was instrumental in suppressing what little evidence of a conspiratorial nature reached the commission. Responsible for supplying information to the Commission was Mason and member of the 33rd degree, J. Edgar Hoover. Former CIA director and Mason, Allen Dulles [whose mistress was the friend of Ruth Payne, the landlord of Marina Oswald, further connecting the former CIA director to the Order’s sacrificial lamb] was responsible for most of his agency’s data to the panel.” {8} [Emphasis added]
Lastly, the Cardinal had a few powerful and devoted Jews at his service. They were Robert Moses, the Freemason Bernard M. Baruch and bosom friend of Freemason John D. Rockefeller Jr., Abraham Beame and Charlie Silver, called “Spelly’s Jew” by John Cooney, the author of The American Pope, of whom we read:
“And then there was . . . ‘Spelly’s Jew’, who raised funds and provided political and economic contacts in the Jewish community [Jesuits and Talmudic Rabbis working together] and also became a deputy mayor.” {9}
After the assassination, during the Warren Commission’s cover-up, Spellman would be served by another Jew who, for his good behavior, would be rewarded with a lifetime in the U.S. Senate. Pennsylvania’s pseudo conservative, gun-grabbing, 33rd degree Freemason Arlen Specter was “Spelly’s evil Jew.”

This was “the Network” Cardinal Spellman oversaw, “the Powerhouse” which he commanded. Aided by the Jesuits, the Cardinal’s Knights in high finance and intelligence kept him informed as to any movement afoot that would pose a threat to Rome’s power in her “Holy Roman” Fourteenth Amendment American Empire, further enabling him to uphold his Oath as a Cardinal!
Dear truth-seeker, based on the foregoing conclusion, if there was a threat to the life of our Roman Catholic Knight of Columbus, President John Kennedy, who would have fulfilled the Vatican’s bidding, whose father, Joseph P. Kennedy, was a prominent Knight of Malta having aided “Jesuitical Politics” by causing the Great Depression, by putting FDR in office and by endorsing the Jesuits’ Adolf Hitler (whose War Machine was built by the Jew-hating, “Episcopalian” Irish pro-Roman Catholic, Henry Ford, and financed with gold from the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank), would not the Cardinal have been ordered to use all his power to prevent it? During the last forty years of fascist tyranny in Cuba has the Jesuit-trained, Roman Catholic Communist Castro, with ambassadors to the Pope’s Sovereign State of Vatican City and to the headquarters of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, ever been overthrown by any faction including the CIA? (An old schoolmate and friend of the author was told by John Hickey, a deceased CIA assassin that, upon having Castro in his sniper rifle sights and ready to delightfully pull the trigger, he was given the order to abort!!!) The Jesuits, in command of Cuban and American intelligence, would never permit it! So it would have been with Kennedy had he, like Castro, obeyed his Jesuit masters. Clearly, it was no less than a Cardinal Spellman who could oversee the Kennedy assassination while possessing the power to cover it up. That power was wielded through his Knights of Malta for the benefit of his master, Pope Paul VI, whose confessor was the pro-Zionist Jesuit Paolo Dezza (who had converted Chief Rabbi of Rome Israel (Eugenio) Zolli to Catholicism, taking his “Christian” name from Pope Pius XII!) and whose master in turn was the General of the Jesuits, Jean-Baptiste Janssens, whose master in turn was Satan.
And why did Satan, who “was a murderer from the beginning,” use his vast array of brainwashed slaves to commit this crime of the century? Dear truth-seeker, Satan’s great dream is to “be like the Most High” — the Lord Jesus Christ. With an insatiable desire he craves to be worshipped by all nations in Jerusalem, as he sits on his throne inside Solomon’s rebuilt Temple. Jealously protecting the office of the Papacy for the last seventeen hundred years, he intends to indwell a resurrected Pope “whose mortal wound was healed.” He will become the Eighth Roman King called “the beast.” Using the Militia of the Jesuit General in control of the Pope and his Hierarchy, it is to this evil end that he actively works every political event under his immediate control, including the assassination of President Kennedy. Satan’s Company, in fulfilling his age long dream, is the obedient, educated and unrelenting,
Society of Jesus.

All was going well for the Vatican’s Jesuits. With their International Intelligence Community, they had begun their Inquisition and Crusade in the Far East. Their tools, Truman and Eisenhower, had begun the Vietnam War and it would prove to be a great harvest of “heretics” pursuant to the Jesuits’ Council of Trent. The Cold War had been heated up with the sabotage of Francis Gary Powers’ U-2 spy plane. Because of lack of fuel it was forced down in Russia, which ended the planned meetings for peace between the United States and Russia. Nixon, openly backed by Spellman (who was secretly for Kennedy), would have continued Eisenhower’s foreign policy of “fighting communism.” But “Surprise, Surprise!” John Kennedy won the election in 1960 by a mere one hundred thousand votes.
As usual, the Society of Jesus with their powerful Knights of Malta had engineered the election. Kennedy, loyal to his masters, continued the Jesuits’

Communist Negro agitation (called the Civil Rights Movement, inspired by Jesuits McSorley and LaFarge), forcibly integrating the Armed Services and thus further destroying the morale of our once invincible American Military. He also, according to Dr. Peter Beter, was used to rob Fort Knox of Fourteenth Amendment America’s gold, moving it to the Federal Reserve Bank in New York.
But after the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion President Kennedy changed. Due to his betrayal by the Jesuits’ Council on Foreign Relations in the person of McGeorge Bundy, he sought to “break the CIA into a thousand pieces.” Why? Because the CIA was the teeth of the Council on Foreign Relations, the enforcer of the Empire’s secret government. Of this relationship Victor Marchetti tells us:
“It was in such an atmosphere of restiveness and doubt, on a January meeting in 1968, that a small group of former intelligence professionals and several other members of the cult of intelligence met to discuss the role of the CIA in U.S. foreign policy, not at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia but at the Harold Pratt House on Park Avenue — the home of the Council on Foreign Relations.” {2}
And no wonder, for Allen Dulles, the Director of the CIA in 1961 had been a CFR member for years just like Bundy, who was Dulles’ tool to wreck the Cuban invasion that Kennedy had approved. So, Kennedy secretly fired Dulles – the darling of the Vatican’s Jesuits – while openly he accepted his resignation. Kennedy then appointed John A. McCone to replace him. McCone was one of Spellman’s Knights and would prove to be one of the President’s assassins, resigning in 1965. Meanwhile, President Kennedy seriously resisted the power of the Vatican’s Jesuit General Janssens. First, according to The Washington Post, he determined to destroy the CIA — that agency which Truman described after the Kennedy Assassination as “a symbol of sinister and mysterious foreign intrigue.” We read:
“Kennedy did fail in his attempt to gain full control of the CIA and its major partners in the Defense Department. It was the most crucial failure of his abbreviated presidency. He recognized his adversary during his first term, and as he related confidentially to intimate acquaintances, ‘When I am reelected, I am going to break that agency into a thousand pieces.’ He meant to do it too, but the struggle cost him his life.” {3)
Secondly, President Kennedy sought to end the Vietnam War. The way in which he sought to end it was described in a report, entitled,
“ ‘Memorandum for the President, Subject: Report of McNamara-Taylor Mission to South Vietnam’ . . .
The Jesuits – 1960 - 1963



592 Vatican Assassins
With this report in hand, President Kennedy had what he wanted. It contained the essence of decisions he had to make. He had to get reelected to finish programs set in motion during his first term; he had to get Americans out of Vietnam.” {4}
President Kennedy began to implement these policies along with limiting the power of the CIA. But those policies were reversed.
“On November 22, 1963, the government of the United States was taken over by the superpower group [the Order merely using its American Intelligence Community to remove one of its Presidential creations] that wanted an escalation of the warfare in Indochina and a continuing military buildup for generations to come.” {5}
And who was responsible for the reversal of President Kennedy’s policies after his brutal assassination? It was the Jesuits’ CIA, controlled by one of Cardinal Spellman’s Knights of Malta, John A. McCone. We read from the book First Hand Knowledge written by CIA agent and Kennedy assassin, Robert D. Morrow:
“At 8:30 AM, on Saturday, the 24th of November, 1963, the limousine carrying CIA Director John McCone pulled into the White House grounds. McCone was there to brief the President and the slain President’s former aide, McGeorge Bundy [the one responsible for the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion] . . . He was also there to transact one piece of business prior to becoming involved in all the details entailed in a presidential transition — the signing of National Security Memorandum 278 [in fact 273], a classified document which immediately reversed John Kennedy’s decision to de-escalate the war in Vietnam. The effect of Memorandum 278 would give the Central Intelligence Agency carte blanche to proceed with a full-scale war in the Far East, a war that would eventually involve over half a million Americans in a life and death struggle without the necessity of Congressional approval.
In effect, as of November 23, 1963, the Far East would replace Cuba as the thorn in America’s side [because the Jesuits had given Cuba to Castro!]. It would also create a whole new source of narcotics for the Mafia’s worldwide markets. (As mentioned earlier, Victor Marchetti, the former Deputy Director to Richard Helms, claimed in his book, The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence, that Air America, the CIA’s proprietary airline, was used as a carrier for opium.)” {6} [Emphasis added]

McCone, escalated the Vatican’s War in Vietnam and gave the CIA unlimited power to carry out the Jesuit General’s policy of mass-murder while developing the Mafia’s drug trade. Every segment of Rome’s Fraternity benefited. The Vatican’s Federal Reserve Bank made trillions financing the Military Industrial Complexes of both the East and West; the International Intelligence Community grew to unbelievable proportions united at its apex in the Vatican; the pharmaceutical industry made billions; the Mafia made billions with the drug trade; Rome’s oil companies and Arab nations made billions; President Johnson and his Texas oil men made billions as the tankers of Rome’s shipping tycoons unloaded their crude in both Saigon and Hanoi; and, millions of “heretics” were murdered throughout Southeast Asia. The blindly patriotic people of Fourteenth Amendment America were further reduced to economic and political slavery with its White Protestant Middle Class further destroyed along with eighty thousand vets committing suicide, many of whom having suffered untold tortures.
Thirdly, President Kennedy also resisted the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank and its monopoly fiat money, properly called “indulgences.” Colonel Gritz writes:
“When Kennedy . . . called for a return of America’s currency to the gold standard, and the dismantling of the Federal Reserve System — he actually minted non-debt money that does not bear the mark of the Federal Reserve; when he dared to actually exercise the leadership authority granted to him by the U.S. Constitution . . . Kennedy prepared his own death warrant. It was time for him to go.” {7}
Indeed it was, time for him to go. Like Lincoln resisting the policies of the Radical Red Republicans leading to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, so Kennedy resisted the policies of the Council on Foreign Relations leading to the war in Vietnam. Neither could be allowed to serve a second term. John F. Kennedy, unlike any President since Lincoln, truly resisted “the superpower group,” Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty’s The Secret Team (so described by Papal Knight of Malta Daniel Sheehan, the chief legal council of the Jesuits’ Christic Institute, and called “The Octopus” by the murdered freelance writer Danny Casolaro), known in history as the Society of Jesus. May we Americans never forget the courage that President John F. Kennedy showed in refusing to bow to Francis Cardinal Spellman, knowing full well that his countrymen would never appreciate the pain and national tragedy he sought to prevent. Indeed, his several acts in resisting Jesuit tyranny were Profiles In Courage, forever wounded in the house of his friends, who continue their betrayal of the last bastion of freedom in the world — an America founded on Protestant and Baptist-Calvinist liberties. Their continual example of sinning by silence, allowing our enemies to triumph over us, makes cowards of our men, whores of our women, undisciplined idiots of our children and slaves of us all.

W. Dulles; Knight of Malta John A. McCone, 1962 #160 Because of Allen Dulles’ deliberate sabotage of the Bay of Pigs Invasion in 1961, President Kennedy dismissed him and appointed John McCone in his place. But Knight McCone was loyal to his master at “the Little Vatican” in New York, Archbishop and Knight of Columbus Francis Cardinal Spellman. As a former head of the Atomic Energy Commission and deeply tied to Vatican corporations composing the American Empire’s Military Industrial Complex, he used certain CIA soldiers, such as Clay L. Shaw, George DeMohrenschildt, David Ferrie, E. Howard Hunt and the patsy, Lee Harvey Oswald, to murder the President. With the Black Pope pulling the strings, Allen Dulles, through John McCone, oversaw the entire assassination and then was appointed to the cover-up Warren Commission with the blessing of the Papal Caesar in Rome.

Jesuit Priest John LaFarge, 1938 #161 Father of the American Black Civil Rights Movement In accordance with Metternich’s Holy Alliance and the Black Pope’s Council of Trent, the Society of Jesus has been committed to the destruction of our Protestant Republic and our “heretic and liberal” American people. Therefore it began “the Negro Agitation” in the early 1930s with LaFarge hypocritically accusing Protestants of instigating slavery and inventing racism when the Jesuits were the largest slaveholders in Maryland from 1650 to 1838. This agitation culminated in the violent “Civil Rights Movement” of the 1960s. Led by the Jesuit-controlled socialist, Martin Luther King, the Order’s purpose expressed by Emanuel Josephson was to “use the Negro to destroy our Republic by inciting them to savagery to effect a complete breakdown of law and order that will serve as a perfect pretext for establishing a dictatorship under themselves that will be welcomed by a terrified nation.” Remembering Malcolm X had boldly declared “the Ku Klux Klan and the Nation of Islam have the same paymasters,” Jesuit New Dealers Robert Hartnett and Georgetown’s Richard McSorley continued the agitation culminating in the 1964 Civil Rights Act and forced integration of the hated Public Schools leading to amalgamation, which always leads to moral corruption and violence (Genesis 6), making America a weak nation of color like Castro’s Cuba.

“A conspiracy is rarely, if ever, proved by positive testimony. When a crime of high magnitude is about to be perpetrated by a combination of individuals, they do not act openly, but covertly and secretly. The purpose formed is known only to those who enter into it. Unless one of the original conspirators betray his companions and give evidence against them, their guilt can be proved only by circumstantial evidence . . . and circumstances can not lie.” {8}

“Freed remembers what apparently passes for polite conversation when men such as Colby [CIA Director] and Cline get together. ‘It was quite bizarre,’ Freed said, ‘for the subject they chose was, ‘When is it acceptable to assassinate a head of state?’ ’ Colby presented what he said was a theological and philosophically sound approach. The Catholic church, he said, had long since wrestled with this question and had, to Colby’s mind, emerged with a sound concept. ‘It is acceptable,’ he said, ‘to assassinate a tyrant.’ ” {9} [Emphasis added]

Both the Secret Service and the FBI conspired to suppress evidence while Rowley and DeLoach met with the Jesuit Daniel J. Power at Georgetown shortly after the murder.

“Kennedy . . . was murdered at Dallas on November 22, 1963. . . . The killing shot came from the driver of the President’s Limousine, a CIA [Secret Service] agent who shot Kennedy in the head with a special weapon developed by the CIA. If you look at the original [Zapruder] film of the assassination in slow motion and watch the driver, then you can clearly see that he turns around with a gun in his hand, shoots, and the back of Kennedy’s head bursts. The films shown in most Western countries [JFK, Director’s Cut] have the driver cut out . . . The bullet, too, was a CIA special that only exploded after entering the body, and thus annihilated Kennedy’s brain [Since no Chief Executive has been killed with a rifle in over two hundred years, a maxim of all Jesuit-authored assassinations when using a firearm is the killing shot must be at a point-blank range like Presidents Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley as well as Franz Ferdinand at Sarajevo.] . . . all the witnesses of the conspiracy were either killed or died of fast-growing cancer [viral cell mutations created by the Jesuit General’s CIA] that they had injected — the deadly marksman in the car [the driver, Navy Seal William Greer] three weeks after the deed, for example.” {11}

Vatican Assassins
This chapter will examine the forest, not the trees. The hundreds of works covering the Kennedy assassination can be reduced to a few simple facts. These facts viewed in the context of the previous chapters lead us to the “Lion” in his “Den of Iniquity” that had the power to execute the murder and successfully cover it up. That Lion was the Cardinal of New York and his Den of Iniquity was St. Patrick’s Cathedral, “the little Vatican,” and home base of the American Branch of the Knights of Malta. From the death of Cardinal Spellman in 1967 until now (2003), the succeeding “Lions,” having kept the assassination covered up, were Cardinal Cooke (himself a Knight of Malta) and Cardinal O’Connor, a Knight of Malta and former Chaplin during Spellman’s Vietnam War, and later, a Navy Admiral. (O’Connor must have known Admiral Edward Kenney, the Surgeon General of the Navy, as well as every detail of the President’s deliberately botched and covered up autopsy overseen by JFK’s physician, Admiral George G. Burkley, at the Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland.) Edward Cardinal Egan is presently the Archbishop of New York and will continue the Great Jesuit Cover-up. Of Cardinal Spellman’s power in 1963 controlling the American Empire’s intelligence and military structure we read:
“Spellman . . . the Military Vicar of the American armed forces . . . was also the unofficial link between the Pope and John Foster Dulles, the U.S. Secretary of State [whose son, Avery Dulles, is a Jesuit] and, therefore, the Secretary’s brother Allen, head of the CIA . . . The Catholic Church in the USA [controlled by the Jesuit Order] is a force in the Pentagon, a secret agent in the FBI and the . . . prime mover of . . . the Central Intelligence Agency.” {14} [Emphasis added]
Knowing that President Kennedy was not going to escalate the Vietnam War, the Intelligence Community began to prepare for his assassination. Raised a Lutheran, Lee Oswald was chosen to be a patsy . . . As a CIA agent, he had been sent to Soviet Russia by Allen Dulles in 1959, supposedly as a defector. Knowing that the CIA (OSS) and the KGB (NKVD) had worked together during World War II, Oswald apparently took a vacation for nearly two years. During that time he married a Russian woman, Marina, whose uncle was a KGB Colonel, Vasili Khritinin. When he returned to the American Empire in 1962, without being formally debriefed, he associated with CIA agents Howard Hunt, Frank Sturgis, David Ferrie (a former Catholic Priest), Guy Banister, Count George DeMohrenschildt (a personal friend of Jackie Kennedy’s father) and Clay L. Shaw. Oswald was a CIA agent and was related to a Jesuit. Emanuel Josephson tells us:
“An interesting angle is presented by the Lee Oswald involvement. His cousin is reported to be a Jesuit priest. And it is a matter of record that Lee Oswald was invited to address the Jesuit College in Springhill, Alabama, on the subject of his activities, two weeks before the Kennedy Assassination. The Jesuit involvement closely parallels that in the Lincoln Assassination.” {15}
The Jesuits – 1963



Chapter 44
Jim Garrison clearly proved the CIA was involved in the assassination through Clay L. Shaw. He writes:
“ . . . we discovered Shaw’s extensive international role as an employee of the CIA. Shaw’s secret life as an Agency man in Rome trying to bring Fascism back to Italy was exposed in articles in the Italian press . . . To me among the most significant revelations were . . . the confirmation by both Victor Marchetti and Richard Helms that Clay Shaw had been an agent of the Central Intelligence Agency.” {16} [Emphasis added]
And who was the Director of the CIA in 1963? It was Knight of Malta John A. McCone. Prior to that McCone had been a defense contractor who had formerly headed the Atomic Energy Commission. Later in 1970, he was a board member of International Telephone & Telegraph Company (IT&T) while remaining a CIA consultant. Marchetti tells us:
“(ITT board member who later admitted to a Senate investigative committee that he had played the key role in bringing together CIA and ITT officials was John McCone, director of the CIA during the Kennedy administration and in 1970, a CIA consultant.)” {17}
Cardinal Spellman’s soldier and Director of the CIA, John A. McCone, participated in the Kennedy Assassination.
Jim Garrison and others have proved that the FBI was also involved in the assassination. He writes:
“I already had concluded that parts of the local Dallas law enforcement establishment [controlled by Cardinal Spellman’s Dallas Bishop Thomas K. Gorman] were probably implicated in the assassination or its cover-up. But now I saw that the highly respected FBI was implicated as well.” {18}
Cardinal Spellman had two agents in the FBI. The first was the Shriner Freemason and brother Cold Warrior, J. Edgar Hoover. According to John Loftus, Hoover had cooperated with the Vatican Ratlines resettling Nazi war criminals in the predominantly Roman Catholic Northeast United States. Why should he not cooperate with Spellman now? Why would he refuse? More importantly Spellman’s key man in the FBI was Knight of Malta, Cartha DeLoach. As the third in command, DeLoach was in a position to supervise the assassination and suppress evidence. Garrison proved DeLoach did in fact suppress evidence.
After the assassination we see a telling relationship between President Lyndon Johnson and Cartha DeLoach. DeLoach was known as Johnson’s man in the FBI and the President would call him any time of day. Curt Gentry writes:
The Jesuits – 1963



Vatican Assassins
“Lyndon Johnson couldn’t sleep. Late at night he had his aid Marvin Watson telephone the DeLoach bedroom. The president had suddenly become convinced that the murder of his predecessor had been a conspiracy and wanted more information from the FBI.” {19}
This is the Cartha DeLoach that had signed a five-year contract with Lee Iacocca’s Ford Mercury in connection with the television series, “The FBI.” Both DeLoach and Iacocca were Knights of Malta subject to Cardinal Spellman during the Kennedy assassination. Later DeLoach went on to be a director of PepsiCo, and according to Colonel Prouty, that company also participated in Kennedy’s assassination. We read with wonder, as it seems this web of assassins appears to be endless:
“Nixon was in Dallas with a top executive of the Pepsi-Cola Company, Mr. Harvey Russell, the general counsel. Nixon was a legal counsel to that corporation. That top executive’s son has told of Nixon’s presence in Dallas at the time of the assassination, and Russell has confirmed the accuracy of his son’s account. Later, sometime after the shooting, Nixon was driven to the Dallas airport by a Mr. DeLuca, also an official of the Pepsi-Cola Company. In addition, the son of another Pepsi-Cola executive was in Dallas at that time and had dinner with Jack Ruby, Oswald’s killer, the night before JFK was murdered.” {20}
(Is it any wonder why President Nixon, a co-conspirator in the assassination, was paranoid over the release of “the Watergate tapes”?) DeLoach, Iacocca and the Knights of Pepsi, now PepsiCo, all worked together.
At the time of the assassination in Dallas, the Catholic priest, Oscar Huber, escorted by an unknown priest, was sent from Holy Trinity Catholic Church to administer “last rites” for the President. Knowing that Kennedy’s wounds were frontal wounds of entry, Huber reported everything to his superior, the Bishop of Dallas, then “The Most Reverend Thomas Kiely Gorman, DD.” According to Martin Lee’s article entitled “Who Are the Knights of Malta?” appearing on October 14, 1983 in the National Catholic Reporter, Thomas K. Gorman was a Knight of Malta. Being a brother Knight, he must have reported directly to Cardinal Spellman and kept him apprised of what was happening in Dallas.
At the time of the assassination in Dallas, roughly 12:30PM (in the afternoon), all the telephones went dead in Washington, D.C. for about one hour. How could this have happened? Someone at IT&T had to be responsible as it serviced the Washington area. In 1963 one of the VIP’s of IT&T was Francis D. Flanagan. You guessed it. According to Martin Lee’s same article, “Who Are the Knights of Malta?”, Flanagan was a Knight. Later McCone, with his brother Knights, coordinated a deal between the CIA and IT&T to better work together.

Chapter 44 603
The author knows there were several Knights of Columbus involved in the Kennedy assassination. They were working for the FBI in particular. But the only notable Knight involved was Senator Edward Kennedy, in that, through his silence he has consented to his brother’s murder. Maybe this is what has driven the perpetual Senator from Massachusetts to his ruined, alcoholic life. Let us take a few moments to pray for the Senator that he might have a change of heart, that he would tell all and that we might protect him. For he too was subject to the occult power of Pope Paul VI’s Francis Cardinal Spellman. He was indeed “Spellmanized”!
Lastly, we know that the Mafia was involved in the Kennedy Assassination. The Mafia, OSS/CIA, FBI and Office of Naval Intelligence had been working together throughout World War II. Jack Ruby was a Mafioso and David E. Scheim makes it perfectly clear in his Contract on America that the Mob had at least two motives; the Kennedy brothers assault on Organized Crime and the loss of the Mob’s gambling paradise in Cuba.
But those were not the reasons. The Mafia Dons must have been promised that they would make more money than Havana could ever produce, through the explosion of the International Drug Trade made possible by the Vietnam War. If they helped eliminate Kennedy, Johnson would escalate the war and thereby, the drug trade. The CIA would bring the drugs in from the Golden Triangle, distribute them to the Mafia families (Sam Giancana and Santos Trafficante families) and both would profit. Mob bosses not wanting to participate would be deposed or eliminated.
More importantly, the Mafia’s Commission had a favor to repay. Cardinal Spellman, through FDR, had arranged the release of Charles “Lucky” Luciano because of “Operation Underworld” mentioned in a previous chapter. Now the Cardinal needed a favor. If refused, Spellman could use the entire International Intelligence Community, which he had helped to organize, to eliminate any Mob boss. If agreed to, new gambling centers would open up, Atlantic City being one of them. Clearly, if the President was removed, everybody would acquire more power and wealth, the Intelligence Community would become more absolute and the Cardinal would be even more respected by his peers in Rome. The rest is history.
Later, in 1964, for the first time in the nation’s history as a Republic (1789-1868) or an Empire (1868-2003), the Pope of Rome set foot in Fourteenth Amendment America. Cardinal Spellman had performed well and was rewarded by a visit from his Master, fellow Cold Warrior and Vatican Ratline handler, Cardinal Montini, who was now the Papal Caesar, Pope Paul VI.
There is yet another reason for the removal of President Kennedy. He wanted to arm Israel. Loftus and Aarons write:
The Jesuits – 1963



604 Vatican Assassins
“In September 1962 Kennedy decided to supply Israel with defensive ground-to-air missiles capable of stopping aircraft, but not the Egyptian offensive missiles. It was the first arms sale by the U.S. Government to Israel . . . Kennedy promised the Israelis that as soon as the 1964 election was over, he would break the CIA ‘into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds.’ . . . With Kennedy’s assassination in November 1963, the Israelis lost the best friend they had had in the White House since Truman departed.” {21}
And why did the Vatican’s Jesuits not want any arms sales to Israel at this time? Why did our Jesuit-controlled President, Lyndon Johnson, turn his back while the Egyptian army moved up through the Sinai desert to prepare its assault on Israel in 1967? Because the attack upon Israel had to be provoked! The Jesuits’ International Intelligence Community, deceiving Egypt into falsely perceiving the weakness of the Israeli army and the supposed abandonment of Israel by the American Empire, provoked that attack. Indeed, weakness breeds contempt and invites attack! The Six-Day war, engineered by Knight of Malta James Angleton, had one primary purpose: the taking of Jerusalem from Islamic Jordan, along with the Temple Mount. The apparent lack of military hardware on the part of Israel provoked the planned attack by Egypt. Therefore, Israel launched a preemptive strike and in six days the holy city was in the hands of Rome’s Zionist government. Had Kennedy armed Israel, the Egyptians would never have been emboldened to maneuver for war. With no provoked war there would have been no Israeli attack. With no Israeli attack the Zionist Army, controlled by the Jesuits’ Mossad, would never have taken Jerusalem. With Jerusalem in Arab hands, the high Masonic Jewish Zionists could never rebuild Solomon’s Temple – unbeknown to the Israeli people – for the Jesuits “infallible” Papal Caesar who, when risen from the dead, will be
“ . . . a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences . . . And he shall speak great words against the most High . . . and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: . . . Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.”
– Daniel 8:23; 7:25; 11:36, 37
“Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God [Solomon’s rebuilt Temple], shewing himself that he is God.”

It is safe to say that the Jesuit General, using the “infallible” Pope with his most powerful Cardinal in the American Empire, assassinated President John F. Kennedy in 1963. For it was Cardinal Spellman, “the American Pope,” in command of his soldiers – the Knights of Malta – who oversaw the assassination.
And it was certain Knights of Malta, using the Central Intelligence Agency, that aided in the actual assassination of the President. Those Knights were CIA Director, John A. McCone, and CIA officers, William F. Buckley, Jr. and Henry R. Luce. In 1963, both William F. Buckley, Jr. and Henry Luce were personal friends of CIA agent E. Howard Hunt. We read from Mark Lane’s Plausible Denial on page 270 concerning Time and Life magazines of which Henry Luce was the owner;
“ ‘I [Howard Hunt] had them [fabricated official cables], typed up on a typewriter and they were Xeroxed, and the Xeroxes were eventually shown to a person of Mr. [Charles] Colson’s confidence, and in Time and Life.’ . . . Hunt, after swearing that he had never been involved in a disinformation effort to embarrass Kennedy, had now testified that he had merely sought to doctor and create evidence to prove that Kennedy was a murderer.” {22}
Again we read of Hunt’s connection with the pompous William F. Buckley, Jr.:
“[G. Gordon] Liddy completed his testimony perfectly, stating that while he no longer associated with Hunt, he did see him last, he recalled, when both men demonstrated their support for another former CIA officer, William F. Buckley, Jr., as Buckley celebrated the anniversary of his television show at the New York Yacht Club.” {23} [Emphasis added]

Dear truth-seeker, Hunt was close to both powerhouses, Buckley and Luce. Hunt was also working with two of his fellow criminals in the future Watergate scandal, G. Gordon Liddy (Jesuit-trained) and Chuck Colson (pro-Jesuit Protestant). And in 1985, it was Mark Lane who proved in Miami’s federal court that Hunt was in Dallas the day President Kennedy was murdered. Therefore, the conclusion was obvious. The CIA with its agent, E. Howard Hunt, had killed the President. In the words of the jury’s forewoman, Leslie Armstrong, we read:
“ ‘Mr. Lane was asking us to do something very difficult. He was asking us to believe that John Kennedy had been killed by our own government. When we examined the evidence (for 65 minutes) we were compelled to conclude that the CIA had indeed killed President Kennedy.’ . . . Hunt had been part of it, and that evidence, so painstakingly presented, should now be examined by the relevant institutions of the United States Government so that those responsible for the assassination might be brought to justice.” {24} [Emphasis added]
“ . . . and it came to pass, . . . that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. And the LORD said unto Cain . . . What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground.”

“Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.”
– Genesis 9:6
Dear truth-seeker, if the government of the United States, presently overseen and managed by the Black Pope’s Council on Foreign Relations through the strong arm of its Central Intelligence Agency, its Federal Bureau of Investigation and now the Order’s Office of Homeland “Romeland” Security (it having absorbed one hundred federal agencies including the Coast Guard and now directed by the Jesuit-trained Roman Catholic Knight of Columbus, Tom Ridge), continues its refusal to punish the murderers of President John F. Kennedy, these murderers having now sacrificed many thousands of people in the Twin Towers of New York’s World Trade Center, (as both Towers were aerially attacked and then internally imploded by Archbishop Egan’s Central Intelligence Agency), we, like the Calvinists of old, must calmly and resolutely withdraw our allegiance; we must formally and legally declare our independence to the world; and then “throw off such government.” If we fail in this we will be consumed by the righteous judgment of the risen Son of God for disobeying His Holy Word — the Authorized King James Version of 1611.

Knight of Malta, William F. Buckley, Jr., 1967 #166 In 1963 Buckley was a member of Yale’s “Skull and Bones” Society, the Council on Foreign Relations, an officer in the Central Intelligence Agency and later, one of Cardinal Spellman’s Knights of Malta. After President Kennedy’s assassination, this traitor played a key role in the Great Jesuit Cover-up, constantly affirming that Oswald was the lone assassin protecting his friend E. Howard Hunt from being exposed. Later, Buckley would be named as the “godfather” of one of Hunt’s children. A close friend of fellow “Bonesman” and Knight of Malta Henry R. Luce, who controlled the national media from Rockefeller Center across the street from Francis Cardinal Spellman’s St. Patrick’s Cathedral, Buckley reached fifteen states through his T.V. program, Firing Line, and his periodical, National Review, had a worldwide readership. He was a close personal friend of the head of the American Branch of the Knights of Malta, J. Peter Grace, who in turn oversaw the Nazi “Operation Paperclip” and President Ronald Reagan’s Grace Commission. As of this date (2003) Buckley still lives and continues to maintain the Great Jesuit Cover-up on behalf of the wicked Archbishop Edward Cardinal Egan of New York, the Black Pope’s Society of Jesus, and the Papal Caesar in Rome.

Former NATO Commander and Knight of Malta Alexander Haig (who according to G. Gordon Liddy was “Deep Throat” during the Watergate Scandal and whose brother, Francis R. Haig, is a Jesuit), speaking to the Masonic Jewish Zionist Henry Kissinger, saved Zionist Israel from being overrun by the Egyptians during the Yom Kippur War in 1973. Being powerful members of the New York Archbishop’s Council on Foreign Relations, both have a complete knowledge of the Kennedy Assassination and both were used to remove President Nixon from office. Knights of Malta Haig and Casey, working with Masonic Jewish Zionists Kissinger and Hammer, brought the world closer to worshipping the risen Papal Caesar ruling from Solomon’s rebuilt Temple in Jerusalem as “the beast,” exalted by his Jewish False Prophet.

“Let proper methods be used to get knowledge of the animosities that arise among great men, that we may have a finger in reconciling their differences; for by this means we shall gradually become acquainted with their friends and secret affairs, and of necessity engage one of the parties in our interests.” {1}
Ignatius Loyola, 1540 Founder, 1st Jesuit General, 1540-1556 Secret Instructions of the Jesuits
“Whoever wishes in this Society, which we desire should be distinguished by the name of Jesus [formerly known as the Knights of the (Black) Virgin Mary] to fight as a soldier of God under the banner of the Cross, and to serve only the Lord and His bride, the Church, under the Roman Pope, the earthly Vicar of Christ, after taking the solemn vow of eternal chastity, poverty, and obedience . . . must also render service in reconciling quarrels.” {2}
Ignatius Loyola, 1540 Founder, 1st Jesuit General, 1540-1556 Formula Instituti
With the assassination of President Kennedy, as in all well laid plans of mice and men, there were a few “glicks” or difficulties that arose. One such difficulty was a hostility having arisen between the less informed agents of the FBI and Secret Service. Each blamed the other as being responsible for the President’s death. Hoover and DeLoach of the FBI, and Rowley, Greer, Kellerman, Hill and Hickey of the Secret Service knew quite well who killed the President. But the lower ranks not in the know were quarreling.
The Jesuits – 1963



Chapter 45 615
Cardinal Spellman’s agent and Knight of Malta, Cartha DeLoach, gives us a most fascinating narration of how the quarrel was resolved. As the third in command of the FBI, Knight DeLoach tells us in his “cover-up” work, Hoover’s FBI, of the absolute power the Jesuit Order wields over the American Empire’s most renowned police agencies. He writes:
“It was a bad time to quarrel. The nation needed to believe that the president of the United States was safe while driving down the streets of America. As the quarrel worsened, Father Daniel J. Power, S.J. [Society of Jesus], head of development at Georgetown [Jesuit] University called me and said, ‘Deke, why don’t you and Jim Rowley [Roman Catholic Papal Knight] have a quiet lunch with me at my office at the university?’ Rowley, chief of the Secret Service, was a former FBI agent whom I knew and liked; we both accepted.
It was the first of a number of such luncheons. Following each, I wrote a memorandum to J. Edgar Hoover with the increasing conviction that Rowley wished to cooperate rather than, as Hoover suspected, make the FBI a scapegoat for his own agency’s shortcomings.
Eventually we worked out a number of administrative procedures that strengthened the relationship between the Secret Service and the FBI and ensured greater protection for the president and his family. Today, it is far less likely that a Lee Harvey Oswald could slip through our net.
This reconciliation was all the more essential because the new president, Lyndon Johnson, issued an executive order allowing the president to use the FBI for protection as well as the Secret Service. Had Rowley and I not worked out our difficulties, such efforts would have been difficult at best.” {3} [Emphasis added]
(Dear truth-seeker, this incidence is a prime example of the Jesuit “unseen hand” in Washington. To be able to calm the storm between the Empire’s two most powerful police agencies reveals who truly maintains order – who rules – in Fourteenth Amendment America.)
The result of these meetings between Knight of Malta Cartha DeLoach and Jim Rowley at the feet of their master Daniel Power – the Jesuit – was the further centralization of Presidential power in Washington. Hoover’s “bureaucratic bastard” – The Holy Office of the Inquisition in America – moved another step closer to becoming the Empire’s Nazi-Fascist Gestapo. President Johnson, the Freemason, gave Cardinal Spellman his “extirpation of heretics” in Vietnam, and CIA Director

John A. McCone, the Knight of Malta, gave the Jesuit General’s Secret Team its International Drug Trade. That massive Drug Trade would greatly accelerate the weakening and the destruction of the White Celtic-Anglo-Saxon peoples (coupled with forced integration, amalgamation, miscegenation, unreported Black-on-White crime, the mass-marketing of corrupted, pro-Latin Vulgate “Bibles” and gun confiscation), they having founded the great and mighty Protestant nations of Western Civilization, while being the risen Son of God’s most devoted Bible-believing preachers and missionaries in the history of the true, blood-bought, Church of the Lord Jesus Christ. Is this not in fact a righteous judgment of the Lord against the predominantly atheistic and immoral, Bible-rejecting White Race of both the British and American Empires for harboring, protecting and financing that calculating, coldblooded viper – the Company of Jesus – as it pursues its hell-bent quest in destroying the Protestant Reformation? The unrestrained and unpunished Drug Trade, coupled with the loss of Hong Kong, will provide the economic base for building that military Goliath in the Far East – our future invader and destroyer – the Red Chinese Army. And the destruction of the Moslem mosques and “holy places” in Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem, secretly carried out by the Black Pope’s International Intelligence Community overseeing the Masonic leadership if the Islamic Nations and the Masonic leadership of Zionist Israel, will fire the hearts of yet another one of our future invaders – the Moslem World having survived Rome’s present war against Islam – the Papal Caesar having finally made Jerusalem an international city under the protection of his revived Holy Roman European Empire. One of our heroes, the ex-Jesuit Alberto Rivera, having gained a secret knowledge of Vatican Intelligence through the instruction of one of the Black Pope’s most powerful Jesuits and confessor to Pope Pius XII, Augustin Cardinal Bea, correctly declared:
“Jerusalem will fall into the hands of the pope and the Muslim nations [via Shriner Freemasonry] will assist him. The last pope will be the “Antichrist” who knows he must flee to Jerusalem to escape from the Vatican just before it is destroyed. (Revelation 17:16)” {4}[Emphasis added]
That Secret Team, in command of the coming Red Chinese invasion of the Empire’s West Coast and a united Moslem invasion of the Empire’s Southeast Coast, is the Borg of Star Trek, the Militia of the Black Pope controlling the Papal Caesar, the Company of Ignatius Loyola. Respectively known as the Society of Jesus, or as the great Reformer, John Calvin, surnamed these brainwashed, mind-controlled, religious fanatics and forever warring, fiery mass murderers of the risen Son of God’s Bible-believing Church, as well as His Semitic Hebrew/Jewish Nation of Israel yet to experience her national blessing under Messiah’s Abrahamic Covenant, they are:

“There was one group, one organization, whose historical background was characterized by the planning and execution of such deeds; that had a lasting consistent motive, before, during and after the crime; that had the necessary international connections; that had the money; that could elicit suicidal self-sacrifice in its members; and that continued to exist through all phases of the assassination conspiracy.

“ . . . I ran into Johnny Roselli in the yard at Terminal Island . . . He was associated with Al Capone . . . Paul Ricca, Tony Accardo, and Sam Giancana . . . He became closely associated with studio moguls, union chiefs, and stars . . . Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin sponsored him for membership in exclusive clubs like Friar’s Club...Roselli [his CIA handler being “Knight” David Atlee Phillips, a friend of “Dame” Clare Boothe Luce] had long been rumored to have been involved in the plot against Kennedy. Being linked to Sam made that seem almost logical. And knowing his background – that he was an accomplished marksman, one of the suspected gunmen at the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre – made the long-standing rumor that he was involved in Dealey Plaza also seem plausible . . . Roselli’s linking [Jack] Ruby to Sam shocked me . . . Roselli was also loose-lipped around the handful of Cubans who were doing time. Some of these people had been involved in the Bay of Pigs, were up to their eyeballs in exile politics, and had been engaged in illegal anti-Castro activities for years. They knew that Roselli, on hire to the CIA, had been involved in several attempts on Castro’s life. They also seemed to know that Roselli had been a triggerman in the assassination — and they regarded him as a hero because of that [and because of his incriminating admissions, his dismembered body was later found in 1976, packed in an oil drum floating in Miami’s Biscayne Bay] . . . There were all kinds of questions I obviously was curious about but did not ask him — about the parade route, for example. Why were the windows in the Texas School Book Depository all opened at the time of the assassination? Why wasn’t that storm drain on Elm Street sealed? He couldn’t have taken up his position without knowing something about the involvement of the Secret Service, which was responsible for the routine securing of the area, such as the sealing of the windows and storm drains. I already had far too much knowledge, and I had no desire for more.” {6} [Emphasis added]

The scriptwriter knew, as evidenced by the Zapruder Film, the President was shot by the driver, William Greer, with a .45 calibre automatic handgun, the cause of death, according to Parkland Hospital’s Dr. Robert N. McClelland, being a massive head wound of the right temple! Mobster James E.

JFK, Director’s Cut, Video
President Kennedy was now gone, and with him the hope and optimism of a generation. The Baby-Boomers, possessed of the energy to take over the world in the cause of liberty and a threat to the Jesuits’ world government under the Pope, were shattered. Johnson was now President; the Vietnam War began to escalate and the English rock group called “The Beatles” spread a senseless mania across the nation. The Civil Rights agitation carried out by priest Richard McSorley and his brother Jesuits, created hatred and violence between Blacks and Whites, as neither race wanted forced integration. Amalgamation was the order of the day as the decade of the sixties was the Second Reconstruction; the Bible-believing White, Celtic-Anglo-Saxon race, being the Jesuits’ greatest enemy, must be destroyed “by any means necessary.” The drug culture was born on the West Coast and a whole generation of us young Americans became addicted to rock music, soul music, fictional movies, professional sports, drugs, sexual immorality and the atheistic religion of evolution.
In this environment the Jesuits’ International Intelligence Community became supreme. Indeed, personal sin emboldens the enemy against us. As we Americans lost our hope we sought to fill our “God is dead” vacuum with pleasure. We lost our courage to resist tyranny in standing for a righteous cause with a righteous man. The Jesuit-controlled Warren Supreme Court banned the Bible and prayer, the two Protestant citadels that made America great, from our Protestant public school system so accursed by the Order. It legalized interracial marriage in 1966, overturning the laws of sixteen States to the contrary. Over the years the Order continued to use the unsolved murder of the President as an agitation to destroy American patriotism and morale. We American people, having lost confidence in the God of our Fathers and our leaders, found ourselves adrift on a stormy sea with no safe harbor in sight.

622 Vatican Assassins
The beginning of this most deplorable state of affairs began with the crime greater than the assassination itself. That crime was and is to this day, the Great Jesuit Cover-up. The true authors can never be known; for, it would lead to the end of the political power of Rome over the American Empire. With the Jesuits and their Archbishop of New York exposed, the freedom loving Roman Catholics of Fourteenth Amendment America would leave the Church en masse! Rome would lose its grip over the International Intelligence Community along with the financial and military power of the Empire. Upon the Order’s expulsion from American soil, other nations, remembering their past, would follow suit, to the end that the Society of Jesus would be without a home and imprisoned wherever found — Praise God!
Indeed, the great Achilles Heel of the Sons of Loyola is the Kennedy Assassination. Left unguarded, and if successfully attacked, the entire house of cards – held together with fear – collapses. This is why the Order, with its myriad of hydra heads, will go to every evil extreme to continue the Vatican’s greatest American crime of the century — the Great Jesuit Cover-up. In Jesuit Temporal Coadjutor Oliver Stone’s masterpiece movie entitled JFK, Director’s Cut, Colonel Prouty, in speaking with Jim Garrison, poses three questions in solving the Kennedy Assassination. They are:
1. Why?
2. Who Benefited?
3. Who has the power to cover it up?
In light of the past two hundred years of true history, we have answered the first two questions. We shall now address the third. We know Jesuit General Janssens (who ruled the Masonic Jewish Zionists’ World Jewish Congress through its President – Nahum Goldmann – and his assistant/advisor — Joe Golan), in control of Pope Paul VI (through the Pope’s Jesuit confessor, Paolo Dezza. the pro- Zionist, intimate friend and fellow cabbalist of the powerful Talmudic Chief Rabbi of Rome Israel (Eugenio) Zolli), in control of the Archbishop of New York, Cardinal Spellman, in control of the Knights of Malta, American Freemasonry, Opus Dei, the Knights of Columbus, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the American Mafia greatly benefited by the Kennedy Assassination. This is why they did it. Every group within this “Fraternity” increased in wealth and power; while the Jesuits progressed towards their ultimate goal of one-world government under their “infallible” Pope, ruling from Solomon’s rebuilt Temple in Jerusalem.
Since the “Fraternity” benefited, it has the power to cover-up its crime. Each succeeding Jesuit General, “infallible” Pope and Archbishop of New York has the
The Jesuits – 1964 - 2000



Chapter 46 623
same great power wielded by their predecessors and they use it! Employing the maxim “the ends justify the means” they carry out their plots “by any means necessary,” as the Jesuits would say, “For the greater glory of God” — the god who sits in “St. Peter’s Chair,” the “infallible” Pope of Rome and creature of Satan’s Jesuit General, the Black Pope.
Therefore, the last three Archbishops of New York, Cardinal Cooke, Cardinal O’Connor, and Cardinal Egan, have continued to exercise the same all-encompassing power, or more, that Cardinal Spellman used to carry out and cover-up the assassination of JFK.
As we have previously covered, the Archbishop of New York is a warrior, a commanding General. This is why he is styled “the Military Vicar” of the American Empire. In 1921 the Council on Foreign Relations was founded by several Papal agents, one of which was the Shriner Freemason Colonel Edward House. By 1963 the CFR (overseen by David Rockefeller) controlled the press, both political parties, banking, the major corporations, the government and its intelligence community. Cardinal Spellman controlled the CFR through two of his Knights of Malta. The first was shipping tycoon and international industrialist, J. Peter Grace, head of the American Branch of the Knights of Malta and President of W. R. Grace & Co. of New York. The other was Henry R. Luce, the seventh most powerful man in the United States according to Winston Churchill, and the utter dictator over the Empire’s press, called the “Lucepress.” Between Henry R. Luce and the far-reaching influence of the Council on Foreign Relations including AP, UPI, the New York Times, Time, Life, Newsweek, Sports Illustrated, ABC, CBS, and NBC, the cover-up of JFK’s assassination would be fairly easy. The press, which every American considered to be “the gospel,” was controlled by the power of this one man in conjunction with the Council on Foreign Relations — subject to Cardinal Spellman. For Luce was a Knight of Malta; an apostate Presbyterian and spokesman for the Jesuits’ evil World Council of Churches; the betrayer of the Chinese people into the hands of Rome’s Inquisitor, Mao Tse-tung; a “jet setter” and member of Yale’s “Skull & Bones” fraternity; a proponent of fascism (the Order’s favorite form of absolute government); a “Cold Warrior” having coined the phrase, “The American Century;” and a close friend of the Jesuit John Courtney Murray, who resided at Woodstock College the Jesuit Theological Seminary in Woodstock, Maryland.
“A concept . . . Luce . . . often discussed with . . . Father Murray was the American national purpose [restoring the Pope’s Temporal Power].” {8}
With all these influences Luce ran his office from New York’s Rockefeller Center, the headquarters of Time/Life. Luce made it clear in a memo to his staff:
“The chief editorial policy maker for Time Inc. is Henry R. Luce . . . ” {9}
The Jesuits – 1964 - 2000



624 Vatican Assassins
Dear truth-seeker, it was Henry R. Luce of Time/Life who, two days after the assassination, bought the famous Zapruder Film and then tampered with specific frames. Robert Groden, the author of High Treason, tells us:
“The original film was bought by Time Inc. It was the single most important piece of evidence in the case and they put a junior employee to work on it, who, while enlarging the movie is said to have damaged all those frames. Is it credible that after paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for the film, they would have treated it this way? William Bader of the Senate Intelligence Committee said, ‘You don’t have to manipulate Time Magazine, because there are Agency (CIA) people at the management level.’ ” {10}
The American people never saw this film until subpoenaed by Jim Garrison for the trial of CIA agent Clay L. Shaw in 1969. We now know why!
Luce was also responsible for putting the famous picture of Oswald holding a rifle on the cover of his Life Magazine. That photo, like the Ashbourne Portrait of Shakespeare, later proved to be a forgery. Henry R. Luce, the Knight of Malta, CFR member and CIA operative did all he could to cover-up the true details of the assassination — to the satisfaction of Cardinal Spellman.
Spellman’s Freemason, Allen Dulles – whose nephew, Avery Dulles, at the time was a powerful Jesuit and is now a Cardinal, having been appointed by Pope John Paul II – was appointed to the Warren Commission by Spellman’s Freemason, President Johnson. Dulles was the major connection between the Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Central Intelligence Agency and its “Vatican Desk” through James Jesus Angleton who in turn had secretly monitored the movements of CIA agent Lee Oswald through one of his CIA assets, Jane Roman, two months prior to the Kennedy Assassination. This arch-demon, who disgraced his Protestant Presbyterian Church and betrayed his countrymen, was one of the major players linking the Vatican’s intelligence communities together. He had worked with Cardinal Montini evacuating Nazis through the Ratlines, and now on the Warren Commission, protected the interests of his old friend who was now Pope Paul VI.
Additionally, future President Gerald Ford, the Shriner Freemason, and Cardinal Spellman’s Knight of Malta, Cartha D. DeLoach, worked together to subvert the Warren Commission. Mark Lane in his Plausible Denial tells us:
“An internal FBI memo dated December 17, 1963, details the items Ford passed to Cartha D. DeLoach, then the assistant to the FBI director. Ford did not disclose to the other six members of the Warren Commission his course of improper and illegal conduct.
The Jesuits – 1964 - 2000



Chapter 46
DeLoach reported that Ford agreed to continue to betray his colleagues on the Commission. Ford said, DeLoach reported, “I should call him any time his assistance was needed.” [Recently, Gerald Ford has admitted to his misconduct while on the Warren Commission.] {11}
In 1968 when Jim Garrison sought to question Allen Dulles concerning Knight of Malta and kingpin of Permindex (Permanent Industrial Expositions), Clay L. Shaw, the Justice Department refused to serve the subpoena. The Empire’s Holy Office of the Inquisition was simply being loyal to the Pope’s Papal Knights, who are always above the law.
The “reigning King of the American Empire,” then Archbishop Cooke, was continuing the cover-up by stifling the investigation in fulfilling his Oath as a Cardinal, whose first loyalty was to the “infallible” Pope of Rome. A portion of that oath reads:
“I, Terence Cooke, of the Holy Roman Church, Cardinal of New York, promise and swear . . . to be faithful and obedient to . . .our Most Holy Lord Paul VI, and his canonically elected successor . . .
To try in every way to assert, uphold, preserve, increase and promote the rights, even temporal, especially those of the civil principality, the liberty, the honor, the privileges and authority of the Holy Roman Church of our lord the Pope, and the aforesaid successors;
When it shall come to my knowledge that some machination, prejudicial to those rights, which I can not prevent, is taking place, immediately to make it known to the Pope . . .
To combat with every effort heretics, schismatics, and those rebelling against our lord the Pope and his successors . . .
So help me God and these holy gospels.” {12} [Emphasis added]
William F. Buckley, Jr., another Knight of Malta, CFR member and CIA operative along with his brother James Buckley, continually maintained in his periodical, National Review, that Oswald was a lone assassin. He too, as the faithful servant of Cardinal Spellman, promoted the Great Jesuit Cover-up.
Shriner Freemason J. Edgar Hoover, with his FBI, also suppressed evidence misleading the Warren Commission chaired by another Shriner Freemason, Chief Justice Earl Warren. Of his general power and role in the assassination we read:
The Jesuits – 1964 - 2000



Vatican Assassins
“In 30 years on the job, J. Edgar Hoover has developed an intelligence system which nothing – no racket and certainly no conspiracy – can escape. Through its extensive network of informers, the FBI knows everything worth knowing that goes on in the United States even in areas that lie outside its legal jurisdiction. The Dallas conspiracy was born and took root in places where the FBI was well represented . . . By mid-October, Hoover had been informed of the existence of a plot and was familiar with many of the details . . . The week before the President’s departure for Texas, Hoover knew exactly what was going to happen. Why did the FBI fail to intervene? ” {13} [Emphasis added]
Why? Because Hoover was working for his master and brother Cold Warrior, Cardinal Spellman, just like Earl Warren who later “investigated” the murder.
In 1976 the House Select Committee on Assassinations was convened. Again, it was filled with fighting from within and resistance from without. The Irish Catholic Papal Knight, Thomas “Tip” O’Neill, strongly resisted its proceedings pursuant to the wishes of his master in St. Patrick’s Cathedral. We read:
“ ‘The Committee was programmed to self-destruct,’ claimed Gonzalez. He saw his unsuccessful entreaties to Tip O’Neill to help fire Sprague as a sign that O’Neill, who was very close to the Kennedy family . . . never really wanted an investigation.” {14} [Emphasis added]
Further,
“Both the Chairman of the Committee, Thomas Downing, and the Speaker of the House retired, and Henry Gonzalez took over as Chairman of the Assassinations Committee, with Tip O’Neill as Speaker. O’Neill [a trustee of the Order’s Boston College] was hostile to the Committee and the investigation.” {15} [Emphasis added]
Tip O’Neill, another trustee at the Jesuits’ Boston College, was just another American traitor loyal to a foreign prince and sovereign — the Pope of Rome.
Another key-player who resisted the Assassinations Committee was the wife of the late Henry R. Luce, the apostate Baptist having been converted to Catholicism by Bishop Fulton J. Sheen. We read of the Dame of Malta, Clare Boothe Luce:
“One of the wealthiest women in the world, widow of the founder of the Time, Inc. publishing empire, former member to the U. S. House of Representatives, former Ambassador to Italy, successful Broadway

playwright, international socialite, and longtime civic activist, Clare Boothe Luce was the last person in the world Schweiker would have suspected of leading him on a wild goose chase. . . .Her impression, Luce told Schweiker . . .was that Oswald was hired by Castro to assassinate Kennedy in retaliation for the assassination attempts against him . . . An awful lot of time had been spent checking out Luce’s story and, in the end, it led nowhere at all.” {16} [Emphasis added]
Luce, like James Angleton, blamed Jesuit Fidel Castro for the assassination. She, with O’Neill, helped to successfully defeat the Assassinations Committee in obedience to her master in New York, Cardinal Cooke.
The murder of over one hundred witnesses to the Kennedy Assassination makes it clear that Fourteenth Amendment America is under a Jesuit-controlled, fascist military dictatorship — the favorite government of Rome! The Vatican’s International Intelligence Community has committed these murders using their tools most fitting for the job. Their agents could be NSA, CIA, FBI, MID, ONI, KGB, GRU, British SIS, Mossad or Mafia. The Jesuits have many sources through which they fulfill their bloody Jesuit Oath on a regular basis. Of the general murder of witnesses we read:
“Jim Marrs, author of Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy, wrote: ‘In the three-year period which followed the murder of President Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald, 18 material witnesses died — six by gunfire, three in motor accidents, two by suicide, one from a cut throat, one from a karate chop to the neck, five from natural causes.’ . . . A mathematician hired by the London Sunday Times in February of 1967 concluded that the odds of the number of witnesses involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy dying between November 22, 1963 and that date, (18 in number) were one hundred thousand trillion to one. . . . In the time period ranging from November 22, 1963 to August, 1993, over 115 ‘witnesses’ have died or fallen victim to death by strange circumstances, suicides or murder [including Chicago Mob Boss Sam Giancana (1975) with his underlings Johnny Roselli (1976) and Charles Nicoletti (1977), the boss of Grassy Knoll shooter, the imprisoned James E. Files].” {17}
One of the more recent CIA actions was the murder of Bud Fensterwald in 1991. We read:
“Gus Russo felt the man [a former Air Force Colonel] was ready to talk about the assassination and, based on this assessment, the head of the JFK Assassination Archives in Washington, D.C., attorney Bud Fensterwald,

was ready to head to Florida and interview him. When I heard of Bud’s intention, I told Russo in no uncertain terms that Bud would never be allowed to approach the man and, if Bud attempted to go through with the interview, he would be killed . . . Just days before I was to meet Bud, I received a call from Bud’s secretary that he had died the previous night. Before I could do anything, Bud’s body was cremated and no autopsy was performed.” {18}
The Intelligence Agencies, controlled by the “Knights” of Rome, continue to murder any honest man who would dare to tell the truth about Kennedy’s assassins. And who is the present Roman Senator, “ A Prince of the Church,” and the “Military Vicar” of these Knights, whose loyalty would go to the extreme of committing high treason against American national sovereignty in obedience to the Jesuits’ “infallible” Papal Caesar? It is none other than Edward Cardinal Egan, the Archbishop of New York and one of the most ardent defenders and promoters of the Temporal Power of the Papal Priest-King in Rome. For it is this Cardinal Egan, along with his Knights of Malta, Knights of Columbus and Shriner Freemasons in control of the American Intelligence Community, that is responsible for the attack and demolition of the World Trade Center and partial destruction of the Pentagon which has resulted in the present Papal Caesar’s Crusade against the Islamic peoples of the mid East.
Finally the Jesuits, in control of Time-Warner (as well as Paramount Pictures having employed Knight of Malta Joe Kennedy), produced Jesuit Oliver Stone’s masterpiece movie, JFK, Director’s Cut. One of the key moments of the movie takes place in New Orleans when Garrison is meeting with his staff in a restaurant. After reviewing the evidence he concludes the meeting by rebuking his aides saying:
“You all got to start thinking on a different level like the CIA does. We’re looking through the looking glass here people. White is black and black is
white.” {19} [Emphasis added]
His last line is a Jesuit maxim laid down by the Order’s founder, Ignatius Loyola, in his Spiritual Exercises. The Jesuit, as well as every Jesuitized “good Catholic,” has no mind of his own. At the word of his superior the truth is a lie and a lie is the truth. In the words of Loyola,
“Putting aside all private judgment [!!!] we should always be ready to
accept this principle: I will believe that the white I see is black, if the
hierarchical Church [Pope, Cardinals, Archbishops and Bishops
controlled by the Jesuit General] so defines it.” {20}

His contacts with the Jesuits of Fordham University enhanced his familiarity with Jesuit-trained Francis Cardinal Spellman and New York’s Council on Foreign Relations. As a result of the Vietnam War his Order would make billions through its Federal Reserve Bank, its Military Industrial Complex, and its International Drug Trade, actively thriving since the Sixteenth Century. The Company’s International Intelligence Community, aided by the bogus “Cold War” and “Space Race,” would justify the completion of its worldwide system of spying. The Order’s International Banks would launder its massive profits of the Drug Trade further building the Black Pope’s International Terrorist Network overseen by the CIA. These were a few of the calculated benefits of the Kennedy Assassination in finally destroying the Lord’s Protestant Reformation; and to that wicked end Jesuit Edward Bunn remained true.

Indeed, a picture is worth a thousand words!

Both of these wealthy “lay brothers” have known each other since 1987 and evidence faithful service to the Black Pope. Stone, in his theatrical masterpiece, JFK, Director’s Cut, quotes an excerpt from Ignatius Loyola’s Spiritual Exercises, cuts out the driver as he shoots President Kennedy in the Zapruder Film, and utilizes the music of a most favorite Masonic composer of the Order, Wolfgang A. Mozart. Castro, having been educated by the Jesuits for seven years, was advised during the revolution by a Jesuit priest, Armando Llorente. Further, one of Castro’s economic advisors who sat on the board of Havana’s Banco Nacional de Cuba was the brother-in-law of Knight of Malta Oswaldo Cisneros. Presently, Jesuits Stone and Castro are working with the Jesuit General’s Tridentine (pro-Council of Trent) Central Intelligence Agency as it plans for the Sino-Soviet invasion of the “heretic and liberal” United States, to be escorted by Bin Laden’s CIA-financed, CIA-trained (via “Operation Cyclone”) and CIA-controlled Islamic/Masonic al Qaeda Terrorist Network, after the destruction of Jerusalem’s mosques is blamed on the American military. Stone and Castro serve the same master, Jesuit General Peter-Hans Kolvenbach.

tyranny and personal hypocrisy. Lee Iacocca, of Italian descent, is what many American men would love to be and rightly so.
It is for these reasons the author proceeds with a great sorrow of heart in exposing the terrible deed of Lee Iacocca, as he participated in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Hopefully this chapter will serve as corrective surgery rather than a dagger to the heart. Since Mr. Iacocca still lives the writer has prayed that he would repent and confess his sin to the Lord knowing that,
“He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.”
– Proverbs 28:13
Since a great host of us Americans are murderers, having polluted our land with the blood of aborted millions, we are no better than Mr. Iacocca. May we confess and find forgiveness and mercy, even as our friend may.
Knowing the Black Pope’s POWER that would rage against Lee Iacocca if he would dare to tell all, the hundreds of assassins that would appear to expedite his demise via “the poison cup, the strangulation cord, the steel of the poniard (the blade of the knife) or the leaden bullet,” we realize the request to confess to the nation is great. But we are convinced his personal greatness is equal to the task. And there are many of us fundamental, Bible-believing Baptists and Protestants who would gladly hazard our lives to protect him from every Jesuit assassin, be he Mafia, CIA or Mossad. For we are Calvinist warriors wielding both the Sword of the Spirit and the Sword of Just Defense, believing that to fight and die in defense of a righteous man for a righteous cause is to die well, that we “might obtain a better resurrection” (Hebrews 11:35) at the Judgment Seat of Christ (II Corinthians 5:10).
On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. The evidence inside the limousine proved there was more than one shooter as there were several primary strikes. The Secret Service took great pains in destroying this evidence. We read:
“Three days after the assassination, Carl Renas, head of security for the Dearborn Division of the Ford Motor Company, drives the limousine, helicopters hovering overhead, from Washington to Cincinnati. In doing so, he noted several bullet holes, the most notable being the one in the windshield’s chrome molding strip, which he said was clearly ‘a primary strike’ and ‘not a fragment.’
The Jesuits – 1979



636 Vatican Assassins
The Limousine was taken by Renas to Hess and Eisenhart of Cincinnati, where the chrome molding was replaced. The Secret Service told Renas to ‘Keep your mouth shut.’ ” {3} [Emphasis added]
As we saw, the man who drove the limousine to Cincinnati was the head of security for the Dearborn Division of Ford Motor Company. And who was the head of the Dearborn Division in 1963 that dispatched Renas for the task of his life? According to Robert Lacy it was Lee Iacocca. We read:
“Henry Ford II says today that the first time he can remember meeting Lee Iacocca was in November 1960, when he summoned the young salesman to his office to tell him he was giving him command of the Ford Division [at Dearborn].” {4}
Lee Iacocca remained the head of the Dearborn Division until he became President of Ford Motor Company in 1970. Therefore as the General Manager of the Dearborn Division in 1963, Iacocca participated in the suppression of evidence in dispatching his security chief to drive the limousine from Washington to Cincinnati.
As a prominent Roman Catholic, Lee Iacocca was well acquainted with the Jesuit Order and Ignatius Loyola’s Spiritual Exercises. He writes of his life during the Depression:
“It took me a number of years to fully understand why I had to make a good confession to a priest before I went to Holy Communion, but in my teens I began to appreciate the importance of this most misunderstood rite of the Catholic Church. I not only had to think out my transgressions against my friends; I had to speak them aloud. In later years, I found myself completely refreshed after confession. I even began to attend weekend retreats, where the Jesuits, in face-to-face examinations of conscience, made me come to grips with how I was conducting my life.” {5} [Emphasis added]
The most important tie to the conspiracy in assassinating Kennedy was Iacocca’s subordination to Cardinal Spellman and the Knights of Malta. According to his autobiography he had eaten supper with Cardinal Spellman (p. 116) and shortly after the assassination, Knight of Malta Henry R. Luce, who bought and suppressed the Zapruder Film, gave Iacocca a great write-up in his periodicals.
“Unveiled at the New York World’s Fair in the spring of 1964, the Mustang proved a sensation . . . Lee Iacocca well deserved the rare accolade of simultaneous cover stories in both Time and Newsweek.” {6}
The Jesuits – 1979



Chapter 47
Could this have been the beginning of the rise of the Lee Iacocca’s star, leading to his appointment in 1970 as President of Ford Motor Company [founded by Freemason Henry Ford], then to his appointment in 1975 as the President of Chrysler [founded by Freemason Walter P. Chrysler], and finally the U.S. Government loan to Chrysler in 1979 resulting in the making of an American hero?
And who was the force in Congress that was ultimately responsible for the passing of the Act creating the Loan Guarantee Board that extended the loan to Chrysler? Iacocca declares that it was House Speaker, Thomas “Tip” O’Neill.
“Tip O’Neill was our real point man in Congress. . . . As soon as he turned on his lights to help us, the tide started to turn. . . . By the time the vote came, we had a lot of backers in Congress. Still, Tip O’Neill’s support was crucial. Just before the vote, he stepped down as Speaker and spoke as the representative from Massachusetts. In an impassioned plea for the loan guarantees . . . Tip used raw emotion to sell his guys in the House. He was one of our leaders in this whole episode. . . . When the vote came in, the House had agreed by a two-to-one margin (271-136) to help Chrysler get back on its feet.” {7} [Emphasis added]
What is the significance of Tip O’Neill helping Lee Iacocca in securing the loan? Tip O’Neill strongly resisted the proceedings of the House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1976 as covered in our previous chapter.
Here we have two Papal Knights, Iacocca and O’Neill, involved in the assassination of President Kennedy through willful acts of suppressing evidence. The first Knight was Lee Iacocca, a highly placed official in one of Rome’s corporate giants, it composing a part of the Jesuits’ Military Industrial Complex. (Remember Nicholas Brady, the multimillionaire, Papal Knight of Malta and personal friend of the Jesuit General’s Francis Spellman, was one of the original owners of Chrysler.) Ford Motor Company had helped to build Hitler’s and Stalin’s War Machines during the Second Thirty Years’ War and therefore had a financial interest in continuing the war in Vietnam. (The guidance unit of the air-to-air missile known as “the Sidewinder or AIM - 9” was built by Philco-Ford.)
The second Knight was Tip O’Neill. Being the Speaker, he was the most powerful man in the House of Representatives for ten years. Handling the nation’s business, it was the House that had been responsible for borrowing 220 billion dollars in credit from the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank (managed by the Council on Foreign Relations) to finance the Vietnam War. The returns for this “investment” would be the fantastic profits generated from the International Drug Trade, while further destroying the Fourteenth Amendment American Empire’s “heretic” and “liberal” population with debt, drugs, disease, and demoralization.
The Jesuits – 1979



638 Vatican Assassins
Thus, Iacocca and O’Neill, two kingpins in the Kennedy assassination and cover-up, worked together in obtaining the loan for Chrysler. That loan was credit extended to the American Congress, created out of nothing, by the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Bank. The result was the rebuilding of the automaker’s entire manufacturing base, exalting Chrysler to one of the Empire’s most advanced corporate giants within the Jesuits’ Military Industrial Complex. (The author wonders if Chrysler will provide hardware and technology to the army of our coming invaders, the Red Chinese and “the former” Soviet Union?) The victory of Chrysler’s recovery was credited to Lee Iacocca. But he would never have succeeded had it not been for Tip O’Neill. Therefore, what or who could have united these men to accomplish such a feat? Both were devoted Roman Catholics; but, more importantly, they were “Roman Knights” loyal to the Pope’s American Military Vicar, the Cardinal of St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York. Of Lee Iacocca’s membership in the Knights of Malta, again we read from the article entitled “Who are the Knights of Malta?” written in 1983:
“The SMOM’s [Sovereign Military Order of Malta] U.S. section has approximately 1,000 members — including 300 “dames” who hail from society’s upper crust. Divided into three associations (eastern, southern and western) its roster includes many of the corporate establishment’s movers and shakers: Lee Iacocca of Chrysler – [W.] Barron Hilton of the hotel chain [who allowed the bastard son of a Nazi, Fidel Castro, to use his Hilton Hotel in Havana for the Jesuit-trained dictator’s headquarters and who was a personal friend of SMOM and Mafioso, Frank Sinatra. Hilton’s friend, Sinatra, was in turn a bosom friend of Chicago and New York Mafia Dons, Sam Giancana and Carlo Gambino (they being two of Cardinal Spellman’s Mafia Commission members), according to Kitty Kelley’s His Way: The Unauthorized Autobiography of Frank Sinatra. Nearly twenty years later in 1980, Sinatra performed at Shriner Freemason and U.S. President Ronald Reagan’s inaugural ball, as they were both actors in Hollywood – the Jesuit Theater – having been openly founded by the Order’s Masonic Jewish Zionists such as Louis B. Mayer (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer), Jack Warner (Warner Brothers) and Darryl F. Zanuck (Twentieth Century Fox). Reagan, after recovering from his attempted assassination, shot inside the presidential limousine by a Secret Service agent according to Colonel James “Bo” Gritz in his Called To Serve, went on to be the a faithful servant of Knight of Malta John Cardinal O’Connor and his New York based SMOM by committing high treason against the American people in formally recognizing the Papal Caesar’s nation-state – The Sovereign State of Vatican City – preparing the American Empire for its Concordat with the Pope of Rome] . . .

Dear truth-seeker, Lee Iacocca, the Knight of Malta, familiar with the Jesuit Order and a personal friend of Cardinal Spellman, participated in the Kennedy Assassination. His payback was the Congress granting a 1.2 billion dollar loan with the help of Knight of Columbus Tip O’Neill, Speaker of the House, and Knight of Malta, William E. Simon, Secretary of the Treasury. For this he will ever be known as the savior of Chrysler Corporation.
May God the Holy Spirit help him to repent and seek the Lord Jesus Christ while He may be found. Then may he, as our example, tell the nation that we all may repent of our personal and national sins, while seeking the forgiveness of God the Father whose beloved Son we have provoked, and the forgiveness of the nations that we have attacked and destroyed. For in our blind patriotism and ignorance, we Americans, garrisoned in over eighty countries around the world like the Roman Legions of old, have been used to restore and maintain the Temporal Power of the Jesuits’ “infallible” Pope worldwide, while Washington has been under the spell of Jesuit control for the last one hundred years. That spell included the assassination of President Kennedy.
Lee Iacocca, in the words of “Rebecca the Jewess” {9}, we beg of you,
“Speak...if thou art a man; if thou art a Christian, speak! I conjure thee, by the habit which thou dost wear – by the name thou dost inherit
– by the knighthood thou dost vaunt – by the honour of thy mother – by the tomb and the bones of thy father I conjure thee to say,
are these things true?”

“Are these things true?”

Iacocca, 1924 – Present #184 General Manager, Dearborn Division, Ford Motor Company, 1960 -1970 After the assassination, President Lyndon Johnson the Freemason arranged for all the evidence of multiple gunshots to be removed from Kennedy’s limousine. LBJ’s old friend, Henry Ford II, made the secret arrangements with a former employee, then Secretary of Defense and CFR member, Robert Strange McNamara, who in turn contacted his former employee, Lee Iacocca, then General Manager of Ford’s Dearborn Division. Iacocca dispatched his head of security, Carl Renas, to drive the bullet-ridden limo to a dealership in Cincinnati that removed the evidence of more than one assassin insuring the success of Cardinal Spellman’s Warren Commission, Shriner Arlen Specter’s “magic single bullet theory” being its foundation. Lee Iacocca’s reward for his obedience in the Kennedy assassination was the success of his Mustang (made possible by Knight of Malta Henry R. Luce’s good press), Pope Paul VI touring New York in a Lincoln (Ford) rather than in a Cadillac (GM), the Presidency of Ford Motor Company in 1970, the Presidency of Chrysler in 1979, and a 1.2 billion dollar loan saving the late Knight of Malta Nicholas Brady’s Chrysler Corporation. Iacocca then converted Chrysler into a major component of the Black Pope’s American Military Industrial Complex, further equipping the Empire to fight future Papal Crusades against Islam.

For a job well done, he was made Speaker of the House in 1977 and from there controlled the nation’s legislation for ten years during which time he aided his fellow conspirator, Lee Iacocca, in obtaining a Congressional loan to save the Order’s Chrysler Corporation. It is most interesting to note that in his autobiography, he mentions that presidential aides Kenny O’Donnell and Dave Powers heard two shots from the picket fence on the grassy knoll, but never once speaks of the House Assassinations Committee or his involvement with Robert Blakey who killed the investigation and went on to be employed by Theodore Hesburgh’s Notre Dame University.

Romanism: A Menace to the Nation
“The power of the Society of Jesus in the Catholic Church is beyond doubt enormous. It is said, apparently with truth, that the Jesuit General, the “Black Pope” as he is called, can make and unmake bishops and even cardinals. He has various agents and representatives within the walls of the Vatican, and he can gain the ear of the Pope whenever he wishes. . . . Again and again the Society has been able to oppose successfully the plans and wishes of Popes. . . . the Society which is perennial at Rome is able to block the efforts of passing Popes [like Pope John Paul I who sought to prematurely establish diplomatic relations with Israel prior to the end of the Company’s Cold War]. . . . The Order is to the Church what the Church is to the world. The Order is a kind of parasite sucking the vital power of the Church. . . . It holds the confidence and consciences of so many bishops, cardinals, and prelates; . . . in fine, [it] works in so many ways on the functionaries of the Church, that it has become as it were an inner circle in the Church. It has made the Pope more and more like its own autocratic General; and has reduced the bishops more and more to the status of Provincials in the Society who are officials nominated by and controlled by the General, without any inherent authority. An interesting proof of Jesuit prestige and power in this country is the existence, in the shadow of the Capitol, at Washington, of the Jesuit School for Foreign Service [which

trained the present CFR/CIA Director, Knight of Malta George J. Tenet having overseen the implosion of the World Trade Center in obedience to his master, Edward Cardinal Egan], opened a few years ago through the instrumentality of an Irish-American, Fr.

At this school of diplomatic service, said to be the largest of its kind in America, young Americans [to be later recruited into the Order’s CFR] are trained to guide the future fortunes of the Republic. . . .

It is quite within the power of the General to dictate the principles and theories to be taught by the Jesuits at Washington . . . one cannot forget the words of the Pope, Clement XIV, who accused them of ‘rising up against the very kings who admitted them into their countries.’ ” {4} [Emphasis added]

“They are a public plague, and the plague of the world . . . From the Jesuit colleges there never is sent a pupil obedient to his father, devoted to his country, loyal to his prince.” {5} “Every species of vice finds its patronage in them. There is no perjury, nor sacrilege, nor parricide, nor incest, nor rapine, nor fraud, nor treason which cannot be masked as meritorious beneath the mantle of their dispensation.” {6} [Emphasis added]
Paolo Sarpi, 1620 Italian Roman Catholic Historian of the Jesuits’ Council of Trent
“WASHINGTON — Glass cases along a wall on the top floor of [Jesuit] Georgetown University’s Lauinger Library contain a surprisingly timely and provocative exhibit: ‘Georgetown in the Sixties: from Pat Buchanan to the SDS [Students for a Democratic Society].’ . . . Photos and clips show presidents Lyndon Baines Johnson, Bill Clinton [and] a two-time presidential candidate [an Irish Roman Catholic, Jesuit-trained Knight of Malta, noted author of Right From the Beginning, A Republic, Not an Empire and The Death of the West; also a founding member of NBC’s Jesuit-controlled “The McLaughlin Group” and CNN’s “The Capital Gang” and “Crossfire”] Pat Buchanan . . .

president of that period, the late Jesuit Fr. Edward Bunn, only one priest is mentioned twice in the exhibit, Jesuit Fr. Richard McSorley [accomplice in the Order’s JFK assassination and confessor of Jackie Kennedy], now 80 and head of the one-man Center for Peace Studies at Georgetown . . . [Shriner Freemason and CFR member] Johnson is mentioned for saying the only reason he left Georgetown Law School was because Lady Bird was in Texas . . .
[Shriner Freemason and CFR member] Bill Clinton [one of his Georgetown classmates later becoming the world famous Roman Catholic actor and activist Tommy Lee Jones who played Clay L. Shaw in Oliver Stone’s JFK, Director’s Cut and played the part of a top secret intelligence officer – a modern super secret Jesuit above the law – using high-tech weapons against “aliens” (whose existence is notoriously espoused by Jesuits of the Vatican Observatory) in Men In Black] was one of the students who helped clean up after the Washington [Civil Rights] riots [of 1968] — but the exhibit deals more with his class presidencies . . . In 1969, McSorley took a sabbatical to visit peace groups throughout the world. His first stop was England. Fellowship of Reconciliation members and Quakers directed him to a big antiwar demonstration at the U.S. Embassy. Bill Clinton was there and recognized McSorley . . .
After the demonstration, Clinton asked the Jesuit whether he would lead the Catholic prayers the next day at an interfaith prayer meeting he’d helped organize in a nearby Anglican church. McSorley offered the prayer of St. Francis; Clinton joined in and they marched back to the embassy and left white crosses to symbolize the deaths of Americans. McSorley then went to France and Scandinavia to meet peace people. Stepping off the train right behind him in Oslo, Norway, was Bill Clinton . . . That evening, before McSorley boarded his train for an overnight trip south, he and Clinton dined together. ‘He was just like most of the students,’ said McSorley. . . .
On July 6, [1995] Clinton was back at Georgetown. In a lengthy talk, he laid out his stance as a candidate for reelection and reaffirmed the values of activism in the ’60s and ’70s.” {7} [Emphasis added]

who were actively laying the groundwork for implementing the New World Order through mind conditioning of the masses made no distinction between the Democratic and Republican Parties. Their aspirations were international in proportion, not American. Members were often drawn from, among other elitist groups, the Council on Foreign Relations. Like George [H. W.] Bush, Bill Clinton was an active member of the CFR, Bilderbergers [founded in 1954 by a former Nazi SS officer and Knight of Malta, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands], and Tri-Lateral Commission.

“We see Rome’s satanic, Nazi Fourth Reich using United States troops to murder the leaders and peoples of nations so that the Roman Antichrist can place his own like-minded leaders in the place of those he ordered to be assassinated or murdered [as in the assassination of Knight of Columbus John F. Kennedy and thus replacing him with Shriner Freemason Lyndon B. Johnson]. These actions are causing all the nations of the world to hate the people of the United States of America. We who were once the most loved nation are now the most hated. The Antichrist in Rome doesn’t allow his world-controlled media to fully tell the truth about what the people of other nations think about us or why they think this way. They hate us because of what the Antichrist, through the high-ranking Roman Nazi agents, which have infiltrated our government, is doing to them [Serbians, Moslems, etc.]. When these nations respond to the Roman Nazi agents’ unholy aggression which is coming from the U.S. through the orders of the Antichrist in Rome, the Pope’s [CFR-controlled] media and his puppets lead us to believe we should go to war against them. Would you not hate someone who’s bombing you, your family and your friends for no apparent reason? . . . The BATF, FBI, DEA, the Federal Bureau Task Force, CIA, CFR, Knights of Malta, all these are branches of the Vatican. The Vatican doesn’t care at all if you come against a president, a king, a queen, or one of these branches, because they’re nothing but smokescreens for the Pope. . . .
President [George W.] Bush is the most Catholic president we’ve ever had. He is surrounded with cardinals. From the beginning of his presidency, George [W.] Bush has been promoting the Vatican-Nazi Jesuit agenda. Two months into his presidency, surrounded by cardinals of Rome, the President dedicated a cultural center in Washington, D.C., to the greatest enemy this Republic has ever had, the Pope of Rome. Bush declared that he is going to enforce the words and teachings of the Pope here in America. [According to Patricia Zapoa of the Catholic News Service, March 24, 2001] President Bush said,
“The best way to honor Pope John Paul II, truly one of the greatest men, is to take his teachings seriously, to listen to his words and put his words and his teachings into action here in
America.” {11} [Emphasis added]

Every President from Johnson to Clinton, and now Bush, has been the abject tool of the Order fulfilling “Jesuitical Politics” — treasonous, internationalist and plotting to make its “infallible” Pope, ruling Satan’s Theocratic Kingdom offered to the Lord Jesus Christ, “the Universal Monarch of the World.” This political control was clearly described in 1933 by Lady Queenborough who wrote:
“The game of politics is the pursuit of power. In all democracies, there are two separate organizations playing the political game. The open and visible one, the members of which hold office as members of a government, and the invisible one composed of individuals who control this visible organization and in whom is vested the real power, the essence of which is finance, controlling the publicity which makes or unmakes its tools. This financial power may be used to promote truth or fallacies, good or evil, national prosperity or national ruin . . . the strength of a democracy thus lies at the mercy of invisible leaders who, being nationally irresponsible, cannot be called to account for the consequences of the acts of the governments they control.
This at the same time constitutes the inherent weakness of any form of government, the apotheosis of which is the control of both parties in the state, right and left, radical and conservative, by the same forces. Then, only the puppets change while the rule of the individuals controlling the machine continues unhindered. Voters who wonder why their efforts have failed, wonder in vain. As the dupes of a controlled publicity their privilege of the vote is a farce [see Votescam written in 1992 by Collier and Collier].
If all factions in a state can be controlled from one source [the CFR], why should International Control [from Rome] be impracticable?” {12}
From the reversal of President Kennedy’s policy to end the Vietnam War (1963), to the war in Yugoslavia (1998), and now the Crusade in Central Asia against Islam (2004), the Jesuits have maintained control over the Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches of the Empire’s government. The murder of “heretics” continues abroad, from the “heretic” Buddhists in the Far East to the “heretic” Orthodox Serbians in the Balkans. The Jesuits, in control of both George H. W. Bush (along with the American military) and Saddam Hussein, through Shriner Freemasonry, “extirpated” the “heretic” Moslems of Iraq while initiating the unification of Europe’s military, largely Roman Catholic, during Operation Desert Storm. A former Jesuit and personal friend suggests why the Islamic people of Iraq have been mass murdered by the Military Industrial Complex of the Order’s “Holy Roman” Fourteenth Amendment American Empire for the last twenty years:
The Jesuits – 1964 - 2000



Chapter 48 649
“At the request of Pope Pius XI in 1931, and as directed by Jesuit General Ledochowski, the Jesuits of the New England Province, headquartered in Boston, opened a new high school in 1932 by the name of Baghdad College, located in Baghdad, Iraq, and staffed by the Jesuit Fathers, Scholastics, and Brothers from four US Provinces. Over the years Baghdad College flourished on what became a beautiful date-palm-covered property, was attended by both Catholic and Islamic students, and developed a reputation as one of the finest schools in Iraq. The Jesuits in Iraq operated under a government restriction that they engage in no proselytizing of their Islamic students, although they were free to service Catholic communities in the country. Some years later, in 1956, the Jesuits opened Al-Hikma University, with curricula in business and engineering. Al-Hikma was also located in the Baghdad area, several miles from Baghdad College.
[Remembering that the Universities of the Military Company of the Society of Jesus are in fact military fortresses through which the Jesuits carry out their military quest in subordinating all nations to the absolute Temporal Power of the Papal Caesar in Rome, we read further that:]
The political events in Iraq from 1932 to 1979 included: 1932 – Independence, League of Nations Mandate. Faisal I becomes King of independent Iraq. Jesuits open Baghdad College (high school) in Iraq. 1933 – King Faisal I dies. Faisal II becomes King of Iraq. 1956 – Jesuits open Al-Hikma University in Baghdad. 1958 – Hashemite dynasty overthrown (as had been done by the Order’s Wahhabi al-Saud tribe to the Arabian Hashemite dynasty in 1926), King Faisal II and Prime Minister Nuri Said are killed; Karim Kassem seizes power; Republic proclaimed. 1963 – President Karim Kassem overthrown and killed. 1966 – President Muhammed Aref killed in crash of helicopter. 1968 – November. Al-Hikma Jesuits expelled from Iraq; allowed five days to leave the country. 1969 – All Jesuits expelled from Iraq.
1979 – Saddam Hussein becomes President of Iraq; payback time for the Moslem People of Iraq.
I wonder if the above expulsion of the Jesuits entitled Iraq [ravaged by more than two decades of war, depravation and Jesuit tyranny administered by the Black Pope’s Masonic Hussein Dynasty] to the mass destruction and horrendous massacres connected with the various wars and bombings — the Iran-Iraq War; the Gulf war, etc. [now invaded during the Order’s present Anglo-American ‘War on Islamic Terrorism’].” {13}

Dear truth-seeker, could it be that Saddam Hussein, the resultant Moslem military dictator of Iraq for over twenty years, who used chemical weapons not only on Iran but on his own Iraqi people, was put in power by the Jesuit Order? Is it not extremely telling that Saddam Hussein was never eliminated by an easily ordered “Special Operation” of the Jesuits’ American Military Intelligence during the Gulf War, as he had been a brother Shriner Freemason and business partner with the Order’s CFR member, Mafia associate and former CIA Director, President George H. W. Bush? (See Pete Brewton’s The Mafia, CIA and George Bush, published in 1992.) Clearly, the Black Pope’s wars upon Iraq for the last twenty years have been waged against the Moslem people of Iraq, not the Jesuit-controlled government of Iraq!
Meanwhile, we American people have been brainwashed into thinking of and pursuing games and amusements, while our intelligence communities are pursuing “fun and games” with false enemies, intrigues and assassinations, in restoring and maintaining the Temporal Power of the Pope around the world. The revived Greco-Roman Olympic games fulfill a major goal of the Jesuit Order: the bringing of the world’s people together glorifying the physical abilities of Man. One day it will be an international union around one Satanic Man — the “risen” Papal Caesar!
The American people are not only addicted to the Olympic games but they are consumed with the vanities of professional sports. This is precisely what the Jesuits said they would do in their blueprint for world government, The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion. Protocol number 13 declares:
“In order that the masses themselves may not guess what [our fruitless agitations] are about we further distract them with amusements, games, pastimes, passions, people’s palaces . . . Soon we shall begin through the press to propose competitions in art, in sport of all kinds: these interests will finally distract their minds . . .” {14}
Dear truth-seeker, it is a matter of fact that these games and amusements are not controlled by a Jewish conspiracy, as the authors of The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion would have us believe, but by a Gentile conspiracy. How do we know this? Jesus the Messiah declared to his Hebrew/Jewish disciples:
“And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh . . . And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.”

Since the destruction of Jerusalem along with its Second Temple in 70 A.D. by Titus’ Roman legions, due to Israel’s breaking of the conditional Mosaic Covenant which includes the rejection of “That Prophet” of Deuteronomy 18:18 being King Jesus the Messiah, the Nation of Israel composing the Hebrew/Jewish Race, has been “the tail” of all nations (Deuteronomy 28:13), scattered and persecuted by ruling and rich Gentiles throughout the world, as foretold by Moses the prophet being somberly moved by the Holy Spirit of God in writing:
“The LORD shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies: thou shalt go out one way against them, . . . and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth . . . And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee . . .
The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high; and thou shalt come down very low. He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the head, thou shalt be the tail . . . And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and stone.
And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind: And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life:
In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.

During this time of dispersion Jerusalem has been under Gentile dominion. And even though the Holy City is presently governed by Jewish Masonic Zionists, they willingly rule by permission only from the evil, White Gentiles now governing New York, London and Rome — the Jesuit General with his “infallible” Pope!
Therefore, we are living under the preeminence of a White Gentile Jesuit Conspiracy. It employs notorious Masonic Jews (and Gentiles) as their agents. This furthers the deception of an “International Jewish Conspiracy” oppressing the nations. Using this lie, Satan, with his White Gentile Jesuit General in control of all major secret societies, is creating global, anti-Jewish fury once again. This fury will one day culminate in the last mad attempt of the world’s Gentile Nations to invade Israel, “the holy land” (Zechariah 2:12), and destroy the physical descendants of Jacob, “the holy people” (Daniel 12:7) or “the holy seed” (Isaiah 6:13) — Armageddon.
A few examples of the White Gentile Jesuit Conspiracy will suffice, as the players are always members of the same secret societies. Walt Disney, the founder of “Disneyland” and “Disney World,” was a thirty-third degree Freemason. The Professed Jesuit of the Fourth Vow, Leo J. O’Donovan, president of Georgetown University and a bosom friend of President Clinton, was on the seventeen-member board of directors of the Walt Disney Company from 1996 to 1998. The racial Jew and Roman Catholic Knight of Malta, Bowie Kuhn, was the Commissioner of Baseball. Knight of Malta Frank Capra was Hollywood’s greatest director and censor of World War II, and the land upon which Yankee Stadium sits was, and still is, owned by the Knights of Columbus. Of the Knights of Columbus we read:
“The Knights of Columbus is a fraternal organization of Catholic men with a membership of nearly 1.2 million [over 1 million junior-Jesuit crusading executioners for the Pope!!!] . . . the Knights bought for $6.5 million the land on which Yankee Stadium in New York stands . . . Thus when in October 1965, Pope Paul [Paul VI] went to New York City to visit the United Nations and later at a pontifical mass in Yankee Stadium, His Holiness in effect was on home ground.” {15} [Emphasis added]
After the death of Spellman’s President Johnson, Richard Nixon became Commander-in-Chief. Nixon, the old friend of Spellman and fellow “Cold Warrior,” extended the War in Vietnam to the bombing of Cambodia at the advice of a Jesuit, Dan Lyons, who personally consulted General Abrams, the Commander of U. S. Forces in Vietnam! Nixon continued to promote the Jesuit agenda as outlined in The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, as his speechwriter was a Jesuit!
“One of Nixon’s main speech writers during three whole years was a Jesuit father, the Rev. John McLaughlin, who wrote the Nixon speeches

at a salary of $32,000 a year [and presently heads the publicly aired “The McLaughlin Group” televised by CFR member Ted Turner through his media monopoly, Cable News Network (CNN)].” {16} [Emphasis added]
(Dear truth-seeker, do you see how the Black Pope, in controlling his Fourteenth Amendment American Empire through the Cardinal’s Council on Foreign Relations and implementing The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, fulfills his evil Council of Trent through his Militia, the Company of Jesus?)
The progress of the Great Jesuit Conspiracy in controlling the American Presidents from Johnson to Clinton is clearly described in two great works. The first is Colonel James “Bo” Gritz’s Called to Serve: Profiles in Conspiracy from John F. Kennedy to George Bush, from which we read:
“This is a definite account of a nation betrayed. A spider web of ‘patriots for profit,’ operating from the highest positions of special trust and confidence, have successfully circumvented our constitutional system in pursuit of a New World Order. They have infused America with drugs in order to fund covert operations while sealing the fate of our servicemen left in Communist prisons . . . At the very least this book represents a factual, true-life adventure that will take you on a riveting journey from the White House, down a heroin highway, to Burma’s Golden Triangle where you will meet General Khun Sa — undisputed drug overlord. You will infiltrate the jungles of Communist Asia to rescue U.S. POWs, and in turn be pursued. You’ll be taken behind the veil of U.S. covert operations to view deceit and betrayal. At best, this will produce a crack in the façade of 20th century American government, through which concerned citizens can view the looming peril and act in time to reverse our course while God gives us time.” {17}
(Dear truth-seeker, we must never forget that the Mormon, James “Bo” Gritz, Army Colonel and Commander of the Green Berets – though many believe he is still a CIA operative and thus in the employ of the American Roman Hierarchy – was the most decorated soldier of the Vatican’s War in Vietnam.)
The second is Mark Phillips’ and Cathy O’Brien’s Trance: Formation of America, which declares:
“This book is primarily the autobiography of Cathy O’Brien, who did not volunteer for service to her country, but was used her entire life against her innate, voluntary will for perpetrating criminal activity by many so-called leaders within the U.S. Government . . . Together, Cathy and I have dedicated our lives to the pursuit of justice and rehabilitation for her and

Kelly [Cathy’s repeatedly raped, tortured and abused daughter]. All avenues of justice and rehabilitative relief have been blocked For Reasons of National Security. . . . The question arises, whose security? Cathy O’Brien provides the logical answer.” {18}
(Cathy O’Brien, forced into compulsory prostitution to service American Presidents Ford, Reagan and Bush, has bravely come forth and told her story, for which she should be given the Medal of Honor! Mark Phillips, who rescued her from White slavery and near death, ought to be given the same. For in recalling Jeremiah Crowley’s great work written in the early Twentieth Century, The Pope — Chief of White Slavers, High Priest of Intrigue, our hero proved “the Vicar of Christ” controlled organized prostitution in the American Empire. Today he controls it through his Mafia and CIA, protected by his “Grand Inquisitor,” the Attorney General, in control of the “Department of Injustice” and “the Order of the FBI.”)
These works, including “Jesuit Vatican Tyranny,” a twenty-one page article (found on the web at http://members.foothills.net/ricefile/JesVat.htm) updating the reader on the people presently empowered by the Company to rule over its “Holy Roman” Fourteenth Amendment American Empire, serve as companions to Vatican Assassins: “Wounded In The House Of My Friends”, and are heartily recommended by the author in describing the Jesuit control of Washington through the Council on Foreign Relations for the last forty years. Author Joel Bainerman in his 1992 masterpiece, The Crimes of a President: New Revelations on Conspiracy & Cover-up in the Bush & Reagan Administrations, further sums up the matter:
“[Shriner Freemason] George [H. W.] Bush has corrupted the American system to such an extent that he can get away with any crime [just like his son, President George W. Bush]. . . . George Bush. Skull and Bones. Drug trafficking by the CIA. The assassinations of JFK and RFK. The Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission. There is a global conspiracy founded on the [Jesuit General’s] Freemasonry notion of a New World Order and global domination and President Bush [and now his President son who is a party to the Jesuit-controlled CFR/CIA demolition of the WTC] plays a major part in it.” {19}
Let us read, then pray, and then acquit ourselves as men remembering the Lord’s exhortation at the mouth of Joab:
“Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that which is good in his sight.”

“He who thinks he knows the Jesuits by having read all the books that were written in the past century [the Eighteenth Century] to unmask them, would be grossly deceived. The Jesuitism of that day was an open war against the Gospel and society; the Jesuitism of the present is a slow but contagious and deadly disease, which secretly insinuates itself; it is a poison taken under the name of medicine.” {2} [Emphasis added]

No better description of the Company has ever been so simply put than that of Mr. Luigi Desanctis, who later became a Reformed pastor. When his description is applied to the American Medical Association (AMA), the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) we can easily see these three agencies as arms of the Great Jesuit Conspiracy, described by Abate Leone in his The Jesuit Conspiracy: The Secret Plan of the Order printed in 1848. The purpose of the AMA, ADA and FDA is to destroy the American people in the name of helping them. By making the people chronically ill these agencies break any will to resist an American fascist tyranny (possibly to be led by the Jesuit-trained Knight of Malta, Patrick J. Buchanan) and the coming “New World Order” under the Jesuits’ “infallible” Pope.
The AMA, as we know it today, began in the early 1900s. The Jesuits, through Shriner Freemasonry, the Morgans and the Rockefellers in particular, began to control the medical education of young physicians, teaching them to treat symptoms with their drugs. Later came surgery, and then radiation completing the medical “unholy trinity” of “cut, burn and poison.”
Warning us of the drug-happy doctor we read in 1912:
“ . . . for the doctor who imagines he can kill disease by his drug gatling-gun will quite as oft kill his patient. Be suspicious of the doctor who comes into the sickroom with an air of omnipotence, takes out his stethoscope as tho it was Gabriel’s Trumpet, writes a lot of Latin prescriptions and asks never a question regarding the daily habits of the patient...Beware, I say, of this class of physicians. They will sit with one hand on your pulse and the other on your pocketbook and not leave until one or the other gives out; but cure you — never! It isn’t in them. They haven’t the first conception of what a real, progressive, up-to-date physician really is able to do for his patients.” {7}
Dear truth-seeker, is this not the heart and soul of American medicine?
The massive drug companies controlled by the Knights of Malta were some of the financiers behind the Jesuits’ Council on Foreign Relations, which in turn created and then controlled the medical inquisitors, the AMA, ADA and FDA.
Purposing to sicken White Celtic-Anglo-Saxon Protestant American people, the AMA and FDA promoted mass vaccinations and immunizations. (Senator Edward “Ted” Kennedy, that darling of Georgetown University and Boston College Jesuits, knowing who really murdered his brothers, recently introduced new legislation that would attempt to vaccinate all children in the American Empire, while

Chapter 49
severely limiting exemptions parents could claim. He also seeks to set up a nationwide vaccine registry to track parents who resist the injections of monkey pus, mercury and formaldehyde into their childrens’ bloodstreams.) These slow poisons in the name of medicine contained live viruses, which would later erupt into “incurable diseases” such as “Cancer.” Dr. William Campbell Douglas tells us in his Second Opinion,
“I reported nearly 10 years ago, on the alarming finding that a monkey virus – simian virus 40 – had contaminated both the Salk and Sabin [Jesuits using Jews in the forefront] polio vaccines. It was known at the time that this virus caused brain cancer in experimental animals but, it was covered, there was no worry as it caused no problems in humans. What the public was not told is that since SV40 is a retro virus (like AIDS), it would take 20 to 40 years before we would know what damage had been done. I noted at the time that brain tumors had increased in frequency since I was graduated from medical school. In 1950, they were rare, but by 1990 they were common — 1950 plus 40 equals 1990 (the year I made my first report on SV40 and brain tumors). The horrifying truth came out in the February 14, 1999, London Telegraph:
‘The mass vaccination campaigns of the 50’s and 60’s may be causing hundreds of deaths a year because of a cancer-causing virus which contaminated the first polio vaccine, according to scientists. Known as SV40, the virus came from dead monkeys whose kidney cells were used to culture the first Salk Vaccines. Doctors estimate that the virus was injected into tens of millions during mass vaccination campaigns before being detected and screened out in 1963. Those born between 1941 and 1961 are thought to be most at risk of having been infected.’ . . .
‘Now a new study of the effects of SV40 points to disturbing evidence that the monkey virus causes a number of human cancers’ . . . ‘such as non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and prostate cancer . . . and bone cancer.’ . . . the monkey virus may be passing from those given the contaminated vaccine to their children, spreading the cancer risk still further.’ ” {8}
Additionally we read:
“Polio Vaccine: Developed in the late 1940’s from dead pig and monkey kidney pus infected with poliomyelitis, and lactalbumin hydrolysate, chemical antibiotics, and calf serum. This live-virus vaccine recently tested to harbor 149 live viruses and bacteria living in the vaccine; including the SV40 virus, also found in cancer cells. Can cause

intestinal flu, autoimmune diseases, (juvenile) childhood diabetes, children’s rheumatoid arthritis, and childhood lupus. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reported that during 1973 to 1983, 87% of polio cases were caused by the polio vaccine injection and from 1980 to 1989 the polio vaccine shots caused 100% of all domestic polio incidences. Dr. Jonas Salk is quoted as admitting, ‘When you inoculate children with a polio vaccine you don’t sleep well for two or three weeks’ (E. McBean, The Poisoned Needle, Health Research, Mokelumne Hill, Calif., p. 144). Dr. Salk’s killed-virus vaccine proliferation resulted in polio incidence doubling nationwide, some states reporting 400-600% increases.” {9} [Emphasis added]
The deliberate poisoning of the bloodstreams of Protestant nations should not be a surprise in the light of the Council of Trent, as, the Jesuits declared they would do this in The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion. We read from Protocol Number ten:
“ . . . it is indispensable to trouble in all countries the people’s relations with their governments so as to utterly exhaust humanity with dissension, hatred, struggle, envy and even to the use of torture, by starvation, BY THE INOCULATION OF DISEASES . . . ” {10} [Emphasis added]
Dear truth-seeker, have not our many inoculations resulted in the tortures of the treatments as well as the deaths our countrymen have suffered due to being eaten alive by “Cancer”?
Later, the agents of the Jesuits would institute the draft creating a huge army. This Army of the American Empire, to be used to restore the Temporal Power of the Pope, would have to fight globally. Therefore its soldiers would be mass vaccinated. With harmful viruses and bacteria in the semen, their wives and babies would become infected producing more cancers and birth defects. The Gulf War Syndrome is a classic example of murder by injection.
The Vatican, with its Sovereign Military Order of Malta, has created many viruses that have been used for the systematic annihilation of the “heretic and liberal” American people. The Knights, with their former Nazis, CIA and drug companies, created the Human Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV) causing the present Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) epidemic. That virus is in every hepatitis B vaccine administered by the medical inquisitors, the AMA! We read from Emerging Viruses: AIDS and Ebola, by Len Horowitz:
The Jesuits – 1900 - 2000



Chapter 49
“Though polio vaccines are also suspected of transmitting HIV-1 and other viruses, the unique epidemiology, and concurrent outbreaks of AIDS in New York City and Central Africa, appears to coincide more closely with the administration of experimental hepatitis B vaccines than with either the Salk or Sabin vaccines.” {11} [Emphasis added]
Since the 1930s, during the tyranny of FDR, the Jesuit Conspiracy against the health of Protestant America has greatly advanced. The true cures for viral diseases were heavily suppressed. Those cures were primarily oxygen-ozone, light with color, ultra-violet blood irradiation (so ably explained by Dr. William Campbell Douglas in his Into the Light {12} and Kenneth J. Dillon’s Healing Photons: The Science and Art of Blood Irradiation Therapy {13}) and direct current frequency generators using both photons and electrons. The use of medical grade ozone, Royal Rife’s photon/frequency machine, Emmett Knott’s blood irradiator and Darius Dinshah’s light-color therapy called “Spectro-Chrome” were all violently suppressed. The use of medical grade colloidal silver was discontinued and all non-drug remedies were suppressed. And why? Because these treatments address the true causes of chronic disease. Of the true causes, Dr. William H. Philpott tells us:
“The oxidoreductase enzymes are necessary to produce biological life energy by oxidation phosphorylation producing ATP and oxidation remnant negative poled magnetism. The biological life energy consists of enzyme catalytic production of: (a) adenosine triphosphate (ATP), (b) oxidative remnant magnetism (a negative magnetic field). This oxidation/reduction enzymatic response is dependent upon alkalinity and molecular oxygen (alkaline-hyperoxia) . . .
This oxidoreductase family of enzymes is alkaline-hyperoxic-negative (south-seeking) magnetic field activation dependent. When these 3 physiologically normal factors are not present, then cellular ATP is made by fermentation. The 3 factors necessary for fermentation to produce ATP are: 1) acidity, 2) lack of oxygen, 3) a positive (north-seeking) static magnetic field as an enzyme energy activator. Human cells have the capacity to make ATP be either phosphorylation or fermentation . . .
ATP made by fermentation with its acid-hypoxic medium cannot maintain human biological life energy. ATP made by fermentation can maintain the life energy of microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, parasites and cancer cells. The secret to reverse acute maladaptive symptom reactions, prevent and reverse microorganism infections, maintaining human biological health and providing for the reversal of degenerative diseases is to maintain a normal alkaline body
The Jesuits – 1900 - 2000

pH, hyperoxia and an adequate negative (south-seeking) static magnetic
field.” {14} [Emphasis added]
In these great words of wisdom lay the cures for all cancers, heart disease, diabetes and infections. Therefore by refusing all infective vaccinations and immunizations as well as amalgam fillings and root canals, by using negatively charged photons and ions to kill all anaerobic bacteria, viruses, fungus and microscopic parasites (such as ultraviolet light and ozone/oxidative therapies), by keeping the body in a highly alkaline state using enzymes and alkaline minerals (as found in raw, unprocessed foods, whole food supplementation and alkaline water), by keeping a highly oxygenated state through deep breathing, exercise and oxygen therapies (such as hyperbaric oxygen and ozone steam cabinets), by keeping in negatively charged magnetic fields (such as magnetic beds, magnetic wraps, magnetic bricks and seat pads while drinking magnetized, alkaline water – all north pole – and by using laetrile and herbs) White Protestant nations would cease to be the leaders in chronic degenerative diseases!
But the licensed treatment of the AMA’s created diseases must be by means of Rome’s unholy trinity — cut, burn and poison. The Church of Modern Medicine tolerates no heresy and uses the sword of government to punish those “obstinate medical heretics” who would dare to truly cure us Americans of our diseases.
And of course, the Knights of Malta control the great pharmaceutical industries such as Merck, Sharp & Dohme, as they are connected with the Order’s Central Intelligence Agency. Knight of Malta Elmer Bobst, past chairman of Warner-Lambert Company (any relation to Luce’s Time-Warner Co.?) and Knight of Malta – the Romanist and racial Jew – Louis Lehrman, whose family owns the Rite-Aid chain of drugstores, are Papal soldiers. Indeed the Holy Scriptures are true when describing Rome, hosting Vatican City, as:
“ . . . that great city . . . that mighty city . . . for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries [pharmacies] were all nations deceived.”
[Thus the risen Son of God cries out to His beloved Semitic Hebrew/Jewish Race:]
“Come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.”

The Jesuits – 1900 - 2000



Chapter 49
In place of proven cures, the AMA, ADA and FDA have pushed toxic, mercury-laced fillings and drugs down the throats of trusting Americans. This has resulted in the unnecessary suffering and death of millions while at this writing there are one hundred million chronically ill people in the American Empire.
Two brilliant Jews, responsible for the exposure of the American Medical and Dental Inquisitions are Dr. Robert S. Mendelsohn and Dr. Leonard Horowitz. Dr. Mendelsohn, in his classic, Confessions of a Medical Heretic, likens the medical establishment to the Roman Catholic Institution, calling it “the Church of Modern Medicine.” The doctors are priests, the birth certificate is the baptismal certificate, toxic silver nitrate applied to the eyes at birth is baptism, the nurses are inquisitors, etc. He writes:
“I do not believe in Modern Medicine. I am a medical heretic. I believe that Modern Medicine’s treatments for disease . . . are more dangerous than the diseases they are designed to treat. I believe that more than ninety percent of Modern Medicine could disappear from the face of the earth – doctors, hospitals, drugs, and equipment – and the effect on our health would be immediate and beneficial . . . For the hospital is the Temple of the Church of Modern Medicine and thus one of the most dangerous places on earth . . . There’s plenty to be afraid of. The God that resides in the Temple of Modern Medicine is Death . . . The doctor-priest gets away with a lot because he can claim to be up against the very Forces of Evil . . . Never is he seen in his true light — as the agent of the Devil . . .
We have a Medical Inquisition. The first sign of an inquisition is the selling of indulgences . . . Medical insurance is the doctor’s version of indulgences . . . Like the communion wafer which Catholics receive on the tongue, drugs are the communion wafers of Modern Medicine. . . . Try getting from one end of life to the other without paying your dues to Modern Medicine: immunizations, fluoridated water, intravenous fluids and silver nitrate . . . When you get to the cathedrals and the little “Vaticans” of Modern Medicine, you are up against priests who have the weight of infallibility behind them. They can do no wrong, so they are most dangerous . . . ” {15} [Emphasis added]
Dr. Mendelsohn knew what he was describing. He had been a devoted medical priest and had watched the Inquisitors for years, as he was well acquainted with the Jesuits at Loyola University in Chicago while a professor in the School of Medicine at the University of Illinois. He later became a most eloquent and undefeated champion in exposing the crimes of modern medicine. His opponents in debate would not even make an appearance.

The life and message of Robert Mendelsohn was hated by the Jesuits’ Medical Inquisition controlled by the AMA, ADA and FDA through the New York Cardinal’s Council on Foreign Relations. Clearly this “perfidious Jew” was believable! Therefore, one day in good health at the age of sixty-three, payback time had arrived for this “obstinate heretic.” He suddenly died, a victim of “the poison cup” at the hand of another Vatican Assassin, “invisible until his stroke was felt.”
Dr. Leonard Horowitz is of the same caliber as was Dr. Mendelsohn. In his fantastic book, Emerging Viruses: AIDS and Ebola, he connects the Vatican’s Knights of Malta to the Nazis, the drug Companies, and the AIDS/Cancer virus makers within the CIA.
“The Gehlen Org, the German intelligence agency run by Reinhard Gehlen, was even more powerful than the Merk net. The Org superseded even the Nazi SS . . . In fact, Gehlen’s organization is largely credited for giving rise to the CIA . . . to shield Gehlen and the entire German intelligence network from harm’s way. Gehlen was a ranking official in the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (SMOM), which maintained inconceivable financial and political influence. . . . Somehow I wasn’t surprised to learn that financial motives . . . were at the heart of SMOM and the Nazi-American alliance . . . Soon after the war, OSS found the extensive documentation of a meeting...between representatives of the SS . . . and firms like . . . I. G. Farben [its president and Papal Knight of Malta, Herman Schmitz, being the Director of Hitler’s Deutsche Bank and a close personal friend of the Fuhrer’s ambassador to the Vatican, Knight of Malta Franz von Papen] . . . [The] world’s masses knew nothing about the partnership, formed between John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company, Germany’s I. G. Farben, and Hitler’s Third Reich. The ‘pirates of Wall Street,’ Allen and John Foster Dulles, of the [CFR’s] law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, had secretly negotiated this alliance. It was not known to allied airmen, flying bombing missions over Germany, why the I.G. Farben plants, where Hitler’s munitions were made, were exempted from attack. Likewise, when the I. G. Farben-Rockefeller Consortium used concentration camp victims as slaves to build and run their factories it never made the news [controlled by Knight of Malta Henry R. Luce]. Nor was it heralded that this same team patented and sold the gas that the Nazis used in the concentration camps to send millions to their graves. Recent headlines have asked to know where the Nazi gold went. Historians only recently recorded that the Rockefeller’s Chase Bank [manned by a high Knight of Malta, Joseph J. Larkin] was among the largest recipients . . . ” {16} [Emphasis added]

Dear truth-seeker, according to the 1993 Annual Report of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Rockefeller Group, Sullivan & Cromwell and the Chase Manhattan Bank are all listed on the Corporate Member Roster of the Jesuits’ Council on Foreign Relations. Along with these are the drug giants, Dow Chemical, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer, and Procter & Gamble. Another member is the Center for Disease Control North America.{17} And guess who is one of the guiding lights overseeing the heads of these giant monopolies of murder? It is CFR member/presider and President of the Jesuit Order’s Fordham University, a Professed Jesuit of the Fourth Vow, Joseph A. O’Hare. {18}
And amidst this fraternity we find the Roman Catholic and tool of the Jesuits who developed the HIV virus and thus the AIDS epidemic, the world’s leading retrovirologist, Robert Gallo! This fiend was pardoned by the Jesuits’ Bill Clinton for scientific misconduct! Horowitz correctly concludes:
“Thus, both of this century’s worst genocides [the Jewish Holocaust and the AIDS epidemic] appear to have been determined by the same
{19}
Those masterminds, Dr. Horowitz, are the Jesuits, the monsters who, with their Knights of Malta, financed World War II, murdered millions of your Semitic Hebrew/Jewish Race, assassinated our President Kennedy and developed killer viruses. The Order, in control of the press, covered all this up and prevented the use of proven treatments that easily cure their created viral diseases. We became their victims as we were forced to go to Mexico for medical help, or herded into their “Church of Modern Medicine” to be tortured and mutilated by their medical Inquisitors. Like the docile slaves depicted by the Jesuits’ Freemason and Fabian Socialist, H. G. Wells, in his The Time Machine, we have marched into the caves of Rome’s Medical Inquisition and have been devoured by the cannibals who cut, burn and poison us. The result has been “the final solution to the ‘heretic and liberal’ question in North America,” sentencing millions of Baptists, Protestants, Jews and “liberal” Roman Catholics to horrible, ghastly deaths initiated by the hellish, damnable, dreadful and deplorable slow poisons, deceptively called “vaccinations and immunizations,” made from the precious little bodies of aborted millions! This mass genocide of the “heretic and liberal” American people, carried out by the Order’s American Medical Association in conjunction with its Food and Drug Administration and the CDC, has created a nation of “the walking wounded.” In the words of Abate Leone, “this secret war,” relentlessly waged against our “heretic and liberal nation” for the last one hundred years, having slowly but surely fattened, sickened, weakened, polluted, agitated, divided and disarmed us, has further enabled our unified, healthy and physically fit Russian, Moslem, Mexican, Cuban and Chinese invaders to extirpate and exterminate us from the face of the whole earth!

The Council of Trent and the Jesuit Oath continue to be fulfilled as we remember a portion of the Fourth Vow of the Professed Jesuit:

I will secretly use the poison cup . . .

As all Provincials are Professed of the Fourth Vow, Smolich was the immediate master of former California Governor Gray Davis, a Knight of Columbus of the Fourth Degree. Remembering that the official position of the Jesuit Conference is the total abolition of gun ownership, Californians have now been legally disarmed of their “assault rifles” further rendering them unable to repel our coming Sino-Soviet-Moslem invasion. Presently practicing in the Straits of Formosa, our Asian invaders will be transported by a combined Chinese and Russian merchant marine of over 2000 ships. With Los Angeles to be decimated this attack will be successful, unlike the Order’s attempted invasion of repentant Protestant England in 1588 using the Papal Caesar’s Spanish Armada. The Protestant Reformation will be finished and we Americans will be raped, plundered and mass-murdered by foreign, marauding, pagan savages fulfilling the Order’s Bloody Oath.

“The Jesuit Order, therefore, stands before us as the embodiment of a system which aims at temporal political domination through temporal political means, embellished by religion, which assigns to the head of the Catholic religion – the Roman Pope – the role of a temporal overlord, and under shelter of the Pope-King, and using him as an instrument, desires itself to attain the dominion over the whole world [when the Order’s Jesuit Pontiff becomes the Universal Monarch of the World after his ‘deadly wound was healed’ (Revelation 13:3)].” {6} [Emphasis added]

Chapter 50 677
The Fourteenth Amendment so altered the Constitution to the point that it created “the new republican constitution” spoken of in The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion. The Jesuit Order, behind the new constitution, created the American Empire. In 1868, on the ruins of George Washington’s Calvinistic Republic, the Jesuits’ new “Holy Roman Empire of the West” was set up with its massive central government in Washington. Its national purpose would be to restore the Temporal Power of the Jesuits’ “infallible” Pope over every nation. To do this the Empire was made the financial and military colossus of the world using J. P. Morgan, their Federal Reserve Bank and the Great Depression. In subduing the nations, credit created out of nothing would be used to build tremendous war machines for the “extirpation of heretics and liberals.” This same Jesuit credit, called “foreign aid,” would be used to establish and finance the reign of dictators loyal to Rome over every nation, including the Zionist and Talmudic government of Israel.
The economic policy of the Empire would be the destruction of small, independent, free enterprise businessmen and the consolidation of capital into the hands of Rome’s corporate monopolies (corporate fascism), while the people would be submitted to the ten pillars of The Communist Manifesto in exchange for The Ten Commandments. A central bank, from which comes all credit, along with a fiat, bogus currency, would replace state banks having distributed federally minted gold and silver coins. A heavy and progressive income tax would invade the privacy of the people while replacing the apportioned tax. The wicked Social Security numbering system would keep track of all “taxpayers.” In fact, it would be the Vatican’s world government number by which the Society of Jesus, through its FBI and CIA, would track every citizen of the Empire. These two pillars alone would be enough to destroy the prosperous White Celtic-Anglo-Saxon Protestant Middle Class, while creating the feudal system of the Dark Ages composed only of the noble super-rich Catholic Whites and the common super-poor of all races and religions. The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion say it clearly in Protocol number twenty:
“The concentration of industry in the hands of [cartel] capitalists out of the hands of small masters has drained away all the juices of the peoples and with them also the states . . .” {9}
Dear truth-seeker, do you see how the radical mass emancipation of the Negro slaves after the War Between the States was never intended to benefit them but rather was calculated to destroy the private wealth of small White “heretic” masters in the South? Historically speaking, Blacks generally only produce wealth when trained and/or overseen by Whites. Do you see how the Fourteenth Amendment enslaved both Whites and Blacks to the new master in Washington — the Society of Jesus? Is not the Archbishop of New York the real “massa” of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Albert Gore and Jesse Jackson (who is apparently to be replaced with another mulatto Black agitator, Al Sharpton), they being nothing more than his “altar boys”?

With the economic system of Communism in place, the political system of the Empire would be an absolutist military dictatorship of the president as “Commander-in-Chief,” for the purpose of “national security.” Protocol number ten spoke of this:
“We shall invest the president with the right of declaring a state of war. We shall justify this last right on the ground that the president as chief of the whole army of the country must have it at his disposal in case of need for the defense of the new republican constitution . . .” {10}
That is fascism, pure and simple. The absolute Commander-in-Chief is one with the Jesuits’ corporate monopolies run by the Knights of Malta. Remembering the words of the Jesuits as quoted by Pierre van Paassen,
“Fascism is the regime that corresponds most closely to the concepts of the
Church of Rome.” {11}
It was fascism that terribly persecuted the Protestants of Franco’s Spain and Mussolini’s Italy. Additionally, it was fascism that deported Jews to Hitler’s death camps in Poland. In fact both Hitler and Stalin, the Grand Inquisitors, were Roman Catholic fascists. Nazism and Communism were simply smokescreens describing socialist economic systems. Both dictators were loyal to Rome’s Jesuits who put them in power, as they both murdered millions of Protestants, Orthodox and Jewish “heretics and liberals,” including many “liberal” Catholic priests and people.
Dear truth-seeker, this is the coming scenario for the Protestants and Jews of the American Empire. The President, since the Emergency War Powers Act of 1950, has been a fascist military dictator loyal to his Jesuit masters at Georgetown University. And with the passage of King George Bush II’s new Terrorist Act, fascism will further increase. The Jesuits will continue to advance their international “Negro/Muslim Agitation” (directed against historically White Protestant nations) and incite international anti-Semitism, or more correctly, anti-Jewish fury. Much was ignited in the American Empire with the Israeli attack on the American spy ship “USS Liberty,” along with the conviction of the Israeli spy, Jonathan Pollard. The Jesuits’ International Intelligence Community including the Mossad created both incidents. Anti-Jewish fury among both Whites and Blacks must be used to drive American Jews back to Israel for the purpose of attempting to kill them all there!
The means by which the Sons of Loyola will accomplish this is their National Security Agency — the NSA. We read:
“Its nickname is the ‘Jew Room’. Inside the National Security Agency is an intelligence center from which all American Jews are banned, regardless of their proven loyalty or devotion to country, just as the U.S. Navy banned Jews from electronic surveillance ships, such as the USS Liberty . . . it is, and

has been, the heart of the secret war against the Jews.” {12} [Emphasis added]
Remembering the words of Loyola in his Secret Instructions of the Jesuits,
“ . . . our members will work themselves into the favor of persons in the highest part of government and consequently be admitted into their most
secret councils,” {13}
is it not obvious the Jesuit Order rules “The Jew Room”? For in the words of ex-Jesuit E. Boyd Barrett:
“In the Order hatred of the Jews is traditional . . . it is forbidden to admit any one of Jewish descent into the Order [from 1593 to the repeal of the statute in 1946, thereby escaping Holocaust war guilt]. Japanese, Chinese, Indians and Negroes may be admitted into the Society of Jesus, but never, under any circumstances, a Jew [except Albert and Auguste Valenstein, who were permitted to enter the Order in the early 1900s for the purpose of working with the Jesuit General’s early Masonic Jewish Zionists including Theodor Herzl and later, Jerzy Kluger, boyhood friend of Pope John Paul II]!” {14}
For Ignatius set the example:
“He [Loyola, the heartless beast] also obtained great honour from all classes for his zeal for the conversion of the Jews. His method was not original. He obtained a decree from the Pope Paul III, then reigning, that the Jews should not be allowed the services of a physician, no matter how serious might be their danger, unless they first accepted the ministrations of a priest . . . ” {15} [Emphasis added]
The Jesuits will also continue to foster international anti-Americanism depicting the Empire as “the Great Satan” to the Arab world and the “NATO Nazi mass bombing bully” to the rest of the world. The NATO crusades in Iraq and Yugoslavia have increased the nations’ hatred for us Americans, they not knowing that the Jesuit-CFR-controlled American government is also the enemy of the American people. Meanwhile, the Jesuits have furthered their quest to reduce the world to the universal rule of their “infallible” Papal Caesar in Jerusalem.
In Fourteenth Amendment America the Jesuit Order rules supremely, having no serious or significant adversaries. Ten Jesuit Provincials oversee the Empire through its King, the Archbishop of New York — Edward Cardinal Egan, he ruling from his palatial St. Patrick’s Cathedral while overseen by the Jesuits of Fordham University. The Cardinal exercises the Pope’s Temporal Power over the Empire through his Knights of Malta, Knights of Columbus, Shriner Freemasonry, Opus Dei, the Club of Rome and the Mafia Commission, along with a host of other subordinate secret societies, they controlling the Council on Foreign Relations.

The Empire has two political parties controlled by the Council on Foreign Relations. The first is the Democratic Party, which is in fact “the Communist Party.” The second is the Republican Party, which is in fact “the Fascist Party.” (Forget the words “liberal” and “conservative” as they mean nothing!) Neither party wishes to “conserve” the Constitution which would result in a truly “liberal” government, as neither party will return to hard money, abolish the national bank and erect a protective tariff — the three essentials for national prosperity as proven by President Andrew Jackson. As in Europe, the Fascist nations resisting “godless Jew Communism” all had Roman Catholic dictators subject to Concordats with the Pope. This is Rome’s present course for the American Empire!
For fifteen years the former Archbishop of New York, John Cardinal O’Connor, in using the Jesuit inspired abortion agitation, built “the New Right” with his Knights and Dames of Malta. Of this fascist, right-wing movement seeking full control of the Republican Party, the leaders have been Paul Weyrich, Lewis Lehrman, Phyllis Schlafly, Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, Rush Limbaugh, Newt Gingrich and the Black Roman Catholic, Allen Keyes. Backed by the Kennedy assassins, Knights Cartha DeLoach, Frank Shakespeare and William F. Buckley, Jr., their ultimate candidate for the Presidency is another brother Knight, the Jesuit-trained Pat Buchanan. As Knight Franz von Papen used the Center Party to bring Hitler to power and as Knight Joseph P. Kennedy used the Democratic Party to bring FDR to power, so will the Knights, including Richard Mellon Scaife, use the New Right Republican Party to bring a Jesuit-controlled, Jew-hating, fascist dictator to power “For the greater glory of God” — the god who sits in “St. Peter’s Chair”!
When the time is right the Black Pope will give the order and the post Protestant Reformation American culture as we know it today will be no more! His Masonic Shriners, Knights of Malta and Knights of Columbus on Wall Street will cause an economic collapse resulting in the anarchy of an inner city race war led by his Black Supremacist Nation of Islam. The Constitution will be suspended and martial law will be declared by a final presidential executive order. America’s Commander-in-Chief will truly be a fascist dictator backed by the economic might of the Knights of Malta. In fulfilling The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, the Jesuit Oath and the Council of Trent, he, like other fascist dictators of the past, will make a treaty with Rome called a “Concordat.” The guns will be confiscated and the persecution of Protestants, Baptists and Jews will begin in dead earnest! Alaska will be the American Siberia run by Jesuit Inquisitors. Located in the southwest corner, there is a one-million acre “restricted area” complex to be used for brainwashing as well as bizarre and torturous experiments as part of the Jesuits’ “relentless war” on all “heretics and liberals” — the Empire’s Protestant, Baptists, Jews and anti-fascist, anti-socialist-communist, pro-Constitution, truly “liberal” conservatives.

This will ultimately give way to war and a foreign invasion. The invaders will be merciless Russian, Chinese, Moslem and Cuban mercenaries, all controlled by the Jesuit General. The movie Red Dawn is an attempt to illustrate the planned invasion. America’s paganized, demoralized, feminized and mongrelized White sons of noble sires with ear rings and tattoos all over their bodies – presently the largest consumers of pornography, illicit drugs and Black “rap music” – will be the internationally hated target. America’s White Protestants and Baptists will be mass murdered, raped and plundered as we have departed from the Bible of the English Reformation, The Authorized King James Version of 1611. We apostate and degenerate White American believers in refusing to abide in Christ have become “good for nothing” and will be gathered by evil men and cast into the fire of persecution “to be burned.”
“If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.”
Jesus the Messiah John 15:6
Our hatred of Calvinism and love for the Jesuits’ “sovereign drug of Arminianism,” resulting in no godly resistance to Rome’s fascist tyranny, will mean our brutal and torturous deaths. “Heretic” Jews and “liberal” Roman Catholics will meet the same fate as they did during the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s.
Meanwhile, the great whore in Rome – the Vatican’s Papal Caesar and Senatorial Hierarchy overseen by the Black Pope and his “Fiery Jesuits” – will experience orgasmic delight as she once again becomes drunk with the blood of the saints, pursuant to the Jesuit Oath and the evil Council of Trent. Bible-believing truth seeker and brother in Christ, is this what you want for your beloved country, church and family? All this is coming because we did not timely resolve the assassination of President Kennedy. The infant that killed him has now become a monster and we, the American people, are like the children of Israel in the days of Isaiah the prophet:
“But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil and none saith, Restore. . . . for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.”

The Black Pope, Peter–Hans Kolvenbach, 2000 #204 Visiting the Jesuit Center in Wernersville, Pennsylvania, very few people could even dream of the vast and ubiquitous POWER this singular and unassuming man possesses. This Dutch Luciferian, who is the High Priest and Military Commanding General of the most powerful, wealthy, disciplined, educated and fanatical army in the history of man, rules the world with the aid of his five assistants, one advisor and one confessor. Once pronounced, there are no appeals from his decrees. His soldiers, including the Knights of Malta, Shriner Freemasonry, the Opus Dei, the Club of Rome, the Illuminati, the Knights of Columbus and the Mafia, these groups commanding a host of lesser international subordinates, rule the American, European, Moslem, Russian and Chinese Empires. His great POWER has been given to him, on behalf of Rome’s Eighth King, Jerusalem’s future risen Papal Caesar, by “the prince and power of the air,” formerly called “Lucifer” who is “the god of this world,” known as “the Devil” or “the Dragon” and addressed as “Satan” by the risen Son of God, Yeshua the Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ.

“Father Rector, let not the damp of astonishment seize upon your ardent and zealous soul, in apprehending the sodaine and unexpected calling of a Parliament [by England’s Jesuit-controlled King Charles I]. We have now many strings to our bow.

I am at this time, transported with joy, to see how happily all instruments and means, as well as lessor, co-operate unto our purposes.

“There is a conspiracy against Christendom. . . . But who are Satan’s agents in this conspiracy? The “agents” are the Jesuits. Even though the Jesuits exude vast influence and control in the areas of theology, education, recorded history and current media [through the Order’s CFR], I am still perplexed that virtually no literature exists exposing the Jesuit’s influence on mainline Protestantism. . . . In this work, the author uncovers forgotten history regarding the cooperative salvation theology of the Jesuits. . . .

Conclusion 687
With the dilemma that we Bible-believing Protestant and Baptist Americans find ourselves in, what shall we do? With the Society of Jesus having poisoned our bloodstreams with their “vaccinations and immunizations,” having mutilated us with their unnecessary surgeries, having drugged us with their “medications” and now ready to slit our throats from ear to ear using a fascist dictator bringing upon us invading foreign armies, to whom shall we turn? The Word of God tells us:
“If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.”
– II Chronicles 7:14
“If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”
– I John 1:9
Historically, the Lord’s people, Israel as well as true Bible-believing Churches, have indeed repented in the past. A classic example was the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. The Solemn League and Covenant with an Acknowledgment of Sins, and Engagement to Duties by all Ranks was agreed upon by Parliament in 1649. Remembering that one of our heroes, Oliver Cromwell, was about to behead the Jesuits’ King Charles I of England and that the Protestant Holocausts in Germany and the Netherlands had formally ended only months before this, we read:
“We Noblemen, Barons, Knights, Gentlemen, Citizens, Burgesses, Ministers of the Gospel, and Commons of all sorts, in the kingdoms of Scotland, England and Ireland, by the providence of GOD, living under one King, and being of one reformed religion, having before our eyes the glory of GOD, and the advancement of the kingdom of our Lord and Savior JESUS CHRIST, the honour and happiness of the King’s Majesty and his posterity, and the true publick liberty, safety, and peace of the kingdoms, wherein every one’s private condition is included: And calling to mind the treacherous and bloody plots, conspiracies, attempts, and practices of the enemies of GOD, against the true religion and professors thereof in all places, especially in these three kingdoms, ever since the reformation of religion; and how much their rage, power, and presumption are of late, and at this time, increased and exercised, whereof the deplorable state of the church and kingdom of Ireland, the distressed estate of the church and kingdom of England, and the dangerous estate of the church and kingdom of Scotland, are present and public testimonies; we have now at last, (after

other means of supplication, remonstrance, protestation, and sufferings,) for the preservation of ourselves and our religion from utter ruin and destruction, according to the commendable practice of these kingdoms in former times, and the example of GOD’S people in other nations, after mature deliberation, resolved and determined to enter into a mutual and solemn League and Covenant, wherein we all subscribe, and each one of us for himself, with our hands lifted up to the most High GOD, do swear,
I. That we shall sincerely, really, and constantly, through the grace of GOD, endeavor, in our several places and callings, the preservation of the reformed religion in the Church of Scotland, in doctrine, worship, discipline, and government, against our common enemies . . .Albeit we be the Lord’s people, engaged to him in a solemn way; yet to this day we have not made it our study, that judicatories and armies should consist of, and places of power and trust be filled with, men of a blameless and Christian conversation, and of known integrity, and approven fidelity, affection and zeal, unto the cause of God; but not only those who have been neutral and indifferent, but disaffected and malignant, and others who have been profane and scandalous, have been intrusted: by which it hath come to pass, that judicatories have been the seats of injustice and iniquity; and many in our armies, by their miscarriages, have become our plague, unto the great prejudice of the cause of God, the great scandal of the gospel, and the great increase of the looseness and profanity throughout all the land. It were impossible to reckon up all the abominations that are in the land; but the blaspheming of the name of God, swearing by the creatures, profanation of the Lord’s day, uncleanness, drunkenness, excess and rioting, vanity of apparel, lying and deceit, railing and cursing, arbitrary and uncontrolled oppression, and grinding of the faces of the poor by landlords, and others in place and power, are become ordinary and common sins; and besides all these things, there be many other transgressions, whereof the lands wherein we live are guilty. All which we desire to acknowledge and to be humbled for, that the world may bear witness with us, that righteousness belongeth unto God, and shame and confusion of face unto us, as appears this day . . .
And, because these kingdoms are guilty of many sins and provocations against GOD, and his SON, JESUS CHRIST, as is too manifest by our present distresses and dangers, the fruits thereof; we profess and declare, before GOD and the world, our unfeigned desire to be humbled for our own sins, and for the sins of these kingdoms; especially, that we have not as we ought valued the inestimate benefit of the gospel; that we have not laboured for the purity and power thereof; and that we have not endeavored to receive CHRIST in our hearts, nor to walk worthy of him in our lives;



Conclusion 689
which are the causes of other sins, and transgressions so much abounding amongst us: and our true and unfeigned purpose, desire, and endeavour for ourselves, and all others under our power and charge, both in publick and in private, in all duties we owe to GOD and man, to amend our lives, and each one to go before another in the example of a real reformation; that the Lord may turn away his wrath and heavy indignation, and establish these churches and kingdoms in truth and peace. And this Covenant we make in the presence of ALMIGHTY GOD, the Searcher of all hearts with a true intention to perform the same, as we shall answer at that great day, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed; most humbly beseeching the Lord to strengthen us by his HOLY SPIRIT for this end, and to bless our desires and proceedings with such success, as may be deliverance and safety to his people, and encouragement to other Christian churches, groaning under, or in danger of, the yoke of antichristian tyranny [of that Roman Antichrist and man of sin], to join in the same or like association and covenant, to the glory of GOD, the enlargement of the kingdom of JESUS CHRIST, and the peace and tranquility of Christian kingdoms and commonwealths.” {8} [Emphasis added]
Dear truth-seeker and brother in Christ, are not these words for us today?
We as God’s people in Fourteenth Amendment America, having received the Lord Jesus Christ as our personal Savior according to His blessed gospel set forth in His infallible Holy Scriptures — The Authorized King James Version of 1611, must repent of our personal and national sins. Then, we must forsake them. Some of those sins are:
1. Permitting the army of the Black Pope, the Company of the Society of Jesus, to exist, mightily prosper and absolutely control the government of the United States, through its Council on Foreign Relations, within our borders;
2. Believing the Jesuit-controlled American Press, which has continually lied and deceived us throughout the Twentieth Century;
3. Permitting the Jesuits’ Federal Reserve Banking System and United Nations to exist within our borders, as these two bodies have successfully destroyed popular liberty (“liberalism”) and the national sovereignty of every nation in the world pursuant to the purposes of the Jesuits’ “Holy Alliance;”
4. Waiving our Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights (secured by the “declaratory and restrictive clauses” of the Bill of Rights at the insistence of the Baptists of Virginia and so dearly paid for with torrents of blood by our Protestant forefathers)



690 Vatican Assassins
through “filing” our confessions every April fifteenth, paying the heavy and progressive Communist income tax, thereby financing a multitude of sins;
5. Permitting the drafting, vaccinating and sending of our sons abroad to fight the Pope’s foreign wars (such as the war in Vietnam and the recent wars in Serbia, Iraq and now Afghanistan), resulting in the further destruction of American “liberals” and foreign “heretics” so condemned by the Jesuits’ Council of Trent;
6. Permitting the Jesuits, in control of the government of the American Empire, to use our military and financial might to enthrone dictators around the world whose first allegiance is to Rome, thereby restoring the Temporal Power of the Jesuits’ “infallible” Pope, returning the world to the Dark Ages;
7. Consenting to the Jesuits’ Supreme Court decisions in removing the Protestant Bible and prayer from the bulwark of American liberty so hated by the Jesuits — the Public School System;
8. Consenting to the immigration of millions of Roman Catholics and pagan persons of color whose loyalty to the Pope or their own race, religion and nationality is greater than their loyalty to our Protestant Constitution and republican form of government, thereby creating a multitude of agitations justifying more centralization of power in Washington, D.C., and through amalgamation, the Africanization of the American White Celtic-Anglo-Saxon Race (being historically the greatest enemy of the Jesuit Order) especially its Bible-believing Protestants and Baptists, as intended by the Company of Jesus pursuant to its Jesuit Oath;
9. Consenting to the Jesuits’ Supreme Court’s several decisions of forced integration resulting in the destruction of both the White and Black races through amalgamation, as the exchange of viruses, bacteria and parasites, unique to each race, creates powerful combinations in the offspring producing a non-resistant, weak and sterile population within five generations;
10. Consenting to the Jesuits’ Supreme Court’s decision of legalized abortion, resulting in the mass murder of unborn babies, polluting the land with innocent blood, ultimately collapsing the Ponzi Scheme called “the Social Security System” justifying mass murder of the elderly by the coming fascist dictator, “provoking the Lord against us, to consume us, until there be no remnant nor escaping in the land” by means of a massive military invasion composed of a coalition of nations, cleansing the land with the blood of unrepentant and unforgiven American murderers;
11. Succumbing to race hatred as a result of Jesuit-controlled, Masonic agitators such as the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and the Black Nation of Islam, justifying the imposition of martial law when the inner-city race wars begin;



Conclusion 691
12. Sheepishly giving up our real wealth, gold and silver coins in exchange for “indulgences” (the Jesuits’ worthless paper money called “Federal Reserve Notes”) and thereby becoming a nation of overworked, unprincipled, money-hungry thieves;
13. Consenting to the cattle brand of the Jesuits’ “Social Security Number” as a means of identification to be used by their International Intelligence Community, begun by Hitler’s SS at Dachau, it being the forerunner of
“ . . . the mark, . . . of the beast, or the number of his name.”
– Revelation 13:17
14. Obeying the evil 1968 Gun Law of Nazi origin and thereby, upon purchasing new firearms, blindly registering our guns – our Swords of Just Defense – enabling the coming, Jesuit-controlled, White, fascist, military dictator to ultimately take them from us making our annihilation sure, pursuant to the Council of Trent;
15. Committing a multitude of personal sins, both public and private, insuring that our annihilation will be a righteous act in the eyes of both the risen Son of God and mortal man.
Realizing that the theology of a people determines the form of government to which they submit; that substance determines form; that theory decrees practice; that heresy begets tyranny; the list of our national sins is not complete. Since our righteous and tolerant Biblical foundations, laid by American Calvinists of the Lord’s Grand and Glorious Protestant Reformation, have been destroyed, we must name the greatest sin of all. It is the fear of man having produced a nation of cowards as a result of cowardice and compromise in the pulpit — something Luther, Calvin and Knox never knew! Where is the fearless Bible preacher today? These “ministers” are all, for the most part, wimpy businessmen dominated by their matriarchal and feminist wives while aspiring to build a following of false easy-believers, who know nothing of self sacrifice, in exchange for their high calling of:
“Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.”

“Be strong and of a good courage . . . Only be thou strong and very courageous . . . to do according to all the law . . . that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest . . . for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed; for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.”
– Joshua 1:6-9
With strength from God, empowered by his Spirit we are to resist the Devil. The Devil manifests his works through many devices. One of them is political tyranny. Human government was established by God when He instituted capital punishment for murderers.
“Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed . . .”
– Genesis 9:6
Its purpose was to punish evil and reward good,
“For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt
thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same: For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.
– Romans 13:3, 4
Government was necessary for the growth of any civilization as even today. But when a government becomes a bloodthirsty tyranny, evincing a design to reduce us under absolute despotism, it is our right, it is our Protestant and Baptist-Calvinist duty, to throw off such government and to provide new guards for our future security. And how do we do this? We first submit to the Word of God, which is the Sword of the Spirit, by meditating upon it and learning how to use it in resisting the Devil, not loving his world system, and daily dying to the urges of our own sinful, fleshly nature. Whenever Christ was tempted by Satan or taunted by the evil Pharisees, whose Judaism was originally based in Jehovah’s Torah but corrupted by the traditions of men as recorded in the wicked Babylonian Talmud, he always resisted with the Sword of the Spirit coupled with his wit. He was not afraid. He was courageous and he attacked, not fearing what men could do to Him. With the strength of Samson and

the zeal of Nehemiah, He cleansed the Second Temple intending it to be Jerusalem’s House of Prayer for all Gentile Nations. Our attitudes and actions must be the same. We wake up every morning with the joy of the Lord, and a spiritual song in our hearts. We put on the whole armor of God, pray and, with courage given by the Holy Spirit, do battle with our enemies, the World, the Flesh and the Devil.
Those enemies manifest themselves through people, some of which are the servants of Satan. I am referring to the Jesuits, the Knights of Malta, Shriner Freemasonry, the Illuminati, Opus Dei, the Club of Rome (founded in 1968 to be used for the Pope’s unification of Europe, and guided by its current Masonic Islamic President, Prince El Hassan bin Talal, who is the uncle of the Arab king of Jordan), the Mafia and the Knights of Columbus. These groups control all banking, the media, politics and organized religion within the American Empire. Like the risen Son of God, we do not hate these men; we hate their doctrines and we hate their deeds.
“But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.”
– Revelation 2:6, 15
We pray for their conversion to Jesus the Christ of the Reformation Bible, enabling them to resist their past worshipful master – Satan – whom they must abandon. But when these unconverted men become bolder to resist the preaching of the pure gospel, desiring to destroy us “heretics and liberals,” we must through the arm of government take up “the Sword of Just Defense” as we Calvinists have called it. We must go to physical war against the armies controlled by Rome’s Jesuits even as our forefathers have so bravely done in the past. Indeed, there is:
“ . . . a time of war . . . ”
– Ecclesiastes 3:8
We fight valiantly for the truth in the earth: we win the day or retreat to attack again. We never surrender, as our foes have no mercy evidenced by the Waco massacre; so, we die to the last man even as Holland’s wild Beggars of the sea. We fight and die well as our Calvinist forefathers fought and died on a thousand fields of battle, outnumbered and outgunned, remembering we brought Europe out of the Dark Ages into the Modern Era; we alone gave birth to political liberty so limiting the powers of rulers, our Father having answered our prayers. Whether we live or die we serve the risen Son of God in resisting the sin of Anti-Christian tyranny presently being shoved down our throats by that Roman Antichrist — the Jesuits’ “infallible”



694 Vatican Assassins
Papal Caesar! In one hand is the Sword of the Spirit and in the other is the Sword of Just Defense. With these weapons coupled with personal purity, prayer and loyal leadership, the man of God is invincible! Gentlemen, the time is not ripe but rotten!
When the Protestants and Baptist-Calvinists of the past resisted the armies of Jesuit-controlled tyrants, they obtained liberty and the following good report:
“Whatever was the cause, the Calvinists were the only fighting Protestants. It was they whose faith gave them courage to stand up for the Reformation. In England, Scotland, France, Holland, they, and they only, did the work, and but for them the Reformation would have been crushed. This is why I admire them, and feel there was something in their creed that made them what they were . . . If it had not been for the Calvinists, Huguenots, Puritans, and whatever you like to call them, the Pope and Philip would have won, and we should either be Papists or Socialists.” {9} [Emphasis added]
If the Protestant and Baptist pastors of the Pope’s Fourteenth Amendment “Holy Roman” American Empire do not repent and begin to vehemently resist our Jesuit, Anti-Christian tyranny centered at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York City, they will most assuredly experience shame, remorse and murder at the hands of Vatican Assassins. Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a Bible-rejecting Lutheran pastor, was hanged naked, suspended with a piano wire in 1945 by the Jesuits’ SS. Prior to this shameful and dishonorable death at the hands of the Devil’s henchmen he confessed:
“I am guilty of cowardly silence at a time when I ought to have spoken. I am guilty of hypocrisy and untruthfulness in the face of force. I have been lacking in compassion and I have denied the poorest of my brethren . . . We, the church, must confess that we have not proclaimed often or clearly enough our message of the one God who has revealed Himself for all times in Jesus Christ and who will tolerate no other gods beside Himself. She must confess her timidity, her evasiveness, her dangerous concessions. She has often been untrue to her office of guardianship and to her office of comfort. She was silent when she should have cried out because the blood of the innocent was crying aloud to heaven. She has failed to speak the right word in the right way at the right time. She has not resisted to the uttermost the apostasy of faith, and she has brought upon herself the guilt of the godlessness of the masses. . . . The church must confess that she has witnessed the lawless application of brutal force, the physical and spiritual suffering of countless innocent people, oppression, hatred, and murder, and that she has not raised her voice on behalf of the victims and has not found ways to hasten to their aid. She is guilty of the deaths of the weakest and most defenseless brothers of Jesus Christ . . . The church must confess that



Conclusion 695
she has desired security, peace and quiet, possessions and honor, to which she has no right . . . She has not borne witness to the truth of God . . . By her own silence she has rendered herself guilty because of her unwillingness to suffer for what she knows to be right.” {10} [Emphasis added]
With the gathering of God’s people led by loyal pastors we must petition the Congress to redress the grievance of the Jesuit assassination of President Kennedy. We must demand that the Society of Jesus be expelled from the American Empire, while praying for individual Jesuits that they would leave the Company and tell their story. Laws must be passed that no one may hold public office that has given an oath of allegiance to a foreign Monarch — especially the Pope! This would include the Knights of Malta and the Knights of Columbus. Laws must be passed that no member of a secret society can hold public office. This would include all Freemasons, as their doctrines are secret, their lodges have no windows (just like the Kingdom Halls of the Masonically-controlled Jehovah’s Witnesses who deny the deity of Christ) and their highest leaders are loyal to the Jesuit General.
Dear truth-seeker, these things will never happen unless Americans experience a true Great Awakening as we did in 1735 and 1835. May we all diligently seek God through His risen Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, while He may be found that we may live for Him, which is our reasonable service.
In the meantime, we must do as Jehoshaphat, the King of Judah, when he faced the invasion of a great multitude from beyond the sea. In open prayer on the Temple steps before all the people, he cried:
“O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.”
– II Chronicles 20:12
Responding to his prayer of faith the Lord replied,
“Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s.”
– II Chronicles 20:15



696 Vatican Assassins
Dear Bible-believing truth-seeker and brother in Christ, if the risen Son of God sank the Spanish Armada when Philip II sought to invade Protestant England in 1588, if the risen Son of God gave Gustavus Adolphus victory after victory during the Thirty Years’ War ending in 1648, if the risen Son of God gave Oliver Cromwell and his Baptist-Calvinist army the victory at Dunbar in the face of annihilation by the Presbyterian Scots (duped by the promises of King Charles I overseen by the Jesuits “who keep no faith with heretics”) in 1650, if the risen Son of God melted the river of ice and drowned the French army of Louis XIV when he sought to invade the Protestant Dutch Republic in 1672, if the risen Son of God gave the righteous and daring General George Patton (America’s greatest General who, while occupying Berlin, publicly rebuked his soldiers in formation and at attention, calling them “pigs” for fornicating with the conquered German women according to a personal friend of the author who was there, Sgt. Harry Boyer) the victory at the Battle of the Bulge in 1945, He can save us from our enemies in the year of our Lord 2003. May you receive the same encouraging reply from God your Father as you ask in Jesus’ name to be led by His Holy Spirit while resisting the Devil’s Jesuit tyranny in Washington, D.C. and the coming foreign invasion of our great land, remembering:
“The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.”
– James 5:16
The righteous man Martin Luther, so hated by Ignatius Loyola, declared:
“If you meddle with popedom [the temporal power of the earthly kingdom
of the Pope], you will have the whole world against you.” {11}
Therefore he prayed:
“I know You are our Father and our God; and therefore, I am sure You will bring to naught the persecutors of Your children. For if You fail to do this, Your own cause, being connected with ours, would be endangered. It is entirely Your own concern. We, by Your providence, have been compelled to take a part. You, therefore, will be our defense.” {12}[Emphasis added]
My elect brethren and serious seekers of the one true God, may we do the same. I bid you farewell until we meet in the air, in the presence of the risen and righteous Son of God in Whom alone is the love of God and to Whom alone has been given all Spiritual Power and Temporal Power – all authority and jurisdiction – in Heaven and in Earth,
Yeshua the Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ.



Conclusion 697
Upon His return, He will chain and imprison the Devil, and cast the White, resurrected, Gentile Papal Caesar – the beastly Antichrist – alive into the Lake of Fire, along with the Jewish False Prophet. Having executed the risen Pope’s murderous Gentile dictators, along with the leading Jewish Zionist and Talmudic Orthodox traitors having conspired with the Antichrist to mercilessly destroy His beloved Hebrew People of Israel, Jesus the Messiah shall sit upon the royal Throne of David and rule the Fifth World Monarchy, as spoken of by Daniel the prophet, on top of Mount Zion from His Millennial Temple in Jerusalem, forever!
“ . . . for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.”
– Micah 5:4
With His surviving elect remnant, the repentant sheep of the House of Israel His national and racial brethren, called “Hebrews” by God and “Jews” by men, all with circumcised hearts as foretold by Ezekiel the prophet – gathered around Him,
“ . . . they shall look upon me whom they have pierced . . . ”
and shall ask:
“What are these wounds in thine hands?”
Their Savior and Messiah, the Lord of Hosts, shall reply in forgiving love,
“Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.”
– Zechariah 12:10; 13:6
In conclusion, my elect brethren, may we Bible-believing Americans, upon the repentance and confession of any Vatican Assassin, forgive him. For our President John F. Kennedy, like Jesus the Anointed One, was also wounded in the house of his friends, many of whom in following orders, knew not what they did.
And finally when our government, in doing its duty of punishing evil, will have expelled that foreign army of the Papal Roman Caesar presently ruling the world that Militia of the Black Pope within America’s borders controlling the Masonic/Islamic International Terrorist Network overseen by its International Intelligence Community with all of the world’s Military Industrial Complexes dedicated to the restoration of the Papal Roman Caesar’s Temporal Power around the world – that murderous, that treasonous, that diabolical serpent of Satan called The Society of Jesus ready to strike us in the heart with a foreign invasion, our Nation’s great, midnight Tragedy shall become our glorious, noonday Triumph!

John Fitzgerald Kennedy, 1917 – 1963 #205
Thirty-Fifth President of the United States of America, 1961 - 1963
“The American Century,” the Black Pope has ruled, Killing “usurpers” worldwide, those “liberals,” those “fools.” For resisting Rome’s Caesar, and his bold Temporal Power, I was shot down in Dallas, at half-past the hour. Forty-one years have passed, while my blood cries aloud, “Justice! Oh, Justice!” to earth’s highest cloud. Is there no champion, my cause to plead? To punish my killers, is there no need? The Temple’s moneychangers, I did chastise, The Cold War and “CIA,” I likewise despised. Just as the death of Messiah, who foreknew his ends,
My only son has been “wounded, in the house of my friends.”



Conclusion 699
John F. Kennedy, Jr., 1963 #206
“Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead
our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep,
through the blood of the everlasting covenant,
Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you
that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ;
to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.”
– Hebrews 13:20, 21

The author of Vatican Assassins highly recommends Michael Bunker’s: Swarms of Locusts: The Jesuit Attack on the Faith
“Even though the Jesuits exude vast influence and control in the areas of theology, education, recorded history and current media, it is still perplexing that virtually no literature exists exposing the Jesuit’s influence on mainline Protestantism. This is what makes Swarms of Locusts such a necessary book. In this work, the author uncovers forgotten history regarding the cooperative salvation theology of the Jesuits. The author then builds upon these historical truths and clearly exposes how the Jesuits (and their cooperative redemption theology) have permeated all denominations of the Protestant Church. From Cain to Charles [G.] Finney, this book historically connects-the-dots and undeniably proves that modern Protestantism has abandoned the Doctrines of Grace and embraced the doctrines of cooperative salvation.”
