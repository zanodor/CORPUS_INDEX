TECHNICAL NOTES
There is no transliteration system which is fully satisfactory for rendering terms originally written in Cyrillac, whether they be Russian, Altayic, or Mongolian. The system used here is that of the U.S. Board of Geographic Names, largely because of its comprehensiveness, its easy accessibility, and its frequent usage. Exceptions have been made, however, with terms which have come into English with a non-conforming spelling, as in the case of "Kiev," "Evenk," and "Saimaly-Tash." I have made exceptions in other cases where the expected transliteration would cause confusion in English. A case in point is the name for the Ket high god, here referred to as Es. Anyone working in scholarly materials relating to Eurasian geography quickly realizes that the English designation,"Central Asia," can be rendered in Russian in two forms, "Srednyaya Aziya" and "Tsentral 'naya Aziya," each with its own separate meanings in terms of physical and cultural geography. In this study I have tried to adhere to established precedents in Soviet archaeological literature. "Middle Asia" refers to present-day Turkmeniya, Uzbekistan, Tadzhikistan, and Kirgiziya; "Central Asia" refers to Kazakhstan and Mongolia. Parts of South Siberia are sometimes included by scholars in northern Central Asia. I will keep these geographical distinctions separate, however, and include in "South Siberia" the regions of present-day Gorno-Altayskaya A.O., Tuvinskaya ASSR (Tuva), Krasnoyarskiy Kray south of Krasnoyarsk (Minusinsk Basin), the Prebaykal (the cultural zone to the west of Lake Baykal), and the Transbaykal (the cultural zone to the east and southeast of Lake Baykal). In this study, "Early Nomads" refer to a specific cultural group within the larger Scytho-Siberian culture. The Early Nomads inhabited the region of South Siberia and northern Central Asia and can be identified by the eighth century B.C. When I refer to early nomads (lower case), I use the term generally to mean the earliest nomadic peoples of Eurasia, i.e. those who emerged with a mobile and stock-dependent economy by the beginning of the first millennium B.C. The illustrative material included at the end of the text is intended to clarify textual references to particular image types and to particular examples of artistic traditions.

CHAPTER ONE
THE RECONSTRUCTION OF SYMBOLIC SYSTEMS
About ten years ago I turned my attention to the image of the deer in the art of the early Eurasian nomads. The recurrence and transformations of that motif across the Eurasian Steppe and throughout most of the first millennium B.C. indicated its centrality within the nomads' symbolic systems. It therefore had to be equally central, I reasoned, to their mythic traditions. However, the more I attempted to fit those appearances into existing interpretative approaches, the more perplexing the image became. None of those theories seemed to fit. While they might have explained some aspects of the deer image, they offered only contradictions and even nonsense with regard to others. As I pursued the deer image both forward and backward in time and across South Siberia, Central Asia, and southern Ukraine and Russia, it gradually became apparent that the image was leading me in the direction of a mythic tradition substantially different from any which had hitherto been advanced. It was appearing too regularly within particular patterns to allow one to ascribe its formulation either to mere ornament or to convention. I began to understand this patterned ordering of images as symbolic systems which retraced in imagistic form the shifting outlines of a tradition of myth and belief. It became apparent that the image of the deer was the key to the understanding of the ecology of emerging and evolving cultures. Considered in this light, the image shifted from being a relatively static icon to being a sign of a process in which underlying belief systems were continually adapting to new circumstances. With these considerations in mind, I undertook the investigation which has led to this study.
A) THE PROBLEM
Across the taiga and tundra of Siberia, the outlines of ancient cultures are traced in thousands of rock carvings and paintings, in stony mounds, altars, and monumental stelae. These images and structures testify to mythic traditions reaching back millennia. They indicate the movement and change of culture, from steppe to taiga and tundra. Nowhere are
these inherited traditions richer than in South Siberia, the region com

2 THE RECONSTRUCTION OF SYMBOLIC SYSTEMS
prising present-day Gorno-Altayskaya Autonomous Oblast' (A.O.), Tuvinskaya A.O. (Tuva), Khakasskaya A.O., and the area around Lake Baykal. Within funerary and ritual complexes and from the dictionary of images carved and painted on rocky walls and burial slabs emerges a symbolic vocabulary which continues from the Neolithic down to the Bronze Age and from there into the age of the Early Nomads and the larger Scytho-Siberian world. That symbolic vocabulary is usually treated as a series of discrete objects and images dimly reflecting a mythic tradition related in some manner to what we know of modern shamanistic traditions or decipherable in terms of Indo-European myths. The discussion which follows takes another approach. It assumes that within the history of South Siberia images which recur together necessarily qualify the meaning invested in any single element; and that as those linked images are modified in space and time, they reveal the outlines of cultural change and the transformation of myth. Those linked images and their placement relative to each other, on rocky walls or within a funerary construct, function as symbolic systems. As deliberately organized elements of larger constructs, they carry a symbolic load reflective of a specific time but also reflective of the passage of time and the modification of myth. This book, therefore, is about the search for meaning in visual symbols where there are no texts to guide our inquiry. The symbols which will be the object of our attention are representational images of a particular kind: antlered deer, horned caprids and horses, panthers and tigers, wolves and bears, birds of prey and waterfowl, all rendered in forms both fantastic and realistic and frequently intertwined in acts of predation. These images were repeated over and over again in the art of the Scytho-Siberian culture-a culture which dominated the vast Eurasian Steppe and Forest-Steppe in the first millennium B.C. Individually and collectively, lodged within recurring patterns of relationships and traced over a period of several hundred years, these images effectively functioned as an elaborate semiotic system carried on the bodies of humans and their horses. The very continuity of images and of image relationships across the Scytho-Siberian world argues for the existence of a commonly-held mythic tradition as the basis of Scytho-Siberian artistic imagery. The imagery to which I refer constituted the essential elements of symbolic systems which continually reexpressed, reaffirmed, and reinterpreted a collective understanding of the nature of individual existence and of cosmic processes. At the center and source of those cosmic

processes appears a particular figure-female and deer-like, an image which gradually shifted in appearance as it was contradicted by the inflow of new cultural elements and as it was transformed to accommodate and absorb those contradictions. In her most ancient incarnation, she took the form of a monumental and unantlered elk (New World moose). Over centuries and even millennia, her representational form shifted to an antlered animal and then to an antlered but thoroughly syncretic form, until finally her animal aspect was eclipsed in the last centures before our era. Where the deer had once been the source of life and death, there emerged a female figure, enthroned and honored; she, also, gradually lost her sway, however, and was slowly reduced in power and in privilege. If the animal images of the Eurasian Scytho-Siberians effectively functioned as visual.symbolic systems, the fact remains that we know those images only as bits and pieces embellishing objects retrieved from the broken remains of burials. We know them as disjointed, disconnected, even physically crushed elements, their artificial isolation from each other obstructing the enterprise of decoding the meaning of their forms and of their patterned interrelationships. Reconstructing the complex arrangements of animal prey and predators is not simply a matter of fitting together pieces on the basis of a visually satisfying pattern or according to principles drawn by analogy from other, neighboring cultures. The reconstruction of symbolic systems undertaken here assumes that even in the absence of written texts, regularly recurring patterns of imagery over time reveal a logic and an evolving signification. Lacking written maps by which to trace the sense of the patterns, meaning may still be fathomed in the persistence and change of images and in the relationships of one visual image to another within the symbolic systems to which they are bound. Meaning thus emerges as an organic process with its own impulses toward variation, transformation, ambivalent negation, and resolution. As surely as within cultures clarified by writing, the load carried in pre-literate cultures by images joined together into patterned order is rooted in history and qualified by the mythic traditions and assumptions of the past. Thus the reconstruction of symbolic systems involves a subtle dialogue between cultural history revealed through archaeologically and ethnographically retrieved materials and the deciphering of the import of change within visual symbolic systems. On one level, then, this book is about the reconstruction of symbolic systems. Central to that inquiry is the reconstruction of meaning lodged

4 THE RECONSTRUCTION OF SYMBOLIC SYSTEMS
in a single image, that of the deer of the Early Nomads of South Siberia and thus of one of the principle Scytho-Siberian cultures. The image of antlered animal elaborated in gold, wood, felt, fur, and stone was at the very heart of the mass of images with which the Early Nomads embellished their dead and the horses of the dead in preparation for the journey to another realm. The deer was not, certainly, the only significant image within the art of the Early Nomads. Like their cousins across the Eurasian Steppe-the Scythians, the Sakas, the Tagar peoples, or those who inhabited the grasslands of Mongolia-the Early Nomads bracketed the image of the deer with feline and wolf-like predators, with eagles and griffinated eagles. They dissolved the antlers of the deer into bird heads, transformed its head into that of a great, beaked animal, or even melted its body into a half-deer, half horse shape. At times they simply dismissed the image, substituting that of an elk or of a horned caprid: sheep, or goat. Throughout that first millennium B.C. and throughout the nomadic hegemony of Eurasia, however, the art of the Early Nomads was dominated by the image of the deer. Isolated or as a part of complex zoomorphic references, the image of the deer is the ultimate key to understanding Early Nomadic culture and that of the larger ScythoSiberian world. The image of the deer of the Early Nomads did not spring fresh and whole with the appearance of these people. It was rooted deep in the prehistory of South Siberia, going back as far as the Neolithic period. When t11e Early Nomads inherited the motif, it had already undergone enormous iconic and symbolic shifts. It had become laden with the interwoven symbolism of cultures in fundamental economic transition. Having emerged within a forest-bound hunting economy and having adapted to the requirements of a new Bronze Age pastoralism, the motif was finally incorporated into the stock dependent economy of the early Iron Age. By then the deer image had come to function as an elaborate text of condensed beliefs and myths. In its articulation in gold, bronze, or carved wood and in its gradual disintegration and replacement, the deer image serves as a key to reading history and myth. This book, then, cannot only be about the deer image or about the reconstruction of the Early Nomads' symbolic systems. It is necessarily about the prehistory of South Siberia as well and about mythic traditions as they are revealed in petroglyphs, in ritual and funerary structures, and in monolithic stone images.

THE RECONSTRUCTION OF SYMBOLIC SYSTEMS 5
B. THE BACKGROUND: PEOPLE, LAND, AND CULTURES
The Early Nomads were the South Siberian branch of the ScythoSiberian culture. In the first millennium B.C., this culture controlled the vast steppe and mountainous regions between China to the east, Persia and Greece to the west, and north to the edge of the Siberian Taiga. The Early Nomads were centered in the region of present-day GornoAltayskaya A.O.. The designation, "Early Nomads," however, has often been used to include all the contemporary nomadic and semi-nomadic peoples of South Siberia. The names by which this broad cultural grouping was divided varies depending on the scholarly approach to the archaeology of South Siberia between the eighth and first centuries B.C. Thus, the Early Nomadic culture of the northern Allay Mountains is frequently divided into the Mayemir (seventh - sixth centuries) and Pazyryk (sixth - first centuries) cultures. 1 The contemporary culture of the Minusinsk Basin is known as the Tagar culture. It emerged at some time in the first third of the first millennium B.C. and was succeeded at the end of the millennium by the Tashtyk culture (Kiselev 1951; Kyzlasov 1960, 1979). Within Tuva, those cultures within the Yenisey drainage and contemporary with the Tagar and Pazyryk cultures are frequently referred to as Aldi-Bel' and Saglin while that in the more southern part of the region and extending into present-day northern Mongolia is usually known as Uyuk (Grach 1980; Volkov 1967). 2 For the sake of clarity, the general term, Early Nomads, will be used throughout this book to refer to the Scytho-Siberians located in South Siberia and in parts of northern Mongolia, while regional cultural designations will be used as appropriate. By virtue of their economy and art, the Early Nomads were close cousins of the Sakas of Kazakhstan, who with their successors, the Wusun, dominated eastern Kazakhstan between the eighth and first centuries B.C (K.A. Akishev and Kushayev 1963; K.A. Akishev 1973, 1978; Bernshtam 1952; Vishnevskaya 1973). Further to the west, the Massagetae controlled the region between the Caspian and Aral seas. Although the archaeological picture of these people is unclear, Herodotus has left a vivid account of how under the leadership of their queen, Tomyris, the Massagetae fought and defeated the armies of Cyrus of Persia and in the process killed the ruler himself ( Herodotus [1954]: Bk. I). To the north

of the Massagetae, the Sauromatians dominated the steppe between the Volga and Ural mountains from the middle of the millennium to its end (Smirnov 1964). The most western of the Early Nomads' relatives and those most familiar to the modern observer were the Scythians. They are believed to have arrived in the lands of the Caucasus, the Crimea, and the rich steppe north of the Black Sea by the sixth century B.C. The Scythians claimed a major portion of The Histories of Herodotus by driving the armies of Darius out of their territory. By virtue of that account and because of the pictorial realism of the goldwork found in Scythian burials, we have a clearer picture of these people than of any of their Scytho-Siberian cousins. Perhaps because of that relative clarity, there is a frequent tendency to apply the specific term "Scythian" to all the related groups across the Eurasian Steppe. Throughout this book, however, the term Scythian will be used only in reference to those ScythoSiberians who inhabited the Crimea and the steppe region north and east of the Black Sea-that region formerly known as "Scythia" (Artamonov 1969; Minns [1913] 1971; Rostovtsev 1922). In the late years of the first millennium B.C., the successors to the Early Nomads and Sakas served as the vehicles for the transformation of Eurasian nomadism into statehood. The Xiongnu of Mongolia gathered an array of nomadic peoples together into a confederation which became the major geopolitical opponent of the Chinese Han Dynasty. In the same period, the second and first centuries B .C., the Yuezhi established hegemony over the vital steppe region west of the borders of Han China and extending through Bactria to the borders of India. Indeed, after their conversion to Buddhism, the Yuezhi-by then known as the Kushans-proceeded to conquer India and to establish the great Kushan Dynasty. Despite these political transformations and despite significant distinctions in language and physical anthropology between the Xiongnu and their Early Nomadic relatives, they as well as the Yuezhi/Kushans may properly be considered to have belonged to the larger Scytho-• Siberian culture. All the members of this larger grouping shared to varying degree a dependency on herd animals-primarily sheep and cattle, secondarily horses, goats, yaks, reindeer, and camels, according to the specific conditions of any given region. All-with the exception., perhaps, of the Tagar culture-were skillful horsemen and known for their skill by the settled peoples to the south. Cultural cohesion throughout the Scytho-Siberian world is attested to by a common weapon typology involving daggers, knives, short and long swords, the three••

winged arrowhead, a modified form ofgorytus, and three-holed cheekpieces and jointed canon (horse bits). No less common across the ScythoSiberian world was the mirror, either of the Chinese type with a central knob handle, or of the long-handled Greek type. 3 Finally, the art of all the Scytho-Siberian groups was founded upon a particular style and upon a particular zoomorphic vocabulary which affirm a certain commonality of taste and of mythic traditions. Across the Eurasian Steppe, by varying degree and depending on climate and the character of the land, the Scytho-Siberians added to their pastoral economy a reliance on the cultivation of grains as well as a reliance on hunting and fishing. Chance finds and burials have revealed tools and weapons appropriate to these economies. The remains of furs, woven fabrics, felt, and grains have also been found within those Altay burials which were flooded and frozen. The mixed economic system indicates that the term generally used to describe these people, "nomads," is not really accurate. While groups like the Scythians had presumably traveled a great distance from a homeland in South Siberia or Central Asia, once they arrived in the region of the Black Sea they turned to the cultivation of grain as well as to fishing and stockraising. Herodotus refers to the "agricultural Scythian tribes, growing grain not for food but for export..." He distinguishes them from Alizones and a "Graeco-Scythian tribe" called the Callipidae, in the region west of the mouth of the Dnieper. Both these groups "resemble the Scythians in their way oflife, and also grow grain for food, as well as onions, leeks, lentils, and millet" (Herodotus [1954]: 248). Most of the other Scytho-Siberians practised transhumance rather than true nomadizing. The nomads living in proximity to the Pamir, Tyan-Shan, Altay, and Sayan mountain ranges probably lived as people do today in those regions. During the winter months they inhabited relatively stable settlements in protected valleys. They may well have lived in solid log and plank structures such as those preserved in the case of the Pazyryk burials (Rudenko 1970). In spring, the nomads would begin to move their animals up the slopes to alpine pastures where they would stay until the beginning of fall. During that period of the year, they almost certainly lived in portable yurt-like structures. In this respect, the lives of the Early Nomads and of the Sakas may have closely resembled those described for modern pastoralists of
3 Within the archaeological sites of the South Siberian and northern Mongolian nomadic cultures have been found several object types for which there are known Chinese parallels. These include, for example, a bronze yoke-shaped object similar to the Chinese pang but of unknown function.

the Altay, Tuva (Vaynshteyn 1980), and Mongolia. The petroglyphs at the Great Boyar cliff from the Minusinsk Basin, dating to the late Tagar or Tashtyk culture, include scenes of herdsmen, yurt-like structures, and more solid log structures (Devlet 1976). Among almost all the Scytho-Siberian groups, burial within a wooden chamber under a stone or earthen barrow (kurgan) was the general rule, although even here one finds variations which may reflect the time of year of death or the nature of the soil in a specific area. In Tuva, for example, the frequent appearance of simple burials above ground but under a stone mound suggests that death took place when the ground was frozen. The frozen burials at Pazyryk demonstrate how the burial chamber could be as large, sturdy, and elaborately furnished as a regular dwelling. While these burials certainly refer to the way of life of wealthy members of Scytho-Siberian society, they also point to a general truth: that the Scytho-Siberians went to death within structures which replicated the dwellings of the living and were equipped with the utilitarian objects, the dress, the food, the furniture and even the horses they would presumably need in another world. The composition of burials also indicates a belief that in some manner the realm to which the dead departed must mirror that of the living. Although individual burials were common, it was equally common for several individuals to be laid out in the same burial chamber, together with their ornaments, their tools, their weapons, and their household vessels. The number of paired burials is particularly striking. Although the five large barrows at Pazyryk were plundered and some of the bodies may have been removed, it seems as if almost all those burials were originally paired, including adult males and females. The Ulandryk burials, also, were often if not always paired (Kubarev 1987a). In other cases one finds burials which seem to reflect nuclear families or lineages .. In the Saglin culture of Tuva, burial chambers might contain from three: to five bodies. The combination of adults and children suggest the members of a family or limited lineage group. Presumably the buria!l chamber was only temporarily covered until a whole family unit, or a part thereof, had been laid to rest (Grach 1980). Similarly reflective of possible family groupings are the burials in the Ulangom cemetery of western Mongolia, dated between the fifth and third centuries B.C. Here, also, it is probable that the bodies of specific lineage groups would be gradually added over time (Novgorodova 1989: 257-315). The repeated appearance of such paired or multiple burials raises the possibility that the "secondary" individual was killed in order to be

THE RECONSTRUCTION OF SYMBOLIC SYSTEMS 9
buried with the primary individual. In the case of double or triple burials involving mixed sexes, the general assumption has tended to be that it must have been the male who died first and then was buried with the body of the murdered female. This has been, for example, the assumption regarding the paired burials at Pazyryk: that the male must have died first and been buried with his consort as well as with his finest horses and belongings. Such pairing was not necessarily dependent, however, on the murder of one individual. It could have been acheived by the same methods which appear more clearly in the Saglin or Tagar burials. There the burial chambers were loosely closed or covered until they had been filled. In some Tagar multiple burials, the bones of the dead had evidently been cleaned and the skeletons disarticulated in order to allow the deposition of many remains in one crypt over an extended period of time (Kiselev 1951; Martynov 1979). Even in such a case as that of the eighth century B.C. burial at Arzhan, Tuva, where several individuals were buried, self-immolation rather than sacrifice may have been the case (Gryaznov 1980: 45-46). Among the Scythians, the principal individuals among the dead seem to have been connected in some significant manner: a male and female pair or even a number offemales suggestive of a particular group of priestesses. Here, as among the Early Nomads, it is possible that the burials would be incompletely closed until they could be filled with the bodies of related individuals. Occasionally the arrangement and combination of bodies strongly points to the killing of retainers at the time of the death of the master or mistress. A case in point may be found in the great "royal" burials at Chertomlyk and Kul Oba. In the case of paired burials of males and females-as at Kul Oba-the general assumption has been that the woman as wife or concubine was killed at the time of her husband's death, presumably to accompany him to the next world. But absent the traces of mortal wounds, one may not conclude that the males died earlier than did their female companions. Indeed, barring death in warfare (which has certainly been attested to, as in the cemetery of Ulangom), the rigors of childbirth would have dictated that females could well have died earlier than males. To date, no one has yet proposed that the male of the pair would be sacrificed at the time of the female's death.4
4 Despite the Scytho-Siberians' reputation in the non-nomadic world for ferocity, there are only a few instances which seem to refer to human sacrifice accompanying the primary dead. This has been attested, for example, in a few collective burials of the Tagar culture (Martynov 1979).

10 THE RECONSTRUCTION OF SYMBOLIC SYSTEMS
Throughout the world of the Scytho-Siberians, the most spectacular indicators of cultural continuity may be found in habits of dress and ornamentation. In the frozen Altay burials of Pazyryk, in the gold ·representations of Scythians from Scythian burials in the South Russian Steppe (e.g., Piotrovsky 1987: pis. 118, 126, 128-129, 184-187), in the intact Saka burial at Issyk (K. A. Akishev 1978), and in the late Yuezhi burials at Tillya-Tepe (Sarianidi 1985, 1989) a mode of dress which was common throughout the nomadic world of the Eurasian Steppe is attested to. Males wore clothing appropriate for horse-back riding: soft, close-fitting pants and boots and a belted short jacket. Their headware usually took the form of a soft, peaked hood. Women seem to have worn long robes, close-fitting over the bodice, and tall headdresses of somewhat varying shape, although in some instances their hair was piled up on their heads on a bone framework and ornamented. The men and women buried at Issyk and Tillya-Tepe confirm what has been repeatedly indicated in the gold representations of Scythians: that the clothing of the Scythe-Siberians was covered with sewn-on gold plaques ornamented with the images of animals, of people, or of purely decorative elements. The frozen burials at Ulandryk in Gorno-Altayskaya A.O. further testify that at least in death even non-aristocratic members of Early Nomadic society wore their hair in an elaborate mounding, secured by gold covered carved ornaments and hairpins (Kubarev 1987a). The most obvious and distinctive common denominator of ScythoSiberian culture, however, is its so-called "animal style," a tradition of symbolic representation and ornamentation in which the zoomorphic image is paramount. In burials early disrupted by robbers, such as that. at Arzhan, remaining bronze objects include a magnificent coiled feline (pl. Ila) and poletops in the shape of powerful, stylized mountain sheep. In the plundered burial at Tuekta in the northern Altay, Rudenko found an abundance of beautiful wooden carvings of felines, eagle-griffins, elk, and plant-like forms (e.g., pl. Ilb - e). Originally these images were probably covered with gold. They ornamented horse bridles, chestguards,. and saddles. The five large barrows of Pazyryk reaffirm the domination of zoomorphic representations. Despite the fact that all five burials had been plundered shortly after they were completed, the remains of horse regalia, of human dress and ornament, and of the furnishings of the burial chambers themselves were extensive. Shabracks were also ornamented with animal imagery. In some cases, the horses carried masks or crests. The men and women buried at Pazyryk wore robes and headdresses of fur, leather, felt, and gold, all ornamented with deer heads, saiga heads,

and birds. The jewelry they wore was most certainly torn from their bodies by the individuals who broke into the burials shortly after they were sealed. That jewelry must have carried abundant zoomorphic references. It is possible that the objects taken by the robbers were similar in size and richness to the great gold plaques preserved in the Siberian Treasure of Peter the Great (Rudenko 1962). But the wealth found in the Pazyryk and Scythian burials was shared to some extent by commoners. Burial remains at Ulandryk and Tashanta, in eastern GornoAltayskaya A.O., indicate that even these members of Early Nomadic society wore neck bands and armlets which were painted or covered with gold and which carried symmetrically arranged images of deer, caprids, birds, and feline or wolf-like predators. Within Early Nomadic burials, simple furnishings were also ornamented with zoomorphic elements: a table, for example, from Pazyryk 2 was fitted with legs carved in the shape of rampant feline caryatids (Rudenko 1970: pis .. 50, 51). At Pazyryk and at the later Early Nomadic burial of Bashadar, even the coffins were embellished with animal imagery. The Bashadar coffin is especially interesting in this respect. It was carved out of a single larch log and its outer sides were carved with a row of standing tigers distinguished by their huge jaws and claws. Under the feet of some of the tigers and in proximity to their jaws are the images of sheep, boar, and saiga antelope or female elk, crushed or twisted under the weight of the cats ( Rudenko 1960: fig. 21). The impression of humans wrapped in animal references wrought in gold is fully confirmed by the single intact burial of Issyk in the Tyan-Shan Mountains, and the gold jewelry and gold swords of Scythian burials confirm that even on the borders of the Hellenic world, animal imagery was considerably more important than human or foliate references down to the fourth century B.C. Crowning and centering this zoomorphic pantheon were images of deer, rams, coiled or crouched felines, birds of prey, and wolves. Juxtaposed and intertwined, these images were most often organized to represent scenes of animal predation: wolves, felines, or birds as predators, and deer, caprids, and horses as prey. Varying in specific elements of style, the repetition of these images on clothing, shields, weapons, utilitarian household objects and horse regalia asserts more clearly than any other cultural tradition a common belief system and set of values binding the Scytho-Siberian world from the borders of China to the borders of Persia and Greece. The apparently rootless, restless, horseborn life of the Scytho-Siberians allowed ancient observers such as Herodotus and Sima Qian to conclude that they were innately ferocious,

predatory barbarians; but for the modern observer, it is probably the representations of animals and of animal predation which perpetuated that reputation and elevated it into myth. The general continuity of Scytho-Siberian culture across the Eurasian Steppe may also suggest a continuity of ethnicity, but that conclusion would be incorrect. Both contemporaneous representations and craniological evidence indicate that the Scythians and Sakas were Europoid in racial stock; it is generally assumed, also, that they were Iranian in language.5 This assumption is supported by the numerous representations of nomads which have come out of the Scythian burials, as well as by representations of nomads in such Central Asian materials as the socalled Treasure of the Oxus (Dalton 1964). On the fine gold cup from Kul Oba, for example, or in the figures of Scythians adorning the Tolstaya Mogila pectoral, the Scythians represented in attentive interaction define the male physical type one finds on materials from the royal burials (Piotrovsky 1987: pis. 121, 184-187). The men were stocky and powerfully built. Their hair was long and often wavy, their beards full. They seem to have had prominent, straight noses and deep-set eyes. Unfortunately, no such visually descriptive images of Scythian women are available. The Sakas seem to have been similar in appearance to the Scythian men, although with perhaps more prominent noses (cf. Jettmar 1967: pl. 30). The picture of the Early Nomads is much less clear; or, rather, the population of South Siberia seems to have been considerably more mixed in racial stock. There are only a few human representations which have been preserved and almost all come from the Pazyryk burials. The most famous is certainly that of the fine horseman repeated several times across the large felt hanging from Pazyryk 5 (pl. Via). The individual has short curly black hair, a fine curling mustache, and a prominent nose. In general, the physical type represented here in stylized form is similar to some of the faces preserved on plaques which had ornamented the tenth bridle of Pazyryk 1 (Rudenko 1970: pis. 91-92) and to the figures found on the anecdotal plaques from the Siberian Treasure of Peter the Great (pl. VIIb). All the faces on the carved plaques have thick, curly hair and beards. Beyond that, the facial types vary between several which are wide and flat and one which seems to be more Europoid in type. This variation in facial type accords with the apparent variation in craniologi

cal indications from Pazyryk and other Altay barrows of the early Iron Age. Although there was a strong Europoid element in the population of the Early Nomads, there appears, also, to have been a clear Mongoloid element (Rudenko 1970: 45-53). Evidence for a mixed population has been confirmed in broader studies of early Iron Age materials from Siberia and Mongolia. These studies indicate that during the ScythoSiberian period, Mongoloid peoples spread to the west and mixed with the dominant Europoid type in South Siberia and Central Asia (Alekseyev and Gochman [Gokhman] 1983: 37-60). The very complexity and mixing of populations evident in craniological studies to date urges us to exercise extreme caution in assuming linkages between physical type, language, and culture. South Siberian in origin, the Early Nomads emerged out of a succession of cultural traditions which reached back through the Bronze Age to the Neolithic period. Those traditions were not simply Siberian in derivation: there is overwhelming evidence that early Iron Age South Siberia was the culmination of a long-evolving and complex interweaving of autochthonous Siberian cultures with other cultures which came into South Siberia from northern Central Asia, from the west and from the southwest. For over two thousand years these influxes resulted in the recurring mixing of Europoid and Mongoloid racial stocks and of their cultures. Furthermore, most of the cultures which preceded the Early Nomads in South Siberia may be identified with a distinctive tradition of artistic expression. It is this cumulative tradition which must form the basis of any inquiry into the reconstruction of the Early Nomads' symbolic systems. The homeland of the Early Nomads may be visualized as a triad of shallow bowls joined at the Sayan-Altay Ridge. One bowl slopes northwards into the Minusinsk Valley, bisected by the northwardflowing Yenisey River. Another falls to the west of the first, cradled by the Sayan Ridge on its east, by the high Altay Mountains on its south, and open on the north to the plain of Central Siberia. The third bowl slopes southeast to encompass northern Mongolia, abutted on the east by the valley of the Selenge River and its Transbaykal extension, the Selenga. Over the millennia, cultures from the north, southeast, southwest, and west were continually sliding into those bowls in overlapping layers, jostling others up and over the sides. Ultimately it was the pastoral nomadic culture of the Early Nomads which emerged as the dominant tradition, leaving its imprint of stock-dependency north and south of the Altay-Sayan Ridge and throughout northern Mongolia.

significance of this region in the history of Bronze and Iron Age Eurasia is underlined when one recalls that the grasslands of Mongolia also spawned the successors to the Early Nomads, the Turkic and Mongoll cultures of the first and early second millennia A.D. Although they are outside the scope of this study, both cultures again demonstrate how the South Siberian-Mongolian region functioned for thousands of years as a cultural vortex and eruptive point, within which traditions from Siberia's forest-bound North met and merged with traditions moving out from the vast Central Asian Steppe of grass and desert. 6 The images exploited by the Early Nomads were rooted in an ancient pantheon first carved and painted on the cliffs over the great Siberian rivers. This tradition will be examined in more detail in Chapter IV. It was concentrated in the region of the upper Tom', Yenisey, Angara, and Lena rivers with extensions south into the Katun' Valley of GornoAltayskaya A.O. Here it should be noted that its most important image was that of the female elk: a figure often represented in monumental size, or at least with a realism and power which was monumental in aspect. During the Baykal Neolithic period a tradition of locating sacrificial sites at the base of cliffs, in what are believed to be sacred places, was also established (Okladnikov 1950; Tivanenko 1989). The Early Nomads also inherited an ancient tradition of metalworking, one which went back to the earliest copper-working culture of South Siberia, the Afanasevo. Dated between 2500 - 1500 B.C., the Afanasevo culture was centered in the Minusinsk Valley, with significant extensions southwest to the Altay and west to the steppes north of the Aral Sea and as far as the northeast shores of the Caspian. Because the Afanasevo people belonged to a Europoid racial type, there has been a predisposition to associate them with a Proto-lndo-European tradition (Gryaznov 1969: 51; Kyzlasov 1986). The investigations of physical anthropologists over the last few decades, however, should give one pause: throughout its South Siberian range, the Afanasevo culture appears to have been carried by a population of mixed Europoid and Mongoloid stock (Alekseyev and Gochman [Gokhman] 1983: 33). Afanasevo was a culture in transition from a hunting economy to a pastoral economy. The population lived in small groups and depended on wild animals, fish, and stock animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, and
6 The region described here is somewhat broader than that included in the two best known sources on the pre- and early history of South Siberia, those of Gryaznov (1969: 9-13) and Kiselev (1951). The latter, however, briefly includes Central Asia in his introduction to a consideration of the "Hunnish-Sarmatian" period.

horses for meat. Afanasevo burial structures seem to have established the beginnings of the South Siberian tradition of using logs, stone slabs, and mounds to construct the burial chamber and to mark it on the surface of the ground. Within the Minusinsk Valley, Afanasevo graves took the form of subterranean pits roofed by a layer of logs and surmounted by an earthen mound sometimes covered with a layer of stone slabs. The burials would frequently contain several individuals as well as simple furnishings. A tall wall of slabs would be used to surround the mound. In the Altay, a similar treatment of the surface would occur, but the burial pit would frequently be constructed from carefully worked thin slabs of stone and was intended for individual burials, several of which would be marked on the surface by a single mound (Gryaznov 1969: 46-48; Kubarev 1988). The artistic legacy of the Afanasevo culture thus includes the building of surface mounds faced in some manner by stones or slabs. Beyond this, however, that legacy is confused by a number of issues contingent on as-yet unascertainable theories: the date of great carved monoliths found within the Minusinsk Basin; the dating of the earliest images of carts found on those monoliths; the question of the exact relationship of the Afanasevo culture to the Proto-Indo-European Yamna culture of western Siberia. Within the Minusinsk Basin, the Okunev culture succeeded the Afanasevo culture by the early second millennium B.C. In contrast to the Afanasevo, the Okunev people were Mongoloid of the Central Asian type (Gryaznov 1969: 51). Burial pits were made of carefully sized stone slabs laid horizontally to build up the walls. They were roofed at ground level by other stone slabs. The most significant art form associated with the Okunev culture are the huge monoliths carved with a variety of quasianthropomorphic images and animal masks (Vadetskaya, Leont'ev, and Maksimenkov 1980).7 These sculptured stones will be discussed later in this book. For the moment it may be said that within a series of cultures which used stone extensively in the construction of mortuary and ritual sites, the Minusinsk stones are remarkable for being the earliest carved monoliths in South Siberia. Furthermore, the images on their facesboth two and three-dimensional-establish a tradition of representing masks which lie between the animal and the human in aspect.
7 There is still no general agreement regarding the dating of these monumental sculptures, although most scholars do accept the Okunev date. Kiselev assigned them to the Karasuk period (Kiselev 1951). Gryaznov, also, first believed they were Karasuk in date, but later put them back to the Andronovo (Gryaznov 1950a). Most recently, Kyzlasov has made a forceful argument for assigning them to the culture he calls Tazmin, preceeding both Afanasevo and Okunev in the Minusinsk Basin (Kyzlasov 1986).

16 THE RECONSTRUCTION OF SYMBOLIC SYSTEMS
By the middle of the second millennium, the Okunev culture in the Minusinsk Basin was confronted by a new and fully Bronze Age culture, the Andronovo. Most scholars consider the Andronovo to have been the eastern extension of the Timber-grave (Shrubnaya) culture, which was centered in the lower Volga Basin and stretched southwest from there to the shores of the Black Sea. 8 The Timber-grave and Andronovo cultures are also related to the Tazabag'jab culture located east and south of the Aral Sea (Chernikov 1960). Whether or not the center of Andronovo was in the region of Lake Zaysan, in eastern Kazakhstan, its eastern boundary was in the area of the upper Yenisey. Andronovo sites have been found extensively between the Yenisey and the Ob rivers, but none have been found either in Tuva or in Gorno-Altayskaya A.O. The high level of Andronovo bronze technology has been indicated by knives, awls, spear heads, celts and needles found in Andronovo graves. Depending on the abundance of pasture in any particular region, this culture practiced both cultivation and stock-breeding. Sheep and cattle seem to have been particularly important, with sheep, cattle, and horses used for food as well as for the sacrificial joints of meat placed in the graves of the dead. The great majority of Andronovo burials appear to have been individual. Typically, interment would be in stone chambers in the center of a circular or rectangular area, bordered by a stone "wall." More rarely in the Yenisey region but commonly in the region of the Ob, burial chambers were constructed of stout logs. The chambers would be covered by an earthen mound bordered by stones (Maksimenkov 1978). In the use of wooden chambers and mounds, the Andronovo is obviously related to the Timber-grave culture of Eastern Europe, as well as to the later Scytho-Siberian culture. On the other hand, the cart burials associated with Timber-grave sites west and east of the Urals (Piggott 1975) are not repeated in any known Andronovo burials: neither the imprint of carts and wheels nor the bronze remains of wheels and axles have been attested to. Only to the west, in the region between the Syr-Dar'ya and Amu-Dar' ya and in the region north of the Aral Sea, where the Andronovo culture mixed with the Timber-Grave culture to the west and with the Abeshevo and Gorbunovo cultures in the Urals, do finds of bone psalia indicate the beginnings of the use of horses for riding and hauling
8 The Timber-grave people are considered by Gimbutas and others to have been "prot<~Scythians," predecessors of the Scythians of the early Iron Age (Gimbutas 1965: 576-577). By contrast, Terenozhkin believes that the Scythians were not related to the Timber-grave culture; rather, they arrived in the Pontic region from somewhere "in the depths of Asia," sometime around the eighth century B.C., bringing with them the bronze and iron implements and weapons from the Karasuk tradition (Terenozhkin 1975).

THE RECONSTRUCTION OF SYMBOLIC SYSTEMS 17
sometime between the twelfth and ninth centuries B.C. (Chernikov 1960). The succession of Afanasevo and Okunev cultures in the Minusinsk Basin functioned as an alternating overlay of Europoid and Mongoloid populations. This pattern of ethnic overlay seems to have characterized much of the prehistory of South Siberia and northern Central Asia. It was repeated when the Andronovo culture was displaced by the Karasuk culture in the second half of the second millennium B.C. As in the case of the Okunev culture, the center ofKarasuk was located in the Minusinsk and Kuznetsk valleys, with extensions indicated into Mongolia and as far as the region of the Syr Dar'ya in south-central Kazakhstan. The Karasuk culture is most noted for its bronze technology, with the sophisticated shaping of knives and daggers and the elaboration of handles and butts displaying an invigorated sense of ornament. Many of these objects display incised and openwork motifs reminiscent of the geometric decor on Andronovo pottery. A number of weapons are crowned by horse or deer-headed terminals, or with the representation of standing animals. On the basis of these weapon types and their ornamentation, Kiselev has argued that the origins of the Karasuk culture lay somewhere in the south, in association with the Northern Bronze culture contemporary with, but distinguished from, the culture of Shang China (Kiselev 1951; Lin 1982).9 On the other hand, significant parallelism can also be found between the zoomorphic and geometric ornamentation of Karasuk bronze daggers and knives and those of the Sejma-Turbino bronze industry (ca. 1500- 800 B.C.) in the North Russian region of the Kama Basin (Gimbutas 1965; Sulimirski 1970a). Similarities in tool and weapon typology and in zoomorphic and geometric ornamentation connecting such farflung regions as the northern Urals, South Siberia, and northern China argue for vital trade and for the movement of peoples carrying bronze technology and their artistic taste throughout the second half of the second millennium B.C. Karasuk mortuary structures and ritual varied according to local culture, but typically they took the form of a stone-lined or simple earthen pit, the roof of which was level with the surface of the ground and then covered by a small mound. Several burials would be found within a usually rectangular enclosure formed by upright stone slabs. In
9 Gryaznov ignores the obvious relationship between the bronzes of the Karasuk and Northern Bronze culture, as well as the related issue of the derivation of the Karasuk people. Sulimirski, following Chlenova, finds the argument for Karasuk origins in the region of the Tyan-Shan to be convincing (Sulimirski 1970a: 308).

18 THE RECONSTRUCTION OF SYMBOLIC SYSTEMS
the large cemetery of Malye Kopeny 3 in the Minusinsk Valley, dated to the late Karasuk period, a number of burial chambers were located individually within the center of round enclosures, at one side of which might be an "entrance" (Zyablin 1977). In so far as the usually disrupted burials indicate, furnishings were modest, limited to a few joints of meat (sheep, cattle, rarely horses), a single pottery vessel, and a bronze knife. Such furnishings were accorded all dead, male and female, adult and children. The high quality of the rounded and ornamented Karasuk pottery suggested to Kiselev that, like the Andronovo, the Karasuk people were stock-breeders who moved within only a relatively circumscribed area (Kiselev 1951: 159). 10 The general aspect of Karasuk society is that of a peaceful, stock-dependent culture, in which there are almost no signs either of hunting tools or of weapons. Sheep were the most frequent source of meat, cattle were used for traction and possibly functioned prominently in rituals. Horses were used only for food (Zyablin 1977: 33-38; Kiselev 1951: 161-170). There is no clear division between the Karasuk culture and its successor in the Minusinsk Basin, the Tagar culture. By the eighth century B.C., variations in burial ritual, in bronze technology, and in weapon typology indicate the emergence of that culture, contemporaneous with and artistically related to the culture of the Early Nomads. The very large number of bronze plaques in the shape of standing or recumbent deer indicates the pre-eminent position of that image, while the typology and ornamentation of Tagar mirrors, plaques, and animalcrowned pole-tops affirm the underlying unity of object and image within nomadic culture all across the Eurasian Steppe. Of the fate of the people who created the Karasuk-Tagar culture, little is known. Tagar archaeological remains indicate that the culture disappeared by the late: first millennium B.C., pushed north-northwest out of the Minusinsk Basin by the influx of another more aggressive culture, most likely that of the Xiongnu ("Huns"). Those who fled to the north may well have been the ancestors of a remnant Yenisey group of peoples of which only the Ket survive. 11 They moved northwards along the Yenisey, carrying
10 Gryaznov has emphasized the increasing importance during the Karasuk of the family as the basic social unit; within that emerging social structure, he claims to find evidence of increasingly patriarchal values. However, in the cemetery of Malye Kop<;lny 3, one finds a striking evenness in the treatment of the mortuary context and in the distribution of burial goods. In only one burial out of 287 did the position of a young woman's body facing that of a large man suggest to the excavator of that site the possibility ofincreased male authority (Zyablin 1977: 19). 11 The other recorded members of this group were the Kot, Asan, and Arin (Jakobson 1957: 222; Pulleyblank 1963). This matter is discussed in Chapter VII.

THE RECONSTRUCTION OF SYMBOLIC SYSTEMS 19
in their mythic traditions elements which may clarify the overwhelming significance of the deer image within the iconographic tradition of the Tagar culture and of the Early Nomads of South Siberia. The history of Karasuk-Tagar culture and the association of Tagar zoomorphic imagery with that of contemporary nomadic cultures of Eurasia suggest that the zoomorphic imagery of the Scytho-Siberians may owe many of its stylistic characteristics to elements associated with Karasuk bronze ornamentation and with the related tradition of North China. These characteristics include the use of knife and dagger terminals in the form of stylized deer, elk, or homed animals. Antlered or horned, the animals were usually characterized by large, soft muzzles and a rounded, cellular treatment of the eyes and nostrils. The remains of inlay in bronze objects found in North China and associated with the styles of both the Northern Bronze culture and with Karasuk bronzes indicates that stone inlay was originally used to add coloristic emphasis to the eyes and ears of the animal headed terminals. 12 The Bronze Age of the northern Altay Mountains remains unclear, although recent archaeological excavations promise to change that situation. The early Bronze Age burials at Karakol have revealed a tradition of painting grave slabs with figures of quasi-animal, quasianthropomorphic aspect. These images suggest connections with the imagery of the Yenisey Valley to the north; they also suggest to some scholars possible connections with a cultural impulse coming from the Southeast. It is certain that a large number of the petroglyphs from the Chuya Valley in southeastern Gorno-Altayskaya A.O. belong to the Bronze Age and that their combinations of cattle, deer, carts, and figures in mushroom-shaped hats obscurely reflect the myths, rituals, and economies of contemporaneous life in that region. Furthermore, the parallelism between the human images here and those found in many sites of northern and western Mongolia and even in central Mongolia, certainly refers either to the gradual spread of a single culture over a large region or to the passage of representatives of that culture from one area to another. One must assume that in the Altay region, as in the Minusinsk Basin and northern Mongolia, pastoralism was the dominant way of life, supplemented by hunting.
12 Because the Karasuk representational style has been chronicled largely through chance finds, its particular character and its independence from the bronze tradition associated with the northern China borderlands remains problematic. Despite the desire of many scholars to find the origins of the Scythe-Siberian zoomorphic imagery in the Karasuk bronze tradition, available material does not yet justify such a conclusion, Regarding the Karasuk and Tagar traditions, see Chlenova 1967, 1976; Kiselev 1951.

20 THE RECONSTRUCTION OF SYMBOLIC SYSTEMS
The grasslands of the Transbaykal and northern Mongolia seem to have also given rise to a pastoralism by the first millennium B .C. and to a characteristically semi-nomadic way of life (Dikov 1958; Volkov 1967; Grishin 1981; Okladnikov 1950). Petroglyphs from the Selenga (Selenge) River dating to the first millennium B.C. reflect a life of stockraising mixed with hunting and some cultivation. Those from the Chuluut Gol in northern Mongolia seem to indicate a continuing dependency on the hunting of wild animals, as well as a preoccupation with herds of animals, wild and domesticated. These scenes may reflect a tradition of reindeer herding as well as religious beliefs which required the pictorial invocation of herds of animals. In the Transbaykal and in northern and central Mongolia, the culture of the first millennium B.C. is associated with rectangular slab-graves, so-called because the slabs of stone set into the earth suggest the shape of large graves. These structures are regular in size and are organized in rows running north-south. Their lack of structural differentiation suggests a general evenness of wealth and authority, but the burials themselves have been almost completely plundered. Perhaps the most striking feature of these slab-graves are great monoliths covered with the carved representations of stylized deer. Sometimes they were placed at the corners of the slab graves; in other cases, they formed a part of the slab wall or were set on the east side of the grave complex. At times these stones have a decidedly anthropomorphic reference, leading many scholars to postulate that they represented warriors of the "after world" or warrior-ancestors ( Okladnikov 1959). 13 The deer images with which they are enwrapped are distinctive, their heads lengthened into birds' beaks, their bodies elongated, their folded legs thin and small, and their great racks rising like waves over the animals' backs (pl. XIXa). From these distinctive images has come the general appelation- "deer stones." Unfortunately, however apt the term may be in the case of the Mongolian stones, its usefulness becomes dubious when applied to related traditions of carved monoliths in the Sayan-Altay region. Although the location of their origin and the direction of their spread is not certain, the Mongolian deer stones do appear to indicate a general unity ofculture across northern Mongolia and throughout the Transbaykal during the early first millennium B.C. In the east and center of Mongolia, even as far as the Khangay Mountains, the deer stones were associated with slab-graves. In the northern part of Mongolia and toward the

northwest, however, in association with the region of the Uyuk culture, the deer-stones were rather associated with a particular kind of elaborated stone mound known as khereksur (Mannay-ool 1970), a term derived from the Mongolian word khargias-ur (Khudyakov 1987: 136). The khereksur take the form of huge mounded spoked wheels or mounds surrounded by walls, gates, and ritual altars or circles. They seem to have been ritual rather than funerary in function. Apparently contemporaneous with the slab-graves and deer stones of northeastern and northern Mongolia was a particular type of ritual complex in northwestern Mongolia, Tuva and southeastern GornoAltayskaya A.O. These combined anthropomorphic stones carved with the representations of deer, horses, felines, and weapons, with ritual circles, kurgans, or khereksur (Kubarev 1979; Grach 1980; Vaynshteyn 1974: 28-32; Volkov 1981; Novgorodova 1989: 201-226). Most scholars agree that the deer stones of the Mongolian type and their counterparts in Tuva and Gorno-Altayskaya A.O. should be dated to the end of the Bronze Age. If that date is correct, than one may conclude that their appearance coincided with the emergence of Early Nomadic culture. Beyond that uncertain association of deer images, monoliths, and Early Nomads, the deer stones remain a major enigma. I shall return to a more extensive discussion of this material, for it is central to the reconstruction of the symbolic systems centered on the Early Nomadic deer image. The foregoing overview indicates that the Early Nomads inherited a number of significant artistic traditions: the carving and painting of images on living stone; the carving and raising of monolithic figures; the construction of ritual sites with circles of stones or with mounded stones and earth; the construction of elaborate funerary structures including log and stone burial chambers and elaborate stone mounds or barrows. In addition, it is possible to document a vital ceramic tradition from the Bronze Age, one which nonetheless seems to have had virtually no impact on the functional ceramic tradition of the Early Nomads. Most important by far is the tradition of bronze casting and, specifically, that of the casting of zoomorphic elements in bronze and gold. This metalurgical tradition itself points back to what must have been a significant tradition of carving in bone, horn, antler, and wood. It is virtually certain that in those perishable materials we would have found the roots of much of the zoomorphic representations of the Early Nomads and of their relatives across the Eurasian Steppe. 14
14 Some bone carvings have survived, such as the important carvings of elk from Bazaykha (Okladnikov and Martynov 1972: 180-185).

22 THE RECONSTRUCTION OF SYMBOLIC SYSTEMS
C. THE ART OF THE ScYTHo-SrnERIANS AND THE IMAGE OF THE DEER
The Scytho-Siberians came out of the center of Eurasia and evolved over centuries into a powerful political and economic force in the history of late Zhou and Han China, of Assyria and Achaemenid Persia, and of the Hellenic world. Over the course of several centuries, they were drawn from regions of grassland and forest-steppe southwards toward the borders of the settled civilizations which ring the Eurasian heartland. Paralleling that expansion was the transformation of their social and political order. The transformation of their artistic tradition, however, also paralleled those changes and traced the evolution of cultural references away from the forest-steppe and steppe toward the tastes of the Hellenic, Achaemenid, and Chinese worlds. Established in its beginnings through monumental images of deer, caprids, panthers and birds of prey, the evolution of their art reveals the nomads' gathering interest in that other world to the south. The archaic severity of their early images gradually gave way to a syncretic and curvilinear treatment reminiscent of Persian and Chinese traditions, and to a realism and anthropomorphism which announced the intrusion of Hellenic taste. Just as the remote Siberian roots of the Scytho-Siberians were lost in the final transition to urbanization and hegemony over the steppes, so too was the unique vitality of their archaic images finally smothered by ornament and by convention.By the period of the Xiongnu and Kushan hegemonies, all vital signs of that ancient imagistic tradition had virtually disappeared. However powerful the nomadic kingdoms in the last few centuries B.C. were, it is not through their political achievements that most people know of the Scytho-Siberians. It is their artistic achievements, wrought in gold, wood, and fabrics, that have attracted both scholarly and general attention over the last one hundred years. The great gold objects found in Scythian barrows-the "golden man" of Issyk kurgan in the TyanShan and the magnificent horse trappings carved in wood and covered in gold from the Altay burials of Early Nomads-have in recent years established Scytho-Siberian antiquities as a major field of archaeology and as the source of a great artistic tradition. At the center of that tradition, shared across the Eurasian steppe, was the image of an antlered animal-sometimes a deer, at other times more closely resembling an elk. In the earliest period of Scytho-Siberian culture (seventh - early fifth centuries), this image shared a dominant position with a coiled or crouched feline and with an eagle-like bird.

of the region, the deer image would be replaced by a horned animal, goat, or sheep. However its position may have varied within the ScythoSiberian symbolic system, the deer remained over time as the dominant image in the nomads' visual pantheon and the image which underwent the most radical transformations. The Scytho-Siberian deer is best known as it is displayed in grand isolation within museum exhibitions and catalogues. These displays tend to emphasize the splendor of the nomads' goldwork, the ferocity of the scenes of animal predation, and the essential "barbarism" of these people from the Greek and Chinese point of view. In its original context on human clothing or carried by horses, the deer image was rarely represented alone. Intact burials and unbroken objects from the North Pontic region, from Kazakhstan, and from South Siberia teach us that the deer was part of a regularly recurring web of images, bound to these others by postures indicating opposition, aggression, and zoomorphic transformation. So regular were the patterns encompassing the deer image and those of other animals and so repeated were the structures by which they were ordered on the bodies of horses and humans, that one begins to sense that meaning must lie in the relations ofelements as much as within the elements themselves. Meaning, however, must also have resided within the process of image transformation indicated by changing patterns of representation. The repetition and modification of the deer image over time suggests that within the vital iconography of the Early Nomads and of their relatives, the antlered animal serves as a key to the understanding of the Early Nomads' belief systems-that is, to their understanding of the source, nature, and processes of their world. The most famous example of the nomads' deer is offered by the great recumbent stag from the Scythian burial at Kostromskaya (Piotrovsky 1987: pl. 16). This image is believed to have ornamented the shield of the man buried there. In its size and in the beauty of its archaic formulation, the Kostromskaya stag is unique. The same image, however, in a less powerfully conceived form, can be found on a multitude of gold and bronze objects from sixth and fifth century Scythian barrows. It reappears on the gold gorytus cover from the sixth century Kelermes 4, there juxtaposed with a crouching panther (Piotrovsky 1987: pl. 23). In the same burial the remains of a gold plaque with four fine deer of the Kostromskaya type were also found. From Kelermes 1 a hollow gold finial was recovered, also in the shape of a recumbent deer (Piotrovsky 1987: pl. 20) and in the Crimean barrow of Ak-Mechet, dated to the fifth century B.C., a single gold plate ornmented with a recumbent deer

(pl. Va) was found. In this case, the animal retains the sculptured stylization of body volumes reminiscent of a carved matrix, but the treatment of the eye has become more realistic, the neck and chest have acquired a stylized fringe, and the great antlers have been transformed into the heads of large-beaked birds. This appearance of a new representational realism mixed with a fantastic zoomorphic transformation surely marks the beginning of the end of the archaic deer image in Scythia. Thereafter, the deer image was fated to become further interpreted away from its ancient mythic formulation. By the fourth century, it had become either burdened by the clash between its archaic formulation and the requirements of a Hellenized taste, as in the case of the shield plaque: from the royal burial of Kul Oba (Piotrovsky 1987: 213) or, as on the: great vase from Chertomlyk, it had become thoroughly transformed into the realistic animal of the Greeks (Piotrovsky 1987: 265-268). Within the scanty remains of the Saka artistic tradition, it is more difficult to perceive the process by which the archaic image of the deer devolved. From the plundered sixth century burial at Chiliktin, in eastern Kazakhstan, a number of gold deer with turquoise inlaid ears have been recovered (Chernikov 1964; Frumkin 1970: figs. 3, 4). Crushed and small, these plaques nonetheless retain the monumental aspect of an archaic prototype. Their heavy bodies and pronounced foretines suggest that the reindeer lies somewhere behind the image. When the deer reappears within the gold magnificence of the Issyk burial, at least one or two centuries later than Chiliktin, it has been deprived of that early monumentality and has been incorporated into the plaques of the dead man's belt and into a plaque adorning the dagger sheath. With an elk-like head and exaggeratedly curvilinear antlers, the animal seems to have been sacrificed to decorative considerations (Basilov 1989: 32-33). The deer image is markedly absent from the plaques of the Siberian Treasure of Peter the Great. The images incorporating syncretic deer/ horse/bird forms from burials in the China border-lands (Tian and Guo 1986) indicate the relatively late date of this material within the artistic production of the Scytho-Siberian world. Only in the art of the Early Nomads of the Altay, of Tuva, and of the Minusinsk Basin is it possible to trace the devolution of the deer from a relatively early image type to a late expression. Here the transformation of single image types over the course of several hundred years does not appear to have been as dramatic as was the case in Scythian art. The earliest known Early Nomadic burial, that of Arzhan, was severely plundered and little remains of image and ornament. Certainly no images of deer survived the robbery

and fire which destroyed this burial, but the single great bronze plaque of a coiled feline (pl. Ila) and the powerful images of rams from the tops of bronze finials indicate clearly the monumental style of the archaic tradition. One can only assume that the images of deer, had they survived, would also have exemplified that early stage of the Early Nomadic tradition. It is through the materials retrieved from the Early Nomadic burials of Gorno-Altayskaya A.O. and from those of the Tagar culture of the Minusinsk Basin that we can reconstruct the history of the deer image in the South Siberian part of the Scytho-Siberian world. Throughout that period-that is, from the fifth century to the first century-the deer remained the most frequently repeated element within the imagistic pantheon of both areas. Provenanced and unprovenanced materials from the Tagar culture indicate quite clearly that the deer image, particularly in its recumbent form, was more frequently repeated than any other animal image. Bronze images of deer have been found in many Tagar burials, laid on the bodies of the dead (female as well as male) as if to mark a significant association of forces or to call down to the dead a particular poweror relationship (Chlenova [1962] 1963; Bobrov 1973). These plaques certainly carried a more vital significance than the caprids did on the Tagar openwork standards. Throughout the period of the Tagar culture, the handling of the deer image seems to have been fairly consistent, as least as far as can be ascertained at this stage of Tagar archaeology. Within the artistic production of the Early Nomadic culture of the Altay, the deer's stylistic rendition was also remarkably consistent over time. Taking into consideration the variation in quality which one might expect between the art of a social elite (as in the five large burials at Pazyryk) and that of commoners (as in the burials at Ulandryk), the handling of the cervid image continues to emphasize the animal's lithe, alert character as well as distinctive differences between elk and deer. The consistency of the cervid's rendition until the disappearance of Early Nomadic culture in the last two centuries B.C. attests to the relative insularity of that part of
the Scytho-Siberian world (Bobrov 1973). The appearance in Altay burials of Chinese silks and mirrors and of Achaemenid fabrics and motifs indicates the intrusion of new tastes but no profound change. The art of the late burials at Ulandryk, Tashanta, and Ak-Alakh-all in Gorno-Altayskaya A.O.-demonstrates a steady, albeit conventionalized, continuation of the styles and motifs which appeared earlier in the art of Tuekta and Pazyryk.

26 THE RECONSTRUCTION OF SYMBOLIC SYSTEMS
Throughout the Scytho-Siberian world, however, the image of the antlered animal also reflects a keen sense of the living animal. Even when the rendition reflects intense stylization, one has the impression that the artist observed the animal in the wild. The alert but fearfu] expression of its raised head and wide-open eyes and the tension in its neck and body, indicate not only the hand of an anonymous master, but also the memory of a hunter. Likewise, the heavy bodies and antlers of the Chiliktin deer seem too close to those of a reindeer to be accidental, just as the vital applique of elk from the Pazyryk shabracks (Rudenko 1970: figs. 108, 109, 113) surely reflect the understanding of an artist who observed the animal in the wild and saw its anguished twist under the impact of a predator. In the case of the early Scytho-Siberian deer images it seems possible to identify the very species of the animals represented. These species include the elk (Akes alces Linnaeus), known in North America as a moose; the reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), a close relative of the North American caribou; a variation of the red or noble deer (Cervus elaphus Linnaeus) or of the maral (Cervus elaphus canadensis). At times in the following discussion it will be possible to determine the exact nature of the animal represented; at other times it will be considerably more difficult to do so. Whatever the ultimate reference of the image may be, we will find that the deer image was enclosed in the signs of change. Usually placed at the center of an axis or arranged in mirror imagery on either side of that center, it might be the intended victim of anticipated attack from a feline, a wolf, or a great bird or its antlers, head, or even body would be represented in a state of transformation from deer to bird, from deer to horse, or from horse/deer to tree. Within the Early Nomadic and Scythian traditions, the patterns in which these images were arranged were strikingly consistent. Although materials from Tagar and Xiongnu burials are considerably more fragmented, there, too, one finds the repetition of similar images bound in regularly recurring patterns of opposition and transformation. Clearly these patterns of representation were not merely ornamental in intent. They functioned as symbolic systems: that is, as systems of images and relationships which carried complex symbolic significance. The deer was the key to those symbolic systems within the age of the Early Nomads, just as it was the key to the symbolic systems of the larger Scytho-Siberian culture. The following pages will investigate the nature of those symbolic systems and attempt to excavate from the archaeology and mythic traditions of South Siberia the source and nature of the deer image itself.

In Chapter II, I will discuss the current scholarly understanding of the deer image and of its historical and cultural sources. Chapter III will examine in considerable detail the Early Nomads' symbolic systems as carried on the bodies of horses and humans. By comparing that material to related materials from the Scythian and Saka traditions it will be possible to see how widespread those symbolic systems were and yet how their variations accorded with chronology and with cultural ecology. In Chapter IV, I will tum back to the history of the deer image in South Siberia during the Neolithic and Aeneolithic periods, continuing in Chapter V with its history during the Bronze Age, as part of a larger pantheon of images. Chapter VI will address the tradition of carved monoliths in South Siberia and Mongolia, particularly as they relate to and complicate our understanding of the so-called "deer stones" of that region. This examination will again draw our attention beyond the world of the Early Nomads to that of the Pre-Scythians and Scythians. In Chapter VII, I will tum to Siberian ethnographic sources for the reconstruction of archaic mythic and ritual symbolic systems which involve a deer or deer substitute. Finally, in Chapter VIII, I will draw these several traditions together. At that point it will become apparent that the deer image inherited by the Early Nomads and elaborated into the center of their symbolic systems was a sign of the ecology of belief. It referred back not to a solar hero or to Indo-European values but rather to the emergence and gradual disappearance of a truly Siberian cosmogonic source-the Animal Mother, the source of life and death.

CHAPTER TWO
THE IMAGE OF THE DEER: THEORETICAL CONSTRUCTS
The image of the Scytho-Siberian deer has prompted considerable theoretical speculation regarding its origins and meaning. One quickly finds that within the study of Scytho-Siberian art and culture, as well as within the art and culture of the nomads' Bronze Age predecessors, inquiry into any one area of style and iconography leads to the question of meaning. Thus, for example, the gold in which the deer was cast and with which the nomads arrayed their dead has prompted a particular focus on the symbolic significance of gold within their cosmology. The warrior signification attributed by most scholars to the anthropomorphic deer stones has given rise to an assumption that the deer image must be interpreted in connection with values validating the role of the warrior in nomadic society. These arguments frequently turn on themselves and lead to the assumption that the deer image was the sign of the warrior. Such associations have been too easily supported by assumptions regarding the warlike character of those early nomadic peoples and their supposed cultural dependency on Inda-European traditions. What emerges from most theoretical approaches to the study of the deer image, and of Scytho-Siberian culture in general, is a web of intertwined threads join ing the motifs of deer, gold, and warrior with Inda-European, Inda-Iranian, and Siberian mythology, but without the benefits of the linguistic evidence on which Inda-European and Inda-Iranian constructs depend. There are three principle theories regarding the origins of the deer motif and of the archaic Scytho-Siberian triad. The first theory, articulated most clearly by M. I. Artamonov, locates those origins within the cultural world of the ancient Near East. Artamonov argued that the origins of Scytho-Siberian iconography and styles were rooted in the art of the Medes and of earlier peoples of Iran and Mesopotamia. Thus the deer, the crouched feline, and the bird of prey, as the primary motifs within the archaic Scythian pantheon, were to be found within that ancient Near Eastern tradition and were borrowed by the Scythians during their sojourn in the northern Iranian plateau and in the region of Urartu (Artamonov 1968). Artamonov's arguments have been seconded by many scholars of Scytho-Siberian history and culture: those who have

THE IMAGE OF THE DEER 29
wished to see the period of the Scythian sojourn in that area as particularly formative both with respect to their artistic traditions and with respect to their culture. If, as some believe, the Scythians spoke an Iranian language and shared in the artistic heritage of the Iranian plateau, then it becomes possible to interpret their motifs in light of lndo-lranian mythic traditions. 1If they were Indo-lranian, then they owe their artistic tradition to Near Eastern sources. Yet despite these arguments, there exist no convincing Near Eastern paradigms for the archaic Scythian deer, crouched or coiled feline, or bird-of-prey. The position staked out by Artamonov has had a powerful influence even on scholars of South Siberian Early Nomadic art. V. V. Bobrov has proposed that the deer motif of the Tagar culture in particular, as well as that found throughout the Scytho-Siberian world, was derived from the Near East and transmitted to the Siberian nomads through an influx of Central Asian Sakas in the fifth century B.C. (Bobrov 1973, 1974). The idea of such an influx is not altogether new. Many have attempted to explain the "sudden" appearance of Arzhan in the eighth or seventh centuries and of the great Altay barrows in the sixth or fifth centuries as evidence of the intrusion of a horse-dependent and warlike people from out of Central Asia. However, whether one speaks of Arzhan, Tuekta, Pazyryk, or the Tagar culture, such an influx remains purely hypothetical and based upon theories of analogy. It is true that burial furnishings of the Early Nomads have revealed clear evidence of regular trade and interchange with the Iranian world of Central Asia. Other than those traded silver objects and rugs and those artistic motifs which indicate the intrusion of a foreign taste, however, there exists little clear evidence that there was a specifically Saka influx as far north as the northern Altay and certainly not as far north as the Minusinsk Basin. The dominant style of the Altay barrows is Siberian, not Central Asian, and the dominant aspect of the Tagar material is rooted in the fauna of the North as well as in an archaic northern tradition of carving wood and bone. Those who have argued for Near Eastern stylistic roots depend on fragile theories of cultural transmission in order to explain the appearance of a confident and integrated artistic tradition as far to the northeast as South Siberia. None except Bobrov have attempted to address the issue ofreception, of why those distant peoples would have been willing, and even eager, to embrace foreign motifs and foreign styles. Bobrov has suggested that the way for such reception in the Tagar culture was paved

by an ancient belief in the elk image symbolizing the sun, but beyond that suggestion, he has offered little concrete evidence. The issue of transmission and reception remains the primary stumbling block for the theory of Near Eastern origins. Except in the case of passing fads characteristic of societies bombarded by modern media, elements of style and iconography are never given and never adopted unless the receiving culture is receptive to the foreign element. That state ofreceptivity involves a complex set of cultural, economic, and political circumstances. Given the vastly different worlds of the settled Near East-politically centralized and urban-based-and the loose pastoral society of South Siberia, it is unlikely that motifs developed in the ancient Near Eastern arena would have had any meaning for the peoples of that distant Siberian world. Only by the middle Early Nomadic period., as is attested by the great burials of Pazyryk, do foreign-made objects indicate that the nomadic culture was sufficiently developed and selfconfident that its members sought foreign objects as signs of the wealth befitting the well-born. 2 In an early study of the deer motif, N. L. Chlenova argued that the image emerged from traditions located between the borders of northern Iran and Lake Zaysan in eastern Kazakhstan (Chlenova 1962b, 168). She developed this position in the context of an extensive stylistic analysis of Tagar deer plaques, but the title of her study-"The Scythian Deer"indicates how her argument with regard to the Tagar motif is intended to refer back to a discussion of the deer motif in the larger ScythoSiberian culture as well as to the origins of the "animal style." Like others writing before the extensive excavations of Tagar materials in a more recent period, Chlenova was dependent upon chance finds. Her insistence on seeing the deer image as an individual element, unconnected with any larger symbolic system, prompts her particular conclusion. Within the Near Eastern tradition, Chlenova argues, the recumbent deer, goat, and bull were almost always associated with a representation of the Tree of Life, itself a symbol of the Great Mother Goddess (Chlenova 1962b: 195). In the Scythian world, however, the deer is never represented with either that tree or with any elements which would appear to refer to a Mother Goddess. Rather-and here she follows the arguments of Abayev (1949)-the deer image within the Scythian world
2 Minasyan has argued vigorously that the technical aspects of the archaic ScythoSiberian coiled feline and recumbent deer clearly contradict a Near Eastern origin. Rather, they refer to a tradition of wood and bone carving which in turn points to a northern forest homeland (Minasyan 1988, 1990).

THE IMAGE OF THE DEER 31
had been reformulated as an image of the Scythian totemic animal. As the totemic animal of the Scythian and Saka groups within the ScythoSiberian world, the deer image-presumably with the rest of the "animal style"-must have emerged somewhere in the vast region between northern Iran and Lake Zaysan, a region bound linguistically and culturally to Iran but distanced from it and enjoying a marked degree of cultural autonomy. The argument for a Central Asian origin has also been supported by K. F. Smirnov, the scholar of Sauromatian antiquities, and by S. S. Chernikov, the excavator of the important burials at Chiliktin in eastern Kazakhstan (Smirnov 1964; Chernikov 1960, 1964). The early dateseventh or sixth century-assigned to Chiliktin 5 and its plaques of recumbent deer and coiled felines certainly suggest a location closer to the origins of the Scytho-Siberian tradition than can be argued for Near Eastern motifs and treatment. On the other hand, either because of isolation or due to plundering, the objects recovered from the severely disrupted Chiliktin burial are not sufficient in number to demonstrate an eastern Kazakhstan origin for the deer image. Furthermore, by virtue of the shape of their heads and bodies and by virtue of their forehead tines, the Chiliktin deer appear to refer to the reindeer, an animal which was not native to eastern Kazakhstan. Rather, it points back to the foreststeppe of the Sayan Ridge. G. I. Borovka, E. H. Minns, and M. Loehr have all argued that the deer image and the Scytho-Siberian artistic tradition had to have emerged in Siberia (Borovka 1967; Minns [1913] 1971; Loehr 1955). Gryaznov, also, believed that the deer motif of South Siberia derived from a local, Sayan-Altay artistic tradition rooted in the image of the maral but associated with an economic dependency on reindeer. The source of the so-called "Scythian deer," according to Gryaznov, was within that Sayan-Altay image of the maral, but tempered by Scythian stylizations (Gryaznov 1978; and see Barkova 1990). I have argued in the past for the theory of Siberian origins of the deer image and of the Scytho-Siberian artistic tradition (Jacobson 1983); this position will be developed in the following chapters. The general reasoning behind the "Siberian connection" is straightforward: the animals which dominate the archaic Scytho-Siberian style are all animals of the northern forest or forest-steppe. Furthermore, it can be reasoned that the archaic nature of the early nomadic styles and images indicates not only a tradition of bone and wood carving but also a tradition of zoomorphic representation that goes back as far as the

32 THE IMAGE OF THE DEER
Siberian Neolithic. The particular combination of cervids (deer, elk, reindeer), felines (panthers and tigers), caprids (probably representing a variety of sheep and goats), and birds-of-prey, evident in the early art of the Early Nomads and that of their immediate predecessors, depends upon the emergence ofan artistic tradition among the hunting-dependent Bronze Age cultures of South Siberia and Mongolia. While the deer image does, of course, occur in Near Eastern art, it is never the image of the maral, reindeer, or elk, and the feline in that ancient tradition is the lion, an animal that was known to the South Siberian Early Nomads only as an exotic conception, capable of considerably more playful elaboration than the panther image was ever granted. By contrast, the representations of panther-like felines from shabracks from the same barrow (Rudenko 1970: figs. 110-112) convey the power and efficiency of the cats without the slightest suggestion of playfulness.. Within these representations of predator and prey, one senses an accu-• racy and vitality which could only be the result of a lifetime of observation on the part of the artist. I have already referred to Chlenova's belief that the Scytho-Siberian world borrowed the Near Eastern deer motif and adapted it to their totemic tradition. It is V. I. Abayev's identification of the deer with the totemic animal of the Sakas which has had the greatest influence on general assumptions regarding the meaning of the deer. In his study of the language of the Scythians, Abayev analysed the term "Saka" as meaning deer, and "because of that, the totemic tribal name saka, 'scyth,'' 'belonging to the totem deer."' (Abayev 1949: 179). From this interpre-tation the assumption that the antlered deer image referred to the male progenitor of the nomadic people and the conclusion that the deer image of the Scytho-Siberians refers to totem, tribal ancestor, male warrior, and maleness have been derived. Hardly less influential than the theory of the deer as a totemic animal deriving from Near Eastern traditions has been Okladnikov's account of the Siberian mythical deer with golden antlers (Okladnikov 1964; Okladnikov and Martynov 1972; Martynov 1974, 1990). This account was based on an amalgam of Siberian traditions regarding a cosmic dee:r associated with gold and, hence, with the sun. The wingedness of the Tagar deer images refers to flight and prowess. The gold with which they were wrapped indicates their solar signification. The association ofdeer, wingedness, and gold has led to the conclusion that the animal represents the sun: it is a solar, cosmic animal, imaged as deer and as (solar) disk, but ultimately replaced by the horse.

THE IMAGE OF THE DEER 33
Unfortunately, it is virtually impossible to find in the raised withers of the Tagar deer image any consistent suggestion of wingedness. This is all the more telling when one realizes that a number of other animalsfelines, caprids, perhaps horses--do acquire wings in Saka art, but deer do not. 3 Furthermore, neither Okladnikov and Martynov' s association of deer/gold/sun nor that of any succeeding scholars have taken into account the stubborn fact that the deer is no more or less frequently represented in gold than is any other animal (Okladnikov and Martynov 1972: 221-229; Martynov 1990). Felines, caprids, horses, birds, and humans have been represented as magnificently in the precious metal work of the Scytho-Siberians as have been deer; but few have argued that in those cases the animal or human represented should be identified with the sun. 4 Related to the association of gold/deer/sun has been the tendency to join gold and the indications of clan genesis. This connection first appears in the account by Herodotus of the Scythians' origins. In the opening pages of his chapter on the Scythians, Herodotus established the mythic association between clan origins, gold, and place. According to Herodotus,
The first man to live in their country ... was a certain Targitaus, the son of Zeus and of a daughter of the river Borysthenes ... Targitaus had three sons, Lipoxais, Arpoxais, and Colaxais, the youngest; and during their reign in Scythia there fell from the sky a golden plough, a golden yoke, a golden battleaxe, and a golden cup. The eldest of the three was the first to see these treasures, and as he went to pick them up the gold caught fire. At this he retired, and the second of the brothers approached; but the gold caught fire and blazed, just as before. Lastly... the youngest came along, and this time the fire went out, so that he was able to pick up the golden implements and carry them home. The elder brothers accepted this as a sign from heaven and made over the whole kingdom to Colaxais. The descendants of ... the youngest brother are the Royal Scythians ... the Greeks call them Scythians (Herodotus [1954]: 243244).
In this tale, gold is associated with clan genesis, but so, also, are the several implements which fell from heaven-plough, yoke, battle-axe, and cup. Unfortunately, no gold ploughs or yokes have been found in Scythian burials, and only two gold-covered battle-axes and a few gold
3 See, e.g., the treatment of felines and caprids in the plaques of Issyk kurgan. The closest one comes to finding winged deer is in the case of plaques of thoroughly syncretic deer from the same barrow. These images have large bird-heads curling up from their withers (Basilov 1989: 32-33). 4 Others have found reason to believe that certain elements, such as wings, horns, or antlers, confer solar value on the animals to which they are added, and that this solar aspect derives from Indo-lranian traditions; cf. Barkova 1985.

vases and rhyta have been found. Obviously, none of these objects relate gold to the specific image of the deer. The solarization of the deer image derives in part from the general belief within Scytho-Siberian scholarship that the deer was gradually replaced by the horse and that the horse itself was a solar symbol. The "replacement theory" is certainly suggested by an Early Nomadic practice indicated at both Tuekta and Pazyryk: that of masking sacrificed horses as deer and caprids. It is also supported by the fact that within the art of the Scythians, the body of the deer gradually assumes a more horselike heaviness. The outright interpretation of the horse as a solar animal is based largely on the report by Herodotus regarding the Massagetae, the branch of the Scytho-Siberians living between the Caspian and Aral seas. According to that historian, the Massagetae worshipped the sun and sacrificed to it the horse, "the swiftest animal" (Herodotus [1954]: 101 ). From this association of horse and sun, parallel to that of deer and sun,. has followed the association of deer, horse, and sun, and the conclusion that the deer-horse is a solar animal. 5 The association of Scytho-Siberians and horses, articulated by both Herodotus and Sima Qian, has tended to be exaggerated in the modern mind: the horse undoubtedly lends to the nomad a greater romance than would be the case if we had to imagine him trudging in the dust on foot beside his sheep and cattle. But it is also true that its visual evidence is substantial and persuasive. The two ends of a superb torque from Kul Oba (fourth century B.C.) are shaped in the form of two bearded Scythians riding their horses (Piotrovsky 1987: pis. 126-127). On the shoulder frieze of the great silver-gilt amphora from the fourth century barrow of Chertomlyk are embossed scenes of Scythians and their horses (Piotrovsky 1987: pis. 266-268). Perhaps the loveliest representation of Scythians amid their animals is found on the magnificent gold pectoral from the fourth century burial at Tolstaya Mogila. In the upper frieze and in the center, two bare-chested Scythians prepare a fleece, while on either side images of milking and of cattle and horses nursing their young create scenes remarkable for their expression of quiet contentment. In the lowest frieze of this pectoral the mood has changed; there, one finds superb renditions of lions and eagle-griffins savaging boar, deer, and horses (Piotrovsky 1987: pis. 118-121). In all these cases, of course, the
sThis position informs such studies as those by Volkov, Chlenova, Novgorodova, Kubarev, and Bobrov, among others. The extent to which it continues as an unexamined assumption may be seen, for example, in Martynov 1990.

representation is in gold. By contrast, there are few provenanced gold representations of horses and men from Siberia. The objects in gold and felt referred to above attest to the importance of horses as steeds and as sources of milk. Horses, however, were also used for sacrifice at the time of an individual's death. At Arzhan, as many as 160 horses had been sacrificed (Gryaznov 1980). In the rich first burial of Pazyryk, eight horses had been laid out in elaborate regalia in the northern part of the shaft above the chamber (Gryaznov 1950). Horse sacrifice within the Early Nomadic world was not, however, a question of wealth. In a number of commoner burials at Pazyryk, for example, one or more horses were laid outside the burial chamber (Rudenko 1970: 326-327). The commoner burials at Ulandryk, even those of females, were regularly accompanied by one, more rarely two, horses, laid carefully just outside the north wall of the burial chamber. The commoner burials of the Saglin culture in Tuva demonstrate a tradition similar to that attested to at Ulandryk (Grach 1980; Kubarev 1987a). The use of horses within the funerary ritual was not consistent within the Scytho-Siberian world. In many cases there is no sign of horse sacrifice at the time of interment and in other cases the only sign of such sacrifice is the remains of a leg or head. In Mongolia, before the late first millennium B.C., the considerable disruption of burials offers an unclear picture of the importance of the horse (Volkov 1967, 1981 ). In the Minusinsk Basin, burial goods indicate considerably less use of the horse than in the neighboring areas to the south, except as a probable source of food. Despite Herodotus' account of how the Massagetae so valued their horses, in the burials associated with the nomads ofKazakhstan there is no clear evidence for horse sacrifice at the time of a person's burial. In the one unplundered burial at Issyk, that of the remarkable "golden man," there was no preserved indication of horse sacrifice (K. A. Akishev 1978). In the case of the Scythians, horse sacrifice was frequent and lavish but still inconsistent. At Kelermes, dated to the sixth century, at least twenty-four horses had been carefully placed in the burial mound of barrow 1. At the ritual site of Ulsky, possibly also dated in the sixth century, 360 horses had been arranged around and in proximity to hitching posts (Balonov 1987). By contrast, in the burials at Axjutintsy and Volkovtsy, the only horse indicators were the gold and bronze objects used in horse trappings (Minns [1913] 1971: 182-187). The inconsistent use of horse sacrifice across the Scytho-Siberian world suggests that whatever the meaning of the horse was within the culture, it was not essential at the time of death. Nor, clearly, was the

horse the prerogative of the male warrior. Although the horse was valued for its milk, funerary ritual and visual representations reaffirm the archaeological testimony that the animals were primarily used as mounts. Whether that aspect of the horse was sacralized, however, is not altogether clear. The regalia in which the Pazyryk horses were buried refer to the functional trappings of riding horses. At the same time, the elaborate ornamentation of that regalia and its impractical elaborations raise basic questions: what kind of mounts were these intended to be, and for what purposes? A number of the horses in Pazyryk 1 were fitted with headdresses or masks which effectively disguised them as other animals or as combinations of animals. Kiselev has argued that the deer masks at Pazyryk refer to the social transition from a deer herding dependency to a dependency on horse and cattle. In his early presentation of Pazyryk 1, Gryaznov also surmised that the use of the mask on some of the horses indicates a reminiscence of earlier days when reindeer were the most valuable animals of the South Siberians (Kiselev 1951: 375; Gryaznov 1950). It would be incorrect to assume that the Pazyryk horses, or those at Tuekta, were intended to be disguised as deer or sheep. There are only two cases, both from Pazyryk 1, of deer-antlered headdresses. In other cases, from Pazyryk and Tuekta, the masks and headdresses refer to caprids or to a combination of animals and point to the use of the horse as a vehicle for some complex of mythic ideas lodged in antlers, in horns, and in the theme of animal predation. I shall return to this regalia in the next chapter. For the moment, it is sufficient to note that despite the wear attested to on some of the bridle parts, it is highly unlikely that the horse regalia was regularly used in riding. The delicacy of the workmanship would not have supported the resulting wear and tear, and the masks and headdresses would have been simply impractical in movement at any significant speed. As a whole, the sacrificed horses and the horse regalia from Pazyryk and Tueka point to the use of horses as steeds, but within a ritual context where "horseness" per se was not necessarily the greatest value. In some areas of the Scytho-Siberian world, horses were evidently plentiful in supply and could be sacrificed in abundance. In other areas, however, one must assume that the horse was too valuable an animal to be sacrificed, but the nature of that value is unclear. The horse's absence from the burials of the Tagar culture or from the rich Issyk barrow may also indicate that within the spiritual realm, the horse itself had no particular function. Similarly, where horse sacrifice appears, we may

conclude either that it was valued as a mount in both life and death, or it may have represented wealth and fealty, or that it may actually have referred to another kind of steed, or simply to the journey that accompanied death. The very appearance of sacrificed horses-one, two, or many-within any burial really tells us very little about the kind of value the animal carried. It is clear that the archaeological record disputes any easy association of horse, deer, gold, and rank and gender within the Scytho-Siberian social order. Equally problematic, I believe, is the addition of a male warrior association to the solar complex of deer/gold/horse. Arguments for this position have emerged from within the study of the anthropomorphic monoliths of Scytho-Siberian Eurasia; they will be reviewed in Chapter VI. In both Siberia and Scythia, belts girdling the stones and the tools and weapons carved as if hanging from the belts indicate that the stones represented males, and possibly males as hunters or warriors. The association of these stones with deer images has led to the conviction that the deer was the sign of the warrior. Thus a line of reasoning was established which associates deer with horse and sun, deer with totemic origins, and, finally, the deer, horse, and male warrior with the sun and with tribal generation. This reasoning has led to a consistent privileging of the male warrior and solar animal (deer/horse) throughout the archaeological record of the Scytho-Siberians in general and of the Early Nomads in particular.6 Herodotus attended to the history of the Scythians because they entered into his primary purpose: to record an account of the Greek and Persian wars. He looked at the nomads as the Greek that he was, however, and they were, in his eyes, barbarians, beyond the walls of Greek civilization. What emerges from his account is a story that has endured: that these were a people whose only achievement was in stopping the Persian invasion of Scythia. 7 Beyond that one act of historical significance, the Scythians offered little of value to the Hellenic world. They were" ...without fortified towns ...accustomed, one and all, to fight on horseback with bows and arrows..." "It is not their custom to make statues, or to build altars and temples, in honour of any

Almost every scholar who has written of the Scythians has turned to Herodotus for supposedly authoritative information. None has weighed seriously the ancient historian's reliance on hearsay, nor has any attempted to consider what information Herodotus does give and what he omits.

god except Ares," to whom the Scythians made bloody sacrifices of animals and prisoners of war. Moreover, according to the account of Herodotus and impressed deeply into the imagination of the modern world,
...the Scythian custom is for every soldier to drink the blood of the first man he kills... (The Scythian warriors) have a special way of dealing with the ...skulls ... of their worst enemies: they saw off the part below the eyebrows, and after cleaning out what remains stretch a piece of rawhide round it on the outside. If a man is poor, he is content with that, but a rich man goes further and gilds the inside of the skull as well. In either case, the skull is then used to drink from (Herodotus [1954]: 257-262).
In fact, no such skulls-gilded or otherwise-have ever been found in any of the burials of Scythians, including even those which are apparently the burials of "warriors."
In the foregoing discussion I have indicated that there are major problems within the prevailing interpretations of Scytho-Siberian culture. More subtle and more difficult to disentangle is the complex web of understandings which finds in the art and archaeology of the ScythoSiberians clear indications of the mythic traditions and cultural dynamics of the nomads and of their predecessors. These understandings are founded on the persuasion that Iron Age nomadic culture depended upon the Bronze Age intrusion of a strong Europoid element into South Siberia. This intrusion occurred when the Andronovo culture entered South Siberia with an admixture of lndo-European values and social characteristics. Since (according to these ideas) Indo-European society was indeed male and warrior-centered, this process is believed to have resulted in a privileging of the male warrior and chieftain, in the increasing organization of nomadic society for the purpose of aggressive expansion, and in the emergence of a belief in male dieties associated with the sun and heaven and with male tribal progenitors. It is certainly these assumptions regarding the Indo-European character of ScythoSiberian society which have encouraged many scholars to consider the nomads' horse sacrifices as a sign of the esteem in which the horse was held by a warrior society and as the sign of the projection of IndoEuropean traditions into the society of the Eurasian nomads (Kuz'mina 1977a, 1977b). These assumptions will be examined more carefully in succeeding chapters. For now it is sufficient to note that they depend upon the persuasion that something is as it appears, according to prevailing

cultural assumptions: that a stone image carrying weapons and tools necessarily refers to a male warrior as ancestor and as the object of worship, and that the appearance of a deer image on a "warrior" figure indicates the subordination of the deer to the warrior, transforming the animal into the sign of the male progenitor. I have pointed to the problems attending the solarization of gold, deer, horses, and warriors. But the constructs of Indo-European (and Indolranian) traditions are based primarily on linguistic evidence, for which there are no parallels among the Scytho-Siberians. Furthermore, there is no basis for believing that certain cultural innovations-e.g., horseback riding or carts-carried with them the cultural load indicated by language. Language and cultural innovations do not diffuse simultaneously or with the same cultural impact. This in itself should caution us against presuming an Indo-European basis for nomadic society, even if we find there evidence for a value placed on horses, gold, and warriors (of some kind) (cf. Hencken 1955; Schmitt 1974; Lincoln 1981). This theory, however, is most clearly contradicted by that very sign of the warrior: the deer image. Whether represented in apparent isolation or with other images, the deer is virtually always indicated as the intended or actual prey of a predator. Even on the deer stones, small images of predators are often interspersed with those of the deer, as if to reaffirm the fact that literally or figuratively the deer was a sign of animal predation, real or symbolic. The representation of the deer as victim would seem, in itself, highly inappropriate as the sign of a (presumably successful) warrior, and the bodies of deer twisting under the impact of felines is a peculiar way of referring to the supremacy of a solar power. Furthermore, the intact burials at Ulandryk in the northern Altay indicate that gold-foil covered deer were worn on headdresses as often by women as by men. This fact, in itself, undercuts the ready association of both deer and gold with the male warrior. Underlying the interpretative strategy which joins deer/horse, gold/ sun, warrior/tribal progenitor is a second category of assumptions closely associated with the first, but heavily influenced by modern political concerns and particularly those which affirm Marxist-Leninist principles of social development. These assumptions underpin the position most clearly articulated by one of the leading Soviet archaeologists, M. P. Gryaznov. Gryaznov has tended to seek and find evidence within the mortuary context of South Siberia to support his thesis that society during the Bronze and early Iron Age became increasingly "patriarchal," increasingly organized around a male warrior elite (Gryaznov 1969).

40 THE IMAGE OF THE DEER
According to this point of view, distinctions within the mortuary context necessarily reflect distinctions in social rank based on political power. The more elaborate the burial furnishings and funerary ritual, the more certain is a concentration of political power in the hands of a male leader. Weapons are considered to be reaffirmations of the warlike nature of a society and, thus, of its organization around a warrior-elite. These assumptions require reconsideration in terms of the archaeo-• logical context itself and in terms of recent developments in theories of the archaeology of death (Chapman 1981; Jacobson 1987). In too many cases, the reading of indicators of ranking has been premature or lacking sufficient evidence, particularly in the face of heavily disrupted contexts. Where bodies are completely lacking from burials and burials have been robbed of much of their valuable metal-as is the case with most Karasuk burials, with Arzhan, with most of the great Altay barrows and with virtually all the Mongolian slab-graves-conclusions regarding the possible relationship of gender, status, and social ranking are hypothetical at best. Moreover, assumptions regarding the nature of ranking have been made without determining certain basic measures. Ranking has been considered, in a sense, absolute: the wealthier the burial, presumably the more powerful the individual within the political sphere. The possibility of ephemeral indicators of power has not been considered, nor has the issue of wealthy paired burials been addressed satisfactorily, except to assume that rank and wealth were dependent on the male of the pair and not on the female. For example, the burial of Arzhan has been cited by Gryaznov to demonstrate the full emergence of a nomadic society centered on a warrior-chieftain to whom many different tribes owed hegemony (Gryaznov 1980). Arzhan has been dated by Gryaznov to as early as the eighth century B.C. It was built of large timbers in the form of a great spoked wheel, with a central chamber and over 60 chambers spreading outward from that point. The timbers by which this palatial burial space was constructed had been laid directly on the ground. Found in the burial were the bodies of at least eleven individuals, identified by Gryaznov as a king, his chief wife, and nine followers, as well as the bodies of 160 horses. The presence of a number of bone and bronze three-holed psalia as well as the find of a magnificent bronze coiled feline and bronze ram poletops allowed Gryaznov to date Arzhan to the very beginning of the Scytho-Siberian period.Unfortunately, no other burials of this type have yet been excavated either in Tuva or in any other part of South Siberia and Central Asia, although there are ritual khereksur which in their

wheel-shaped structures are analogous to Arzhan. 8 Moreover, Arzhan had been extremely disrupted by early robbers and the bodies of the dead had been pulled from their log coffins and scattered. There remained a few pieces of gold foil and turquoise, some bits of richly woven fabrics and sable, and a few pieces of gold jewelry to indicate that the dead had been lavishly dressed. In other words, there was nothing to indicate that this was the burial of a great chief other than by the theory applied to a ruined funerary site. The five main burials at Pazyryk offer another case in point (Gryaznov 1950; Rudenko 1970). In barrow 1 only one coffin was found, but no body. The dead had apparently been pulled from the burial by grave robbers. The furnishings remaining in that burial chamber were inadequate for surmising the sex of the individual or individuals who had been buried there. In Pazyryk 2 the bodies of a male and female were found. Since there was only one large coffin, one must assume that it had been used for both individuals. The burial chamber still contained many objects indicative of the wealth and well-being of this couple. The burial also had an associated horse burial. Barrow 3 contained only one treetrunk coffin and one skeleton, a male's. But there were two headdresses found in the burial chamber, one left undescribed and another of a type clearly associated with a female. One must assume, therefore, that another body, that of a woman, had been pulled from the burial by the robbers, in order to more easily strip it of valuable clothing and gold. Barrow 4 contained two coffins and two skeletons, those of a man and a woman. In barrow 5 were also found a pair of bodies, male and female. Like the other burial chambers, this one referred in structure and furnishings to a lavish domestic context. It is possible, of course, that the grave robbers had taken all the metal weaponry and tools, thereby stripping the burials of their specifically male markers. What remains is simply inadequate to support the assumptions of Rudenko and almost all others who have considered these burials: that they represent a society dominated by a male warrior aristocracy. The broken barrows give no clues regarding the relative ranking of males and females, nor the source of social ranking. Distinctions between their size and furnishings and those of other nearby barrows only indicate that, at least in death, Pazyryk society was characterized by social distinctions of some kind. When the burial structures, furnishings, and burial rituals of the Early Nomads are looked at in terms of an integrated context, it becomes clear that the assumptions which have filtered the interpretation of the deer

image need to be reexamined. We can neither conclude that the head of the household, of the lineage, or even of the tribe was male, nor can we claim to have the materials that would allow us to assert that military activities dominated nomadic society and were restricted to males. Where one has a rich burial involving male and female, surviving goods do not indicate that the male was necessarily the principle interred and the woman the consort. If one were to base one's conclusions only on what has actually been found, than it would have to be admitted that Pazyryk 5, with its elegant carriage and with the wall hanging dominated by a seated female figure, would seem to be more certainly the burial of a great lady and her male consort than the reverse. The assumption of male dominance in Scytho-Siberian burials has been greatly dependent on the appearance of weaponry within the burials: that is, weapons are assumed to belong to the males and are assumed to be indicators of higher rank than, for example, the bowls, needles, pottery, and tools associated with women (but also with men). This kind of privileging, however, is problematic. It is clear that battle axes and long swords were useful as weapons, but neither appear in Early Nomadic burials until rather late.9 Moreover, we do not know their value as indicators of rank or status. It is also true that daggers, knives, bows and arrows-all of which have actually been found in proximity to female bodies as well as to male, although not as frequently-may have functioned as both weapons and tools; their appearance within a burial does not automatically indicate the burial of a warrior or of a male of superior status. Among a number of Scytho-Siberian groups, women as well as men handled knives and daggers. Kiselev has found weaponry associated not only with the "warrior-males" of Tagar burials but also with the females (Kiselev 1951: 227; cf. Kulemzin 1982). The Sauromatian women-most certainly the source of the Greek myth of the Amazonsappear to have functioned as both warriors and priestesses (Smimov 1964, 1971). Tomyris, queen of the Massagetae, succeeded her husband after his death and successfully led her warriors into battle against Cyrus. Her actions and her words of challenge to the Persian ruler suggest a woman as comfortable in that role of leadership as a man might be (Herodotus [1954]: 96-101). The assumption that weapons indicate males, warriors, and superior
9 Both do appear in early Scythian burials, Kelermes and the Melgunov kurgan being prime examples (Piotrovsky 1987: pls. 32, 36-40). Their absence from other burials may, of course, be due to the plundering of robbers. On the other hand, they are not attested in the preserved burials of Ulandryk, admittedly those of commoners.

THE IMAGE OF THE DEER 43
ranking is further challenged by the possibility that female ranking may have been indicated through ephemera: charisma, personal power, or objects which have disintegrated in the course of time, such as elements of clothing. The problem of determining rank and status in regard to burials also applies to the analysis of images and their symbolic formulations, including those involving the deer. The signifying load of any image or of any structure of images will shift in time, depending on a number of factors. Some social or religious traditions inherited by a society from the past may be retained but others may be modified or lost. This could occur, for example, in the event of shifting climatic or geophysical factors, as when a social group moves elsewhere in pursuit of food or shelter. In that case, the force behind a particular image or structure may simply be lost or forgotten, or the original source of that image being absent, the image becomes mythologized, in the process gaining characteristics it never had earlier, or losing elements with which it had formerly been associated. The reindeer is a case in point. Even in its predomesticated state, it must have served as a primary source of food and clothing for South Siberian peoples of the Bronze Age. There is much to indicate that the reindeer was distantly behind the retention of the deer image within the Scytho-Siberian pantheon, long after the nomadic groups had left reindeer territory. One must assume that as Early Nomadic society shifted out of a Bronze Age balance between hunting/fishing and pastoralism to a greater dependency on livestock, the values with which specific images were laden would also have shifted. We know that such values and their institutionalization within symbolic systems may not proceed together. Nor can one necessarily find a ready consonance between changing symbolic formulations and new dimensions of social order and ranking. As is the case of artistic styles, so too in the case of the lives they embellish: old forms and old rituals may be retained, perhaps only for the sake of a sentimental attachment to what has been. Or they may be retained, perhaps, because of a cultural idealization of the past. At the same time, symbolic systems reflective of changing religious beliefs or changing social ranking may lag behind significantly, retaining traces of earlier value systems long after the latter have disappeared from effective functioning within society as a whole. This has been fully demonstrated in the case of mortuary practices, which may represent a "freezing" of earlier traditions and values that are effectively rejected in the practical communication of a given society (Pearson 1982).

may entirely divest itself of earlier signification and gain new meaning. In the case of the transition from Bronze Age to early Iron Age South Siberia, the regular pairing of individuals may or may not reflect a contemporary relative equality between males and females. The fact that horses or horse trappings have been found with females and children alone rather than only in the presence of males also gives one pause: in light of the general scholarly contention that horses were the sign of the male warrior in Scytho-Siberian society, we have here either a direct contradiction of that hypothesis or a delayed retention of outmoded associations and rituals into a new age. Specific objects such as a sword or an ax may also shift from a reference to martial power to that of political power, without that shift leaving any other trace within the mortuary context. No less obscured by essential human conservatism could be a changing social order involving the shift in centers of power within household and lineage from females to males. Given the fact that the furnishings of Early Nomadic burials are overwhelmingly domestic in reference, there may be no way of ascertaining how, when, or if such a complete change ever occurred. The point is that contemporary realities of social organization and ranking may not be clearly visible through the mortuary or ritual context. The anthropomorphic deer stones associated with the slab-graves of Mongolia are also associated with the ritual khereksur, as well as with ritual enclosures. As I have indicated, because the monoliths seem to repre~ent mll.le wllrrior figurei; the lli:rnmption hlli: prevlliled thllt the khereksur refer to some aspect of a socially validated viricentrism, perhaps to a cult of the male tribal progenitor. In fact, in their structure and in the lack of other surface and subsurface materials, the khereksur give no clues regarding social ranking or gender reference. There is nothing to allow us to associate them with tribes rather than with clans or lineages. If the khereksur do refer to ranking, we cannot know from anything within their context whether they presuppose a centralization of leadership either in the political or spiritual realms. While the nature and sizeoftheritualstructures may indicate social willingness to accord individuals or groups conventional signs of authority (Tainter 1978; Brown 1981), it is not possible to say how, if at all, those signs will leave "readable" distinctions within the surface or subsurface archaeological record. Nor is it possible to determine the nature of that authority or the source of that ranking. In other words, there is nothing in the Early Nomadic mortuary or ritual context which would demonstrate a dominating and determinant belief in a male ancestor or tribal founder.

THE IMAGE OF THE DEER 45
Finally, one must recognize the limitations of assuming that there is a self-evident relationship between a sign and the signified. A sign may represent one set of values associated with one social being, but depending on the context, it may shift those values to a very different reference. The bull and the lion of Sumerian and Babylonian traditions refer, on the one hand, to male vitality and fertility, but they were also frequently associated with the female goddess and were subordinated to her power. Separated from her, these images continued to serve as indicators of her presence, as well as of her domination. Chariots also referred to the presence of both gods and goddesses, since they were understood to be vehicles of both. Within the context of late Bronze-early Iron Age South Siberia, it is no less possible that the multivalency of any one symbol involved shifting attributes from one reference to another. While the anthropomorphic deer stone may on one level represent the male warrior, it may also indicate the presence of a female progenitor of the lineage. The result is similar to the way in which a Buddhist dvarapala arrayed in the attire of a warrior referred not to warriors, but rather to the presence of the Buddha, the embodiment of non-action and non-violence. Within Early Nomadic society, a sign could serve equally as icon and to indicate the presence of a power or individual that was otherwise absent. The powers indicated by that sign could thereby shift from one referent to another. This, indeed, is what happened to the deer image in its passage through time and through the cultural layers of Neolithic, Bronze Age, and early Iron Age South Siberia.
There is yet a third set of assumptions which has tended to prejudice scholarly examination of the Early Nomadic culture. These assumptions are characterized by the understanding that from the time of the early Bronze Age, the ancient cultures of South Siberia were shamanistic (e.g., Brentjes and Vasilevsky 1989). Petroglyphic images of horned figures, "masks" with the characteristics of fantastic creatures, and dead men laid to rest in suits of gold are all taken to indicate the cultural importance of the shaman figure in Siberian and Central Asian prehistory. Even mirrors have been taken to refer to a shamanistic ritual (Martynov 1979: 143145). Since shamanism indicates the concentration of spiritual power into the hands of a few individuals, the ascription of shamanism to an early society likewise would indicate that the society had evolved to the point where access to spiritual powers was indirect, and had to be facilitated through a small and select group. Moreover-and here one may return to a modern tendency to romanticize the past-"shamanism"

46 THE IMAGE OF THE DEER
functions as a useful catch-all to explain monstrous images (masks) or funerary rituals and furnishings which suggest a belief in an afterlife. "Shamanism" is a way of saying that we are unable to recapture the early, primitive belief in a journey to the land of the dead and in life in the hereafter. The modem perspective has erected "shamanism" as a barrier between "us" and "them," a sign of unity between humans and the natural world which can be known only by primitive societies. Assumptions regarding the shamanistic character ofBronze and early Iron Age society in South Siberia ignore basic questions: when, after all, did shamanism emerge as a religious institution and how can we know the answer in the absence of written texts? There are no references to shamanism in South Siberia before the Turkic period. No shamans' gowns, drums or drumsticks-or at least nothing recognizable as such-have ever been recovered from early burials. If the signs of shamanism were other than those associated with modem shamanism and if we knew what they were with certainty, we might be on more solid ground. The fact ramains, however, that the analogy between ethnographic materials gathered in the last few centuries and presumed characteristics in the society of the Early Nomads and their predecessors breaks down in the face of a lack of archaeological evidence. Stated simply, mask-like petroglyphs, mirrors, animal images, and sacrificed horses do not make shamanism, or at least not shamanism as we know it. The challenge facing the scholar who would use ethnography to tease out the meaning of images from South Siberian prehistory is allowing the possibility that shamanism as we know it may only be a late expression of a tradition which at that time had a vastly different form. Within the ethnographic record, as within the archaeological record, experience has been laid down in strata and over millennia; only the most archaic elements, within the most ancient layers, will offer some possibility of revealing meaning.10
This book is the result of the conviction that existing theories regarding the mythic traditions and social organization of the Early Nomads and of the other Scytho-Siberian groups do not account for their most impressive imagery, nor do they account for the embedding of that imagery within symbolic systems which persisted for centuries.None of these theories serve to reveal either the significance of the deer image or the significance of the symbolic systems of which this image was part. The position taken here is that the deer is indeed the key to the recon

struction of Scytho-Siberian culture in general and of the Early Nomads' in particular. While the deer image may have carried reference to the sun, that was only one limited aspect of the realm it represented. Moreover, if the deer image of the Early Nomads functioned as the emblem of the male warrior, that was a late and ambivalent development. I believe that maleness and warlikeness were not its original attributes and males were not its primary reference. The meaning of the deer image was, rather, rooted in an ancient identification of the animal with cosmogenesis and with the source and end of a clan's lineage. Beginnings, endings, and regeneration were all associated with this animal, as were the heavenly bodies, the rivers and mountains of this world. That unity, however, existed only in the Neolithic period and in the early Bronze Age. The history of the deer image is also the history of change in form, in context, in meaning. To investigate the history of an image and of the symbolic systems in which it was embedded is to study the process of cultural change itself. The deer of the Early Nomads was wrapped in layers of myth and ritual, hinted at in the ritual and burial structures of the Bronze Age, traced obscurely in the petroglyphs along the great Siberian rivers, and distantly echoed in the mythic traditions of remnant peoples such as the Tungusic Evenk and the Paleo-Siberian Ket. As the ancestors of those peoples left the regions of Mongolia and the Sayan Ridge, pushed northwards by the expansion of other peoples in the first millennium B.C., they carried with them mythic traditions which, when excavated from layers of story telling begin to reveal the outlines of a vital, generative being. In unwrapping the layers that obscure the image of the deer of the Early Nomads, one finds that it was rooted in a symbolic system revolving around the Animal Mother: the deermother as Tree of Life and as source of life and death. Essentially female, it was gradually arrogated to the male as a sign of his power; with time, however, that function also disappeared. By the end of the first millennium B.C., the deer had lost its visual and mythic energy; it had degenerated into meaningless ornamental scrolls, it had been translated into the image of a woman, or its absence was indicated only through the presence of a male warrior. With the disappearance of Scytho-Siberian culture, the deer was destined to persist only through the shamanistic tradition of Siberia and Central Asia. In seeking to reconstruct the symbolic systems represented by the deer of the Bronze and early Iron Ages, it is possible to consider this animal as a text: within its elaboration and modification is written the emergence, florescence, and decline of a once powerful symbolic system.

CHAPTER THREE
IMAGES AND THE SYMBOLIZING ORDER OF IMAGES IN THE ART OF THE EARLY NOMADS
A. OBJECTS, IMAGES, AND STYLES
Interest in the art of the Eurasian nomads was first aroused in the early eighteenth century when Tsar Peter the Great was honored with a gift of gold plaques said to be from Siberia. Cast in gold and studded with semi-precious stones, they represented realistic and fantastic animals, alone or locked in mortal combat. Peter's interest turned into fascination; he encouraged his representatives in Siberia to gather whatever gold pieces they could acquire. The resulting Treasure of Peter the Great, now housed in St. Petersburg's Hermitage State Museum, attests to the satisfaction of Peter's intense interest, as do the plundered burials across Siberia. Not a single object entered into Peter's collection with any scientific documentation. Great quantities of gold objects were spirited out of Russia and subsequently lost. One must assume that an even greater number were simply melted down for the personal enrichment of robbers and merchants (Rudenko 1962; Gatsie 1975). As a result, the magnificent objects belonging to the Sih~rio.n Treo.!lure of Peter the Greo.t have limited value within scholarship. At best, they can be used only to support hypotheses based upon excavated materials. The attention that had been focused on the Siberian gold was revitalized late in the eighteenth century by the 1763 excavation of the Litoi kurgan in the southern steppe of the Ukraine. Interest in Scythian antiquities was also encouraged by a contemporary fascination with Greek antiquities. By the mid-nineteenth century, more orderly excavations had been encouraged by the Imperial Archaeological Commission in St. Petersburg. Throughout the succeeding period and up to the present, first Russian and then Soviet archaeologists have uncovered the so-called "royal" burials of Scythia, as well as many lesser burials. Although many of the early excavations were done in a disorderly, even unscientific manner, the results of more careful excavations have permitted the development of a detailed understanding of provenance and chronology (Jettmar 1967). During the last fifty years, Soviet, Mongolian, and Chinese archae

ologists have continued to uncover major finds across the Eurasian Steppe and Forest-steppe. The sheer number and richness of these finds defies description. Countless cemeteries have been excavated, and their small finds fill out our understanding of artistic traditions within a larger cultural context. More stunning are the large burials of individuals who must have held a privileged position in nomadic society. These large burials include the great burials at Arzhan in Tuva, and the large burials at Tuekta, Pazyryk, Berel, Bashadar, and Katanda in Gorno-Altayskaya A.O. The burials at Chiliktin and lssyk in eastern Kazakhstan, as well as excavations in the Chinese Tyan-Shan (cf. Jacobson 1985) have offered a wealth of new information about the Saka tradition. Chinese excavations at the sites of Aluchaideng, Xigoupan, Taohungbala, Yulongtai, Sujigou, and Maoqinggou in Inner Mongolia have added immeasurably to our understanding of the complexity of the art of those nomads who crowded China from the north in the late Zhou and Han periods (Tian and Guo 1986). Finally, mention must be made of the spectacular finds at Tillya-Tepe, in northern Afghanistan, excavated by the Soviet archaeologist V. I. Sarianidi (Sarianidi 1985, 1989). The thousands of gold pieces recovered there have immensely enriched our view of the art of the latest Scytho-Siberians in Central Asia, the Yuezhi. The cumulative effect of these discoveries and their publication has permitted as close a study of the art of the Sakas and Early Nomads as has been made of the Scythians. Nonetheless, the sheer wealth of material now available has discouraged the publication of comprehensive studies of Scytho-Siberian art. To date, there have been only a few studies which consider the Scytho-Siberian artistic tradition as a stylistic whole (Jettmar 1967; Borovka [1928] 1967), and none has attempted a reconsideration of Scytho-Siberian iconography. Of all the regional artistic traditions, only those of the Scythians and those at Tillya-Tepe have been well-published and analyzed with respect to the chronological development of styles and techniques. 1 The beginnings of Scytho-Siberian art are reflected in materials from the burials at Arzhan, Chiliktin, Kelermes, Litoy (Melgunov Treasure),
1 The conviction that much of the best of Scythian gold work actually reflects Greek workmanship has encouraged a greater interest in Scythian art than in any other of the Scytho-Siberian regional traditions. Several studies have focussed on artistic and iconographic impulses from Near Eastern traditions, such as those of the Medes and Urartians. Others have concerned themselves with Greek elements in Scythian art, usually assuming that the goldwork which strongly reflects Hellenic taste is the result of Greek workmanship. A smaller number of scholars have attended to issues of technology, the relationship of iconography, taste, and social change. See, inter alia, Artamonov 1969; Grakov 1971; Minns [1913],1971; Piotrovsky 1987; and writings by Rayevskiy, Kuz'mina, Mantsevich.

Kostromskaya, and in the hoard recovered from Ziwiye in the Iranian plateau (cf. Godard 1950; Dyson 1965). Within this body of gold and bronze materials, the most significant animal images were those of the deer, of an eagle-like bird with large-beaked head, of a horned caprid, and of a coiled or crouching feline. The style in which these animals are represented may be described as monumental and archaic. It is best represented by the great deer of the Kostromskaya shield (Piotrovsky 1987: pl. 16), by small reindeer plaques from Chiliktin (Chernikov 1964: fig. 7), by small bird plaques from the Litoi kurgan (Piotrovsky 1987: pl. 19), and by heavy bronze ram poletops from Arzhan (Gryaznov 1980: figs. 25, 26). All these images are rendered with sharply juxtaposed planes reflective of a wood or bone-carving paradigm. Equally frequent are indications that the cells of eyes and ears were originally inlaid with colored stones. In contrast to the lavish inlay represented by plaques from the Siberian Treasure of Peter the Great, that of the early and archaic style appears to have been as restrained as the images were monumental in effect. The most powerful examples of coiled or crouching felines include the great bronze plaque from Arzhan (pl. Ila). In that plaque, originally mounted on the breast strap of a horse, a concern with modeling by means of sharply juxtaposed planes is again found. The cellular eyes, ears, and nostrils, as well as the small cell in the animal's tail, point to the original insertion of colored paste or stones. This feline is matched by an unprovenanced gold plaque from the Treasure of Peter the Great in which the modeling is fuller and the cells for inlay insertion are considerably larger (Rudenko 1962: pl. VI/1). Other early examples of the archaic feline image include crumbled gold foil images found in 1911 by Adrianov under a stone near the Mayemir kurgan in Gorno-Altayskaya A.O. (Rudenko 1960: 10-12) and the 29 small gold felines from Chiliktin in eastern Kazakhstan, dated to the sixth century (Chernikov 1964: fig. 7).2
The Arzhan feline type was frequently represented throughout the early Scythian period, but typically it is crouching rather than coiled. The
2 Two similar felines in bronze, one obviously used as a pendant, have been recovered from the early Saka finds of barrow 33 at Uygarak (VII - VI c. B.C.), in the region of the lower Syr-Dar'ya (Vishnevskaya 1973, pl. XXVIII/6,7). The finds in this barrow and that of barrows 27 and 28 included a number of objects ornamented with feline motifs. The motif reappears ornamenting the disk of a bronze pin, from barrow 21. Archaic bird heads with large beaks and deer also indicate the early date of these barrows, as do horse and weapon typology. Regarding the motif of the coiled feline, its stylistic development and the dependency of that style on carved prototypes, see Barkova 1983 and Minasyan 1990.

best known example is the gold shield plaque from the sixth century burial at Kelermes (Piotrovsky 1987: pl. 17). Closer to the South Siberian version and to the felines from Chiliktin are the small coiled feline, in relief, marking the central handle of a mirror from Kelermes 2 (Artamonov 1969: pl. 35) and that represented on a bone quiver ornament from the seventh century burial at Temir-Gora, near Kerch (Piotrovsky 1987: pl. 7). Many other crouched or partially coiled felines in the art of the Scythians (e.g., Grakov 1971: pl. XX; Artamonov 1969: fig. 17) confirm what is suggested by the monumentality of the Arzhan and Kelermes plaques: that in its early coiled or crouching form, the feline was associated with a centralized placement within a symmetrical organization of images. A number of representations of coiled animals suggest that the coiling of a predatory animal may have been more significant than the actual nature of the animal itself. A bridle plaque from Kulakovsky barrow in the Crimea, dated to the early fifth century, indicates that, at times, the feline could become remarkably wolf-like in appearance (Piotrovsky 1987: pl. 61). From the very inception of the Scytho-Siberian artistic tradition, therefore, there was estabished a small number of powerfully defined images: the deer, the feline, the caprid, and the eagle-like bird, often expressed in terms of a large beaked-head. In so far as we can judge from recovered materials, these images were virtually always represented individually, in a kind of monumental isolation. When images of predators and prey were juxtaposed-as on the gold casing from Kelermes kurgan (Piotrovsky 1987: pl. 23)-physical interaction would be implied and psychological interaction was signalled by conventional means: the posture of the feline would indicate imminent attack and the head of the deer would be raised, as if in alarm. Such compositions lend clarity to individual images such as the plaques from Arzhan, Kostromskaya, and Kelermes. In their isolation and stylization is lodged much of their monumentality; but their postures implicate the assumed presence of other animals. The archaic style represented by the Arzhan, Kostromskaya, and Kelermes plaques was fated to change. As the Scythians, Sakas, and Early Nomads developed closer ties with Greece, Persia, and China, the monumentality of the early formulations gave way to a greater sense of the animal observed in a state of nature. Realism and a sense of immediacy replaced the expression of a hieratic permanence. On the bridle trappings and shabracks recovered from the Pazyryk burials, deer twist and bolt, griffinated eagles stoop and hover, wolves and felines

52 THE SYMBOLIZING ORDER OF IMAGES
sniff, leap, and pounce. On the other side of the nomadic world, in Scythia, an Hellenic concern for realism gradually overwhelmed the archaic style. Realistic proportions and organically modeled surfaces transformed the stylized animals of the northern world into images of immediate flesh and blood. Even the archaic animal types were transformed. The eagle head gave way to an eagle-griffin imported from the Near East and the Mediterranean world. The horse made its appearance beside the deer as the preferred victim of predation. The panther, or Siberian tiger, disappeared, replaced by a lion. This translation of archaic motifs was never completed in South Siberia. From the eighth to the first centuries B.C., the deer, the caprid, the raptor and the panther-like feline remained persistent elements. Nonetheless, the dilution of the archaic style is indicated by the intrusion of foreign formulations. Already at Tuekta, and more decisively in the materials from Pazyryk, the raptor becomes griffinated. Whimsical lionized animals and lion heads are introduced, probably from Achaemenid art, as ornamental elements in native felt designs ( Rudenko 1970: fig. 116, pl. 148). A lion-bull and a four-legged eagle-griffin from Pazyryk 1 suggest a playful translation of Near Eastern motifs even though the ferocity of their predation on the bodies of deer or goats belies that lightheartedness. Except in the case of objects which surely seem to be of foreign craftsmanship, human images did not make their appearance in ScythoSiberian art until the fifth, or more likely fourth, century. 3 Finds from the late fifth century barrow of Solokha and from the fourth century Scythian barrows of Chertomlyk, Kul Oba, and Elizavetovskaya, among others, indicate the Hellenistic nature of human representation in Scythian art. That human representation became increasingly common, to the point where it virtually overwhelmed the representation of animals. This is well illustrated by the superb gold vase from Kul Oba, decorated with large images of seated Scythians speaking and tending to each other and to their weapons (Piotrovsky 1987: pis. 184-187; and see related vessels from Gaimonova Mogila and Chastiye 3, Piotrovsky 1987: pls. 166173). Despite the fact that the men carry weapons, the scenes themselves are quiet and lyrical. So, too, are the images of men and boys on the pectoral from Tolstaya Mogila (Piotrovsky 1987: pl. 118). These and other representations in Scythian art stand in stark contrast to the florid
3 Earlier they appear on objects which were probably done by Urartian or other Near Eastern craftsmen. Regarding the introduction of human images in Scythian art, although with a line of reasoning which is open to serious challenge, see Raevskiy 1978 and 1983.

Helle- nic treatment of battling Greeks and Amazons on a gold scabbard casing from Chertomlyk and to the equally overdone images on the gold gorytus cover from the same burial (Piotrovsky 1987: pls. 221-222, 224225). Among the Early Nomads, the earliest human images within a native idiom are found in bridle plaques representing human heads, from Pazyryk 1 and on the great felt hanging from Pazyryk 5 (pl. Via; Rudenko 1970: pis. 91, 92, 154). There on the hanging, repeated eight times in two friezes, a seated woman holding a branch with one hand is approached by a fine male rider. The very confidence with which this scene is repeated on a hanging of monumental effect suggests that this very unusual scene belonged, in fact, to a common cultural understanding.By contrast to the confident presentation here, human representation is absent from the Ulandryk and Tashanta materials (fifth- first c. B.C.) except for a small gold-foil horned mask and a human head attached to the side of a composite deer ( Kubarev 1987a: pl. LXIl/12, 13). In contrast to the few anthropomorphic images from South Siberia, in the art associated with the Xiongnu human representation appears to have become somewhat more important. This is indicated by a number of belt plaques on which are represented wrestlers or cart drivers and carts. Unfortunately, the vast majority of this material-like the anecdotal plaques from the Treasure of Peter the Great-are chance finds and lack precise dating (Salmony 1933; Devlet 1980). In the latest material associated with the last of the Scytho-Siberians, the Yuezhi, zoomorphic imagery is totally submerged by ornamental considerations and by a Hellenized preoccupation with the representation of humans, heros, and anthropomorphic dieties (Sarianidi 1985, 1989). Throughout Scytho-Siberian art, the motif of animal predation constitutes the central representational formulation. This theme cannot be dismissed as a reflection of the fears of primitive hunting and herding peoples or as an immediate echo of the natural world. For example, it is certain that within the Altay Mountains, wolves as predators were as significant in antiquity as they are said to be today. Yet in the art of the Early Nomads, the wolf has an ambiguous role, appearing more frequently as an opponent to predatory felines and raptors than as a predator itself. The eagle-like bird also plays an unclear role within the pantheon of the Scytho-Siberians: quasi-predatory, quasi-protective, at times merged into the very body of another animal. In contrast to the actuality which surrounded the Early Nomads, herd animals never appear in the role of prey. The predation that constituted the central motif in Scytho

54 THE SYMBOLIZING ORDER OF IMAGES
Siberian art was entirely acted out in the realm of wild beasts or fantastic animals. Predation was expressed in three basic formulations. The most archaic was certainly that represented by the Kelermes gorytus cover with its images of crouching felines and recumbent deer: predation implied through the juxtaposition of independent animals, the time of its occurrence frozen into an eternal potentiality. A similar predation is suggested by the bronze panther from Arzhan, placed on the chest of a living horse as if to indicate the fall of predator on its prey. The second form ofrepresenting predation is best offered by two pairs of wolves and deer carved ata site called Alty-Katyndoi on the south bank of the Chuya River in southeastern Gomo-Altayskaya A.O. Datable by style to the Pazyryk period, these images represent ferocious wolves confronting startled deer. This treatment is almost non-existent, however, within material recovered from actual burials. Far more common is the third formulation of predation, that of explicit attack. This is represented by a gold plaque from Ilyichovo, in the Crimea (Piotorovsky 1987: pl. 70), and more powerfully and explosively by the sets of animals on the shabracks from Pazyryk (Rudenko 1970: figs. 108-113). If predation, implied through juxtaposition, freezes the act into eternal potentiality, explicit representation freezes it into a perpetual actuality. Implicit or explicit, predation indicates the essential motif of the symbolic system of the Scytho-Siberians in general and of the Early Nomads in particular. It is a predation without conclusion, however. Within the eternal repetition of that act there is no death. Only at the end of the Sey- tho-Siberian period do we find animals once antlered and horned hang- ing lifeless or tom apart and devoured (e.g. ,details from the Chertomlyk and Elizavetovskaya scabbards; Artamonov 1969: pls. 185, 330). One of the most distinguishing aspects of the art of the ScythoSiberians is the manner in which animals are transformed into other animals or are joined in a complex pattern of zoomorphic junctures. This tendency appears within the archaic tradition of the seventhsixth century, the most striking example being the large crouching panther from Kelermes: its feet and the joints of its tail take the form of small, coiled panthers. Small bridle ornaments from that and other early Scythian barrows suggest that the fusing of sheep and birds, or of predators and birds, was a significant aspect of the archaic style (Piotrovsky 1987: pis. 1, 6, 10-12). A similar if more vigorous process of juncture and transformation appears in the art of the Early Nomads

THE SYMBOLIZING ORDER OF IMAGES 55
of South Siberia; examples of this material will be discussed below. The image of a deer with bird-headed antler tines offers the most important example of the Scytho-Siberian tendency to represent the process of zoomorphic transformation (Jacobson 1984). Within this transformation, the tines of the deer end in the heads of large-beaked birds, resulting in the fusing of deer, branched antlers and birds. This transformation is exemplified in Scythian art in plaques from the fifth century barrows of Ak-Mechet and Ilyichovo. The Ak-Mechet plaque (pl. Va) reveals a sturdy animal with raised, alert head and a spray of antler tines, three of which terminate with the heads of large-beaked birds. The realistic treatment of the animal's eye and ear and the ridging along the underside of its neck indicate a departure from the archaic tradition revealed in the treatment of its body. In the Ilyichovo representation (Piotrovsky 1987: pl. 70), the large deer still retains the powerfully modeled body of the archaic style, but the ornamentation on its throat and the treatment of its eye and ear indicate the intrusion of Hellenic formulations. Rearing up before the raised head of the deer is a great serpent, while a wolf or bear-like animal curls round the deer's upper body and bites into its chest, and an eagle pecks at its tail. Faced with such ferocious predation, the deer's raised neck and head and its firm body still express enormous vitality. As if they were an aspect of that vitality, its antler-tines have been transformed into the heads of birds with long curled beaks. Even the hoofs of the deer and the tail terminate in bird heads. The image clearly joins the processes of predation and transformation, centering them in the body of the antlered deer. The theme of the fusing of deer and bird takes on other variations: the head of the deer may become bird-like (e.g., a bridle frontlet from the fifth century Seven Brothers barrows; Piotrovsky 1987: pl. 68), or the bird heads may become griffinated and may sprout on the body of the deer, as in the case of a deer image from Axjutintsy (Jacobson 1984: pl. 11 ). In a number of instances, images of deer and birds are suggestively juxtaposed rather than fused. A gold horse-frontlet from Zhurovka (Piotrovsky 1987: pl. 71) demonstrates this pairing of elements. In the upper part of the frontlet we see a recumbent deer, its powerful body and the treatment of its body surfaces indicative of the archaic tradition of representation. In the center of the frontlet and facing in the same direction as the deer is a flying eagle, its body also formed by broad juxtaposed planes. Two bird heads with huge eyes terminate the lower section of the frontlet. In this object, then, deer and bird are joined to the horse which wore the frontlet, and although none of these elements refer

56 THE SYMBOLIZING ORDER OF IMAGES
to transformation, the combination here of animals which elsewhere are fused is noteworthy. Whatever the specific variation, the motif of the deer with birdheaded antlers may be found repeated across the Scytho-Siberian world. Among the most impressive examples are the fantastic deer on the: tattooed man of Pazyryk 2 (Rudenko 1970: figs. 53-54), the composite deer on the wooden plaques from Katanda, and the unprovenanced Verkhne-Udinsk plaques from the Treasure of Peter the Great (pl. Ve). A number of these examples will be considered in more detail below. If the deer was the animal most frequently fused with a bird, however, it was not the only one. This merging of zoomorphs was echoed in other transformative motifs in Scytho-Siberian art. A bronze bridle plaque (early fifth century) from the Kulakovsky barrow in the Crimea represents a wolf-like animal coiled like a Siberian feline. Superimposed on the body of the animal are a caprid and small bird head, while its paws and tail terminate in long-beaked heads (Piotrovsky 1987: pl. 61). A horse-shoe shaped bridle plaquefromZhurovka (fifthcentury) is ornamented with a crouching feline. The animal's body is rendered with juxtaposed planes and its tail terminates in the head of a bird (Piotrovsky 1987: pl. 65). On a number of gold plaques from the Siberian Treasure, wolves. sprout bird heads or griffinated bird heads from the tips of their tails and on their necks (Artamonov 1973: pls. 178,280). Similar forms appear on the tattooed man from Pazyryk 2, as well as in late material from the grasslands of Inner Mongolia and northern China. The griffin-headed creatures with elaborated antlers from Xigoupan (Tian and Guo 1986: 356) only distantly recall the deer of the Pazyryk tattooes or those on the Verkhne-Udinsk plaques. The inlaid gold wolves crested with griffinheaded antlers from Aluchaideng (Tian and Guo 1986: pl. XVl/1) seem crushed beneath the weight they carry. One of the latest examples of the crested wolf transformation can be found on the carpet of the Xiongnu burial at Noin-Ula; in this last statement of the motif, dated to the first century A.D., the theme has become reduced to an ornamental flourish (Artamonov 1973: pl. 203). This brief overview of the evolution of style and motif in ScythoSiberian art indicates the outlines of a general pattern across the Eurasian steppe: the closer the nomadic groups came to centers of settled civili-· zations and the more they became absorbed into those cultures or emulated their aggressive statehood, the more completely any traces of the archaic pantheon were extinguished. The motif of predation disintegrated into conventionalized and grim reflections of death while the

THE SYMBOLIZING ORDER OF IMAGES 57
signs of transformation either disappeared or became conventional, like the rote incantation of a prayer emptied of meaning. By contrast, in those nomadic cultures which remained further from the settled crescent on the south and which never emerged into statehood, zoomorphic imagery continued in a tradition of realism or conventionalization. In the gold and bronze work from the Inner Mongolian late nomadic sites of Aluchaideng and Xigoupan and in numerous chance finds from the northern Chinese borderlands, the motifs of the predation of wolf or feline on horned animals, deer, or horses continued as a major theme, albeit rendered in terms of an increasingly lifeless conventionalization. The pattern of change across the nomadic world of Eurasia and over a period of several hundred years suggests that mythic traditions rooted in cultural patterns untouched by the traditions of settled civilizations were lodged in the archaic triad and in the combined motifs of predation and transformation. Central to those early formulations was the deer. Whatever the meaning of these aspects of the deer were, they were always articulated within a larger structure: one which postulates the vertical axis and bilateral symmetry as the sign of essential or ideal order. Even within the gradual transformation of the deer into horse, and within the final disintegration of the animal into conventionalized realism or meaningless ornament, the essential principles lodged in the representation of predation, transformation, and axial order are retained, like distant echoes of the archaic traditions.
B. PREDATION, TRANSFORMATION, AND AXIAL ORDER
Throughout the Scytho-Siberian world, but best represented by materials from the frozen burials of the South Siberian Early Nomads, the themes of predation and transformation were organized around an implicit central vertical axis. This axis was usually coextensive with the head or body of a human being or with the head and body of a horse. This axis, however, was also indicated by the pairs of plaques which were intended to be carried on the bodies of horses, men, or women. 4 The
•Unfortunately, the finest such plaques all derive from the Siberian Treasure of Peter the Great. They are therefore unprovenanced and cannot be used as primary documentation, but their general reliability is established through the finds of wooden plaques which replicate the images on those from the Siberian Treasure. Their authenticity, if not their date and provenance, is also indicated by the well-established tradition among the Xiongnu of wearing paired or individual plaques on their belts. One can only surmise that the lavish use of gold attested in the plaques of the Siberian Treasure accounts for the fact that similar plaques have not been found elsewhere; they were most likely among the gold materials plundered by ancient robbers from Early Nomadic burials such as Tuekta and Pazyryk.

58 THE SYMBOLIZING ORDER OF IMAGES
plaques carrying the representations of animals would have been worn in such a manner that the antlers or horns of the prey would coincide with, or frame, the central vertical axis; on either side of that axis and facing toward it the predatory animals or the larger elements of the scene would be arranged. When these plaques are paired, one finds that the central axis coincides with the representation of antlers, bird wings, and trees. That axis is reaffirmed by the positioning of the animals of prey and of predation itself. I would maintain that this material, late and unprovenanced as most of it is, nonetheless points to the direction in which scientifically excavated material will lead us.
1. Arzhan
Arzhan offers too little material that is too disrupted to allow the reconstruction of the image patterns as they were arranged on the bodies of horses or human figures. A possible exception is offered by the great, bronze, coiled feline which is believed to have been mounted as a breast ornament on a horse's cheststrap (pl. Ila). If the Arzhan plaque was used in this fashion, then the animal would have been "represented" as being coiled around its prey, much as the wolf-like animal on the Ilyichovo plaque is coiled around the deer. The Arzhan plaque thus raises the possibility that when this motif is found elsewhere, it was set on the central axis and its posture served as the sign of a centrally-located predation.
2. Tuekta
Although badly plundered, the four large barrows within the cemetery of Tuekta are believed to be among the earliest representing the Altay Early Nomads. Burials 1 and 2 establish the type which comes to represent later burials of this region. The chambers of single or double walls were constructed at the bottom of a deep pit. The dead had been placed in tree-trunk coffins and the horses killed in sacrifice were laid either outside the walls of the wooden chamber (burial 1) or above the chamber (burial 2) (Rudenko 1960: 93-108).5 No human ornamentations were found in either ofthe first two Tuekta barrows, but there are many indications that the horses sacrificed there
5 Tuekta was first excavated in 1935 by S. A. Sergeev and again in 1937 by S. V. Kiselev. A more complete excavation and study was undertaken by Rudenko, beginning in 1949.

had carried elaborate headdresses. These headdresses and the fine, carved bridle ornaments together indicate a pattern of dressing the sacrificed horse in such a way that the animal became the vehicle for carrying a set of elaborate images. By those ornaments, the horse was transformed into an antlered or horned animal, but it could also be said to carry a landscape which reaffirmed the processes of predation and transformation. For example, from Tuekta 1 were recovered two sets of large wooden horns, curved and fringed with half disks to recreate the horns of a mountain ram (pl. Ild).6 There were also four wooden structures, each composed of a curved wooden stand into which had been set a large carved antler shape (pl. Ile); these may have been assembled on the horse's head together with the large carved horns (Rudenko 1960: pl. LXXI). 7 From the same horse burial was recovered another pair of wooden horns with one interesting variation: on the top ofeach "hill" had been set the standing figure of a feline (Rudenko 1960: LXXII). The remains of gold foil on these horns indicates the original splendor of these large and magnificent structures. In some as yet unclear manner, each of these structures had been set on the head of a horse, transforming the animal into a ram or deer or into a combination of the two. The feline/ horn construction created an even more complex transformation. As the horse "became" a ram through the headdress, the felines between the hills of the horns articulated the theme of predation within a landscape setting. Bridle ornaments from Tuekta 1 and 2 reiterate the theme of transformation: from antler to leaf-like form, from antlered animal to griffinated bird (pl. Ile). One senses an almost playful willingness to let shapes and signs slide from one reference to another, yet the range of references is intentionally delimited. Many of the carved wooden bridle ornaments take the shape of assymetrical foliate forms rendered in large recurving shapes. Others seem to hesitate between a reference to plantlike foliage and to antlers, as though deliberately slurring the distinction between the curves of the two. The full curves of the foliate and antler-like ornament reflect the applique ornamentation on the felt shabracks that were poorly preserved in the Tuekta burials and superbly preserved in the burials at Pazyryk (Rudenko 1960; 1970: pls. 160-162). This similarity between fabric and carved ornamentation suggests that the apparently abstract
6 A similar but smaller pair was found in Tuekta 2; see Rudenko 1960: pis. LXIX, LXX, CIX.) 7 This placement of the antlered structures has been suggested to me by L. L. Barkova.

curvilinear shapes rendered in felt also referred to plants or to antlers or to both. Several of the Tuekta 1 bridle ornaments hover between griffinated bird heads and the heads of female (?) elk and between griffinated bird heads and foliage. In many of the ornaments, the feline motif reappears, usually in the form of a frontal panther head with huge jaws and gripping in its mouth or attached at the neck to the fronds of a bird-foliate or antlerfoliate ornament. Regardless of the variation in the ornament, in every instance it is problematic how it should be read. In some cases, the juxtaposition of feline head and foliate-form suggests a highly stylized statement of predation. In other cases, there is at least the suggestion that the feline head vomits the shape from its mouth. However interpreted, both versions reaffirm complex references to transformation. Like the horns topped by felines and worn by the horse, these bridle ornaments transform the horse into a vehicle for the location of change and for the change which is located in and by predation. The Tuekta ornaments clearly establish a necessary and vital relationship between antlered animal, bird, and plant form, and a possible relationship between horned animal and feline.
3. Beret, Bashadar, and Katanda
At the plundered burials ofBerel in Gorno-Altayskaya A.O. a few horse: ornaments which also refer to deer antlers, plants, or to a combination of these were found (Sorokin 1969). In the horse burial of Bashadar 1 a pair of wooden horns covered with gold and silver were found. They had apparently been used as part of a horse headdress (Rudenko 1960: pl. XXXVIII). From the same horse burial two superb hovering eagles, carved from wood and originally covered with gold foil, were recovered (Rudenko 1960: pl. LI). They are believed to have been placed on the front and rear horns of a saddle, thus recreating the theme of a bird grasping in its talons its prey or the meat of a dead animal. This placement of the bird of prey directly on the horse recalls the original placement of the feline plaque from Arzhan. In both cases, the horse has become a vehicle for the representation of predation as an essential symbolizing process. If one consults the strength of the Ilyichovo deer, however, with its head raised high despite the predation of wolf and bird, then the Bashadar and Arzhan constructions of plaques and horses could be seen as ambiguous. We may here be presented with the idea of predation by bird or feline on the horse, or of transformation, with the

horse or the antlered or horned animal "becoming" the bird through the merging of antlers and wings, or signified through the bird's eating of the prey's flesh. The large Katanda burial is usually dated to the Shibe phase of the Altay Early Nomad culture (third century B.C.) (Rudenko 1960; Kiselev 1951). Among the scattered indications of what had been a rich double burial were found several carved animals in a bundle of fabrics and fur. Like so many carved images from other Altay burials, these animals look like horses but have holes in their heads for the mounting of leather antlers. They thus suggest an animal in metamorphic process, between horse and deer. 8 A carved wooden plaque from Katanda is of particular interest (Artamonov 1973: pl. 196). The plaque is rho-shaped and was probably one of a mirror-image pair. It carries the representation of a bear-like feline attacking a large composite animal with the forebody of a horse but the hindquarters of a wolf or feline (pl. Vd). The animal's head is beaked like an eagle and from its antlers and tail sprout the heads of eared eagles. In shape and subject the Katanda plaque relates to and confirms the reliability of the unprovenanced Verkhne-Udinsk plaques from the Siberian Treasure (pl. Vc). 9 I have said that paired plaques such as those from Katanda or Verkhne-Udinsk would have been worn so that the antlers of the animal faced inward toward the implied central axis of the person's body. In this respect, therefore, when one recreates the pairing of plaques, one finds that the act of predation occurs at the center of the axial area and that the animal which is the object of attack seems to explode into a variety of forms while its branched antlers sprout the heads of birds. This combination of elements echoes the symbolic structures suggested by the materials from Tuekta: the conflation of antlers and birds; the resulting conflation of bird, antler, and tree mediated by the similarity of shape and placement; the association of composite horse-deer and predator; the juxtaposition of the construct of predation with that of the horse/deer/tree.
8 Kubarev has proposed that these animals were part of an elaborate human headdress similar to those more clearly indicated in the Ulandryk finds (Kubarev 1987: 110). If this is the case, then these deer would have been carried on the head of a person. 9 See the discussion of these and related plaques, provenanced and not, from Mongolia and Liaoning, in Jacobson 1984. In the wooden Katanda plaque, the masked horse has the hindquarters of a wolf, while in the Verkhne-Udinsk plaques, and others from Inner Mongolia and Xichagou, the wolf element is lacking.

4. Pazyryk
The richest source of material on the Altay Early Nomads is unquestionably that recovered by Gryaznov and Rudenko from the five large burials at Pazyryk. Located in a high alpine region in the Ust Ulagan Valley, between the Bashkaus and Chulyshmanrivers in eastern Gorno-Altayskaya A.O., the burials were part of a large cemetery that included many small kurgans as well as the five large ones, all generally dated to the fifthfourth centuries B.C. 10 The burial chambers of the five large kurgans had already been thoroughly plundered in antiquity. In their haste to seize objects of value, the robbers scattered the furnishings of the chambers and mangled or dragged away the bodies. Stripped of their gold-foil covering, beautifully carved pieces of furniture, richly appliqued clothing, and other objects of both a utilitarian and decorative nature were left behind. As a result, the remains of the Pazyryk burials are extremely important for the understanding of Early Nomadic traditions of working wood, fur, leather, and wool. Within Pazyryk 1 the excavators recovered no materials which seemed to relate to headwear or systematic body ornament. A man and a woman had been buried in Pazyryk 2 and from the remains there Rudenko was able to reconstruct a woman's headdress. Shaped like a hood or flat-topped cowl, it was made of black colt's skin ornamented with an overall pattern of leather diamond shapes. At the top was a crown, or diadem, of standing leather cocks. Beyond this crested headdress, a number of carved wooden objects found in the same burial suggest other crests for human use, but how they would be mounted and on what kind of base remains a mystery. Included in this material were two bird heads with inserted leather ears and two deer heads originally fitted with leather antlers. In addition to those remains of human headdresses, Rudenko found
10 Pazyryk l was first excavated in 1927 by M. P. Gryaznov, a member of a larger expeditionary force led by S. I. Rudenko to explore the archaeology of the Altay (Gryaznov 1950). Subsequent excavations of Pazyryk 2, 3, 4, and 5 were carried out by Rudenko in 1947-49. The five large burials are dated by Rudenko to the fifth century B.C. (Rudenko 1970: 293-309). On the basis of radiocarbon and dendrochronology, Rudenko has suggested a detailed dating for the five burials within a period of48 years. Others, such as Jettmar, have proposed a broader horizon, between the fifth and fourth centuries (Jettmar 1967: 135). More recently, Marsadolov has used the scientific analysis of organic materials to propose dates for the five large burials between the late fifth century and the first halfof the fourth century, with the fifth burial being perhaps the last completed (Marsadolov 1984, 1988).

two complex and finely carved structures. One is a beautifully carved head of a griffinated eagle with leather ears and wings, holding in its beak the head of a deer. In a manner reminiscent of the composite deer of the Katanda and Verkhne-Udinsk plaques, the tines of this deer's leather antlers are transformed into small heads ofcrested eagles, suggesting the interconnection between the act of predation and the process of transformation. Assuming this was used as a head crest, the size of the construct (23 cm. long) indicates the necessity for a careful setting on some kind of stiff headgear. The other structure recovered from barrow 2 takes the shape of a carved griffinated eagle head holding a deer head in its beak. On each side of the griffin's neck a sculptured relief of an eagle with a goose in its talons is affixed. Pazyryk 3 contained only one body, that of a man, but the recovery of two headdresses from that chamber suggests that there had originally been another body. Rudenko describes only one of those headdresses, a balaclava-like covering of leather and felt topped with a gold-covered wooden structure (Rudenko 1970: 90-91). No headdresses were found in barrow 4. In barrow 5 a woman and man had been interred in one long log coffin. A wooden headdress with attached pigtail probably belonged to the woman. As a type, it is similar in appearance to that worn by the seated woman on the large felt hanging found outside the north wall of this burial chamber (pl. Via). One other group of images should be mentioned: those tattooed on the body of the man buried in Pazyryk 2. Rudenko has described the condition of this individual, whom he calls a chief, in some detail (Rudenko 1970: 110-113). On the relatively well preserved right side of his body were images of wolf and feline-like animals; twisted animals of horse, onager, or caprid type, with beaked-heads and with horns and bird-headed antler tines (pl. Vb); an antelope-like animal, confronted by a strange clawed, toothed and snouted creature with a wing-like appendage and curled up tail. Similar beasts were visible on the man's poorly preserved left arm, while on the left side of his chest were found the traces of a large predatory animal. The left leg of the man's body had been too damaged to make out the tattooed images. On his right leg were discernible a large fish, a row of four running goats, and a snouted and horned wolf-like animal with bird heads sprouting from its body. In so far as it is possible to reconstruct the imagery tattooed on the man from Pazyryk 2, there appears to have been a distinct order in its organization. The forequarters of the predatory animals on his chest had faced in towards the center. The primary images on his arms were of

64 THE SYMBOLIZING ORDER OF IMAGES
composite animals. Their postures replicate the twisting of elk, deer, and rams under the impact of a predator. The tattooed images thus recreate the theme of predation, but with the predator either absent or merely indicated by juxtaposition. The heads of all the animals of deer or onager aspect face in the direction of the central vertical axis marked by the man's head and chest. This pattern reaffirms the principle advanced earlier: that the organization of predators and prey would refer to a central vertical axis, here carried by the man. Moreover, the animals represented as prey epitomize the process of transformation attendant on predation. From their heads sprout horns and antlers, the tines of which terminate in minature griffin heads. In this fantastic combination of elements, the composite animals echo the main image on the VerkhneUdinsk and Katanda plaques. 11 The transformation of a horse by the imposition of antlers or horns echoes the transformation that had been effected by the crowning of the Tuekta horses with antlered and horned headdresses. If the plundered human burials at Pazyryk add only a limited set of materials to our knowledge of the Early Nomads' headdresses, the horse burials add an immense wealth of information. Although the Pazyryk materials did not reveal horse headdresses exactly analogous to those indicated by the Tuekta finds, there are a number of parallel forms which suggest a similar tradition of elaborate headgear and similar principles of transformation underlying the ornamental motifs. The unbroken and frozen horse burials at Pazyryk allow one to reconstruct with great certainty the organization of motifs on the bodies of the horses, carried on masks, headdresses, crests, bridles, and body harness. 12 Unquestionably, the elaborate regalia in which these horses were buried goes far beyond the requirements of an ornamental display of wealth. Every horse sacrificed in Pazyryk 1 was sent to its death carrying references to the themes of predation and transformation-all organized around the vertical axis of the horse's body and head. So, too, were the horses in burial 2 and at least one in burial 5 elaborated. Each of the horses within Pazyryk 1carried a bridle, a chest strap, and a shabrack. Several of the animals were originally fitted with elaborate headdresses or masks. In each case the standing horse in regalia established a central vertical axis, on either side of which were symmetrically
11 They also recall the magnificent gold animal from Shenmu, Shaanxi province, which probably crowned a stiff headdress (pl. IVb) 12 The clearest representations of the reconstructed horse regalia may be found in Gryaznov 1950.

arranged individual elements and image constructs. Horse "A" is a good example (Gryaznov 1950: fig. 13). The axis located through his head and chest was implicitly defined by the symmetrically arranged leaf forms on the bridle. The images of eagle-griffins perched on twisted elk were reproduced on each side of the shabrack. The resulting system of images described the emergence of foliage from the predation of eagles on elk:

Body _ _ _ _ _ chestguard _ _

Horse "B" wore a bridle and chestguard ornamented with leaf shapes and antlered deer symmetrically arranged around the implied center (Gryaznov 1950: fig. 11). Images of eagle and lion-griffins predating on caprids ornamented the shabrack and its pendants, thus bracketing the implied axis with references to animal predation. The resulting organization of images on the horse describe the conflation of deer and foliage and the predation of fantastic animals on homed animals:

Horse "C" wore a bridle on which was indicated the merging of horned caprids and foliage (Gryaznov 1950: fig. 10). A great hovering eagle was worn in the center of the horse's chest band. On either side of the shabrack panthers savaged elk. This horse also carried a crested mask

66 THE SYMBOLIZING ORDER OF IMAGES
of leather, felt, fur, and gold. The mask took the form of a feline in combat with a lion-griffin; the griffin's head and wings became the horse's crest. Thus the horse carried a complex organization of images. At the top of the axis, a bird-animal struggled with a feline, as if for possession of the horse. At the horse's head, the juxtaposition of caprids and foliage suggests both the place of the animal in its natural world and the alternative form of that animal. On the axial center of the horse's chest hovered an eagle, while on either side of the axis was repeated the predation of feline on cervid:

Horse "D" carried a set ofimages which also described the emergence of horned animals and foliage from the predation of felines on deer (Gryaznov 1950: fig. 9):

The bridle of horse "E" was ornamented with carved plaques demonstrating a considerable sophistication in the reduction of a ram's body and head to a symmetrical statement of the whole animal (Gryaznov 1950: fig. 17). Full ram heads ornamented the psalia ends. On the chest

harness, ram plaques alternated with a plaque that condensed a ram head in the jaws of a homed and snouted animal (pl. Ille). The horse's shabrack carried lion-bull images on either side, while from the shabrack hung pendants of rampant fantastic lions. This array of images was crowned by the elaborate mask worn by the horse. The mask recreated the attack of a feline laid over the face of the horse, as if attacking that animal's head, but the horse itself had been transformed into a deer by antlers ofleather and fur (Gryaznov 1950: fig. 16). The feline's body was made of blue fur studded with gold and originally must have made a extraordinary impression. It would be rash to assume that the mask was intended to transform the horse into a deer. Its purpose, rather, like that of the mask on horse ''.C," was to transform the horse into a vehicle for retelling the mythic opposition of feline and winged animal or of feline and homed or antlered animal. The result was a system of images which repeatedly affirms the association of predation with the vertical center:
Horse Head-- mask--

Body---- chestguard-

A similar configuration of images was carried by horse "F" and by horse "G" (Gryaznov 1950: figs. 15, 12). In the latter case, the carving of deer on the bridle and of elk on the chest strap is particularly outstanding. The artist has skillfully conveyed the alert and nervous power of these animals. At the same time, by elongating antlers and wedging palmettes between split bodies, the artist has emphasized the synonymy of antlers and plant-like forms, organizing them symmetrically on either side of the axis implied through the head and body of the horse. The result is a powerful construction within which the conflation of antlered animals and foliage emerges from the base established by the predatory animals:

The horses buried in Pazyryk 2 had evidently also been elaborately arrayed to recreate the conjoining of predation, transformation, and central vertical axis, but little remained intact. A crested eagle head of painted leather was apparently part of a disintegrated horse headdress. Another headdress in the form of a horse cowl carried an elaborate sculpture of leather, felt, wood and gold foil representing a bird with raised wings over the head of a large horned ram (Rudenko 1970: fig. 95). In both cases, the winged bird was set at the top of the horse's central axis. Four of the five saddle horses buried in Pazyryk 5 were fitted with harnesses less elaborate than those of Pazyryk 1, but they did carry beautifully ornamented felt shabracks, including one which ingeniously incorporated a fine Chinese silk. The ornamentation of the shabracks combines references to birds (wings and beaks), antlers, and floral forms (Rudenko 1970: 160-162). Only the fifth horse carried an elaborate outfit, including a full face mask crested by a beautifully carved antlered deer head (pl. Illb). The head effectively established the deer at the top and center of the axis of the horse. The ornamentation of the bridle

THE SYMBOLIZING ORDER OF IMAGES 69
described elegantly curled recumbent deer confronted by the heads of felines; this combination of animals was juxtaposed by forks representing the jaws of wolves opening towards psalia tipped with the heads and claws of eagles (pl. Illa). The elaborately constructed saddle and its chest guard reiterated in several forms the motif of felines confronting antlered animals (Rudenko 1970: fig. 88). In effect, the horse carried a system of images which joined antlered animals and feline and wolf predators around the vertical axis of its body:
Pazyryk 5 - Horse 5 Horse Head--mask:--

eagle x wolf x felines x deer x felines x wolf x eagle Body-----chestguard-

Notes:

While the masks and bridles from Pazyryk might have been used in ceremonial situations, they would have been too awkward and fragile for anything like everyday use. It is possible that these beautifully carved constructs were intended for burial only. They clothed the horse in a set of images which effectively established a map of significant relationships around a central vertical axis. That axis must have referred to the joining of realms of being, and the acts of predation and the processes of transformation evoked by the horses' regalia were reaffirmed as essential parts of the journey signed by that axis.
5. Ulandryk and Tashanta
The symbolic systems which were arranged on the bodies of horses at Tuekta and Pazyryk reappear in the regalia of commoners buried at Ulandryk-Tashanta, in the high and barren steppe of southeastern GornoAltayskaya A.O.(Kubarev 1987a). The burials are dated from the fifth to the first centuries B.C.; the largest number of those excavated by Kubarev belong to the third - first centuries B.C. They thus represent a late phase in the Altay nomadic tradition.

70 THE SYMBOLIZING ORDER OF IMAGES
Like the large burials at Pazyryk, these at Ulandryk and Tashanta are all chamber and horse burials. Unlike those at Pazyryk, however, only one or two horses were sacrificed with each burial. They were laid just outside the north wall of the chamber and did not carry any elaborate trappings. Moreover, the burial furnishings laid out with the dead were modest. They were also well-preserved, thanks to the early seeping of water into the burials and their subsequent congelation. Because of that freezing, the bodies ofthe dead lay undisturbed until excavation, making possible the reconstruction of the elaborate headdresses in which both males and females were laid to rest. The style with which the images of deer, caprids, birds, and felines were carved reveal a close connection with that found in the carvings of the Pazyryk burials. They also reveal a similar organization of images and of the motif of predation symmetrically around an implied vertical axis. This situation is examplified by finds from burial 2 in Ulandryk cemetery IV. Dated by Kubarev to the third century B.C., this was a wellpreserved paired burial ( Kubarev 1987a: 186-189, pis. LXXI-LXXV). Both bodies lay on their right sides with their heads to the east. The male was placed against the south wall of the chamber, the female just in front of him, to his north and facing north. Outside the north wall of the chamber had been laid the body of one sacrificed horse. Congelation preserved the general order of objects with reference to the bodies of the dead. Close to the man's neck were found the terminals of a neck-piece; they had been carved in the form of crouching horned felines. Near his head were found three wooden images with the body types and throat fringes of caprids. Above his head, against the east wall, was found the wooden carving of a spread-winged eagle. Nearby lay a wooden standing deer with pendants. All seem to have been originally covered with goldfoil. In immediate proximity to the dead man's skull were two images which Kubarev refers to as horses, perhaps because they lack the throat fringe found on certain caprids. However, these "horses" had holes in the top of their heads, perhaps for the insertion of leather horns. The woman's head was also surrounded by objects which had once ornamented her elaborately worked hair. A large dark area around her head indicated the remains of black dye used either generally or specifically in the elaboration of funerary regalia. On her head had been set a gold-covered diadem ornamented with swan-like birds and terminating in sheep heads.13 A gold-covered wooden horn and two other half
t3 This diadem was found in the immediate area of the woman's head, but the text description and the excavation drawing do not agree on its exact location.

cylinders were found at the back of her head. Kubarev believes that they had been used to build her hair into a mass capable of carrying the objects with which it had been adorned (Kubarev 1987: 94 ff.). Above and in front of her head lay a small diadem composed of a deer with split body, so that the head of the animal must have been placed at the front and center of her hair. Just at the top of her head, behind the deer diadem, lay the wooden carving of a caprid with gold-covered leather horns. It was set on a bronze pin stuck into the top of the woman's piled-up hair. When one reconstructs the organization of the headdresses and of the neck ornamentations worn by the couple buried in Ulandryk IV/#2, the following patterns emerge:
Headdresses from Ulandryk N/2
Male eagle deer caprid-caprid caprid-caprid-caprid feline-feline
Female
caprid deer caprid-birds-caprid
The headdress of the male from IV/2 carries no representation of actual predation by one animal on another. However, at the top of his head he had worn the figure of a spread-winged eagle. The felines crouched on the neck torque suggest the rhythms of the natural world: the attack of predator on prey and the subsequent contest between predator and hovering bird for the flesh of the dead animal. In the proposed reconstruction of the female's headdress, deer again occupy a central position on the vertical axis, while caprids and birds fill out the symmetrical organization of images. The burial of Ulandryk 1/12 is also dated to the third century B.C.; in it were found the bodies of a male and female, laid out as in the burial of Ulandryk IV/2 (Kubarev 1987a: 163-165, pls. XXV-XXVIII). In this case, the woman seems to have carried the more elaborate head ornamentation, as well as the images of rampant felines at her neck. In association with the simpler ornamentation of the male was found a small head of an animal, most likely a caprid (with lost horns) and hanging objects. A reconstruction of the headdresses along a vertical axis described from neck to the top of the head would result in the following ordering of images:

The one female buried between the third and first centuries B.C. in Ulandryk Il/5 (Kubarev 1987: 170-171; pls. XLI-XLII) carried hair and neck ornaments which would have created the following vertical pattern of images:

The single male buried in the third century grave of Ulandryk IV/1 had also been fitted with an elaborate head regalia. This included a particularly fine diadem composed of two recumbent facing deer separated by feline heads(?) and "attacked" at each end by felines with horns terminating in bird heads (Kubarev 1987a: fig. 45/1). Other head ornaments included three small carved animals; the lack of chest fringe suggests they are horses, but the general conformation of their bodies and the holes in their heads indicate that they were understood as caprids and were originally fitted with leather horns. The large standing deer above the man's head had been hung with four pendants. Four standing caprids found just above and in back of the head had perhaps been placed to either side of the deer, allowing the following reconstruction:

The woman was accompanied by the body of one horse, its head to the east. The remains of black dye under the woman's head indicated that her hair had

been piled up in a tall cone-shape, at the top of which had been stuck a pin decorated with the head (and body?) of what Kubarev calls a horse but which has the small muzzle of a caprid and holes to indicate missing horns (or antlers). Somewhere in the vicinity of the lower front of her conical hair had been set a diadem of a double-bodied, single-headed animal with holes in its head to receive leather horns or antlers. The fringe under the animal's throat suggests a goat or ram, or possibly a deer. At the woman's neck were the rampant felines terminating the ends of a neck-piece. The result was a tall, conical structure with the following display of imagery:

The material recovered from the frozen burials of Ulandryk-Tashanta confirms what is indicated by the horse and human regalia from Pazyryk: that within Altay traditions of the early nomadic culture, the head of the dead would be elaborately ornamented with a system of zoomorphic images usually wrapped in gold. The Ulandryk-Tashanta finds, however, broaden the implications of the Payzryk material. They indicate that elaborated headdresses were as much a part of the death-right of commoners as of the wealthy members of nomadic society, and as much a part of a woman's death-right as of a man's. The reconstructed headdresses from Ulandryk-Tashanta also indicate that the bird motif was a possible, but not necessary, part of such headdresses and was most likely to be placed in the upper part or at the top. Predatory animals such as felines were used as frequently as elements of female regalia as of male regalia. The same gender non-specificity is true of deer (standing or recumbent), caprids, and possibly even of horses, although the distinction between horses and caprids is occasionally problematic. The materials from Ulandryk-Tashanta further indicate what was also apparent in the poorer burials at Payzryk: that woman were as likely to have been buried with horses as were men. The horse headdresses and crests from the Pazyryk burials demonstrate that headdresses could become quite complex. A similar complexity is suggested by the reconstructed headdresses of those people buried at Ulandryk. In a number of cases, the crowning elements in a headdress had removable heads, suggesting that they were intended to move with

the movement of the wearer. This is true of the deer which may have crowned the head of the woman buried in Ulandryk II/5, of a standing deer found near the jaw of the man buried in Ulandryk IIl/4, and of the deer diadem which crowned the woman buried in Ulandryk 1/12. The resulting movement of elegantly carved and gold-covered ornaments must have been quite striking. However, assuming that the conviction existed that there was another life after death, we cannot be certain that these ornaments were intended for use in this world. Gold may have been valued as ornament or because of some mythic signification, but whatever its meaning, the finds from Tuekta, Pazyryk, and Ulandryk-Tashanta make abundantly clear that headdresses, crested masks, and related regalia carried significance beyond the requirements of ornamentation. 14
If the Early Nomadic materials establish a pattern of symbolic systems carried on the bodies of humans and horses, materials from other parts of the Scytho-Siberian world elaborate on that pattern. They indicate that such systems had to have been considered essential at the time of death and interment. While their elaboration indicates a finely developed sense of the ornamental, the very repetition of specific themes consistently organized around a central vertical axis indicates that these symbolic systems were not driven by ornamental considerations. Their existence and function were part of an enterprise attendent on death. The materials deriving from the larger Scytho-Siberian world describe several processes of change. These changes occur in the formulation of the images themselves and reflect the intrusion of tastes and values from outside the nomadic world. However, they also reflect the way in which concepts rooted in the Siberian world of forest and foreststeppe were gradually reformulated under the influence of Hellenic, Persian, or even Chinese traditions. Landscape implied became landscape represented. Animals of the forest were replaced by those of the Near Eastern and Greek world or even by human images. Nonetheless, within all those changes, the pattern of organization around a central vertical axis continued to reaffirm the essential principles established in the Pazyryk materials.
14 The finds of Ulandryk and Tashanta are expanded by Kubarev's recently published excavations at Yustyd (Kubarev 1991). Particularly relevant to this discussion may be included burials XII/ 8, XIl/12, XIl/16, and XII/21 from that site.

6. The Crown Ornament from Aluchaideng
In 1972, a hoard of more than 218 pieces of gold was discovered in the sandy soil ofa commune near Aluchaideng, Inner Mongolia. Aluchaideng is located in the Ordos plateau at the north edge of the Mu Us desert, in that region of valuable grassland which was much contested by nomads and Zhou-Han Chinese. It is believed that the objects came from two graves belonging to the Bai Yang or Lin Hu of the Xiongnu confederacy in the late Warring States period. 15 The most impressive object within the hoard was a gold cap topped by a standing goldeagle with amoveable head ofturquois and naturalistically patterned feathers (pl. IVc). 16 The cap over which the eagle spreads its wings is scalloped and scrolled on its outer edge. Within each of the four equal sections of the cap, a wolf interlocks with the twisted body of a wild caprid. Associated with the cap was a three-piece gold crown belt modeled in a braided rope pattern and terminating in the recumbent bodies of a horse, a caprid, and a crouching, snouted wolf. Cap and belt were probably sewn onto a large headdress of fur or fabric, of the kind worn until recent times by such peoples as the Burials, Tuvinians, and Mongols. By style and by subject matter the Aluchaideng crown is closely associated with Early Nomadic traditions. 17 The appearance of the eagle at the top of the crown recalls the placement of a bird at the top of the man's headdress from Ulandryk IV/2. The Aluchaideng crown also suggests the original use of two gold eagle-like birds in the Siberian Treasure of Peter the Great (Artamonov 1973: pls. 267, 270). The smaller of the two birds is naturalistically rendered. It stands on a broken plaque fitted with three holes for attachment. The larger of the two birds
15 Tian and Guo 1986: 342-350. This find included 218 gold pieces, 5 silver pieces, and about 45 stones for inlay. As a group, the Aluchaideng finds are of immense importance in reconstructing the artistic traditions of the Ordos before Xiongnu political hegemony and outside Chinese cultural hegemony. Together with materials from other sites in Inner Mongolia--e.g., Xigoupan, Taohungbala, Yulongtai, Sujigou, and Maoqinggou-they offer the opportunity for an informed reconsideration and redefinition of Ordos art. 16 The eagle is 7.3 cm. high; the weight of the whole crown is 192 grams, while the weight of the three segments together is given as 1202 grams. 17 Other objects within the hoard confirm this association. Among the most interesting are twelve inlaid gold plaques in the form of crouching wolves, their tails and neck crests terminating in the heads of griffinated eagles (Tian and Guo, pl. XVl/1). This motif obviously echoes, albeit in much clumsier form, the crested wolf tattooed on the right foot of the man buried in Pazyryk 2, and the magnificent crested wolves from the wolf/tiger plaque pair (unprovenanced) from the Siberian Treasure of Peter the Great (Rudenko 1962, pl. VI/3,4; and see Jacobson 1984).

was originally inlaid with turquoise; it holds in its talons the stylized body of a swan. At its base are holes and hooks by which to attach it to a larger object. Like the eagle on the Aluchaideng crown, this bird also has a moveable head. On the Aluchaideng crown ornament, the representation of wolf predating on caprid is repeated four times. In every case the representation is stylized to the point ofunrecognizability. Although the wolf heads cross the bodies of their victims, none of the animal pairs reflect the psychological impact of predation.
7. The Issyk Headdress
The most lavish human headdress from the early nomadic world is that from the undisturbed burial at Issyk, in the Tyan-Shan territory of the nomadic Sakas (K. A. Akishev 1978). In burial ritual and in the lavish use of gold plaques and gold covered objects, the Issyk burial is easily associated with both Altay and Scythian precedents. The dead man had been laid out on his back, his head to the west. His short jacket and boots had been entirely covered with sewn-on gold plaques. By his side had been placed a gold-sheathed sword and long sword. This headdress, however, was the most remarkable find (pl. IVa). It took the form of an exaggeratedly tall nomadic hood covered with representational gold plaques. According to Akishev's reconstruction, the front of the hood was adorned with composite animals combining horses with winged caprids and facing out from either side of an implied central axis. Above these composite creatures were arranged large gold feathers, goldwrapped and tipped arrows, wing-like motifs and vertical objects of gold with a painted pattern. Around the hood's sides and back plaques of twisted and winged felines, frontal feline heads, tri-peaked and zigzag mountains, profile caprids standing with feet together as if poised on .a ridge, and pole-trees topped by profile birds were distributed. At the top of the headdress a standing gold ram was somehow affixed. However many plaques were actually attached to the Issyk hood, 18 the
18 Different reconstructions of the hood have been proposed by K.A. Akishev and by his son, A. K. Akishev (1984). The setting of the solid gold ram at the top of the headdress would have necessitated a stiff internal frame. The interrelationship of caprids and horses on the front of the hood is also problematic. Although this is the only such well-preserved headdress, finds from plundered Saka burials at Tenlik and Alagou, in the Tyan-Shan, indicate that this may well have been a particular type of headdress that was not uncommon. Issyk has been dated to the fifth century, also, but for a number of reasons that dating seems early by one or two centuries (Jacobson 1985).

ensemble would have recreated a mountain setting, the top of which was crowned by a horned ram. On the sides of the mountain-hood, birds sat on trees and felines lived and predated on mountain caprids. On its front, a composite of caprids and horses was mediated by wings. The Issyk headdress thus combined images of predation, transformation, and axial order within a structure rooted in a pictorial realism. It translated into the realistic terms of a mountainous setting the mythic events implicitly and mythically referred to in the Aluchaideng headdress ornament and in the Tuekta and Pazyryk horse outfits. In the case of the Issyk headdress, the implied axis was that of a mountain, and the ram with the curved horns was associated with the top of that mountain. In this respect, the Issyk headdress recalls the caprid horns which had been mounted on a horse from Tuekta 1, and the horns with standing felines from the same barrow which suggested the transformation of horn into a hilly landscape. In the case of the earlier Tuekta headdress, the wooden horns served as a metaphor for the axial mountain and the felines referred statically to the existence and function of the predator within that setting. In the case of the Issyk headdress, representing later Saka culture, the mountain image is explicit and the representation of predatory felines within a mountainous setting is unmistakable. Juxtaposed, the Tuekta horns and the Issyk headdress suggest an evolution in the representation of mythic traditions, within which the mountain was a central reference point. Considered as a group of organizing systems, the horse and human headdresses from Tuekta, Pazyryk, and Issyk indicate that there existed at least two models for articulating the vertical axis. In addition to the mountain form recreated by the Issyk headdress, there was the vertical axis created by symmetrically arranged foliage, wings, and antlers. The transformation of antlers into tree-like forms, the branches of which end in bird heads, suggests that antlers and wings were a metaphor for trees or for the central axial tree. The Issyk headdress suggests that the explicit representation of the mountain may have been a late development, one dependent on the emergence of a concern for realism.
8. Late Scytho-Siberian Headdresses and the "Woman under the Tree"
Within the Early Nomadic funerary regalia, the headdress was clearly a central element. It could take one of several forms-diadem, cowl, hood, or crown. The simplest headgear was a diadem, usually fashioned from wood or leather and often covered in gold. They were frequently carved

78 THE SYMBOLIZING ORDER OF IMAGES
with scenes of animal predation organized around the implied central axis. Diadems were associated with females and males and they might have been used to crown a cowl of perishable material. As far as can be judged from surviving materials, diadems seem also to have been a common form of ornament among the far western relatives of the Early Nomads, the Scythians. Fine gold examples have been recovered from Kelermes, Kul Oba, Olbia, and the Three Brothers barrows near Kerch (Piotrovsky 1987: pls. 45-46, 183; 223; Minns [1913] 1971: figs. 288289). These diadems, however, are all ornamented with the floral elements, fantastic beasts, and technical intricacies which indicate Greek taste and possibly Greek workmanship. They carry no reference to the Siberian images of animal predation nor does their ornamentation refer to a single central axis. The cowl recovered from Pazyryk 2 indicates the Early Nomadic use of a head cover of perishable material. It seems to have been a variation on the nomadic hood, of which the Issyk version offers a magnificent, if impractical, version. 19 There are many scattered materials which indicate that the hood and the cowl were a standard form of head cover among the Scytho-Siberians. The most vivid representation of the Scythian hood may be found on the gold vessel from Kul Oba. A number of the figures there wear what appear to be soft pointed headcoverings which fit closely down over the wearers' ears and neck. Males were not, however, the only ones to wear hooded head gear. At Ulandryk and Tashanta, both males and females could carry pyramidal structures or hair piled up in pyramidal form. The woman in the late burial of Tashanta II/3 had worn her hair in a large conical shape around an internal frame. At the top of her headdress had been placed the head (and body?) of a deer or horse. At the front of her hair was a large carved deer with split body and a single protruding head (Kubarev 1987a: pl. XCil/11). Hooded shapes were sometimes worn by Scythian women. The woman found in the fourth century barrow of Chertomlyk had also been buried in some kind of a hood or pointed headdress (Minns [1913] 1971: 161; fig. 45/16). The headdress had been ornamented with 57 gold plaques showing a seated female holding a mirror up before a smaller male figure who drinks from a rhyton (pl. Vic). The seated woman wears a soft cowl which falls over her head to her shoulders. In another plaque
19 A hardened crested hood recently recovered from Ak-Alakh, Gorno-Altayskaya A.O., may represent a simple funerary version. That crest indicates the probable manner in which the crests from Ulandryk and Yustyd were mounted on headgear (cf. Kubarev 1987a, 1991).

THE SYMBOLIZING ORDER OF IMAGES 79
associated with the woman buried in Chertomlyk, a similar headdress is worn by a frontally seated woman (pl. Vld). In this case, the woman is approached by a smaller male on her right, while on her left stands an altar or branch. Yet another gold plaque from the Scythian traditionthis one cruder and of seemingly late date-was found at Merdzhana in the Kuban region (Artamonov 1969: pl. 331). Here a woman is depicted sitting frontally, holding a bud-shaped object in her hand. Her headdress takes the form of a long cowl, falling on either side of her head. To her right stands a tree; to her left, a post is topped with the head of a horse. Approaching from the left is a man on a horse. Artamonov has pointed to the non-Scythian aspect of this figure's clothing (Artamonov 1969: 82), but his hair and beard are Scythian in style and texture. Moreover, the image of the seated woman in relationship to a male is reminiscent of the images on the Chertomlyk plaques. These several instances of the same scene are certainly related to the images on the large hanging from Pazyryk 5. In every instance, a male on foot or on horseback addresses a seated woman as if in the position of suppliant or worshipper. In each instance, also, the woman is associated with a tree, a branch, or an altar. A young woman interred in the third century Karagodeuashkh burial, in the Kuban, had also worn a tall and pointed headdress ornamented with a triangular gold plaque (Piotrovsky 1987: pl. 232). The plaque appears to have been cut out of a larger composition divided into three horizontal friezes. In the lower section a seated woman wearing a tall pointed headdress is represented; she holds a large cup while on either side three males (one visible only through his arm) pledge her with raised cups or rhyta (pl. Vie). Behind her stand two woman in cowls. In the middle frieze a robed woman stands between two horses, and in the topmost section stands a single frontal female. Although much in this burial reflects Hellenic taste and workmanship, the images in this gold plaque seem to refer not to Greek representational traditions, but rather to representations found elsewhere in the nomadic world-as in the Chertomlyk plaques and the Pazyryk hanging. The hood and the cowl were not the only significant forms of head gear among the Scytho-Siberians; no less important was a kind of blocky crown associated with women. One such crown was found with the woman buried in Pazyryk 5. According to Rudenko, the woman had been partially shaven, but to her headdress of wood was attached a long pigtail composed of her own hair and horse hair (Rudenko 1970: 104; pl. 66/a). Curiously, one finds the same kind of blocky headdress and shaven head in the case of the woman repeated eight times on the wall hanging from

the same burial (pl. Via). It is not simply the great size of this hanging nor the clearly superior position of the woman which impresses th1! viewer. The hanging conveys a powerful sense of solemn purpose, carried in large measure by the female image. She holds one hand to her mouth in a gesture which might indicate speech. In her other hand she grasps the large branch with fanciful foliage. The images on the Pazyryk felt hanging certainly refer to some mythic tradition and in some manner to the processes catalyzed by death. We do not know how this hanging was used, but Gryaznov has suggested that it was hung around the bier of the dead during the actual construction of the burial chamber. 20 It is significant that an almost identical grouping of male and female occurs in the plaques from late Scythian burials, referred to above. Equally evident is the correspondence between the images on the hanging and those on the pair of anecdotal plaques from the Siberian Treasure of Peter the Great (pl. Vlb). Those plaques, also, convey a similar sense of solemnity. Like the woman in the hanging, the woman seated beside the tree is shaved and wears a blocky crown terminating in a long projection which loops up into the branches of the tree like a flexible rope or pigtail. The fine young horsemen recall the handsome rider on the Pazyryk hanging. Gryaznov is certainly correct in seeing a narrative purpose in these plaques (Gryaznov 1961). The scene creates the impression that death has called one of the riders, and that the moment of death is somehow bound to the figure of the woman under the tree. Similarly, the felt hanging from Pazyryk 5 can be associated with death by its placement outside the north wall of the burial chamber; its imagery in turn joins the female figure and tree, just as the plaques from Chertomlyk, Merdzhana, and Karagodeuashkh indicate that representations of seated women addressed by males carrying rhytons or cups and in association with altars or branches were in some manner appropriate to the rituals accompanying death. No blocky wooden headdresses have been found in Scythian burials, but gold crowns of a similar blocky shape have been found. A particularly impressive example was found in association with the woman buried in Chertomlyk. Standing 25 cm. high, it includes four friezes with tendrils and battling animals and two rows of hanging buds or nuts. Another version was found in the fourth century burial of a "priestess" at Great Bliznitsa, but there the images represent Amazons battling eagle-griffins (Piotrovsky 1987: pls. 226-228, 233).

THE SYMBOLIZING ORDER OF IMAGES 81
The most striking example of the block-shaped crown actually comes from a post-Scythian burial at Khokhlach in the Don-Dniepre steppe. The find is traditionally called the Novocherkassk hoard; it is associated with a Sarmatian woman, that is with a high-ranking member of the group which displaced the Scythians in the last years of the first millennium B.C. Despite the lateness of its date, the crown is of great interest-not only because it represents the outflow of the ScythoSiberian tradition, but more because it indicates the extent to which an Hellenic tradition of realism had by then transformed the bird, caprid, and deer images of the earlier nomads. 21 The center of crown is marked by a carved stone female bust. On either side of the stone portrait were arranged large bezeled stones and modeled gold eagles, each set frontally and inlaid with stones. Along the upper edge of the crown were arranged elaborate cast and inlaid elements: at the center, a large leafy tree, and on either side of the tree, antlered deer, horned caprids, smaller trees, and water birds. The leaves of the tree hung on rings to allow movement with the movement of the crown's wearer. Some other pendant must also have hung from the noses and beaks of each of the animals and birds since they were all fitted with gold rings. The organization of images on the Novocherkassk crown reaffirms the association of deer and tree (or of caprid and tree), and of tree, bird, and antlered or horned animal. Equally important is the association of a tree and female image with the central vertical axis. This organization recalls the implied axis created by the pairing of plaques from the Siberian Treasure, where the woman sits under a tree, bound by the extensions of her headdress to the branches above her. There are two other crowns or crown substitutes which fill out this discussion and confirm the probability that the tree and the female represent a late translation of images earlier rendered in other forms.
21 The hoard has been dated by Minns as late as the second-third centuries A.D., primarily on the basis of the chalcedony bust of an "empress" mounted on its face (Minns (1913] 1971: 235-236, 280-282). The identification of this image, however, and the consequent late dating are insecure. Sulimirsky associates the hoard with an Alanic group of Sarmatians from east of the Urals and proposes a date in the mid-second century A.D.. He refers to a tradition associating women with elaborate diadems or crowns auested to in finds from Eastern Europe as early as the second millennium B.C. and the widespread continuation of that tradition among Alanic peoples (Sulimirski 1970b). The crown was damaged when found and has been variously reconstructed. According to the version published by Minns and taken from N. P. Kondakov, two caprids would flank the central tree on either side, followed by the deer. In the reconstruction of the crown in the Hermitage Museum and as published by Sulimirsky (Sulimirski 1970b: fig. 57), deer flank the central tree, followed by caprids and another pair of deer.

Both crowns come from the burials at Tillya-Tepe in northern Afghanistan. The site is dated between the first century B.C. and the first century A.D. and appears to have belonged to a ruling group of the pre-Buddhist Yuezhi centered in Bactria. As such, it may be characterized as the latest intact burial site associated with the early nomadic peoples of Central Asia. The materials found in the Tillya-Tepe graves reflect the eclectic tastes of a group of nomads who were poised to become the center and force behind the Indian Kushan dynasty. Nonetheless, within those eclectic references are clear traces of the older nomadic artistic tradition, transmitted in the form of richly inlaid gold ornaments and scenes of animal predation. The female buried in Tillya-Tepe 6 was laid in a coffin with her head to the west and pillowed in a shallow, silver dish. The crown she wore was made of a flexible gold band to which were attached five magnificent cut-gold trees (Sarianidi 1985: 46-48, pls. 12-15; Sarianidi 1989: 117-120, 144). In the upper boughs of the trees were cut-gold birds. Soldered to each of the trees were flowers with central bezels for inlay surrounded by granulation. Disks were attached by twisted gold wire to the petal and to the lateral branches of the trees. Similar flowers with attached disks were soldered to the forehead band; in some of the central bezels traces of the original turquoise inlay inlay. In its overall dimensions and generalized shape, the crown must have resembled the large headdress found in Pazyryk 5, those worn by the woman of the Pazyryk 5 wall hanging, and that worn by the woman in the plaques from the Siberian Treasure. In the case of the plaques and wall hanging, the tree either shades the woman or is held by her. In the case of the Novocherkassk crown, the tree rises above the image of the woman (and the presumed female wearer of the crown). In the case of the Tillya-Tepe crown, the tree is the crown and crowns the axis of her head. The delicacy of the crown's workmanship, its deliberate fabrication to reflect the movement of the wearer, and its imagistic reference to the natural world recall the earlier Altay and Saka traditions of headdresses, the delicate movement allowed in the Aluchaideng headdress and in one of the birds of the Siberian Treasure, as well as that of the Novocherkassk crown. Every aspect of this crown refers to a specifically nomadic tradition rather than to any crown tradition associated with Greco-Bactrians, Seleucids, or Parthians. 22
22 According to Sarianidi, Greco-Bactrian, Seleucid, Parthian, and dynastic Kushan rulers wore narrow fillet-diadems rather than crowns. Parthian noblewomen wore veils secured by narrow tiara (Sarianidi 1985: 48). Kushan coins indicate a great variety of helmet types and crest ornaments, but nothing analogous to the tree crown.

The other headdress recovered from Tillya-Tepe was apparently a construction intended for use within the burial ritual. This crownsubstitute (Sarianidi 1985: pis. 112-121; Sarianidi 1989: 89-90, 135135) was found in the male burial of site 4, where a number of objects done in a clearly nomadic tradition were also found. According to Sarianidi, the head of the deceased was laid on a small cushion cradled in a gold phiale which carried an inscription in Greek. Attached to the side of the bow1was a golden tree with dangling disks and pearls and the beautifully modeled figurine of a ram with full curl horns. Sarianidi believes that the ram had been fabricated by a Greco-Bactrian master in the period preceding the Yuezhi hegemony and that it was inserted into the crown construction because of its status value. But if the ram were foreign-made, it nonetheless fit within the representational traditions of the nomadic world. 23 It is not clear how the tree and ram would have been attached to the phiale. The base of the tree has four perforated wings, while the feet of the ibex were each fitted with a disk for attachment. The rim of the phiale, on the other hand, shows no perforation by which to attach tree or ram. Originally, both tree and ram must have been attached to some other objects but were reassembled here in proximity to the man's head in response to some compelling ritual concern. The Tillya-Tepe headdresses confirm the proposed association of tree and death. The resulting organization of elements-tree, birds, horned or antlered animals, and the vertical axis marked by the head of the dead-recalls the earlier Issyk hood and the Novocherkassk crown. In the Novocherkassk crown, the tree at the center was combined with deer and flanked by horned caprids. In the Issyk headdress, the hood referred to a mountain and the head of the central axis was marked by a horned animal. The tree, the central axis, and the associated birds on the TillyaTepe woman's crown translate into realistic images the principles of order embodied in a number of the Altay headdresses and plaques. Within that order, the horse could be transformed into a deer or a caprid. Considered in light the symbolic systems indicated by head wear from Issyk, Novocherkassk, and Tillya-Tepe, it is possible to understand the deer's bird-headed antlers as a metaphor for the branches of trees, just as the Tuekta wooden horns with standing felines are revealed as a
23 The identification of the species of animal is difficult. Its compact body, large curled horns, and neck ruff suggest an urial or possibly a tur, but the pronounced curl of the horns and their particular ridging is more reminiscent of an argali. The accurate identification of this animal would have to take into consideration, among other elements, the ecological niche occupied by the intended animal and the relationship of that animal to a total mythic tradition among the nomads (cf. Geist 1971; Schaller 1977).

metaphor for a mountainous setting. The Novocherkassk and TillyaTepe crowns, however, are far distant from the archaic visions of the early nomadic world. What earlier had been symbolic metaphor became translated into direct representation. Gone were any indications of the animal predation around which the earlier Altay headdresses were developed. The realism submerged itself in decorative flourishes and reasserted throughout the Tillya-Tepe finds reflects a specifically GrecoBactrian taste: a taste informed by urban sophistication and imperial ambitions rather than by the archaic mythic order of the northern Altay. The use of a tree as a crown is not known within Greco-Bactrian traditions, nor can such ornamental trees be found outside the early nomadic world during the first millennium B.C.24 The trees from TillyaTepe may be compared with three unprovenanced gold trees with movable hanging leaves in the Siberian Treasure of Peter the Great (Artamonov 1973: pis. 274-276). One was intended to be attached to some kind of a base; the others were perhaps mounted on staffs. The sculptural treatment of all three recalls the tree from Tillya-Tepe 4, while the realistic leaves echo those hanging on the trees of the Novocherkassk crown. The Tillya-Tepe finds suggest that the unprovenanced trees were used in a similar manner: in life the purpose unknown, but in death to mark the head-the significant axis-of the individual buried. Although no headdresses have been found which can be dated earlier than those from Pazyryk and Tuekta, the sophistication involved in the imag.._ry and organization of those examples indicates an established and thus presumably older tradition. The repetition of archaic crouched and coiled felines, large beaked-heads, recumbent caprids and deer throughout the materials of seventh and sixth century barrows-Arzhan, Chiliktin, Kelermes-indicate the outlines of an archaic mythic formulation. Objects from these early sites and others join individual images into instructive relations. Thus, the Kelermes gorytus cover (Piotrovsky 1987: pl. 23) combines the crouched feline and recumbent elk, drawing together, as it were, the separate prey and predator. The gold horse frontlet from Zhurovka, barrow 401 (Piotrovsky 1987: pl. 71) joins archiac images of a recumbent deer, an eagle, and beak-heads. It is only
24 The single possible exception to this rule comes from the Han dynasty. These were the so-called "money trees" associated with the goddess Xiwangmu and her cult, but they were not used as crowns (Wu 1987). By contrast, the gold tree crowns from the Silla Kingdom of Korea, fifth-sixth centuries A.D. (Choi 1979: pis. 1-37), offer a fascinating analogy to the nomadic tree crowns, just as the timber chamber burials from that period offer parallels to early nomadic burial rituals. The difficulty with the Korean material is that it is apparently considerably later than the materials from Tillya-Tepe.

THE SYMBOLIZING ORDER OF IMAGES 85
in the material from Tuekta and Pazyryk that one begins to find a certain indication of the complex symbolic systems which joined these images conceptually as well as visually. Within those systems, animals alone or joined through the act of predation are repeatedly referred to a central vertical axis. The consistency with which that structure reasserts itself in the Altay material indicates that significance was accorded to vertical axial order, to bilateral symmetry, and to the ordering of images in terms of predation and transformation. One is led to conclude that these symbolic structures referred to a significant mythic order, the reiteration of which was essential at the time of a person's death. The continuity of the tradition established in the materials from Tuekta and Pazyryk is marked in later finds. The Aluchaideng headdress ornament, dated to the early fourth century B.C., belongs also to that Altay tradition as it extended south into the Ordos. The Issyk headdress clearly reaffirms the significance of the central vertical axis and of the bilaterally symmetrical arrangement of predation and transformation motifs. The burials at Ulandryk have been reliably dated between the fifth and first centuries B.C. The headdresses from Tillya-Tepe and Novocherkassk are the latest in our chronology. In their imagery they join realism to the patterns of a mythic order. Taken as a specific artifact type, the early nomadic headdress for humans is represented by only a small group of examples-too small to allow any absolute conclusions regarding meaning. The consideration of the headdress proper can be enlarged, however, by the consideration of other forms of head ornamentation, such as diadems, cowls, and hoods. When to _this material is added the elaborate horse regalia from Tuekta and Pazyryk, clear patterns in the ordering of images begin to emerge. Those patterns become even more clearly defined when the horse outfits and their structural order are compared with recovered sets of human burial regalia and with unprovenanced and provenanced plaques. The headdress was part of a ritual regalia carried by humans and by horses. It reaffirmed a central vertical axis around which were elaborated the structures of symbolic animal predation and attendant animal transformation. Within that transformation, the association of antler, foliage and bird was critical, as was also the association of horn and mountain. The headdresses from Issyk, Tillya-Tepe, and Novocherkassk, however, rooted as they are in realistic imagery, intimate that the earlier vertical axis represented by horse and human and elaborated by images of animal predation was in fact a tree or a mountain: the Tree of Life or the World Mountain, joining the realm of the living with that of the spirits.

86 THE SYMBOLIZING ORDER OF IMAGES
such a system, wolves and felines were the symbols of that change which was catalyzed by death but which in fact was the process of metamorphosis from one form of being to another, and thus from one realm to another. The horned caprid of the mountain and the antlered deer of the tree were thus the most fitting symbols of the unity of destruction and renewal encompassed by metamorphosis and passage. Griffinated, the eagle-like birds referred to raptors which seize their prey on the ground and carry the meat to their nesting young. From its participation in this visible cycle of renewal, bound to earth, tree, and the heavens, the raptor functioned as the being that most appropriately symbolized and sanctified the process of death and renewal. These considerations illuminate the bird's ambiguous presence on the Aluchaideng headdress, its feathers adorning the lssyk headdress, its griffinated forms in the Pazyryk headdresses, and its frontal prominence on the Pazyryk chest straps and bridles and on the Novocherkassk crown. Within such a symbolic system, horses were incidental to the underlying mythic structure, at least in the early period. They served as the steeds on which the dead made their journey to the next world, and they served to carry significant imagery, particularly that referring to deer antlers and the Tree of Life. The horse trappings from Tuekta and Pazyryk and plaques such as those from Verkhne-Udinsk and Katanda argue, however, that the horse in regalia was a practical solution to a mythic need: the requirement for an antlered animal to serve as the dead man's vehicle. The materials from Ulandryk indicate that it was only in the late nomadic period that horses in their own right may have become a legitimate part of that mythic process of death and renewal. Moreover, within the late first millennium B.C., realism became a value in and of itself. That emergent realism, unquestionably joined to profound changes in political and religious life, may ultimately have forced the submergence of the animal-spirit which was both the source of life and the guardian of the dead: that spirit from which emerged the World Tree or which existed as a metaphor for the World Mountain. The axis revealed in the headdresses of the Early Nomads and in the regalia of their horses was rooted in the certainty that death was a process ofchange that occurred along or through, or by reference to a tree (of life) or a (world) mountain. The process of the journey represented by tree or mountain could also be indicated symbolically by other image structures: by antlers of leaf-shaped form and by antlers with bird-headed tines; by horns or by horns which assumed the configuration of mountains; by the forms of animal predation. At the same time, the process or

THE SYMBOLIZING ORDER OF IMAGES 87
journey symbolized by axis, tree, mountain, antlers, or horns was associated with an animal-spirit, one which ruled over both life and death. In its archaic stage, this animal spirit was an antlered or horned animal, cervid or caprid. Its antlers were a metaphor for the Tree of Life while its horns may have referred to the World Mountain, or axis mundi. Working backwards, however, through the gradual emergence ofimages referring to the real world and through the gradual appearance of anthropomorphic representation indicates that the original animal-spirit was female in gender. Represented as a deer or caprid in the art of South Siberia and as a deer throughout much of the early Scytho-Siberian period, with the passage of time and the influx of Near Eastern and Hellenic traditions of representation she gradually assumed the form of a human female. She might be seated holding a branch or represented under a tree, or she might be recreated as the dead under the tree crown. It is certain that this being was rooted in ancient Siberian traditions and that her original substance was that of an antlered or horned animal. Across the Early Nomadic world, the reiteration of a seated female in association with a post or a tree and addressed by one or more men insists again upon the existence of a common mythic tradition. The woman's appearance in the Pazyryk felt hanging does not indicate that she was a sudden import from outside the nomadic world. It more likely refers to the circumstance of survival of otherwise perishable materials. It also refers, however, to the anthropomorphization of mythic powers which earlier had been given only zoomorphic form. 25 The material detailed in this chapter suggests that the tree and the mountain mediated between the symbolic systems ofvertical axial order, zoomorphic predation, zoomorphic transformation, and the figure of a female. But who was this female and what was her place in the world of the dead? The clarification of these questions requires a broader range of material: that embedded in the stone carvings and paintings of Neolithic and Bronze Age South Siberia.
25 If one excludes the human imagery which derives from Near Eastern (perhaps Urartian) sources, (e.g., that on the gold sword scabbard and silver mirror from Kelermes), then it is only in the fifth century barrow of Solokha that one finds in Scythian art the intrusion of human representations where there earlier had existed only the representations of animals. It is also in this period that the archaic images of the early nomadic world begins to give way to Hellenized forms: the panther begins to turn into a lion, the eagle or beak-head into an eagle-griffin, and the deer is gradually replaced by a horse.

CHAPTER FOUR
ROCK CARVINGS AND PAINTINGS FROM THE NEOLITHIC AND AENEOLITHIC PERIODS
A. METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Rock carvings and paintings constitute the most substantial body of information for the study of ancient South Siberian artistic and mythic traditions. Yet this resource is accompanied by significant obstacles. The first such obstacle is obvious: the great number of recorded images still does not insure inclusiveness. While it is possible that the most important petroglyphic complexes have been recorded, every year brings the discovery of yet more sites containing new material: material capable of upsetting carefully constructed understandings of chronology and cultural diffusion. More problematic is the destruction of known sites. In many cases that destruction has occurred through time and by the elements. Cliffs formerly covered with images now lie crumbled as a result ofrock falls or due to the more prosaic processes induced by freezing and thawing. 1 However, time and the elements are not, unfortunately, the most effective agents in this destruction. Human acts, particularly those of this century, have been far more efficient in wiping out the petroglyphic record of millennia. The construction of the Bratsk hydroelectic station on the Angara River inundated many superb Neolithic petroglyphic complexes between Ust'-Uda and Zayarsk. The construction of the Sayan-Shushensk hydroelectric project on the upper Yenisey has resulted in the inundation of the Mugur-Sargol complex in Tuva. The Krasnoyarsk reservoir on the Yenisey submerged many of the richest petroglyphic sites dating to the Neolithic and Bronze Ages in the Minusinsk Basin, such as those at Ust' -Tuba, Shalabolin, and Oglakhtin. Such destruction prevents significant reconsideration of the original images within their original settings.
1 The site of Saimaly-Tash in the Fergana Range, surely one of the most important petroglyphic complexes in Central Asia, is also one of the most spectacular examples of destruction by earthquakes and rock fall (Bernshtam 1952; Frumkin 1970: 44-47). The small site of Yalbak-Tash over the Chuya River in Gorno-Altayskaya A.O. exemplifies the more prosaic and more common crumbling of smooth surfaces as water and plants work their way into the cracks of the rocky faces.

ROCK CARVINGS AND PAINTINGS 89
More complex than the accidental or purposeful destruction of sites are the problems created by deliberate overcarving and recarving. When in modern times such overcarving occurs we are likely to call it vandalism. This kind of overcarving, however, has been occurring for thousands of years, complicating and enriching the petroglyphic record. At times such reworking actually helps to clarify chronology. At SaimalyTash, for example, the carving of a two-wheeled cart over the images of a deer and bull indicate a chronological sequence which could facilitate more generalized, relative dating (Sher 1980: fig. 110). An elk carved over the images of two boats at Ust' -Tuba III on the middle Yenisey also indicates patterns of chronological sequence (Sher 1980: fig. 80). To be meaningful, however, such superimpositions must be repeated on a regular basis. Only then does circumstance depart from the accidental and indicate the outlines of a reliable historical process. More troublesome are those innumerable instances where later images are inserted around or between earlier images, thus creating the impression (for the modern viewer) that certain representations would actually occur together. Since the technique of carving may not vary radically from one period to another-at least not before the early Iron Age-and since wear and tear may obscure subtle distinctions in execution, it is not necessarily possible to determine which images go with others. An example of this is offered at Kalbak-Tash by the juxatposition of an ordered row of deer with large figures arranged in ritual postures. There is no way of telling if the two groups of images were done at the same time and refer to some common ritual practice or myth. It is not difficult to imagine a Bronze Age artist taking advantage of the row of deer to carve a new group of figures who have some reference to wild animals; it is also possible, however, to imagine that such an artist simply took advantage of a large empty space on the east-facing wall-a space that happened to be next to a row of deer. Two other complications of an intellectual character must be mentioned here. One has to do with the established tradition of assigning to particular images a predetermined symbolic load. This approach concludes by shaping the emerging "new" culture in terms of known traditions originating outside the particular region being studied. The newly interpreted image becomes a sign of that foreign culture's intrusion. In some cases, these assumptions seem reasonable. For example, the female elk images associated with the Baykal Neolithic are sufficiently consistent in style and techniques of execution that their appearance suggests a continuity of culture, rather than some kind of fortuitous

90 ROCK CARVINGS AND PAINTINGS
coincidence. When these images appear within South Siberia but outside the established perimeters of the Baykal Neolithic one may safely conclude that they are signs of the intrusion of the more northern culture. On the other hand, the appearance of female elk images in the Ural Mountains and in parts of Karelia and Scandinavia does not necessarily indicate an actual continuity of culture; it may rather indicate certain cultural commonalities among Neolithic peoples of the northern Eurasian forest zone. Similarly problematic are the so-called "masks" of Mugur-Sargol in Tuva, the images of wheeled vehicles ("chariots") found throughout the petroglyphs of northeast Central Asia and South Siberia, the mushroomhatted figures so frequently arranged in ritual poses, and the rows of dancing figures like paper-cut dolls. In considering the trails of these images across broad regions, we must bear in mind that at each stage of removal from their homelands, the myths and rituals underlying imagery are necessarily reformulated. Distance, changes in climate, changes in physical geography, and the resulting pressures placed upon traditional economies must have deposited their own sediment of meaning over cultural layers already represented by older images. Thus, stability of outer form does not predetermine a continuity of meaning; indeed, such stability more likely masks constant change within the symbolic load of images. Related to the issues of image diffusion and the concommitant modification of symbolic load are the interpretative distractions inherent in the very naming of images. "Chariots," "sun-heads," "bulls," and "warriors," offer but four examples of the manner in which terminology effectively ends by prejudicing critical discourse. Such terms are invariably freighted by references to other traditions where texts exist to clarify images. In those cases, the texts help one to ascertain the existence of, for example, solar worship, a warrior class, or the association of chariots and aristocracy. In light of Indo-European and Near Eastern traditions, "chariots" conjure up a warrior, aristocratic elite with its own social and political presumptions. The term "sun-head" or "solar-mark" assumes the nature of the referent-the sun-and shapes the assigned meaning in terms of the solar cults of textually known traditions from the Near East and lndo-European traditions. Throughout the intellectual discourse surrounding the study of South Siberian and Central Asian petroglyphs, the cultural load carried by terminology has gradually been shifted from old references, derived from distant traditions, to new images. This discussion cannot promise to evade altogether

the dangers involved in naming images. The necessity of creating a common vocabulary may frequently seem to outweigh a concern for refining the relationship of terminology to image. To the extent possible, however, I will attempt to avoid the pitfalls of assigning culturally-laden terms to image types.
B. THE FIRST TRADITION:
THE ELK OF THE SIBERIAN NEOLITHIC PERIOD
The most characteristic image of the Baykal Neolithic period is that of the female elk. Monumental in effect and often in size, usually represented as if in full stride to the right, the thousands of repetitions of her figure attest to her centrality in contemporary religious beliefs. The region in question included, to the east, Lake Baykal and the lower Selenga Valley, and to the west that region defined by the upper Lena, the Angara, and the middle Yenisey, with extensions west to the Tom' River. Okladnikov has divided the Baykal Neolithic into a number of stages: the Isakovo stage (fourth millennium); the Serovo stage (fourththird millennium); Kitoy stage (third-early second millenium B.C.) (Okladnikov 1959a). The great petroglyphic representations of elk and in particular of female elk are dated to the Serevo stage; during the Kitoy, that image lost its impressive monumentality. While that dating may put the great images of the elk far too early, there is no question that theyor rather, she-is a product of the Neolithic period and that she had effectively disappeared by the beginning of the second millennium B.C. The image complex centered on the figure of the female elk and so characteristic of the Baykal Neolithic is best represented by petroglyphs found on the upper reaches of the major Siberian rivers. Along the Tom' River, major sites include cliffs south of Tomsk, another site further south, nearTutal'skoe, and a third group further south, near Novoromanovo (Okladnikov and Martynov 1972). The Angara River was particularly rich in Neolithic imagery, with major sites located throughout its flow from a point north of Irkutsk to just north of Bratsk, and again along the lower Angara in the region of the inflows of the Irkineeva and Kamenka rivers (Okladnikov 1966).2 Okladnikov has also identified a number of important sites in the region of the upper and middle Lena River (Okladnikov 1977; Okladnikov and Zaporozhskaya 1972). 3
2 Much of this material has now been lost under the so-called Bratsk Sea. 3 This Neolithic tradition may be compared with that recorded in the northern Ural Mountains (Chernetsov 1964, 1971) and in Karelia (Ravdonikas 1936; Formozov 1969;

92 ROCK CARVINGS AND PAINTINGS
The petroglyphs of the Tom' River typify this Baykal Neolithic imagistic complex. In most cases, the images were scraped and chippedinto cliffs which faced to the south. The elk are almost always antlerless and thus certainly female. The outlines of their bodies and four legs are represented with an extraordinary realism, revealing the vitality of this majestic animal (pl. Vllf). Their heads and bodies are characteristically outstretched, the legs bent, the whole form expressive of the animal's surging power. Sometimes the elk are only outlined; at other times their heads are treated in silhouette but their outlined necks and chests are treated with internal lines, in a so-called "x-ray" style. To the same broad period are dated the images of boats with vertical lines which are believed to refer to human figures or human souls (Okladnikov and Martynov 1972: fig. 113).4 Because these early and monumental elk images usually occur on south-facing cliffs and because they are frequently accompanied by enigmatic circles, Okladnikov and Martynov have concluded that sun cults and solar rituals figured importantly in the life of Neolithic Siberia.. The boats frequently underlying or overlaying the elk refer to the passage of the dead from one world to another (Okladnikov and Martynov 1972: 251-252).5 The fact that the elk images are predominantly female would indicate that the religious beliefs in question referred to that animal as the source of life. Assuming that the boats do refer to the passage after death, one may conclude that the juxtaposition of elk and boats indicates that the female elk must also have been invoked in funerary rituals. The finest images from the region of the Tom' River are certainly those of the Tom' and Tutal' sk groups, while those of the Novoromanovo cliff are considerably cruder. By virtue of their frequent placement over the images of boats or elk, the scattered and strange anthropomorphic figures certainly belong to a later period, most probably that of the early Bronze Age. As for the scattered images of anthropomorphic figures
Savvataev 1970, 1977). These traditions, in turn, suggest significant connections with those of Neolithic Scandinavia, with its characteristic images of elk, boats, and horned anthropomorphic figures. 4 Also included in this early layer of images are bear images, stripes, disks, and possibly circles with inset circles or with spokes, as well as heart-shaped masks which suggest panSiberian connections both with the Amur Basin and Neolithic imagery from the northern Urals (Okladnikov and Martynov 1972: figs. 185,217,242, 244, 272; Okladnikov 1971; Okladnikova 1978). 5 Okladnikov's interpretation is certainly strengthened when one recalls that still today, among many northern Siberian peoples, the dead are "buried" above ground by placing the box in which they are laid on top of their sled, or by placing the dead person in his boat; see, e.g., Gracheva 1971.

with bird-like heads, Okladnikov and Martynov date them to the Bronze Age, primarily on the basis of their comparison with images on pottery shards from Samus IV, as well as with the bird-headed figures engraved on a stone from Tas-Khazaa, in the Minusinsk Valley, dated by most scholars to the Afanasevo culture ( Kyzlasov 1986: figs. 159, 233; Okladnikov and Martynov 1972: 187-191; Lipskiy 1961; Leont'yev 1978).6 The second great depository of Baykal Neolithic imagery was certainly that of the Angara River before the creation of the Bratsk Sea. The images datable to the Neolithic period include representations of elk, fish, and seals, characteristically carved and chipped-in. 7 The great variation in the size of the Angara elk (pl. Vllh) and the constant overlapping of one figure by another also suggests that a ritual significance resided in the visual repetition of these animals, who normally do not move in herds. Like those of the Tom' River, the Angara elk are virtually all female and are represented in profile with four legs, striding (usually to the right) or standing still. The finest images are rendered with an intense sense of the living animal: its powerful body, the great hump over its withers, its massive head, and soft drooping upper lip. The images of both elk and seals8 testify to the economic centrality of hunting within the Baykal Neolithic. No less monumental or expressive of the natural animal than the Tom' River images, these elk of the Angara Neolithic nonetheless demonstrate a regional stylistic differentiation. Here the animals are somewhat bulkier, the hump of their shoulders more softly curved, their necks and heads heavier. Images of boats appear again among the Angara petroglyphs, as do those of frontal figures; both types of images are frequently done in reddish pigment or in a engraved technique different from that of the massive elk figures. These differences indicate a somewhat later period. A composition from the Second Stone Island includes a massive female elk and an anthropomorphic figure on skis behind her. In this case, the difference in engraving techniques would indicate that the human figure

These are unquestionably the Baykal seal, Phoca siberica, a land-locked species which now only inhabits Lake Baykal, but earlier (before the advent of dams) inhabited the upper Angara River.

was added to the earlier animal image. 9 A group of curious mask-like images from the same island was done in an engraved technique. The images are crude and broken in their remaining patterns, but what remains does suggest a relationship with the strange mask-like faces of the pre-Okunev or Okunev culture of the Minusinsk Basin (Okladnikov 1966: 37, 134-135, pl. 32). In both cases one finds adistinctivereduction of an anthropomorphic entity into the mask-like head; the face is marked by a curious and often faint reference to eyes, nose, mouth; and the masks carry horn-like projections. A number of strange, frequently homed frontal figures from sites such as First Stone Island, Second Stone Island, Third Stone Island (pl. VIie), Balya Sukhaya, Bol'shaya Kada, and Manzya are dated to the Bronze Age by Okladnikov on the basis of their comparison with anthropomorphic figures on pottery shards from the Bronze Age site of Samus IV, near Tomsk (Okladnikov 1966: pls. 29, 90/3-4, 95/9, 103/ 1,105/2, 135, 159, 161, 164, 168; Okladnikov and Martynov 1972: 189). These figures bear an interesting similarity to a frontal horned figure found in 1962 on the upper Yenisey (Lipskiy 1970: 164, fig. 2b), as well as to figures painted on the slabs of the Aeneolithic (late third-second millennium B.C.) Afanasevo burial at Karakol, in Gorno-Altayskaya A.O. (see below). Like many who have looked at these images, Okladnikov refers to the Angara images as shamanistic figures. I shall return to this interpretation in Chapter VII. The cliffs over the upper Lena River were also carved and painted with the images of animals and anthropomorphic figures from the Neolithic and Bronze Ages, as well as with many representations of animals and horsemen from the Iron Age Kurikan tradition. Among the earliest images are female elk, their full bodies distinguishable from elk rendered with antlers and in a more slender style. 10 The horned and occasionally ithyphallic figures are certainly from a later, Bronze Age date. The repetition of images of female elk and boats along the valleys of the great Siberian rivers indicates the extent to which belief systems may
9 Elk were not always engraved into the rock: within the Second Stone Island representions, the rendition of both large female elk and boats in reddish pigment indicate that technique is not necessarily a firm indicator of relative chronology (Okladnikov 1966: 38, pl. 34). 10 In the case of the images at Tai' ma, Okladnikov fails to distinguish these two types of elk (cf. Okladnikov 1977: pis. 56-64). Tal'ma 9 includes a number of anthropomorphic figures which Okladnikov assigns to the Aeneolithic Glaskov period (c. 1800 - 1300 B.C.) and the Bronze Age because a number of them significantly overlay the images of Neolithic elk (cf. Okladnikov 1977: pis. 60, 62).

be shaped by existential realities. The rivers were one of the two most important lifelines of the Siberian Neolithic cultures: they were a rich source of food, they were the roads that led to the land of the sun, the south. They were, however, also the roads which led to the land of cold and darkness, the north. The forests surrounding the rivers were the natural habitat of elk, animals which must have been a primary source of food, skin, bone, and antler. It is not difficult to imagine how boats could become a metaphor for the passage of the soul after death into another world, and how elk could function as metaphor for the everrenewed source of human sustenance. This world of the north was not, however, immutable. The appearance of horned anthropomorphic figures indicate the elaboration of belief and ritual in the ensuing Bronze Age. These images and the appearance of masks at the Second Stone Island in the Angara may also indicate the infiltration of another tradition in the late third and early second millennia B.C. If figures and masks indicate a northward penetration of cultures into the region of the Baykal Neolithic, there is also ample indication of the penetration southwards of that culture. That process is indicated in the rich mix of images found at a multitude of sites along the upper Yenisey River. At a site near the confluence of the Sosnovki and Dzhoy rivers with the Yenisey, for example, a frontal figure with rayed-head, a series of stripes of the type associated with the Angara-Lena tradition, three female elk in the Tom' -Angara style, and a boat have been recorded (Lipskiy 1970: 165, fig. 2). Elk images with large bodies, heavy heads, and softly curving upper lips have been found at II 'inskaya and at the site of Tepsey II. In the latter case, the outlined body of a large female elk lies below the silhouetted and striped-style bodies of cattle, indicating the overlay of a northern culture by a cattle-dependent culture, probably in the Aeneolithic or early Bronze Age (Sher 1980: figs. 62, 71 ). At a number of other sites on Mt. Tepsey many elk images of the Tom' and Angara type, as well as overlaid images of cattle on elk and of elk and boats have been recorded. Such combinations of images probably reflect the contemporaneity of elk and boats and the intrusion of a culturecertainly post-Neolithic-for which cattle imagery was more significant (Sher 1980: 150, figs. 74, 76, 77,79, 80, 83).11 Shalabolin, on the right bank of the Tuba River in Krasnoyarskiy
a Other sites along the Yenisey where images of elk-virtually all characteristically female and facing toward the right-have been recorded include Oglakhtin, Bychikha, and Cheremyshnyi log, four km. above the village ofBaykalovo (Sher 1980: 160 ff, figs. 90, 93, 94, 95.)

Krai, includes an unusually rich layering of images in which elk and boats appear below other imagery-most notably, the images of strange masked figures and cattle. The vast majority of elk images are lacking in antlers and thus may be considered representations of females (pl. Vllg). 12 In other cases, in terms of relative size or the manner in which the animal is arranged with deer and cattle (pl. Vlld) of similarly realistic representation, but relatively static posture, the antlered elk appear to be of a later, Bronze Age date (pl. VIie). Boats also appear regularly in the Shalabolin complex. In one instance, for example, a boat with vertical stripes crosses over the upper body of a powerful female elk moving to the left (Pyatkin and Martynov 1985: fig. 83). In another case, two boats appear beneath the full image of a female elk. It is possible that one of these boats originally crossed over the body of another elk, of which only the head and neck are now visible (Pyatkin and Martynov 1985: fig. 28). Among the southern-most instances of Baykal Neolithic imagery are the paintings of female elk at Turochak on the Biya River, 60 km. from Teletskoe Lake in Gorno-Altayskaya A.O. (Okladnikov and Molodin 1978). These images are rendered in a style most comparable to that established by the Tom' River complex: the female elk are represented with four legs, moving to the right, their bodies sometimes done in openwork and striped patterns. Turochak is not, however, the most southern occurence of individual examples of the Neolithic elk. In the burials at Karakol were found a number of slabs which carried painted and carved images. The partial or complete images of female elk underlay all the other images on the stones. Moreover, a number of these stones had been reversed or turned in their reuse, so that the positioning of the older elk images was rendered senseless. Kubarev dates the burials to the late third- early second millennia B.C. and thus to the Aeneolithic or early Bronze Age (Kubarev 1988). Because of the complexity and importance of the images at Karakol, I will consider them in more detail below. The elk images at Shalabolin, Turochak, and Karakol indicate a finger-like penetration of the Baykal Neolithic culture up the Yenisey and into the northern Altay. The obvious chronological primacy of the female elk image over a vast stretch of South Siberia surely indicates an ancient belief system in which that animal held a central place. As the source of life for her own species and as sustenance for other animals and

humans, it is reasonable to suspect that she was viewed as a magna mater, as an essential element in the survival of individuals and communities. At the same time, the frequent overlay of the elk by boat images and the relationship of the Neolithic elk to major rivers suggests that if the rivers were considered by Neolithic cultures to be the paths souls took to the world of the dead, then the female elk in turn came to be associated as closely with death as they were with life. The petroglyphic tradition repeatedly confirms the proposition that the elk image had essentially disappeared before the appearance of the images of realistic cattle and antlered deer.
C. THE SECOND TRADITION:
ANTHROPOMORPHIC IMAGERY OF THE AENEOLITHIC AND
EARLY BRONZE AGE
We have seen that at some time in the early second millennium B.C. a new set of images made its appearance in South Siberia. Represented by petroglyphs along the Tom', Angara, and Yenisey rivers, and in a distinctively varied form at Shalabolin, at Karakol and Kalbak-Tash in Gorno-Altayskaya A.O., and along the Chuluut Go! in Mongolia, these images focus our attention on forms which seem to combine human and animal elements in what could only have been mythic references. The images stand frontally or in profile, hierarchically still or as if in rapid motion. At times they are reduced to masked conventions; at other times, they are detailed down to their feet and hands. Some are clearly ithyphallic, others are not. Many are female in reference, combining allusions to anthropomorphic females with elements from birds, bovines, and snakes, and sometimes with references to bears. Since the images appear in a number of variations at Karakol in Gorno-Altayskaya A.O., that site offers a useful starting point. In 1985-86, Vladimir Kubarev and his colleagues excavated five burials which had been partly disrupted by bulldozers preparing the site for construction of a community building. The burials took the form of small cists formed by stone slabs. The slabs themselves had been elaborately painted and carved with layers of images, each layer referring to a separate period of time. By virtue of their preservation for thousands of years, the Karakol slabs offer an uncontaminated record of pre- and early Bronze Age cultural layers (pl. VIIIa-f). It is true that most of the Karakol imagery has little to do with the deer image: only the lowest layer, that marked by the image of the elk, testifies to a cultural

preoccupation with the cervid. On the other hand, Karakol serves two important functions, both related to the ultimate concern of this book. By offering a controlled opportunity to examine layers of imagery in a pre-• and early Bronze Age context, it allows a more certain unraveling of the chronological layers in other petroglyphic contexts. Secondly, the excellent state of preservation when the graves were excavated may help to clarify the imagistic references carried by general carvings and paintings from other, open-air, sites. All the burials were constructed from fitted stone slabs, similar to those associated with the Neolithic Isakovo culture of the Angara Valley and very much like the burial structures characteristic of the Aeneolithic Okunev burials of the Minusinsk Valley (early second millennium B.C.). A number of the slabs were marked with carved and painted images on both their inner and outer faces. The images represent several generational layers, with the lowest level of images referring to the: Neolithic period. Furthermore, in a number of cases the slabs had been turned, so that older images were inverted and then overworked as if to obscure, if not obliterate, their appearance. As a result, one can "excavate" layers of imagery on the Karakol slabs, some of which may be separated by generations, others by only a short period of time. A good example of the resulting complexity is offered by the slab which had been set behind the head of the dead man, to the west, in burial 2, kurgan II. 13 In its found position, the slab indicated the reuse of a surface which had been turned clockwise 90 degrees. Its lowest layer, in found position facing downwards, included at the top of the slab a full figure of an elk moving powerfully to the right. In the center and on the right was the head of another elk, this one possibly carrying a small antler. Both images were rendered by a chipping technique and seem to have been done at the same period of time. Kubarev believes that three sturdy caprids in the lower half of the stone may have been done at the same time (Kubarev 1988: 39-40). The next layer over that of the elk included three anthropomorphic figures which had also been chipped-in. Two were represented with frontal heads, great "feathered" headdresses, and legs suggesting they were striding to the right. The headdress of the figure on the left is rendered with particularly long feathers and an outer rim of circular elements, reminiscent of the "eyes" in the feathering of some large birds.
13 This is stone #3. The analysis of layers follows that of Kubarev, but with variations. Kubarev distinguishes five layers of images, but I believe that there may actually only be three principle layers; cf. Kubarev 1988: 37-44, figs. 26-29.

ROCK CARVINGS AND PAINTINGS 99
Another figure with frontal head and two horns may also have been striding to the right, and in the lower right corner of the slab were the remains of a chipped-in head with feather headdress. This second layer of imagery also included a particularly strange figure with long legs bent and stretched as if running to the right. Although badly damaged, the head of this chipped -in figure was marked by a great double loop projecting up and ahead. Similar loops were visible in the lower right comer of the slab and to the right of the running figure's front leg. The overlay of images indicates that the anthropomorphic figures were chipped-in later than the elk. The fact that all the images discussed so far are set so as to move in the same direction also indicates that whatever the original location of this slab--carved when it was still part of a cliff face or used as a dressed slab---the original directionality was honored, if not the integrity of the images. In the case of the topmost layer, however, this was not true. In preparing the slab for its placement in the burial, the maker turned it to the right and superimposed a new figure over all the existing images. This was a large frontal figure with outstretched arms (pl. VIIld). Its body and arms were rendered in darkred color and its large round head and huge bovine-horns were scratchedin. The figure's decisive and formal frontality lends it a distinctive monumentality. A similar chronological process is indicated by the imagery on stone 1, burial 2, kurgan II (pl. VIiia). The lower level includes the chippedin figures of two "loop-headed" figures moving to the right. Between their rendition and the final reuse of the stone for placement in the burial, the slab had been turned 90 degrees to the right. The topmost layer included four figures done in red, black, and white coloring and standing in hieratic frontal postures. The heads of the two on the left of the stone were surrounded by feather-like rays. The preserved face of one was rendered in schematic lines indicating eyes, a mouth, a vertical line between the eyes, and a horizontal line above the mouth. The arms of both these figures terminated in long shapes reminiscent of heavily furred tails. The two figures to the right carried on their heads projections reminiscent of horns or rabbit ears. Their faces were indicated in a schematic, mask-like manner and their raised arms terminate in large three-clawed "hands." Stone 1 of burial 5 had originally carried the chipped-in outlined body of a fine female elk moving to the right (pl. VIIlb). In reusing the slab, however, the artists had again turned it 90 degrees to the right. Three large figures dominated the final upper layer (Kubarev 1988: fig. 43). On

the left was painted a frontal figure with feathered headdress similar to that of the left-most feathered figure from stone 3, burial 2. The feathers around its face are reduced and stylized, producing a masklike appearance, and its hands are replaced by long furtails. On the right of the slab and placed over the figure of the inverted elk was painted another frontal figure with arms raised and extended to the sides, its head reduced to a conical shape with blunt upper end and no features. The central figure combined a profile treatment of the head, of the placement of the arms (to the front and back of its body), and of its legs, thus suggesting movement to the right. Hanging from each "hand" was a branched stick. The most peculiar element is the figure's head. It wears the same kind of feathered headdress as does the figure to its left, but the sideview of the head indicates a distinctly animal-like aspect reminiscent of a bear. From the forehead of the creature emerges a small double loop similar to those of the large loop-headed figure on stone 3 of burial 2. This slab indicates that profile and frontal positioning could exist within the same layer of imagery and thus within the same cultural layer. Furthermore, the appearance of the loop-heads here on the topmost layer and elsewhere on earlier layers suggests that reuse of the stone may actually have occurred within a relatively short period of time and that layers do not necessarily indicate cultural distinctions. The appearance together of painted and carved feathered headdresses also indicates that distinctions in technique may not indicate distinctions in cultural levels. Featfo,red headdresses, animalistic heads, claws, branched "hands," and tail-like hands indicate that the beings represented here combined anthropomorphic and animal characteristics. The masklike treatment of many of the faces is of particular interest. It could refer to the actual wearing of masks by ritual performers, but it could also refer to the face of a deity: terrible, awesome, inhuman. In the case of all of these figures there is no indication of sex. This contrasts with the plainly ithyphallic figures found in the Tom', Angara, and Lena complexes and indicates either that there was no sexuality associated with these non-human beings, or that they were understood as female. A few other slabs from the Karakol burials are covered with similarly complex images. On one slab was found the image of a full frontal figure with outstretched arms, three-fingered hands, and large crescent shaped horns (Kubarev 1988: fig. 49). To its left were the remains of a large figure with a mask-like head and large crescent shaped horns similar to the large figure on the topmost layer of stone 3, burial 2 . On a broken slab from the same burial another large frontal figure with scratched-in

roundhead and horns was painted (Kubarev 1988: figs. 58-59). The body of this figure was somewhat different, with large straight shoulders from which a streamered robe seemed draped. To its right can be seen a scratched-in and painted figure with what seem to be the remains of looped horns. On stone 3, burial 5, faint painted remains revealed a large frontal figure with furtail hands and a large feathered headdress (Kubarev 1988: 66-68, figs. 50-54). Beneath this figure and again indicating that the stone had been turned clockwise 90 degrees were several other elements, including the carved-in figure of a large moose and a featherheaded figure walking to the right. Here again, the appearance offeatherheaded figures on two different levels and in two techniques indicates at most a distinction in generational levels within the same culture. The larger and more hieratic frontal figures are clearly the "latest" in the series represented on these slabs. On the upper section of another badly damaged slab from the fifth burial, it was possible to make out the remains of three figures rendered in a dark raspberry color (Kubarev 1988: fig. 55). Two stood frontally with spread legs and hanging "arms" or sashes. Similar images, painted, scratched, and chipped-in, may be found on yet other slabs; they frequently overlay the images of elk and those of the loop-headed or feather-headed figures. The layering of engravings and paintings on the Karakol slabs and the inverting, reversing, and reworking of used surfaces allow a number of tentative conclusions. The imagery of realistic elk and, perhaps, of realistic caprids, had been devalued by the time of the construction of the graves. The culture responsible for these burials seems to have valued beings which combined certain animal and human elements. The zoomorphic references carried by these beings are to birds (feathers, wings, claws) and cattle (horns). Secondary references may be carried by bear, wolf, or wolverine elements (heads, tails). The loop-headed figures (pl. VIIIa, e) are strange, but not unique. Several such striding images have been recorded at Shalabolin, on the Tuba River (pl. VIia). The meaning of the loop-shape is not clear. Kubarev believes that it refers to a bull horn and indicates a cult of a bull deity, related to the solar cult indicated by the feather-headed figures (Kubarev 1988, 94-101 ). 14
14 A number of petroglyphic motifs are recorded which could support a bovine interpretation of the loops even if they do not necessarily indicate a bull cult. At Dalangash, on the border between Gorno-Altayskaya A.O. and northern Mongolia, a group of square-bodied cattle with loop-shaped elements on their head, as if they were loop-horns filled in, has been recorded. The cattle-definition is provided by the bodies and the tails (Okladnikova 1976: fig. 2).

Novgorodova has related the appearance of a post-Neolithic bull cult (Novgorodova 1989: 85-86) in Mongolia to images of frontal figures, outlined and frequently represented with raised hands, small or absent heads, and bodies which include the backbone and ribs in a fish-spine manner, with a lower body composed of a "skirt" of hanging lines. In some cases there is also added a pronounced indication of the pubic area (Novgorodova 1989: 89-113). There can be no mistaking the female aspect of these figures, and for that reason Novgorodova refers to them as images of the ancestral mother, associated with the (male) hoofed totemic ancestor. She also calls attention to the treatment of the hands of the "mother" images in terms of three-claws, and the fact that the occasional horn or antler-like projections on their heads suggest a conflation of male and female progenitor. Most of these frontal female images have been recorded within the Chuluut Gal complex, but a number of fine examples may also be found at Kalbak-Tash, a rocky ridge in Gorno-Altayskaya A.O. above the Chuya River, about 14 km. east of the Chuya's confluence with the Katon'. The frontality and the unusual treatment of the hands and headgear of these images (pl. IXa,b) suggest that they represent a regional variation on the theme of frontal, horned, or feather-headed figures from Karakol; their presence indicates a cultural connection with the culture represented by the Chuluut Gol figures. The skirts of the Kalbak-Tash figures are reminiscent of the spread tail feathers of a raptor, while their small heads and claw-hands raise the possibility of referring to them as "bird-women." Among this group of images is also a frontal figure which suggests a human in a long-feathered robe (pl. IXd). This particular image is directly comparable to several surviving figures from Karakol: the large frontal figure in streamered robe from burial 2, described above, another from the same burial, and a third from burial 5 (pl. VIiie, f). In contrast to the "bird-women" from Chuluut Gol, those at Kalbak-Tash are not associated with bovine images but rather with the large images of deer. These clearly belong to a later layer of petroglyphs, as is demonstrated by the deer carved over the skirt of one of the women (pl. IXc). In the petroglyphic imagery of Chuluut Gol, Kalbak-Tash, and Karakol, hieratic frontality seems to have carried a greater significance than did the profile or three-quarter positions; but that distinction is blurred by other circumstances. In the imagery of Karakol, both frontal and profile figures could wear similar feathered headdresses. The movement suggested by some of the walking figures from Karakol is puzzling:

where are they going and with what purpose? Perhaps here, as in the case of the Neolithic elk images, is indicated the conviction that the vitality and power of the being represented-zoomorphic or anthropomorphic--could only be expressed in movement. This vitality is also expressed in the frontal figures, but in another manner: their erect postures, forward gaze, and extended arms and legs suggest a vitality held in arrested tension. In considering the extraordinary wealth of information encompassed in the imagery of Karakol, it is also useful to consider another aspect of that information-namely, the elements which are absent. None of the images offer any indication of their sex, except in the inclusion or exclusion of antlers in the case of the elk. There are no images of bulls or of deer, and only three representations of caprids. There are no boats or boat-like elements. On the other hand, the culture responsible for the late Karakol images conceived of its significant deities in terms of quasibird, quasi-bovine anthropomorphic forms, or it assumed that those deities had to be addressed through the mediation of such animal beings. The appearance of these images in burials further suggests that the images themselves, or the beings to which they referred, had to be invoked at the time of death, either as a sign and instrument of death or as a sign and instrument of renewal. Karakol leads one in search ofrelated imagery as a way ofdiscovering relevant cultural connections and as a way of seeking out meaning. In the immediate region of Gorno-Altayskaya A.O. or to the southeast or southwest the search ends only in tentative connections. I have related the frontal images from Karakol-those with aspects of both birds and bovines-to the "bird-women" from Kalbak-Tash and Chuluut Gol. I believe that all these images represent local variations upon the same theme. But there are also similarities between the feather-headed figures of Karakol and images from other petroglyphic complexes. One of the most intriguing sites is that of Tamgaly, located in the Dzhambul' region of Kazakhstan, 170 km. to the northeast of Alma-Ata. At Tamgaly figures with anthropomorphic bodies and large round heads have been recorded (pl. VIIIg, h). Instead offacial features, the heads are filled with geometric patterns, or with dots, or even left "empty" or "filled." Around their heads are extended rays, rows of dots, or combinations of such patterns which produce an effect similar to that of the feathered heads of the Karakol figures. There are, however, significant differences. A number of these figures are associated with animals: several of the figures are placed above animals, as if standing on them, some have tails,

and a few may be ithyphallic. These figures have been referred to as "sun-headed" deities, unquestionably because of their similarity to childlike drawings of the sun; they have been described as indicators of aregional solar cult oflndo-Iranian derivation (Maksimova, Ermolayeva, and Mar'yashev 1985: 9-10). The recorders of the site date the round-headed images from Tamgaly to the Bronze Age, but the evidence for that conclusion is weak. It rests on the conviction that these images are solar deities and that they must therefore reflect Bronze Age Indo-European or Indo-Iranian traditions of the second millennium B.C. Similar conclusions have been assumed regarding the so-called "sun-faced gods" at Saimaly-Tash in the Pamirs (Bernshtam 1952; Sher 1980: 233-234). These images combine stick bodies and short stick legs with circular "heads" from which project rays. Occasionally these "heads" are marked on the interior by small "rayheads," or by crossed lines (Golendukhin 1971: fig. 205). Bernshtam and Sher date these images to the Bronze Age and associate them with a solar cult which came into Central Asia with the Aridronovo culture. Golendukhin dates them earlier, to the third-second millennium B.C., and believes they reflect the calendrical rituals of a pre-Indo-European agricultural people (Golendukhin 1971). Both Golendukhin and Sher are unquestionably correct in finding cultic references in some of the Saimaly-Tash petroglyphs, particularly in those with representations of individuals with their arms raised as if in prayer or in ploughing scenes. Concluding that these should be seen as reflections of solar cults, however, depends on assuming that early cultures were satisfied to represent the sun through a childish joining of a circle and extended rays. The ploughing scenes seem more accessible to understanding. Many of these images combine a number of curious elements. The drivers are frequently bull-tailed; sometimes they are distinctly ithyphallic and have long "hair" streaming back from their heads (Sher 1980: figs. 107, 108). Some of the ploughs are drawn by two different animals, e.g., a bullock and a horse, a goat-like animal and a horse, or by bulls with exaggeratedly long horns. Golendukhin is possibly correct in finding here images of ploughing that refer to calendrical cycles. But the focus of the ceremony referred to by the ploughing may have been the field itself, the embodiment of Mother Earth, whose fertile growth is brought forth by the bull's ploughing of the field in early spring. Cults revolving around the Mother Goddess as the source of the fruitfulness of earth and flocks were wide-spread and even dominant in

the Near Eastern world and in its outlying regions from before the Neolithic period until well into the Bronze and even Iron Ages (Levy c. 1946; Berger 1985; and see below, Chapter VIII). The region of SaimalyTash is rather different from those riverine cultures which spawned the Near Eastern cults, however. The site is located in a rocky and mountainous region removed from the agricultural environment of the valleys of Ferghana. The Saimaly-Tash petroglyphs might seem to mediate between the agricultural lands on the outskirts of the ancient Near East and the dependency on stock increasingly necessitated by dry," rocky, and mountainous lands. Similar ploughing scenes have not been found further to the northeast, although representations of wheeled vehicles do appear at Tamgaly. For the moment it is possible to suggest, I believe, that the ray-headed images and the ploughing scenes may well be associated, that they relate to a pre-lndo-European period, i.e. to the late third-early second millennium B.C., and that the ploughing and planting of the fields as well as the bull elements refer to cults revolving around the earth as Mother Goddess. As the underlying cult was carried to the northeast, regional economic realities dismissed the ploughing ritual and replaced it with animal references to a pastoral dependency. Only with such a dynamic understanding of cults and of cult images could one hope to trace a meaningful relationship between the images of Saimaly-Tash, Tamgaly, Karakol, and the "bird-women" of Kalbak-Tash and Chuluut Gol. It is curious that two of the closest visual parallels to the Karakol feather-headed figures and to the Tamgaly images derive from a site far from the Altay. Among a group of engraved signs and images in a Chalcolithic shrine at Timna, in ancient Palestine, is one figure with stick body, arms, and legs and a head composed of a circle with expanding concentric circles. From the "forehead" of the face extend two long hornlike projections. The excavator of this site believes that this image is "probably female" (Rothenberg 1972: 55, figs. 12-14). From the adjacent site of the temple dedicated to the horned goddess, Hathor, and dated between the fourteenth and twelth centuries B.C., a pottery shard was recovered with the partial image of a similar figure. This image has an upper body which might be indicative of a female figure, a hand with five(?) claw-like fingers, and a head of concentric circles out of which project ray-like elements (Rothenberg 1972: fig. 47/4). What these images mean is not clear. There is no question about their being solar referents-they are not-but they do appear to be female in reference and they were found within a shrine dedicated to a goddess. Within the

Timna context, that goddess would presumably be related to the horned goddess, Hathor, of whom more will be said in Chapter VIII. For the moment, more useful analogies to the Karakol imagery may be found to the north of Gorno-Altayskaya A.O., in the valley of the Yenisey River. 15 The first relevant site is that of Shalobolin, to which I have already referred. There, scattered among the elk and boats which testify to a Neolithic layer of petroglyphs are a number of images clearly comparable to those found at Karakol. In addition to the loop-headed figures (cf. pl. VIia and pl. VIIIa,e) there are two others of considerable interest (pl. Vllb). One is only a head with a strange mask-like appearance, with feather-like rays projecting around its circumference and bordered by an arc. Beneath the head and connected to either end of the bow is a horizontal latticed section from which project downward a number of short vertical lines and to the side, diagonal lines. The second image is best preserved in its head section. It also has a mask-like round head marked by horizontal dividing lines. From the sides of its head long feather-like rays project, while the top of its head is marked by tall horns and a central vertical shaft. Although neither image is identical to the feather-headed or horned frontal images at Karakol, there are significant similarities to the latter: in the feather motif itself, in the stylized and mask-like treatment of the round head, and in the combination of horns and feathers. Assuming the possibility ofregional variations in the visual formulation of significant images, it is possible to conclude that Shalabolin reflects a continuity of culture of two image types from Karakol and thus of two temporal levels of culture. I have indicated that frontal images with large bovine horns are less frequent within the Karakol complex than are the feather-headed figures. However, their hieratic postures on the upper surface of the slabs suggest a particular significance within a larger pantheon of figures. Several of those Karakol figures also have distinctive wedge-shaped markings on their faces. The faces of other "rabbit-eared" figures with claws are marked in the same manner. Similar facial markings, usually in conjunction with horns, appear on many of the carved masks recorded at MugurSargol in the upper Yenisey (Devlet 1976b, 1980). Not all the masks from this complex are the same. Many have more recognizably anthropomorphic features, others are simply circles or facial features. Among the large number of such images, the majority carry bovine horns.
15 But see, too, the two or three images with "feather-heads" and "winged" bodies from the petroglyphic site of Oroktoy, on the Katun' River (Okladnikova 1984: pl. 26).

Several, also, have antennae or even a small human figure emerging from between the horns (Devlet 1976b: figs. 4-7). A small number carry antlers in place of horns. Devlet dates the Mugur-Sargol masks to the Bronze Age, primarily by reference to the Bronze Age images of homed figures associated with the Tom', Angara, Lena, and Selenga petroglyphs. She sees in the masked images reflections of shamanistic traditions which had emerged by that period and were to be continued up into the present (Devlet 1980: 225-243). If the analogy between the horned and wedge-shaped figures of Karakol and the masks of Mugur-Sargol is more than coincidental, then the date of the latter should be placed at least as early as the early Bronze Age. An earlier date would also be indicated by analogies with frontal faces with horns and antlers from Chuluut Gol. However, none of these connections can be considered certain, and as in the case of the horned figures from the Baykal Neolithic, assumptions regarding their shamanistic significance are premature. At the most one may conclude that the masks of Mugur-Sargol are yet another regional variation of the mythic traditions glimpsed in Shalabolin and Karakol, images datable to the early Bronze Age and possibly reformulated in the bird-women of Kalbak-Tash and Chuluut Gol and in the "feather-heads" of Tamgaly and Saimaly-Tash.
D. CARVED MONOLITHS OF THE MINUSINSK BASIN
The most powerful images comparable to those from Karakol are carved on giant monoliths associated with the Minusinsk Basin (pis. X, XI). These huge stones rose over the surface of the ground as much as 6 m. Over the millennia many of the stones have fallen and broken, others have been reused and recarved, and yet others have been rubbed into illegibility by grazing animals. Despite the muted aspect of the carvings, however, they retain a distinctive monumentality.16 When seen from the side, almost every stone describes a rising arc, its highest point terminating above the main, eastern face of the stone. That eastern face is dominated by a great mask image which protrudes from the surface of the stone.
16 See especially the work of Vadetskaya, Leont'yev, and Maksimenkov. A large number of these stones have been gathered into the Historical Museums in Abakan and Minusinsk. This relocation has protected the stones and allows one to view many of the most famous and impressive of the stelae in one place. In neither location, however, does the display auempt to recreate the original settings.

108 ROCK CARVINGS AND PAINTINGS
Gryaznov, one of the first scholars to consider these stelae, began by believing they were datable to the Karasuk culture, but later associated them with the Andronovo culture (Gryaznov 1950a). Since Gryaznov first called scholarly attention to these monoliths, most scholars have associated them with the Okunev culture, usually considered to be an Aeneolithic culture of the late third or early second millennium B.C. (Formozov 1969; Khlobystina 1971a; Leont'yev 1978; Vadetskaya 1967, 1986). Against this prevailing opinion, Kyzlasov has proposed that the great stelae with masked images date to a Neolithic third millennium culture which he names Tazmin (Kyzlasov 1986). Regard-less of when they were actually carved, many of the stelae were reused in the context of Okunev period burials (e.g., pl. Xb). Whether that reuse indicates the disrespect accorded the works of an earlier culture by a later one, whether it indicates, rather, respect and honor, or whether it indicates a simple variation in the purposes for which such carved stelae could be used is not resolvable at this time. For the sake of clarity, I willl refer to the large monoliths with engraved masks as Okunev, but with the understanding that their actual cultural identification and dating remains debated. The several dozen stelae recorded in recent decades represent an unending variety of several specific themes. The general characteristics may be briefly reviewed. The faces themselves, usually found approxi-mately 1/3 or 1/2 up from the actual base of the stone, combine stylized anthropomorphic elements-eyes, noses, mouths-with decidedly non-human features. These include stripes or bands across the face in a manner reminiscent of the banded faces at Karakol. Circles suggestive of extra eyes or nostrils appear on many of the masks. Some of the masks. are surrounded by ray or feather-like projections, such as that on a stele: found in the Sorga Valley or in the case of the mask from a slab reused in a Tagar period burial on Black Lake (Kyzlasov 1986: figs. 59, 97). Most of the masks, however, have distinctly horn-like projections or "antennae" (e.g., pl. X a, b, d). In this respect, the masks are clearly similar to the masks of Mugur-Sargol. On a stone from Shira, masks and mask-like elements form a vertical band extending upwards from between the horns of the head (pl. Xe). In some cases (e.g., pl. Xie), the central projection over the head of the mask takes the form of a complex ray or feathered element; in other cases, the undulations of the ribbons or bands have a snake-like character (Vadetskaya, Leont'yev, and Maksimenkov 1980: nos. 33, 35, 53,64, 79; and see Lipskiy 1970: fig. 4). In addition, there is the frequent appearance of a four-cornered circle

ROCK CARVINGS AND PAINTINGS 109
on various parts of the stelae (e.g., pl. Xd, e; pl. XI c). Under several masks may be found large circular elements. These often coincide with a distinctly protruding area, suggestive of a swollen belly or female breasts (e.g., pl. Xd, e). On the Shira stele, a large beast's head and forearms emerge from a side view of the proturding breasts and belly (pl. Xe), while on a broken stele from Bile, the eyes of a jawed beast are merged with the mask's breasts (pl. Xe). Most of the Minusinsk stelae are tapered at the upper end, but a number are carved into massive sculptural forms. The upper end of a stone from Verkh-Bidzhin (pl. Xia) takes the form of a massive horned ram head facing in the same direction as the mask (presumably, originally, to the east). The horns are carved into the sides of the stele in the form of two full-curves (Kyzlasov 1986: 137-139). Another huge stone found at Kulagash has a roughly shaped upper section recalling the head (unfinished?) of an animal such as a ram (Kyzlasov 1986: figs. 69, 70). A stone which had been reused as part of the enclosing wall of a Tagar kurgan in the Sorga Valley is particularly interesting (Kyzlasov 1986: 102-103). The upper portion of the stone, above the mask, is carved in the form of an elk's head, antlerless, its nostrils pointing up to heaven (pl. Xlb). In the case of all these stones, it is unclear whether or not the animal heads were carved at the same time as the masks and were intended to be a part of the same iconographic program. 17 A few stones have attracted considerable attention, since they suggest to some scholars the appearance of Proto-Indo-European elements within the Minusinsk Basin. These elements include bovines and wheeled vehicles: The most famous example of the occurence of these elements is that from the village of Znamenka on the Erbe River (pl. Xld). 18 Calling these animals "bulls" in association with a cart, Khlobystina dates the animals, cart, and stele to the Okunev period. She argues that the cart represents the sun in its heavenly course; bulls are a sign of the
17 Similarly problematic is the image of an elk carved above the partial mask of a stone believed to have been found along the Sagaich River (pl. Xlf). The drawing reproduced by Kyzlasov gives the elk antlers and suggests that the carving is different from that used to render the partial mask (Kyzlasov 1986: fig. 124). The drawing reproduced by Vadetskaya makes no such distinction and characterizes the elk as female (Vadetskaya, Leont'yev, and Maksimenkov 1980: no. 70). In both cases, however, there is the suggestion that the antennae springing up from the face of the mask actually cross at least one of the elk's legs, thus indicating that the mask was done after the carving of the elk. 18 The Znamenka stone was first considered in an article by Gryaznov (1960). It is also extensively discussed by Kyzlasov, as are two other stelae with dubious "carts," one from Usl'-Byur' and another, now-lost, from Krasnyy kamen' (Kyzlasov 1986: 178-179, 193194; figs. 112,116, 121).

emergence of the Bronze Age in the early second millennium, and the bulls and carts together represent the emergence of agriculture in the: Minusinsk Basin (Khlobystina 1971b). Kyzlasov also believes that the cart and associated "bulls" are contemporaneous with the mask and refer to a solar cult. Gryaznov dated the stone itself, with its mask and solar mark, to the Andronovo and the cart, bulls, and "antelope" to the Karasuk. While these dates may be too late, he is unquestionably correct in seeing a sequence in time between the cart and bovines and the upper group of animals (Gryaznov 1960). The images of carts and bovines introduces the larger issue of interpretation. Khobystina is only one of many scholars who identify the masks on the stelae as indicative of a syncretic female-ancestor, originally the combination of woman and bull (Khlobystina 1971a, 1971b). Over time, the female ancestor began to play a greater role than did her animal partner, coming finally to dominate the slabs with engravings from the Okunov period. Echoes of this tradition persist in Siberian mythology and trace the origins of a people to the marriage betwen a woman and an animal: within Okunev art, that animal-husband is the totemic bull. Kyzlasov has developed a similar but more elaborate interpretation of the motifs on the Minusinsk stones. Associating the masked stelae with sacrificial grounds and altars, he calls the deity to which are dedicated both grounds and stelae Mother Earth. Each stone recreates the axis of the World Tree and World Mountain, their divisions associated with the underworld, the world, and the heavenly sphere. The female thus becomes the First Mother, and her worship in antiquity explains the now widespread Siberian worship of mountains, menirs, and stones. The cosmological cult of the World Mountain, said by Kyzlasov to have been brought to South Siberia from the ancient Near East, was grafted onto a local Neolithic cult of fertility and abundance (Kyzlasov 1986: 188192).19
It is probable that the stelae reflect the merging of two cultural traditions: one from the outside, probably from the southwest, and the other authochthonous. Whether it is then possible to interpret masks, carts, bovines, and "homed-circles" in terms of solar and fertility cults is, however, dubious. One may argue-as I will in Chapter VIII-that
19 Kyzlasov rather enigmatically argues that the element "contributed" by the local tradition was the conception of the Mother Earth; she assumed her role on the stelae as the, conflation of two traditions. He gives no basis for his theory about the local tradition and the imported tradition of a world mountain.

ROCK CARVINGS AND PAINTINGS 111
there are significant parallels here with traditions known textually from the ancient Near East, but it is unlikely that the iconographic programs on the Minusinsk stelae can be understood as directly derived from ancient Near Eastern and Proto-Indo-European traditions. Lacking any clear indication of how such a menu of beliefs could have been imported from such a distance and rearranged with such confidence on the stelae, it would be much wiser to withdraw from a detailed interpretation based on loose analogies and consider the regularly repeating, interlocking patterns found on these monumental stones. Most of these stelae are marked on their main or east face with a mask of somewhat anthropomorphic aspect. Whether superimposed upon a modeled pier or on a flattened slab, these masks are frequently marked by horizontal stripes or divisions. Most, if not all, have characteristics which in some respects are bovine: large and wide-set eyes, large nostrils and mouth. Ears are suggested by circles or loops on the sides of the mask and virtually all the masks are marked by projecting elements: horns in particular, but also antennae, vertical streamers, and feather-like elements. Under a considerable number of the masks are the modeled indications of breasts. In many cases, the thickening of the stone below the mask suggests the full womb of a female body. Many of the stones have earred circles marked either along the sides of the shaft or below the mask. The absence of these elements directly above the masks at the top of the stelae would argue against their interpretation as sun disks or as the sun over and under the world. If they were suns and if the solar aspect of these stones were as pronounced as Kyzlasov believes, one would certainly expect to find solar disks at the top of the shaft, thus reflecting the passage of the sun through the heaven. For the time being, these marks-like many others on these stelae--defy interpretation. Similarly, the association of the very few wheeled vehicles carved on the stones with a solar chariot (theoretically brought from Near Eastern traditions) with the bull and the mask as a symbolic grouping cannot be supported: first, because if the mask faced to the east, the cart on the Znamenka stele would also be facing to the east in its passage through heaven; second, because the carts and the bovines, here and on other stelae, are either later than the masks in execution or are known in such fragmentary or damaged form that their authenticity and authority must be considered uncertain; third, because there are too few representations of either wheeled vehicles or bovines to come to any confident conclusion regarding their intended meaning. Kyzlasov is certainly correct in emphazing the significance of the

112 ROCK CARVINGS AND PAINTINGS
mask-carved stone within the context of a place of ritual sacrifices. It is also probable that the deep burying of the stelae into the ground so that the mask might appear only above the surface of the earth, was intended for ritual as well as for practical purposes (Kyzlasov 1986: 85-135). As a result, the stone shaft would appear to connect the world under the soil., the earth's surface, and the upper sphere, as Kyzlasov argues. In this respect the shaft could function as a variation on the pan-Eurasian concept of the World Mountain or World Tree by which the three spheres are joined. Whatever their original function and however their original symbolic significance was nuanced, the elements on the Minusinsk stones taken altogether strongly suggest the presence ofa female deity. This deity was associated with animal characteristics which denoted either her animal-other or her actual animal nature. The animal in question was much more likely to have been the horn-bearing cow than the bull, and the fullness of the deity's breasts and womb much more certainly refers to the cow as the source of life and of sustenance than to the bull. The placement of the deity's mask on the face of the stelae, and the deep planting of the stelae into the ground, suggests that the deity was intended to mediate between the upper and lower spheres of existence. She emerges from the earth as if rooted there. The undulating ribbons may indicate snakes, a common corolary to chthonic deities, while the more feather-like elements may indicate her avian aspect. The appearance of the stelae or menirs within the confines of sacrificial grounds indicates the significance of this deity within the life of the community and the belief that on her timely propitiation depended the order and well-being of the universe. If her powers extended to the sun as a source of warmth and light, then that was only one area of her domain. Given a common cultural horizon, the frontality of mask-like images and the particular combination of animal elements indicate some significant connection between the images on the Minusinsk stelae, the main images on the Karakol slabs, and, possibly, the masks of Mugur-Sargol. The variations in treatment of the facial area and the slurring between horns, feathers, and snake-like elements may indicate regional or generational idiosyncrasies in the handling of a similar set of religious conceptions and references. The Kalbak-Tash and Chuluut Gol frontal figures are more specifically female in reference than those from Karakol; in this respect they recall the enlarged wombs and breasts on the Minusinsk stelae. By virtue of their appearance in burials, the Karakol figures are clearly related to life after mortal death; in that respect, they

appear to be properly chthonic. The horns of some of the Karakol images are analogous to the more imaginative horns of the Mugur-Sargol and Minusinsk masks, while their feathered heads and clawed hands echo the bird-like aspects of the "bird-women" of Kalbak-Tash and Chuluut Gol. The essential absence or obliteration of any references to elk from the immediate cultural horizon within the upper layers of imagery on the Karakol slabs and on the Minusinsk stelae argues that we have here a culture which could only have been dated to the Aeneolithic or early Bronze Age. The undercarvings of elk at Karakol argue that the culture of the horned and feathered deities overlay local outflows of the Baykal Neolithic. Whereas the female elk was the central image for that earlier culture, within the new culture an anthropomorphic deity of bovine and bird characteristics-a female associated with death and with the fullness of life-personified fundamental principles of belief. In some regions her bovine characteristics indeed suggest that this new culture was pastoral, with a primary dependence on cattle. She was also birdlike, however, and that curious aspect, as well as her relationship with deer images at Kalbak-Tash, will require further consideration.
E. CONCLUSION
I have said that there is considerable disagreement regarding the dating and the cultural basis of the Minusinsk stelae, although most scholars consider them to be of the Okunev period, thus post-dating the appearance of the Afanasevo culture in the Minusinsk Basin. Kubarev believes that placement of the Karakol burials within Afanasevo mounds might also indicate a post-Afanasevo chronology, but the lack of any bronze goods within the burials points to the very early Bronze Age at the latest. Novgorodova believes that the images of frontal females, birth scenes, and bulls from Chuluut Gol must belong to the Aeneolithic period. Since the Aeneolithic population of northwestern and central Mongolia appears to have had a clear Europoid component, Novgorodova concludes that here, also, there must have been a culture of Afanasevo characteristics (Novgorodova 1989: 81-86). The Afanasevo culture has been most clearly identified with the regions of present-day Gorno-Altayskaya A.O. and the Minusinsk Basin. As an Aeneolithic culture it formed a transition between the Neolithic and Bronze Ages of that region. The round-bodied pottery with sides ornamented by simple, impressed patterns and flattened or softly pointed bases was sturdy and functional. The scanty remains in Afanasevo

burials indicate a dependency on both stock (cattle, horses, sheep), and hunted animals. I have already referred to the significant parallels between the Afanasevo culture of South Siberia and the Yamna (Pitgrave) Neolithic culture identified with the Volga Steppe and western Siberia in the late third millennium B.C. The Yamna culture was primarily stock dependent, with sheep predominating in the east and cattle in the more western region. The Yamna graves were typically constructed in the form of square or rectangular shafts, frequently lined and covered with planks or beams. Yamna groups in the Lower Dnieper region more typically lined and covered their burial shafts with stone slabs. In both types of burial chambers, timber or stone, the bodies of the dead were laid on their backs, legs contracted with knees upright. Although burial goods appear to have been meager, there was frequently a considerable use of ocre in the burials.Burials would be marked on the surface by a characteristic earthen mound (Sulimirski 1970a: 127-136). In terms of the burial ritual, burial structures, and stock dependency, there are striking parallels between the contemporaneous Yamna and Afanasevo cultures. Although osteological evidence is not complete, the Afanasevo appear to have been of a Europoid physical type. On the other hand, although sturdy carts have been found in Yamna burials of the Lower Dnepr at the end of the third and early second millennia B.C., no carts have been found in association with Afanasevo burials. Beyond these facts, however, both the relationship--if any-to European cultures of the Proto-Indo-European period and the details ofthe Afanasevo culture itself remain unclear.Burial structures and ritual varied from the Yenisey to the Altay; and although some scholars see no relationship between the Afanasevo and Okunev cultures (Gryaznov 1969), others find persuasive indicators of continuity (Kiselev 1951; Kyzlasov 1986). It is certain that the particular slab structures of the Karakol burials more closely resemble burial structures associated with the Okunev culture in the Minusinsk Basin than the log construction considered by Gryaznov typical of the Afanasevo burial structure. It is also apparent that the relationship of Afanasevo and Okunev cultures-the former often vaguely associated with a "western" tradition, the latter associated with a Siberian taiga tradition-remains unclear. This discussion leads to the general conclusion that within the Minusinsk Basin and already by the second millennium B.C., the Europoid peoples of the Afanasevo culture and the Mongoloid peoples of the Okunev culture had developed significant cultural interconnections evident in shared aspects of burial ritual, ceramic styles, and

economy (Vadetskaya 1986). There were, however, significant differences. The pastoral Afanasevo were primarily dependent on cattle and sheep. Bone finds in Okunev settlements and burials indicate, by contrast, a major dependency on the hunting of wild animals, including bear, elk, deer, and fur-bearing animals such as wolves, sables, fox, and so forth. Reindeer horns, presumably from the wild animal, served extensively for the production of tools. Funerary finds of significant numbers of bear teeth and claws indicate, most probably, a developed bear cult (Vadetskaya 1986: 30-34). There is also ample evidence, however, that over time the culture became increasingly dependent on domestic stock, particularly on cattle and sheep, as well as on horses. Such changes suggest that the Okunev learned stock-raising from the Afanasevo. What is certain is that both cultures, deriving from different regions and ethnicities, achieved a degree of cultural parallelism and even ethnic interpenetration within the Minusinsk Basin by the eighteenth - seventeenth centuries B.C. Whatever problems exist in the dating of the Minusinsk stelae, there is no significant questioning of the Okunev origins of a number of minaturecarved figurines of bone or stone representing females (Kyzlasov 1986: 267-269; Vadetskaya 1986: 31-33). These figurines were found in the burials of young women. In several cases the images are represented as if with long hair combed down over their shoulders and upper chest, and in some cases they wear ornaments on their necks and ears. The columnar base of these images suggests that they were "dressed," and that they may have been intended to be held or set up on some miniature altar. The very care with which they were carved seems to indicate that they were more than dolls. Their impressive frontality and stylized realism contrasts with their miniature size. In that frontality and pillarlike form, these small figurines clearly recall the masked Minusinsk stelae. On the other hand, their realism also suggests that they belong to a related but different culture, or that their reference was markedly different. In either case, there is the visual reference to an image of female attributes, but in one case, the image of the deity is monumental and anti-realistic, in the other, she is realistic and miniaturized. She possibly served as a particular protective deity for women. There are no known analogous male figures. Within the complex ofpost-Baykal Neolithic images discussed in this chapter, many join certain or probable female references with references to bovines and birds. Almost all the imagery refers to beings with quasihuman, quasi-animal characteristics. They are monumental in appear

ance and anti-realistic. Only the small Okunev figurines may be confidently associated with a culture which was on the verge of entering the full Bronze Age and only these figurines demonstrate a concern with realism. It is this aspect which seems to lead into the petroglyphic traditions of the South Siberian Bronze Age of the second and early first millennia B.C. As we turn to that period, however, we will find that imagery in general indicates a revitalized realism. One senses that even if the objects of representation refer to a spirit or mythic realm, they are now rendered in the guise of a real world of humans and animals. The Neolithic and Aeneolithic singularity of representational purpose also disappears: where the mnemonically repeated images of female elk had held sway or where imagery returned again and again to a strange masked figure offemale human and animal characteristics, we find in the Bronze Age a great variety of references. Bulls, cattle, deer, caprids, humans in many ritual settings, carts and wagons-this more fully populated world became the focus of the Bronze Age artist in South Siberia.

CHAPTER FIVE
THE ELABORATION OF IMAGE AND MEANING The Petroglyphic Tradition of the Middle and Late Bronze Age
A. IMAGE TYPES AND THEIR REALMS OF REFERENCE
When the burials at Karakol were sealed, so, too, was sealed a dictionary of significant images from the period of the Neolithic, Aeneolithic, and early Bronze Age. The importance of those burials lies not only in their having preserved the visual vocabulary of archaic belief. It lies also in what they exclude: what they push, by force of absence, into the succeeding Bronze Age. Where and by what means, however, does one distinguish the lower chronological limits of that Bronze Age vocabulary? To establish that lower horizon, one must turn to a wider regional consideration and to an increased reliance on style. One must also depend upon the principle of exclusion based on iconographic and stylistic evidence derived from materials which can be dated securely in the Iron Age. These images and the styles in which they are rendered point to an invisible line marking the end of the Bronze Age at some point shortly after 1000 B.C. The realistic elk and the feathered and horned mythic figures on the one hand, and the elegant, stylized animals of the Early· Nomadic period on the other, form brackets around the body of material which must be assigned to the second and early first millennia B.C. 1 If style and image type distinguish the deer, caprids, wolves, felines, and boar of the Early Nomadic period from the deer, cattle, human figures, and vehicles of the preceding Bronze Age, it is also possible to assert that any images of humans riding horses must be excluded from a consideration of Bronze Age petroglyphs. After all, it is only with the great burial at Arzhan that we begin to see the bone and bronze psalia, bits, and strap settings which would have allowed the regular use of the
1 Excluded altogether from this discussion are petroglyphic materials which can be assigned to the Turkic and modern periods. The Turkic materials are fairly easy to discern: by the distinctiveness of their style, the use of a scratched-in technique, and by the frequent presence of Turkic writing.

horse for riding. It is also probable that scenes of herding, such as those from Shivertyn-Am and Gachurt (pl. Xlla,b), and scenes of herds of animals, such as those from Moroy (pl. Xllc) or from Kunin in the Minusinsk Valley (pl. Xllf) must be dated no earlier than the late Bronze Age or more likely within the early Iron Age. Internal evidence from the Great Boyar petroglyphs of the middle Yenisey River, dated to the late Tagar period, would indicate that such domestic scenes should also be dated well into the Iron Age (Devlet 1976a; cf. Okladnikov et al. 1979: pl. 7/9). Those images which include the stylistic marks of the Tashtyk and succeeding Turkic periods must also be set aside. As for the innumerable and indistinguishable images of caprids and deer, repeated again and again on the rocky walls of Gorno-Altayskaya A.O., Tuva, and Mongolia as if they were visual invocations of the real animals, they must also be excluded from this discussion, due to the uncertainty of their dating. In all probability they belong somewhere within the Bronze and early Iron Ages. The so-called "deer stones" of South Siberia and Mongolia are a significant part of that late Bronze Age tradition; because of their particular form and meaning, they will be considered separately in Chapter VII. Excepting them, what remains after considering the chronological brackets I have indicated are a number of image types from across South Siberia and from western and northern Mongolia. All can be placed with some confidence within the second millennium B.C. Within the more northern complexes these include the occasional representations of bear, as at Shalabolin (Pyatkin and Martynov 1985: figs. 75, 84). Much more common are bovine images and images of large antlered deer. These animals are rendered in a variety of styles: silhouette, outline, and a distinctive brocaded or "embroidered" style, in which the animal's body is treated with a variety of linear patterns (e.g., pl. IXe, f; pl. XVlb). Cattle are distinguished by their large bodies and pronounced horns and tails. In some cases, where the bodies of the animals are particularly squared and the tails terminate in a large tuft, the animal represented may be a yak (pl. XIIlf). Occasionally the necks of the animals are ridged or fringed, as if to indicate either folds of skin, a fringe of hair or possibly ritual harnessing (pl. XIIIa). The deer are often, but not always, antlered. Within a group of animals impressive antlered individuals may frequently be found. Together with cattle, deer are among the most common zoomorphic images datable to the Bronze Age. Indeed, the very repetition of cattle, yak, and deer throughout South Siberia and northern Mongolia, calls to mind an artistic imagination

which roams on behalf of individual or community between a reverential acknowledgement of the beasts of the forest and mountain-steppe and an invocation of the fertility of domesticated cattle and yak. In addition to the readily recognizable animals are a number of syncretic beasts, merging bovine, deer, and-more rarely--caprid elements. Within the Yelangash complex, for example, a human figure leads a large bodied animal with bovine tail, neck fringe, and a combination of horn and antlered projections on its head (pl. XIIId). Other images from the same complex and from Kalbak-Tash have the distinctive bodies of cattle but wear antlers (pl. IXe, f, g; pl. XIIIg, h). In some cases, the body and horns indicate a goat but the animal has the long tail of a cow or bull (pl. XIIle, i). Among the petroglyphs of the Chuluut Gol complex in north central Mongolia may be found examples of deercattle, bovines in a large style, and elaborate interior patterning reminiscent of that at Kalbak-Tash (Novgorodova 1984: figs. 17, 18, 21, 30). From as far south as the Yin-Shan complex of Inner Mongolia (Gai 1985, fig. 93) comes one example of an animal which appears to combine a large bovine body with deer antlers; its body surface is carved with the circles and double-circles reminiscent of the elaborate patterning of syncretic animals, bovines, and deer at both Kalbak-Tash and Chuluut Gol. In general, however, the center of such syncretic animals appears to have been within Gorno-Altayskaya A.O., that region which served as a kind of hub for the circling and merging of peoples from the North, from the East, and from the Southwest. It seems certain that the pictorial merging of bovine and cervid must indicate the interweaving of symbolic values adhering to each animal and thus the interweaving of cultural traditions. Syncretic deer-cattle are decidedly less frequent in representation than are their "pure" counterparts. Nonetheless, their appearance sideby-side with cattle, yak, and deer done in similar techniques supports the hypothesis that within the Bronze Age, the images of cattle and deer represented two different spheres of reference in the cultures' belief systems. These animals also raise an issue to which we shall repeatedly return: we cannot know from the representations where-in which realm- such animals should be located. Do they refer to real animals which were ritually dressed to become syncretic forms? Do they refer to ideal animals which uniquely joined the conceptual bases of two significant realms? Or do we simply have to do with a playful rendition? The last suggestion may probably be set aside: there are entirely too many such images to justify anything but common ritual or myth as shared

reference across South Siberia and northern Mongolia. Whether to locate these images or even those other images of "realistic" cattle and deer in the world of phenomenal reality, the realm of ideal form, or the realm of ritual and myth will necessarily remain, for the present, unclear. In addition to these primary zoomorphic images, there are a number of other images which significantly extend the realm of reference and meaning within South Siberian Bronze Age cultures. These include the representations of wheeled vehicles, reminiscent of carts or wagons, as well as a very distinctive kind of human image, marked by a mushroomshaped headdress (pls. XV, XVII, XVIII). These figures often carry taillike appendages, bows, arrows, and spears. At times they seem to wear pouches at their waists. Most often rendered in outline or silhouette style, they may also appear in the brocade style in which were rendered deer, cattle, and deer-cattle (e.g., Novgorodova 1984: fig. 28). In many cases these mushroom-hatted figures are represented alone, but more frequently they appear in groups, postured as if dancing, performing some kind of elaborate dance-like ritual, hunt, or combination ritual hunt. In a very few cases, they are engaged in real or mock battle or appear associated with vehicles. These image types and broader questions relating to the representations of two and four-wheeled vehicles will be discussed more fully below. One of the most striking aspects of full Bronze Age petroglyphic art is the emergence of compositions of interacting figures, or of figures and animals. These elements are grouped not simply as if together; they seem rather to reflect the process of action and response. Such compositions indicate, in other words, the emergence of the representation of a primitive psychological interaction (Jacobson 1990b). In some cases the indications of physical or psychological interaction are extremely simple. For example, the representation from Chankyr-Kel' of an archer on foot in proximity to a large deer describes in relatively static terms the imminence of cause (release of bow) and effect (the death or startled flight of the animal) (pl. XIVb). In other cases, one senses a more sophisticated interest in the interconnection between action and potential effect. A group from the Yelangash Valley includes several archers whose appearance with readied bows may be directly related to the indication of yak in flight (pl. XIIlf). Elsewhere, the meaning of the grouping is not clear, but the placement of humans among the animals seems purposeful. In the joining of ithyphallic frontal figures and animals such as caprids, horses, or deer (e.g., pl. XVa-c, e), one

senses a reference to some ritual moment or to the narration of ritual. 2 The representation of interaction again raises the question of references: whether, for example, the hunt represented is ritual or real, or whether the dance represented is not actually a priestly ritual or even a ritual enacted by spirit ancestors. While it is possible to name the visual sign by reference to the phenomenal world-hunt, copulation, dance, and so forth-it is not possible to determine the accuracy of that name or to know the realm of existence with which that representation should be associated. On the other hand, even if we cannot say what an image group actually represents, it can be acknowledged that the terms in which the individual images are related agree with perceived laws of physical and psychological interaction: that is, with a human logic of action and response. A hunter raises his bow and animals stand on the alert. A wolf appears to challenge a herd of deer, a human leads an animal dressed in ritual regalia. Here, mushroom-hatted figures move together like a solemn chorus. There, they seem to be moving in a more active dance around several deer. If these are not images of real animals or real humans, the figures at least act out theirritual roles in postures which can be named by reference to our world. If they exist only in the realm of myth and ritual, the terms of their visual discourse belongs to our realm of phenomenal being.
B. RITUAL FIGURES AND FIGURES IN INTERACTION
Within the major petroglyphic complexes of Gorno-Altayskaya A.O., Tuva, and Mongolia, among the most commonly repeated subjects are interacting pairs or small groups of figures without the representation of any weapons. From Mugur-Sargol, Yelangash, Khavtsgayt to the Chuluut Gol complex, these simple forms of interaction include scenes of copulation or of two figures holding hands or standing beside each other with unclear purpose (pl. XVb, d, f). More intriguing are the many groups of figures or figures and animals, apparently engaged in some kind of ritual activity. 3 This is exemplified by several groups of images
2 E.g., at Kayancha on the Katun' River; or at Kok-Kan on the Katun' (Okladnikova 1984: pis. 22/1, 37/1). 3 The simplest representation of humans in some kind of interaction is certainly that referred to as figures in a "chorus line." This formulation is well known from the petroglpyhs of the Angara, Lena, and Baykal regions. Many of these groups may belong to the Bronze Age; but similar representations from the Selenga (Selenge) River complex, including figures holding hands or simply standing frontally, or figures which appear to be transformed into birds, are usually dated later, well into the Iron Age (Okladnikov and Zaparozhskaya 1969; Tivanenko 1981).

from the Mongolian site of Khobd Somon. In one, a large frontal and ithyphallic archer, bow in hand and legs bent as if in dance, holds the horn of a caprid (pl. XVc). Near him are recorded three figures, one of whom has a distinctive headdress with large side loops, the other two of whom may be females squatting in childbirth (pl. XVf). From another site in the same complex, an ithyphallic man holds the lead of a large stallion (pl. XVe). The figure of a person leading a large bovine with ritual "fringe," from Sary-Satak, may also belong in this category (pl. XIIIa), as may the representation of two figures leading a female animal of some kind, from Chankyr-Kel', in the Yelangash Valley (pl. XVa). A particularly complex ritual scene from Chuluut Gol includes animals and figures, several of whom appear to be dancing (pl. XIVe). In contrast to the large number of ritually interacting figures and figures and animals, the number of instances in which figures are represented either in hand-to-hand combat or attacked by predatory animals is so small as to be almost negligible. It is probable that they belong to the early Iron Age. An image from Mugur-Sargol, in which two figures seem to be fighting with pick-axes, probably dates from the later Tagar period (Devlet 1980: pl. 66), as would the images of figures attacking each other from the Minusinsk Basin petroglyphs of Kunin (pl. Xllf). From sites in both the Yelangash Valley and in Mongolia come several instances of figures raising their bows as if to shoot directly at each other; these may indicate an actual battle, or they may indicate a ritual battle from human or mythic experience (pl. XIVa, c, f). On the other hand, a group of figures from the Yin-Shan Mountains of Inner Mongolia may be dated to the Bronze Age by their distinctive mushroom-shaped hats. These figures aim their primed bows at each other; their close range suggests an intense and ferocious interaction (Gai 1985: fig. 1212). Despite this intensity, however, a number of elements suggest that this is not a real battle but one existing on the level of myth or ritual. Several of the figures wear long tail-like appendages. From their waists protrude erect phalluses, weapons, or both. Their mushroom-shaped hats are similar to those found on a significant number of figures throughout South Siberian and Central Asian petroglyphs, but in almost all those instances-to which this group must be compared-the figures are engaged in what only can be understood as ritual activity. In other words, among all the petroglyphic images which seem datable to the Bronze Age, the instances of figures aggressively attacking each other is very small and the actual nature of that agression is open to question. There are occasional image groups which seem to represent specific

rituals or mythic events involving one or more archers. In one group from Khobd Somon, an ithyphallic archer aims at (?) a mushroom-hatted figure squatting as if in childbirth (pl. XIVd). At Khavtsgayt, Okladnikov recorded a group of ithyphallic figures with tall head ornaments, tails, and quivers (?), facing each other with drawn bows (pl. XIVf). By contrast to the number of image groups expressing human aggression on an actual, ritual, or mythic level, there are a large number of scenes in which figures appear with animals either in ritual performances or in a ritual or real hunt. As in the scenes which may be expressive of human aggression, here many of the figures are ithyphallic. It is possible that this representational element may function as a sign of fertility ceremonies, but it is also possible that the representation of the phallus was simply a practical way of distinguishing male from female within the representational constraints of rock carving or painting. Figures with mushroom-shaped headdresses are well exemplified by a group of figures from Kalbak-Tash. 4 The largest is approximately two feet tall, the smallest perhaps one-half that size. Large and small, they stand in a three-quarter position facing to their left. In their stylized postures and in the repetition of the sack at their waist and their mushroom-shaped hats, one has the distinct impression of figures involved in some kind of ritual activity. Although this figure type occurs frequently throughout South Siberian petroglyphs, it appears in various forms and contexts. At times, the sacks carried by the figures assume the size and character of a tail; at other times, the sack becomes large enough to suggest a quiver (Devlet 1976b: pis. 36/1, 44). In still other instances, particularly in representations from Yelangash, the large, round "sacks" worn by mushroom-hatted figures seem deliberately to mimic the large, round tufts at the ends of the tails of the bovine animals the figures are hunting (?) (pl. XIIlf). The activities in which these images appear are similarly varied, some with no clear reference and others suggesting a ritual of unclear significance. Examples of this type of representation include that of the large figures from Kalbak-Tash and the group from Chuluut Gol, recorded by Novgorodova, in which seven figures holding bows seem almost to be dancing in proximity to a double-headed(?) stag and a doe led by one of the figures (pl. XIVe). One representation from Khavtsgayt, in western Mongolia, includes two mushroom-hatted figures in copulation (pl. XVd). In a grouping from Khobd Somon, a mushroom-hatted woman crouching as if giving

birth is juxtaposed with an archer who aims his bow at a group of cervids, including a male and female deer and a large female elk or reindeer (pl. XIVd).5 This particular scene indicates that the hat itself does not indicate gender; indeed, without the clear indication of a phallus or weapons, it is not possible to distinguish males from females. Moreover, whatever the intended gender, these mushroom-hatted figures occur far more frequently in ritual dances or hunts than in either a real or ritual battle scene, the only clear example of such combat being the scene from the Yin-Shan mountains of Inner Mongolia. The mushroom-hatted figures appear within an arena sufficiently defined to suggest a significant degree of cultural cohesion. One finds them in petroglyphs within the Chuya River basin of southeastern Gorno-Altayskaya A.O., and a large number of them have been recorded in western Mongolia, within the Khobd Somon complex. Other examples have been recorded within the complex ofChuluut Gol, in northcentral Mongolia; and a sprinkling of their images have been found in the YinShan complex of Inner Mongolia. In addition, at least two examples have been recorded in Tuva, at Mugur-Sargol on the Yenisey River (Devlet 1980: figs. 71, 214). These distinctive figures are absent from any representations involving horseback riding, or from any involving pictorial styles associated with the Scythe-Siberians. They are not found in any meaningful association with animal or anthropomorphic representations of the Baykal Neolithic or early Bronze Age or within the image groups described by the Karakol slabs and the Minusinsk stelae. Al-though these facts constitute negative evidence, they confirm that the mushroom-hatted figures must be associated with the middle Bronze Age, that is with the period of the Andronovo-Karasuk cultures. In summary, images of large deer, bovines, and composite deerbovines, as well as figures in ritual or mythic scenes, are among the most significant imagistic elements of the South Siberian and northern Mongolian Bronze Age before the first millennium B.C. Representations of actual aggression between human figures are rare, while scenes of hunting on foot are relatively common. In considering this vocabulary of symbolic forms, one senses a world in which ritual had come to signify not only the reaffirmation of cosmogonic myth, but also the reaffirmation of culture and society. Figures acting together and dressed in similar garb over an extended region-from southeastern Gorno-Altayskaya

A.O., Tuva, and through Mongolia down to the Yin-Shan Mountainswould indicate a certain commonality of cultural reference throughout that region. The same petroglyphs, however, indicate that rituals enacted by humans were not the only object of reverence. In some manner that culture was pulled between two poles: one pole represented by bovine animals and probably referring to the significance of pastoralism within the economic life of the people, the other represented by deer images and referring to the taiga as literal and figurative source of being and sustenance. At times those two spheres were joined, as in the syncretic deer-cattle figures. Surely those images reflect both cultural tension and the ritual and mythic resolution of tension, at least during the second millennium. There is, however, one other cluster of images which qualifies such a conclusion: images of vehicles. Although they appear to be quite separate from any study of the deer image, their frequency has decisively shaped scholarly understanding of the cultural context within which the deer image must be located.
C. WHEELED VEHICLES, WARRIORS, AND THEORIES OF CULTURE
Images of two- and four-wheeled vehicles have been found extensively in petroglyphic complexes of eastern Kazakhstan, Gorno-Altayskaya A.O., Tuva, Mongolia, and even Inner Mongolia. These vehicles are almost always represented from above; the figures and animals associated with them are shown frontally or in profile, right side up or inverted. Over the lasnwo decades, these images have caught the attention of numerous scholars, who have found in the vehicles signs of an IndaEuropean invasion and the indication of the diffusion of Inda-European mythic traditions.6 From this persuasion has followed the tendency to interpret all other images-those of deer, bovines, and horses, in particular-in light of Indo-European traditions. I believe that this has led to misunderstandings and interpretations which ignore the ecology of culture and belief. Variation in the presentation of vehicles appears to have had no regional regularity. It is possible to distinguish four-wheeled wagons from two-wheeled carts-vehicles that were appropriate for hauling freight and individuals over rough terrain. More problematic is the

With a few exceptions to be discussed below, the image of the wheeled vehicle does not occur in the Minusinsk Basin nor docs it occur in the Transbaykal region or in the taiga zone to the east and north of Lake Baykal.

distinction between the two-wheeled cart and the chariot, a two-wheeled vehicle of prestige and warfare. Assuming that the light-bodied chariot is functionally distinguished by its ability to be pulled rapidly, nothing in the petroglyphic images allows us to arrive at a decisive conclusion regarding the nature of the two-wheeled vehicle. Across South Siberia and Mongolia, the wheels of vehicles are represented in a variety of ways: solid, as if of single-piece construction; with four-spokes, as if of cross-bar construction; or with multiple spokes of up to eight or more (e.g., pl. XVIa; cf. representations on pl. XVIII). 7 A wheel of singlepiece wooden construction would clearly offer heavy but slow transport. One would imagine that vehicles with such wheels would function essentially as heavy-load carts or trolleys, similar to those used in the construction of the Pazyryk barrows (Rudenko 1970). Identification of the animals used to pull the vehicles suggests that the representations on the rock carvings indicate carts or that they refer to generalized conceptions. In the majority of cases, the animals associated with these vehicles can be identified as horses; in a significant number of other cases, however, bovines or a combination of bovines and horses are used. At Yelangash, for example, within one image group a man with a mushroom-like hat stands in a two-wheeled vehicle pulled by a horse and bovine; over his head is a standing deer (pl. XVIIIc). If one may distinguish horses from bovines on the basis of the handling of the tail, then it would seem that the pairing of horses and bovines for traction occurred frequently, at least in the northern Altay region (e.g., Okladnikov et al. 1979: pis. 40/2, 41; Novgorodova 1984: fig. 23). Whether the animals used for pulling include one or two bovines, however, the presence of any precludes the identification of two-wheeled vehicles as chariots. In those cases, one can only assume that they are rough carts or carts intended for slower transport. In a small number of cases, deer are represented either as pulling the vehicle or in direct association with the animals pulling the vehicle (pl. XVIIIb, g). A surprisingly large number of vehicles are represented without animals or driver, or with animals alone (pl. XVIIc; pl. XVIIIe, f). On the other hand, representations of vehicles with drivers but without draft animals (e.g., Okladnikov et al. 1982, pl. 37) are extremely unusual. This combination of elements throughout the range of the petroglyphic representation of vehicles suggests that the vehicle itself-its wheels, axle, and box-was the most important element in the

representation, that draft animals were secondary, and that the driver was the least important element of all (Jacobson 1990c). The problem of identifying the represented vehicle relates not only to the number of wheels and to the animals involved; it also concerns the treatment of the wheels and the actual location of the representation. Theoretically, the greater the number of spokes joining the wheel's nave and rim, the lighter the wheel and the faster the vehicle. A wheel spoked by two cross-bars would be lighter than a solid wheel, but the necessary thickness of the spokes and rim would allow neither great speed nor strength and thus would be inappropriate for either a hunting or war chariot. A pair of two-wheeled vehicles from Arpauzen Vin the Karatau Ridge of Central Kazakhstan has been identified as chariots (Kuz'mina 1986: fig. 38/7; Kadyrbaev and Mar'yashev 1977: fig. 72). Each of the vehicles is pulled by two stallions and is driven by an archer, whose bow is pulled and ready for shooting at a nearby caprid. The vehicle wheels are all four-spoked. If these images can be understood as factual representations, such wheels would indicate a vehicle that was too slow to be useful either in hunting orin war. Furthermore, it is improbable that pairs of stallions would be easily used for traction. Other discrepancies emerge with regard to the representations of vehicles with multi-spoked wheels and pulled by horses that have been found among rock carvings at a site called Ak-Dzhilga, in the northern Alichur Ridge of the Pamir Mountains (Zhukov and Ranov 1974). In this case, the elegance of the vehicle and horses seems to clearly indicate chariots, but the rugged and high nature of the pass precludes the representation of chariots which could actually have been pulled through that mountainous region. Assuming these are chariots, then, they must be understood as conceptual vehicles or as references to a mythic reality, rather than the images of chariots which actually passed through that land. Among the many representations of vehicles in the eastern part of Kazakhstan, in South Siberia, and in northern Mongolia, not one that I am aware of includes any reference to human combat, and very few suggest that the vehicles were actually used for hunting. In the Arpauzen representations, in which hunters are represented shooting from their vehicles, there are no indications of reins connecting horse and driver. Littauer and Crouwel have discussed the skills demanded of the charioteer who functioned simultaneously as a archer. Drawing on examples from the Near East, they conclude that the reins would have had to have been tied at the waist of the archer-charioteer (Littauer and Crouwel 1979: 63). This may have been considered a feat used by racing

charioteers, but it would have been highly impractical in the hunt, except in the case of the battue, where the animals would have been driven into the path of the chariot. It was certainly too uncontrolled a manner of driving to have been used in traveling rapidly over rough terrain. A similar set of problems pertain in the only other representation of hunting from a vehicle that I am familiar with. Novgorodova has recorded an image from Chuluut Gol in which an archer "stands" on the platform of a vehicle with two solid wheels, drawn by two bovines (pl. XVIIId). Without any sign of reins, the archer shoots at the figure of a large deer of the type known from the Mongolian deer stones. An ox-drawn cart with solid wheels would obviously have been an impossible vehicle for a successful hunt. One must conclude from this example, as well as from those from Arpauzen, that it is therefore not possible to determine the actual form and function of the vehicles on the basis oftheirpetroglyphic representations, or one must conclude that the scene constitutes a mythic reference or with purely ritual invocation of the successful hunt. The origin and date of the vehicle imagery of Central Asia and South Siberia remain uncertain. There are no archaeological remains of wheeled vehicles earlier than the Pazyryk period (cf. Rudenko 1970). No traces of the wood or bronze fittings have been found that might have been used to secure axels or strengthen wheel naves and rims, nor have the earthen reflections of disintegrated vehicles been identified. On the other hand, the range of distribution of vehicle imagery suggests the diffusion of wheeled vehicles in western Siberia and Kazakhstan eastwards into South Siberia at some time before the age of the Early Nomads. Chronologically, the remains of wheeled vehicles from Bronze Age burials of western Siberia and from Anyang burials of the Shang Dynasty create archaeological brackets for the area between-that of South Siberia and Mongolia-and tend to confirm the probability that the diffusion of the images must have occurred during the second millennium B.C. They also indicate that the four-wheeled vehicle carved onto the upper section of the Znamenka stele (pl. Xld), discussed in the last chapter, represents either an earlier anomolous intrusion or the addition of a second millennium carver. The issue of wheeled vehicle representations brings us back to the primary interpretations of Bronze and early Iron Age imagery. We have seen that bovines have been routinely identified as bulls, carts have been interpreted as chariots, and bulls and wheeled vehicles have been identified as indications of a dominating solar worship. These interpretations certainly reflect the equally persistent persuasion that the "chariot"

was a sign of the sun and the vehicle that of the warrior. The vehicle's appearance in rock carvings of South Siberia and Mongolia in the second millennium is said to indicate the invasion of a new culture whose primary instrument of war was the chariot (Kozhin 1968; cf. Novgorodova 1984: 59-79). Unquestionably, these associations by which a wheel or wheeled vehicle becomes a chariot emblematic of the sun and of a warrior class and a warlike culture depend heavily upon a number of assumptions. These include an understanding that wheeled vehicles came into South Siberia from a western and Proto-Indo-Eur.opean or Indo-European culture; that in that culture, wheeled vehicles were a sign of the warrior class and high status; chariots and horses were symbolic of the sun; the wheeled vehicle was emblematic of the chariot. Within these discussions, and without exception, there emerges the assumption that the warrior-charioteer was an honored member of society. Considerable attention has been paid to the cart-burials of males in a group of burials belonging to a transition Timber-grave-Andronovo culture and found near Rimnikskiy in Chelyabinsk Oblast', on the east side of the Urals. These burials were in timbered chambers and five of the burials were furnished with light carts, visible by the negative impression they had left in the soil. The horses associated with these burials were placed in the grave-fill above the roofs of the chambers. These burials have been dated to the mid-second millennium B.C. (Piggott 1975). Earlier Andronovo burials, dating to the seventeenth sixteenth centuries B.C., at Sintashta, Berlik, Ulyubay, and Satan, in northern and central Kazakhstan, have yielded the remains of wheeled vehicles or their imprints (Gening 1977; Smirnov and Kuz' mina 1977; Zdanovich 1983). The size of the kurgans under which the males were buried and the fact that their burials were accompanied by wheeled vehicles and horses that had been laid above the actual burial-as if intended to escort the dead-<:ertainly indicates a degree of status accorded the male dead. Within this Timber-grave-Andronovo complex, women were occasionally accorded burial under large kurgans. Nonetheless, we know relatively little about such burials: they have been so completely plundered that little of the original furnishings remain (Zdanovich 1983). Our ignorance, however, may also reflect a general lack of interest on the part of archaeologists in uncovering funerary rituals which might disturb existing theories of status and ranking. 8 The very fact that female burials

were so thoroughly plundered would certainly suggest that such burials must have been rich in metals and that their occupants were elite members ofsociety, but that possibility is generally overlooked, as is the fact that the vehicle burials have simply received more attention-and, one might add, more authority-than those without vehicles have. The question arises whether our contemporary social privileging of individuals buried with vehicles actually reflects the reality of the culture in question and its values. It is indeed probable that the Timber-grave-Andronovo connection was essential to the reintroduction of wheeled vehicles into South Siberia. Two major scholars of that connection, Kuz'mina and Smirnov, have argued that from the fourteenth century B.C. the chariot was used as an instrument of war among the Mitanni, Hittites, and Assyrians. This tradition established the association of chariots with war-making and with a warrior elite within the Indo-Iranian culture carried by the Andronovo across Kazakhstan (Smirnov and Kuz'mina 1977: 53). According to Kuz'mina, the appearance of wheeled vehicles or their substitutes in burials probably indicates the high class of the dead and the fact of class differentiation (Kuz'mina 1974). There is general agreement that the four wheeled vehicle developed within the Proto-Indo-European cultures of the eastern European steppe and that its diffusion must be associated with the use of the horse for rapid traction and riding, and with the use of the wagon for indicating status in burials (Gimbutas 1963, 1973; Piggott 1974, 1975, 1983; and cf. Rowlett 1984). On the other hand, Littauer and Crouwel have argued that the light war chariot was developed within the Near East as a practical response to the imperial need for a prestigious vehicle combining speed with maneuverability (1976). It is also clear that from as early as the third millennium the chariot was associated with both gods and goddesses thoughout the Near East. In Hittite representations of wheeled vehicles of the second millennium B.C. and with the appearance of actual vehicles within Mycenae shaft graves, the chariot seems to have been associated with success in war or in the hunt (Anati 1960: figs. 1, 2). By the time the image of the chariot appeared in Central Europe, as in Camonica Valley of northern Italy, its image had come to function more as a sign represented schematically either with or without bovines or horses for traction and frequently accompanied by ithyphallic stick figures with raised arms. Anati associates these images with the emergence of heroic figures or war divinities (Anati 1960, 1961). Elsewhere in the Camonica petroglyphs, two or four wheeled vehicles appear in a

functional form, as if for hauling. Many of these European representations have been found together with the images of weapons, thus prompting the conclusion that the wheeled vehicle was the sign of the warrior class of an aggressive culture. The image of a wagon pulled by two oxen, together with the images of daggers, is found on a massive stone figure dating to the third millennium B.C., from Lagundo, northern Italy (pl. XXld). Such a combination has only served to confirm in the minds of many observers the intimate relationship between wagons or wheeled vehicles and warriors. In Scandinavian petroglyphs dated to the Bronze Age, the twowheeled vehicle was frequently represented both with and without draft animals and drivers. 9 Individual wheel shapes are also assumed to refer to the chariot and both chariot and wheel are understood as referring to a cult of the sun (Anati 1960; Gelling 1969). The famous "sun chariot" of Trundholm has been cited as a primary example of the relationship between wheels, wheeled vehicles, horses, and the sun in northern Europe. In general, wheels and wheeled vehicles have been understood as referring to an Indo-European worship of the sun; they are thus associated with the sun, the sky, and with a warrior elite. Within these understandings, the distinction between wagons, carts, and chariots has too often been neglected; anything wheeled becomes referred to as a chariot and the "chariot" is associated with both solar worship and with the warrior hero (Gelling 1969; Hawkes 1962). It is certainly this set of associations, born of a fascination with solarism within European scholarship (cf. Dorson 1955), that lies at the basis of the predominant interpretation of South Siberian and Central Asian vehicle images. Within the Indo-European tradition there is considerable association between horse, chariot, sun, and heroic figure. Of all the Vedic-Avestan dieties, Surya is most clearly associated with the sun and the golden chariot. His name is said to have derived from svar, light, a cognate of the Avestan hvare, sun, "which has swift horses and is the eye of Ahura Mazda" (Macdonell 1965, 124). The Avestan Mithra, also, is said to ride before the sun in his bright chariot, but he himself is not a solar deity nor does his chariot represent the sun. 10 Male gods do not, however, have a monopoly on chariots and light. Usas, the Dawn, is also represented as

coming in a chariot (ratha) of light, bringing the luminosity of heaven. 11 Moreover, within the Vedic tradition, chariots and swift horses are not consistently indicators of male superiority. In demonstrating how in the Inda-European tradition the third function (the cultivators) could gain supremacy over the first two functions (priests and kings, warriors and charioteers), Dumezil cites the tale of Mudgale, from Rig Veda X, who took part in a chariot race by using a cart drawn by a single ox and driven by his wife, Mudgalani (Dumezil 1953: 202, 254-262; Grottanelli 1986: 138-139). In this case, supremacy comes at the hands of a woman driving a slow, ox-drawn cart. Grottanelli has pointed to a number of other instances within Inda-European mythology in which virtuous women driving carts or wagons gain the upper hand over men driving or riding horses. 12 These various instances suggest that the association of chariot, horse, and heroic male is not fully supported even within Inda-European and Indo-Iranian mythology. Among all the images of wheeled vehicles which have been recorded from the petroglyphs of South Siberia and Central Asia, none matches those of the Znamenka stone. Okladnikov has recorded what may be a wagon from the Yelangash complex, but it is pulled by horses and not associated with the images of bovines (pl. XVIlf). I have earlierreferred to the representations of ploughs at Saimaly-Tash in the Tyan-Shan mountains which Golendukhin (1971) identifies with calendrical celebrations of an agricultural society. At Saimaly-Tash, representations of whecle1 implements appear to be used in ploughing (Sher 1980: fig. 107). By contrast, no ploughing images have been recorded at sites further to the northeast, in South Siberia, or in Mongolia. Given the limited agricultural opportunities of that region, the lack of such images may not be surprising. Kozhin has proposed that the wheeled vehicle most strikingly represented in the so-called "Gobi quadriga" (pl. XVIIIa) must be compared with chariots found at Anyang. He dates the Gobi vehicle and the Shang
11 Rig Veda I, 48-49. Even that association is not consistent, however. In Rig Veda IV, Usas is represented as having been humiliated by Indra; enraged by her delay in bringing the dawn, he breaks her cart with his thunder bolt. (Dumezil 1968-1973: 176-188). 12 Even within the founding of the Scythian tradition, the supposed equation of gold, horse, warrior is not consistent. According to Herodotus, to whom we owe the fullest account of the Scythians, the Scythians associated their origins with a golden plough, a golden yoke, a golden battle-axe and a golden cup, all of which fell from heaven. Dumezil has pointed out how, in this account, the Scythians were associated with the implements of the cultivatorplough, cart, oxen-as well as with the cup of the priest and the battle-axe of the warrior. At their very founding, the Scylhians were thus associated with lhe three functions of priest, warrior, cultivator (Dumezil 1953: 263-266).

Dynasty chariot contemporaneously with the Karasuk period, that is, to the fourteenth - eleventh centuries B.C. (Kozhin 1968, 1977). From this he concludes that all Bronze Age wheeled vehicles in both Central and East Asia must be associated with the Karasuk culture and must be considered to represent the advent of an invading culture dependent on the use of a new war vehicle. Novgorodova also dates the representation of wheeled vehicles in Mongolia to the early Karasuk, which she places as early as the fifteenth to thirteenth centuries B.C. She agrees with Kozhin that the wide spread diffusion of vehicle images represented the pre-eminence of a new battle weapon (Novgorodova 1984: 64). On the basis of the Mongolian representations of wheeled vehicles and, in particular, with reference to the image group from Chuluut Gol comprised of a horse-drawn two-wheeled vehicle, a driver, and a snake-like element (pl. XVIIlb), Novgorodova suggests the relationship of the chariot image to a hero-warrior and thus the vehicle as sign of the emergence of the heroic epic tradition of South Siberia. In those twc instances where deer with large antlers appear near a chariot or its driver, she proposes that the deer should be understood as the warrior's totemic protector (Novgorodova 1984: 70-71 ). Novgorodova's argument and that of Kozhin and other scholars associating wheeled vehicles and specifically "chariots" with a warrior class assume an analogy between the function and symbolic load of the vehicle in eastern Eurasia and the association of the wheeled vehicle with a warrior class within Indo-European traditions. What one actually finds in the petroglyphic images of Central Europe and Scandinavia is a sufficiently varying set of associated images to indicate that cultural values and symbolic meaning must have shifted as traditions moved into new environments. While in Central Europe the image of the wheeled vehicle is sometimes associated with the representations of weapons, the vehicle itself cannot be conceived as a war chariot: in fact, it is usually not a chariot at all, but rather a four-wheeled wagon drawn by oxen. 13 In petroglyphs from Bohuslan, this vehicle is sometimes drawn by a deer, an unlikely animal for a war chariot (Gelling 1969: figs. 7/d, 44/a-g). At other times, it is simply represented without an animal. This variation in draft animals-horses, bovines, or even deer-or their complete absence is repeated in the case of the South Siberian- Mongolian imagery. If one were to assume that the wagon, cart, or chariot were a sign of the warrior,

134 THE ELABORATION OF IMAGE AND MEANING
then one would also have to conclude that the vehicle itself, without its draft animal, was a sufficient sign of the warrior caste. Whether in the case of European petroglyphs or those from Central Asia and South Siberia, however, or even in the contrast between wagons used in Indo-European burials and chariots used by Near Eastern royalty, one is forced to ask what exactly should be associated with the warrior: the slow wagon, the rough cart, or the chariot? The vehicle drawn by oxen, by horses, by deer or by nothing at all? Which kind of vehicle is actually represented in the South Siberian petroglyphs? We have seen that the images as often as not indicate the solid-wheel construction of a slow cart, rather than the light and multi-spoked wheel construction of a chariot. Sturdy, slow vehicles would be justified by the need to transport goods and people across extensive terrain. The maneuverability of such a vehicle is also appropriate to a landscape characterized by rough, mountainous terrain, narrow high valleys and passes, and the broad grasslands of northern Mongolia. On the other hand, it is difficult to imagine the usefulness of a chariot in most of the terrain of southeastern Gorno-Altayskaya A.O., Tuva, or northwestern Mongolia. The land there is too high in elevation and too rough in surface for a light vehicle of prestige developed in the context of a Near Eastern urbanized society or for warfare on the broad Central Plain of China. In certain parts of the Chuya Steppe chariots might be practical. The inevitable unevenness of terrain and the presence of rugged side valleys, however, raise the possibility that the pursued enemy or hunted animals could quickly find shelter on a higher terrace, inaccessible to a chariot, or that they could rapidly disappear into one of the constant defiles bordering the broader valleys. In the meantime, the pursuing chariot would have fallen to pieces, unable to absorb the vibrations created when a light, wooden, two-wheeled vehicle is pulled rapidly over rough terrain. A number of other considerations, all drawn from the petroglyphic record itself, further challenge the conclusion that the vehicle imagery of South Siberia and Mongolia indicates the intrusion of a warlike society and the presence of a warrior class. In the case of Central Europe, the association of vehicle and warrior is suggested by the occasional representation of weapons together with wheeled vehicles; the association of weapons, bovines, and vehicles with a male figure is particularly indicated by the anthropomorphic stele from Lagundo (pl. XXId). By contrast, in South Siberia and Central Asia there are no representations of weapons found in association with the images of wheeled vehicles, except those few carried by the driver. If one is to insist that the vehicle

is a warrior signifier, then it would have to be admitted that in the process of transmission from west to east-from western Siberia and Kazakhstan into South Siberia and Mongolia-an important part of the signifying complex, the weapons of the warrior, were discarded. This would be to admit, however, that the imagery and the symbolic loads the images carried changed with environment and time. However similar may have been the wagons and carts carved onto the rocks of Central Europe and South Siberia, their apparent similarity does not support an argument of identity of substance or signification. The positive arguments joining vehicle representations to a Bronze Age date rely heavily, as we have seen, on material from Bronze Age cultures of western Central Asia and Europe and on the understanding that the Timber-grave culture was a western variation of the Andronovo culture of Central Asia and South Siberia (Chernikov 1960; Gimbutas 1965; Sulimirski 1970a). These finds indicate that wheeled vehicles were used within the burial rituals of Indo-European cultures which had penetrated deep into the Kazakhstan steppe; presumably, these same cultures used wheeled vehicles in their daily life. Where the trail of actual wagons or carts ends, in northern Kazakhstan, their images begin again: in the petroglyphs of the Alichur and Karatau ridges, for example, and in those of Saimaly-Tash. One is led to the conclusion that the wheeled vehicle had to have been reintroduced into northern Central Asia and South Siberia during the Andronovo period and out of the Timber-grave-Andronovo connection. The ploughing representations at Saimaly-Tash indicate, however, an earlier knowledge of the use of animal traction, perhaps with wheeled implements, brought from the Near East to eastern Central Asia. Thus, the Andronovo vehicle may represent a reintroduction of the function of animal traction and with it the introduction of new cultural values. Kozhin and Novgorodova associate the appearance of the vehicle image and, thus, of the "chariot" itself with the Karasuk culture (Kozhin 1968, 1969, 1977; Novgorodova 1984; Nowgorodowa (Novgorodova) 1980). In contrast to the westward-extending Andronovo culture, the Karasuk culture is acknowledged to have been formed out of elements indiginous to Siberia. The people of the Karasuk culture would either have had to reinvent the wheeled vehicle independently-an unlikely circumstance, which no one has tried to argue-or they would have had to receive it from such southern neighbors as the Chinese or from western neighbors, such as the Andronovo. There is no archaeological evidence to indicate that the wheeled vehicle of Shang China could have

been indiginously developed; from its Anyang date and the lack of evidence of more primitive forms, it could only have been received from outside. The one remaining source for the reintroduction of the wheeled vehicle, and by far the most convincing one, is the Andronovo culture, with its westward extension into the Timber-grave culture. There are other elements, however, which undermine the theory that the dispersal of the wheeled vehicle was specifically associated with the expansion of the Karasuk culture. In terms of the sheer number of representations, the drift of the wheeled vehicle image seems to have been from the region of eastern Kazakhstan and Gorno-Altayskaya A.O. into Mongolia and present-day Inner Mongolia. There are very few representations of wheeled vehicles preserved in the Minusinsk Basin, the region where the Karasuk culture first clearly emerged. Moreover, while the Mongolian deer stones have been convincingly associated with the Karasuk period on the basis of the weapon typologies represented on the stones (see Chapter VI), there is only one recorded instance of a cart represented on a deer stone and the dating of that image is entirely uncertain (Volkov 1981: pl. 103). There is, also, only one instance of a vehicle associated with the deer image of the type found on the Mongolian deer stones. In that case, from Chuluut Gol, it is possible that the large deer is a later "addition" to the much smaller representation of cart and hunter-driver (pl. XVIIId). If, as Volkov has persuasively argued, the deer stones can be dated to the late Bronze Age, i.e. to approximately 1000 B.C. and later, then it would seem necessary to place the image of the wheeled vehicle earlierthan that date, although within the AndronovoKarasuk chronology. 14 The similar geographic distribution of representations of wheeled vehicles and the mushroom-hatted figures suggests that within the South Siberian-Mongolian arena these two pictorial elements referred back to the same cultural context. Their actual connection is not, however, completely clear. Within the Yelangash complex, two-wheeled vehicles may possibly be associated with the mushroom-hatted figures. I have referred already to one instance (pl. XVIIlc) in which a hatted figure "stands" on the axle of a two-wheeled vehicle drawn by a bovine and a horse. Above the head of the man is a small deer with antlers. Whether deer and man were done together is unclear, as is the exact nature of the man's headwear. From Chankyr-Kel' comes a more certain image of a

mushroom-hatted figure. He leads two horses and seems to be approaching a two-wheeled cart, as if to harness the animals (pl. XVIIe). As in the case of the previous relationship of deer to man, however, this relationship of horses to vehicle is merely hypothetical. 15 Only one known representation of a mushroom-hatted figure associated with a wheeled vehicle has been found in Mongolia, in the Chuluut Gol complex (pl. XVIIIb). From all the known images of both mushroom-hatted figures and wheeled vehicles, from Kazakhtan through Gorno-Altayskaya A.O., Tuva, and Mongolia, there are only three instances in w~ich the two elements may possibly be connected, and only one-that from Chuluut Gal-where the connection seems certain. One can only conclude that if indeed the two pictorial elements belonged to the same cultural stratum, they were not necessarily associated.
I have indicated that the images of "chariots" and "warriors" have had an overwhelming influence on the general understanding of Bronze Age South Siberia and northern Mongolia. The Indo-European solar theories into which all petroglyphic imagery has been fit necessarily color the prevailing understanding of images of deer, cattle, syncretic forms, and mushroom-hatted figures. These images have either been ignored, or the cattle are turned into bulls and the deer into solarized animals. Within that interpretative strategy, there has been little possibility for locating the actual focus on rituals which bind community. 16 A careful examination of the petroglyphic record, however, would indicate different circumstances and different conclusions. Both the petroglyphic record and its association with the archaeology of the Aeneolithic and Bronze Age across Eurasia suggest that during the second millennium B.C. there was a gradual intrusion of peoples from the west and southwest into northern Kazakhstan, the northern Altay, and Mongolia. These peoples had originally inherited the Indo-European traditions of the Timber-grave culture as well as elements from the Near Eastern traditions which had preceded the Indo-European overlay but persisted within the agricultural oases of Central Asia. In other words, the Bronze Age cultures reflected in the Saimaly-Tash and Tamgaly petroglyphic complexes were not purely Inda-European and cannot be fathomed using only the tools of a simplified Inda-European
15 I can cite no other representations in which a figure appears to be harnessing animals to a vehicle. 16 For a continuation of the interest in solar interpretations, see, most recently, Martynov 1990.

mythic tradition. We must assume that as the Andronovo peoples pushed on into South Siberia, their customs and beliefs met, confronted, and were reshaped by the customs and beliefs of the autochthonous populations. The climatic rigors and rugged landscape of South Siberia had to have constrained mythic traditions which had arisen far to the west and south. The very process of penetrating into the Minusinsk Basin and settling in a land which opened to the taiga and tundra of the north must have forced belief systems onto the imagination of the newcomers that had been shaped by the landscape, the weather, the native plants and animals. Physical and cultural survival must have insisted on accommodation and change. As Andronovo met Karasuk and as non-Siberian traditions merged into those of Siberia, reflections of the resulting cultural modifications spread themselves across the petroglyphic record and left signs which contradict the prevailing conceptions of an intruding warlike culture. The image groups that are indicative of interaction or rudimentary narrative emphasize ritual, the hunt (which may also be ritual), and interaction relating to wheeled vehicles. Within those Bronze Age traces, there is no indication that the cultures responsible for the petroglyphs placed a particularly high value on either individual human combat or on war. Indeed, the vast majority of the scenes eschew violence and the hunting scenes are striking for their lack of violence; figures and animals are balanced in size and number, as if to suggest a balance in actuality. There is no indication that the mushroom-hatted figures functioned more frequently as hunters than did any other kind of figure, nor does petroglyphic evidence allow the conclusion that they may have been warriors. While war, combat, and plunder may well have been part of cultural life, within the petroglyphic record we find no validation of these activities. The imagery catalogued above indicates that the hunt for meat, ritual hunting, and ritual dance and sacrifice were valued above all other activities. The vehicle, too, even without a driver, seems to have had a particular, if still unclear, significance. In the vast majority of cases, the wheeled vehicle is drawn by only two animals, usually horses but occasionally bovines. The largest concentration of these representations comes from the valley of the Yelangash River with extensions into the valley of Chuluut Gol. The general aspect of all the represented vehicles is that of a vehicle used for everyday practical purposes rather than for military purposes. The vehicles seem to be driving in all directions or to be facing in all directions; the very arbitrariness of directionality seriously under

cuts the assumption that the vehicle referred to the sun in its course through the heavens. Moreover, the appearance of the cart alone indicates that it was valued in and of itself, without any necessary reference to warriors or horses. There are no texts to indicate how the vehicles functioned in the life of Bronze Age peoples of South Siberia and Mongolia. We do know, however, something about the significance of the cart within the life of the Mongols of the Mongol empire. This has been described by Western visitors to the courts of the great khans. The Mongols' carts were apparently essential elements in the wealth of a household. They were small enough to carry the personal chests prized by women or large enough to carry large gers (yurts). The latter could require up to 22 oxen in a team. According to Friar William of Rubruck (journeyed 12531255), such a cart would require an axle as large as the mast of a ship (Komroff 1928: 59-60). William's account is interesting for the light it sheds on the use and significance of the carts. He indicates that these carts were intimately associated with a sense of community. The "Tartars" (as he called them) would carry their houses on their carts and whenever they stopped to make camp, they placed the carts with their chests still on them "here and there, within half a stone's throw of the house: so that the house stands between two ranks of carts, as it were, between two walls." The carts carrying the family wealth seem to have been associated particularly with women: they carried the women's personal chests, often carved with great refinement. The women, according to William, made themselves "most beautiful carts," and a rich man with many wives thus had many carts for all his women. "One woman will guide twenty or thirty carts at once ... and they bind the carts with camels or oxen, one behind another...They go at a slow pace, as fast as a lamb or an ox might walk" (Komroff 1928: 60-61). William says that the duties of women included, among others, driving the carts, laying their houses on the carts and taking them off again (Komroff 1928: 70). 17 Granting the great time difference between the petroglyphs of the Bronze Age and the Mongolian practices observed by William of Rubruck in the thirteenth century, one may still find in the latter an explanation for the former. Rather than referring to hunters or warriors, or even to the aggressive invasion of a foreign culture, the Bronze Age petroglyphs of wheeled vehicles may simply refer to the presence of a
17 Contemporary Mongolians use horse drawn carts, most frequently with only two wheels and drawn by one or two horses. The flat bed of the cart can be loaded up; the axle is held up along the body of the horse.

new culture in terms of the signs of its understanding of wealth. With or without draft animals, the cart may have functioned as a cultural sign of well-being; it may have referred to the community as a source of identity and to the presence of that community in a new region. It is entirely possible that such a cultural intrusion was identical with the intrusion of the Andronovo culture into South Siberia and its merging with the: contemporary Karasuk culture of the Minusinsk Basin and northern Mongolia. If we are to take the petroglyphs seriously, however, then we must admit that as that culture penetrated into the physical and culturall environment of South Siberia, it is possible that its Indo-European mythic traditions and values were constrained and reshaped by new conditions of survival and other belief systems. The wheeled vehicle may have begun as a sign of the Indo-European warrior and as a reference to the sun, but we have seen that the insistence on conflating wheeled vehicles, solar signification, and warfare raises serious questions as to whether cultural theory leads or is led by historical documentation. However the image of the vehicle functioned within IndoEuropean traditions, it seems to have last appeared in eastern Eurasia in a different form: as a sign of a cultural presence and as the mark of community. Like the images of ritually dressed figures, the images of vehicles carved into the cliffs and boulders of South Siberia and Central Asia trace the gradual infiltration of one culture into a hitherto unknown territory. These images reflect neither warriors nor solar worship nor even the emergence of a dominant warrior caste, but rather community as identity, the cart as a sign of household well-being, and the community reaffirmed by rituals. Within those rituals the primary animals seem to have been cattle and deer. Whether both were used cannot be certain; but their ubiquitous presence and the curious syncretic deer-cattle certainly indicate that they were referred to-one a sign of the pastoral economy, the other a sign of a continued physical and spiritual dependency on forest animals.

CHAPTER SIX
DEER STONES AND WARRIORS
Anthropomorphic Monoliths of the First Millennium B.C.
A. HISTORICAL AND GEOPHYSICAL CONTEXT
Yalbak-Tash is the name of a small pass on the north side of the Chuya River above the confluence of the Chuya and Katun'. To the casual observer it is only a crumbled mass of rocky outcroppings. Observed more closely, one may begin to discern fragments and broken surfaces on which remain images of deer, caprids, horses, and horsemen, the reflections of centuries of cultural traditions from the Bronze Age to the present. The millennia have taken their toll here and few smooth surfaces remain. High in the center of Yalbak-Tash, a vertical surface stands out from the surrounding stony debris. Its face is marked by a number of silhouetted images, visible even from a distance. When lit by the side light of morning or late afternoon, the chipped-in shapes separate themselves from the mauve-grey stone. Particularly striking are the images of two stylized reindeer (pl. IXh)-their bodies exaggeratedly elongated, their withers sharply raised into a point, their hindquarters rounded as if tensed for flight. By contrast, their legs are short and thin-almost withered appendages. The heads of these deer are no less stylized: small, elegant, with the nose and jaw region elongated into a long beak-like form. The lower animal, a buck, has a large antler which recedes back over his neck. The animal above has the smaller rack of a female. The stylized deer at Yalbak-Tash are late versions of an image which appeared in petroglyphs of South Siberia and Mongolia in the late Bronze Age. Those at Yalbak-Tash are among the western-most instances of this type and date to the period of the Early Nomads, but eastward, in the Chuya Valley at Kalbak-Tash, throughout the Yelangash complex, and on the Barburgazy River flowing down from the Saylyugem Ridge1 this particular deer image is repeated again and again (e.g., pl. Xllc,d,e; pl. XVI). The vast majority of these deer images are antlered and most lack any indication of gender. Only in late instances, as here

142 DEER STONES AND WARRIORS
at Yalbak-Tash or in the case of a pair of images from a site further east on the Barburgazy River (pl. XVId), is there any clear distinction between male and female animals. At Yalbak-Tash, Kalbak-Tash, Yelangash, and Barburgazy, the deer with exaggerated antlers, elongated bodies, and beak-like heads describe a cultural intrusion out of northern Mongolia and westward into presentday Gorno-Altayskaya A.O., an intrusion which also left traces north into Tuva and southwest into Kazakhstan. More importantly, they are the most distinctive aspect of the so-called "deer stones" of South Siberia and northern Central Asia and serve as the source of that peculiar name. In fact, these stylized deer images appear only on the stones associated with Mongolia and the Transbaykal; their anthropomorphic reference, however, is repeated in the deer stones of Tuva and Gorno-Altayskaya A.O. and even in the monolithic sculpture associated with Eastern Europe in the late Bronze and early Iron Ages. As much as the image of the deer itself, the deer stone maps the changing ecology of culture and belief across the Eurasian Steppe in the first millennium B.C. At this time, considerably more than 600 deer stones have been recorded in the region of Central Asia and South Siberia. 2 Related stone images are now known to have been carved across a vast region that included parts of South Siberia, Central Asia, west to the Kuban in Georgia, the region of the lower Bug River, Dubrudzhe in northeastern Bulgaria and even on the Elbe River (Chlenova 1962; Savinov and Chlenova 1978).
B. DEER STONES OF MONGOLIA AND THE TRANSBAYKAL
In a collection of careful drawings first published late in the last century, the archaeologist and explorer V. V. Radlov called attention to the deer stones of ancient Mongolia, as well as to the Turkic stones and runes which succeeded them (Radlov 1892). His reproductions demonstrated the manner in which these stones were regularly enveloped in images of deer both elegant and highly stylized. The drawings also indicated the extent to which the deer stones were set within elaborate stoneworks. In some cases, these stoneworks resembled the vertically protruding walls of a grave; in other cases, they took the form of elaborate circular mounds
2 Already in 1979 Kubarev reported more than 500 known in Mongolia alone, as well as approximately 30 in Tuva, and SO recorded by himself and others in Gorno-Altayskaya A.O.. (Kubarev 1979). A few years earlier, Schul'ts had estimated that there were 42 known images from the Scythian world (Schul'tz 1976).

with "fences," "gates," crosswalks, or repeated circles of seven or eight boulders. Radlov's drawings suggest that the deer stones were part of elaborate ritual constructions, presumably of considerable ancient significance. Interest in the deer stones was rekindled in 1954 by A. P. Okladnikov' s study of a stone which had been collected in 1856 by D. P. Davydov from a place described as "between the Ivolga and Klyuchevskiy stations, along the highway from Verkhne-Udinsk to Selenginsk, 22 verts south of Verkhne-Udinsk" (Okladnikov 1954). According to Davydov's description, the stone had been found lying flat on the ground. Under it was found "rubble" and the bones of a headless horse. Okladnikov believes that it was this deer stone which can now be found in the State Historical Museum in Irkutsk and which has come to be referred to as the Ivolga stone (pl. XIXd). The Ivolga stone measures approximately 3.5 m. in length, 90 cm. in width at the center of the stone, and about 19-20 cm. thick. In its original setting it rose about 2.9 m. over the surface of the ground. The upper end of the stone is cut on a diagonal slant; the resulting high thin side is generally considered to be the "face," or east, side of the stone. Covering the two wide surfaces of the stone are the elegantly carved figures of deer with heads facing towards the taller thin side . The carving of the deer images is shallow: the deer have small triangulated forelegs, truncated hind legs, exaggeratedly long bodies and necks. Each deer's withers are marked by a pronounced rising point, their heads are distinctly and deliberately transformed into long bird-beaks, and their antlers flow back over their bodies in great rising waves. Between the large bodies of deer are smaller ones, as if to fill space, as well as the small bodies of horse-like animals; on the south side a kind of battle axe may be seen. In a few cases, the heads of small "filler" deer are turned backward and their legs are folded under their bodies in a more realistic, recumbent posture. On the narrow east face of the Ivolga stone are a series of objects including, at the top, a small deer and beneath it a round circle, a bow with readied arrow, and several weapons and tools, ending with a double hook. The shorter, narrow west side of the stone is likewise marked by the bodies of small, beaked deer placed vertically with heads up; beneath them is a trapezoidal shield-like object of uncertain significance. In the triangular area at the top of the stone's north face a circular object with a tail descending like a handle is carved. On the south side of the stone, in the same position, are two circles, the upper one smaller than the

lower. Beneath these two is a line, set as if to separate the space of the circles from the deer. The Ivolga stone offered Okladnikov an opportunity to present the rich vocabulary ofimages which have come to characterize the TransbaykalMongolian deer stone. On the basis of the deers' pronounced forehead tines, Okladnikov identified these animals as reindeer. He argued that the circles on the upper north side of the stone and on the east side were: long-handled mirrors and that the line on the upper south side was a belt. He suggested that the stone should be dated to approximately the seventh - sixth centuries B.C. and that it was contemporary with the early slab graves of the Transbaykal, "of which the inventory, disregarding for a. moment its rarity, retains unquestionable Karasuk characteristics'" (Okladnikov 1954: 218). He surmised that the Ivolga stone was probably the creation of a local late Bronze Age culture, one dependent on stock and, to a lesser extent, agricultural cultivation. Okladnikov believed that the stone had to have been associated with funerary rituals and that it must have functioned as a monument to a particular dead person. On the basis of the weaponry represented on the stone, he concluded that the dead person to whom the stone was dedicated was a warrior, and since the slab graves associated with the stone must have required an expenditure of significant social energy, the warrior memorialized by the stone must have been a leader of high status. Okladnikov's conclusions established the essential interpretative strategy that has characterized the approaches of most scholars. This strategy has assumed that the stones were associated in some way with funerary monuments and that they refer to male warriors. From this identification of the representational value of the stones has emerged the conclusion that, by the late Bronze Age, the nomadic and semi-nomadic cultures of the Eurasian steppe were dominated by a warrior elite. The male reference carried by the weapons and belts of the stones indicates, in turn, an established patriarchal social organization (cf. Dikov 1958: 46). The Ivolga stone is an unusually fine example of the Mongolian deer stone type-that is, of that type found primarily in the Transbaykal and Mongolia. Almost invariably, these stones are covered with the stylized images of recumbent deer with bird bill-like heads and exaggeratedly large antlers. Smaller deer, horses, weapons, and tools were carved into intervening spaces. The belts with which most of the stones are carved are particularly suggestive of an anthropomorpic reference. Even in the case of crudely carved stones, the encircling belt and its hanging

assortment of tools and weapons evokes the order of a human body from the otherwise mute stone. Among those tools and weapons can be found axes, daggers, hooks, and a peculiar, as-yet unidentified shield-like object. Around the upper part of the stone may appear marks which have been identified by a number of scholars as "necklaces," "earrings," mirrors, and other objects which underscore the essentially anthropomorphic reference of these stones (e.g., pl. XIXa, c). To date, the most extensive study of the deer stones of Mongolia is that by V. V. Volkov (1981). Following the earlier_ observations of Okladnikov and Dikov, Volkov distinguished between two cultural traditions which were joined by the appearance of the characteristic Mongolian stone. In the Transbaykal, eastern Mongolia, and the region to the east of Govi-Altay Aymag, the deer stones appeared in the context of cemeteries, the graves of which were marked above ground by rectangular "walls" of vertically set thin slabs. These complexes have been referred to in scientific literature as slab graves; they are associated with a Siberian cultural tradition centered in the late Bronze and early Iron Ages in the Transbaykal and in northeastern Mongolia (Dikov 1958; Volkov 1967; Grishin 1968, 1975). Through the rare finds of bronze objects such as knives or daggers (e.g., Grishin 1975: fig. 13), the slab-graves have been connected with a late Karasuk bronze culture. The relatively infrequent skeletal remains which have been recovered from the slab-graves also indicate a fairly clear Mongoloid element (Gokhman 1967; Grishin 1975). 3 The deer stones were generally set up near the corners of the slab-graves, or as part of the slab wall. In some cases, a single stone seems to have functioned as a kind of a guard stone, set about 8 to 10 m. east of the graves. In their occasional placement at the corners of the slab graves, they suggested to Volkov both guard stones and a kind of hitching post for tying a horse (Volkov 1981: 81). In several cases they were left lying on the ground, like a kind of hearth before the burial site. Such an arrangement has been recorded at a site near Ulangom in Uvsanyr Aymag and at Khereksurin Denzh, in Bayankhongor Aymag (Nowgorodowa (Novgorodova) 1980, 1989; Volkov 1981: pl. 37). The manner in which the horizontal stones were intended to function is uncertain; it remains possible that at those sites, as elsewhere, their use as covers over burial or sacrificial sites may represent the reuse of stones originally intended for another purpose. While the deer stones are connected with the slab-grave culture
3 On the other hand, the slab-graves with accompanying deer stones have been so lacking in furnishings and skeletal remains as to suggest to Volkov that they were not graves at all, but rather ritual sites (Volkov 1981: 81).

centered in central and northeastern Mongolia and the Transbaykal, they are also associated with a culture whose most impressive remains include large stone kurgans, surface monuments of stones known as "khereksur," and circular enclosures or alters. The khereksur are typically round in plan and surrounded by round or square enclosing walls articulated with considerable variety. 4 The khereksur seem to have functioned as ritual structures of some kind, marking the sanctity of a place and the locus of sacrificial altars. Khereksur complexes have been recorded across northern Mongolia as well as in Tuva and southeastern Gorno-Altayskaya A.O.5 The ritual complexes marked by Mongolian deer stones and khereksur were often elaborated by other surface structures: by stone kurgans, round stone altars laid out in regular patterns, and "walls" and "gates" surrounding the khereksur or kurgan. 6 The complex at Ushkiin-uver, Hovsgol Aymag, in northern Mongolia, is an excellent example of the complexity of these architectural and sculptured ensembles (pl. XIXb). The khereksur took the form of a great mound surrounded by a wall of stones and by a larger circle formed of circular stone altars. Stretching to the south of the khereksur were two rows of large deer stones-fifteen in all-carefully organized among circular altars (Volkov and Novgorodova 1975; Volkov 1981). At Khargalant, in Arhangay Aymag, the combination of deer stones and hundreds of stone altars suggests a gradual elaboration of the site by generations of worshippers (Volkov 1981: pl. 21). In such an instance one has the impression of a site sanctified as much by continuous tradition as by any specific time-bound ritual. 7
4 The term, khereksur, or kereksur, comes from the Mongolian term, "khargias-ur," meaning large, elaborately structured stone mounds, often with walls, gates, crosses, and attendent enclosures or altars; see Khudyakov 1987. 5 In recent years several scholars have called attention to a tradition of khereksur and ritual altars in the Transbaykal, particularly in the region of the Selenga River and its tributaries; see Danilov 1987; Tivanenko 1989. 6 Particularly clear discussion of elaborate stone complexes associated with the khereksur may be found in Grach 1980 and in Mannay-ool 1970. Mannay-ool dates these elaborate forms to the Scythian period, but most scholars date the khereksur to the late Bronze Age and early Iron Age. Khudyakov (1987) has attempted to determine a chronology of deer stones and khereksuron the basis of the organization of parts and the semantics of the stones. The results are not, however, persuasive. 7 The khereksur sites ofTuva could be almost as elaborate as those recorded in Mongolia. At the Tuvan site ofUlug-khorum, for example, the khereksur took the form ofa giant spoked wheel, among the stones of which were found pieces of deer stones. Associated with this khereksur were a large number of regularly placed round stone altars (Grach 1980; and see Grach 1960a, 1960b).

DEER STONES AND WARRIORS 147
The actual placement of the deer stones within both the slab-grave and khereksur complexes was not consistent. This variation points either to a broad range of functional possibilities or to the regular resetting of stones as needed by ritual (cf. pl. XIXb, c, e). By their placement on or in proximity to the khereksur or altars, they seem to have functioned as guard stones or corner markers. At Khargalant and Ushkiin-uver, the stones were evidently closely connected with the stone rings and small mounds which seem to have served as ritual altars. At the base of many of the stones have been found coals and bone ash, and many of the stones recorded by Volkov had been heat-burned in antiquity (Volkov 1981: 81). In some cases, however, the deer stones have been found lying on their sides, as if purposely disposed, and almost completely covered with earth.8 These peculiar variations in the placement of the stones again suggest their reuse by a culture later than that which had first produced them. Volkov believes that the time between the making and reusing of the stones may not have been very great: first made for a sacrificial altar, they could have later been reused within a burial structure. On the other hand, when the deer stones are found lying on the top of kurgans or khereksur (e.g., pl. XIXc), it is not possible to say whether or not they were actually set up vertically on these mounds and subsequently fell or whether they might have been used in that manner as structural material from the time of the construction of the mound (Volkov 1981: 94). 9 All who have studied the deer stones have been particularly interested in what is referred to as their semantics, about which I will have more to say below. For the time being it should be understood that while there are only six stones in Mongolia which have been carved with human faces, there is a virtually universal understanding that the deer stones carried an anthropomorphic reference. The three slash lines on the upper part of the stones refer to some aspect of the human head, while the circular elements on either side of the "head" are usually understood as earrings, and the bead-like elements around the head appear to be neck ornaments. The belt and hanging weapons and hooks confirm the identity of the figure as that of a warrior, while the curious trapezoidal
8 At Zheregsurin denzh, Bayankhongor Aymag, Volkov found about twenty stones laid flat on the ground. At Temeni chuluu, Ovclrhangay Aymag, the deer stones used in the construction of a tall slab wall had been buried upside down in the ground (Volkov 1981: 81). 9 A well-known case in point is the fragmented deer stone found within the boulders making up the Arzhan. Whether the deer stone was set up intact on the mound or whether it represents the reuse of a discarded stone considerably affects how one would date both the deer stone type and the burial itself; see Gryaznov 1980.

element which occurs regularly on deer stones is considered to be a shield. 10
C. DEER STONES OF THE SAYAN-ALTAY REGION
For many years, the Sayan-Altay deer stone tradition was known only through occasional articles, most of which looked at broader issues of dissemination of style and at questions of meaning. In 1979, V. D. Kubarev published what has been the most comprehensive study to date of the deer stones of Gorno-Altayskaya A.O. His book focused attention on the least well-known deer stone tradition, as well as on the sculptural type itself (Kubarev 1979). In considering the stones ofGorno-Altayskaya A.O., Kubarev established an approach to this sculptural form which correctly returns it to its larger archaeological context. In considering the deer stones of the Chuya and Katun' river valleys, Kubarev distinguished two types: those of a tall, thin type, the "face" of which was always on the thin eastern side; those stones which tend to be short and heavy, square in form and usually no higher than 1 m. In the case of the taller stones, the full length of which may reach 3 m., the upper part often slopes down from east to west in a manner reminiscent of a standing human figure. In some cases these stones are quite rough in cut, suggesting a great pointed slab of stone (e.g., pl. XXf). Both types-tall and thin, and short and heavy-shouldered- seem to have been contemporaneous. In both cases, however, one confronts the problem of use and reuse, and thus the issue of the intertextuality of image and type. There is ample indication that the Gorno-Altayskaya A.O. stones of both kinds were frequently reset and even recarved, first by the Early Nomads of the Pazyryk period (i.e., fourth-second centuries B.C.), and then by the Turks (seventh-ninth centuries A.D.). In the process of being recarved and reset, many of the taller stones seem to have been broken. A particularly clear example of the deer stone complexes of this region was recorded by Kubarev on the high bleak steppe of the Yustyd River, the central tributary to the upper Chuya (Kubarev 1979). The Yustyd complex is remarkable for the appearance of a deliberate order
10 A yoke-like object has been found on a number of the deer stones but its function has not been confidently identified. Some have suggested it was used for the bracing of a bow, others have associated it with a chariot or as the symbolic indicator of a chariot in the form of a kind of model yoke. Bronze counterparts are well known from Tagar-Karasuk, Andronovo, and Zhou Chinese burials but their function and meaning are no clearer; see Belokobyl'skiy 1985).

focused on some sacred ritual (pl. XXg). Within a great terrace several kilometers long, throughout which are scattered ritual rings, kurgans, and rows of stones from many different periods, Kubarev recorded an ordered grouping of perhaps 104 stone rings, running in rough rows of three, from north to south. On the east side of this grouping, also running north to south, were found perhaps 30 stones, either whole or in fragments. Originally, the stones must have been set vertically in the ground, facing to the east. Kubarev believes that they were arranged in pairs, north to south. Within all the rings were found the remains of strongly carbonized material, including animal bones, thus confirming the general hypothesis that these round rings represent ritual altars for burnt offerings of sacrificial animals. Among the stone rings is one square enclosure located roughly halfway between the north and south ends of the complex. At its center stands a large stone, #6, measuring 260 cm. on its longest side and 20 cm. at its greatest width (pl. XXf). In general shape and size, stone #6 appears to fit into the Sayan-Altay deer stone type. On its rough sides only three images have been carved: those of a hammer (south side), a dagger (east side), and a quiver (north side). While suggesting the sides of a person's body and the arrangement of weapons hanging from a belt, the small number of images and their modest size suggests almost an afterthought: as if the weapons had been added long after the stone's cutting and raising. The stone shaft had been set solidly into a mixture of earth and gravel and was wedged with larger stones for added stability. Within the material compressed at the base of the slab a number of unusual elements were found, including two burned horse teeth, some iron slag, and-just under the turf-pieces of four deer stones, recognizable by the presence of carved elements characteristic of the Sayan-Altay deer stone type (Kubarev 1979: pls. II-III). At a depth between 20 and 30 cm. a group of stone pestles was found, one of a decidedly phallic shape; several stones which appear to have been pieces of deer stones; a stone carved with a mask-like image; fragments of thin ceramic and black crystal. 11 The materials gathered and buried at the base of this large stone suggest a complex history of use and reuse, the treasuring of old objects,
11 Pestles, a stone mortar, and a finely worked diorite bear's head, as well as animal teeth, a tusk, and bone necklaces, have been recovered from an group of Afanasevo burials near Kuyum, Gorno-Altayskaya A.O. (Bers 1974). Volkov reports the finds of stone pestle-like objects mixed with the coals and ashes found near a deer stone at Dagan-de!' (Volkov 1981: 80.) The pestle seems to have been associated with rituals involving both sacrifice and the deer stones.

and their investment with a significance which went beyond either the value of their material or their function. These elements also complicate the dating of this stone. Its rough aspect and the stone pestles found deep at its base suggest an early date-perhaps as early as the Neolithic period. On the other hand, the pieces of iron slag and the fragments of more elaborately carved deer stones point to a date in the middle of the first millennium B.C. It is possible that the stone itself is ancient but was reset in the Early Nomadic period; the carved weapons would also date to the time of its resetting. At that time-presumably when this present complex was established-other deer stones were broken and distributed around its base. Other stones in the Yustyd group also indicate a deliberate and sometimes more practical breaking and reusing, often for construction purposes. A tall stone at the north end of the Yustyd complex, for example, was deliberately broken (pl. XXIa). 12 This curious process of breaking and reusing remains mysterious. One must presume that the deer stones themselves were invested with significant power, but with a power of an ambivalent nature. Among the deer stones of Gorno-Altayskaya A.O., as among those of Mongolia, a few are carved with clearly anthropomorphic references. One of three stones recently regrouped near the village of Iya, near the confluence of the Katun' and Chuya rivers, is shaped as if with a cowled hood; at its waist is carved a belt into which is tucked a dagger. A smaller stone in the same group also bears the dim traces of a face and belt. 13 Another stone further to the east in the Chuya Steppe is more interesting since it lacks signs of modern tampering. Rising about 2 m. above the surface of the ground, tilting precariously on its axis, its surface worn and discolored by lichen, the shaft appears from the distance like the lone guardian of the grassy terrace. On its upper east side a distinctive face marks the flat surface of the stone. With a large long face, long nose, a mouth down-turned at one end, and close-set eyes carved deeply into the stone the face far more readily recalls a Europoid type than do the usual faces on Turkic stones of the Altay region (cf. Kubarev 1984). On the
12 Other stones were smashed and used either for the stone debris of circles and mounds or for the rings themselves. Yet another stone was found approximately 150 - 200 m. to the northwest of stone #6. Squat in form (30 x 25 x 15 cm.), it had been placed on the west-most end of a row of balbal running to the east from a small enclosure of the Turkic period. Three stones in the same complex (Kubarev's 7, 14, 15) were found lying in the center of a mound of a huge khereksur (Kubarev 1979). 13 Within the last few years, local residents reset the shafts in concrete in closer proximity to a large unexcavated kurgan from the Early Nomadic period. Unfortunately, the large shafts on the east and west sides of the group have been reset so that they now face in the wrong direction: that is, to the west rather than to the east.

north-east side of the shaft a dagger is carved, while on the north side an image of a horse and of another large object, perhaps a bow, are carved. The appearance of realistic faces on the stones of the Chuya Steppe is curious, even unsettling. In each case, the human face seems stylistically and conceptually out of place within the rigidly monumental context of the stone. In facial type and in their lack of satisfactory integration with the rest of the stone, the mask-like faces recall three masks on a large stone found in the context of a Tagar ritual site, near Bel'tir on the Abakan River, Minusinsk Basin (Kyzlasov 1986: 259260).14 The cowl-like treatment of the stone on the larger Iya figure suggests the hoods worn by Early Nomadic horsemen and by their Scytho-Siberian cousins across the Eurasian Steppe. In each of the three cases, there are no deer images emblazoned on the stones. Nonetheless, the stone type, the original organization of imagery, the shape of the stone with reference to an eastward orientation, and the anthropomorphic references carried by belts and weapons join the stones to the larger deer stone tradition. In most cases, the anthropomorphic references on deer stones of the Sayan-Altay type are considerably more muted than those of the Transbaykal-Mongolian stone type. The stones at Yustyd illustrate this point. With the exception of the large central stone, #6, those found both intact and in fragmentary form are considerably more schematic in their human references than are the three stones with carved faces. Carved chains of beads around the "neck" of the stone, three parallel slanted lines on the "face" or at the side of the face, carved marks suggestive of earrings, and a carved belt and hanging weapons: these are the elements which ordinarily distinguish the deer stones of Gomo-Altayskaya A.O. (e.g., pl. XXa-c). The marks are similar to those one finds ubiquitously on the Mongolian stones; so, too, are the representations of weapons and tools which appear on a number of the stones. On the other hand, the images of animals, including deer, boar, horses, caprids, and crouching feline or wolf-like animals seem more indifferently carved and take up considerably less space than do their Mongolian counterparts. Occasionally, as on the tall, thin stone from Yustyd (pl. XXIa), the stylization of the deer recalls that characteristic of the Mongolian deer stone images, and the crouching predators on the stone resemble the curled felines on
14 Kyzlasov dates this stone to the Afanasevo period, but the argument for that dating is not persuasive.

a stone from Gurvanbulag, Bayanhongor Aymag (pl. XXd). By comparison with their Mongolian counterparts, the animal images from Yustyd are lacking in expressive power. The distribution of animal images on the deer stones of GornoAltayskaya A.O. followed a variety of patterns. The tall stone from Yustyd, referred to above, is carved with images of four recumbent deer: one just below the earring and two-one antlered, the other not-as if "hanging" from the belt. Below the uppermost deer and displayed as if on the "chest" or side of the figure are the remains of perhaps four crouched, wolf-like animals. In other cases, animal images were carved among the "beads" of the necklace on the upper part of the stone, suggesting that the zoomorphic plaque was a part of the ornament: on one stone from Yustyd, a recumbent deer occurs in that position; on another from Kara-Dyurgun, an animal reminiscent of a recumbent horse, but possibly with the beard of a goat, is set among the necklace beads; on another stone from Uzuntal, a boar with hanging legs is placed within the necklace (pl. XXa-c). In all cases, the representations suggest animalshaped plaques that could be worn hanging from the belt or as part of a necklace or pectoral. Such implied ornamentation recalls the carved, wooden images covered with gold that were used to dress the hair and neckpieces of the dead, male and female, in Early Nomadic burials from Tuekta, Pazyryk, and Ulandryk. The pairing ofdeer, antlered and unantlered, is unusual on deer stones of the Mongolian type, where virtually all deer images are antlered. On the Yustyd stone, mentioned above (pl. XXla), the distinction between antlered and unantlered animals was deliberate. A similar distinction has been mentioned with respect to the two large deer from the site on the Barburgazy River (pl. XVId), and the pair at Yalbak-Tash (pl. IXh). However, aside from these examples, there are very few instances of a similar pairing, either on the deer stones or within petroglyphic compositions. In the majority of cases, the deer of the Transbaykal-Mongolian and Sayan-Altay stones are antlered and carry no specific sign of the male gender. There has been considerable dispute regarding the chronology of the deer stone types, with some scholars believing that the simpler the carved imagery, the earlier the type, and others arguing the reverse. 15
15 Gryaznov has argued that the Sayan-Altay type preceded that of Mongolia and should be dated as early as the twelth to ninth centuries B.C. (Gryaznov 1978). Kyzlasov has argued that the stones with what he calls "animal style" images (i.e., those of the Sayan-Altay type) date to the Scythian period, while those of the Mongolian type are later (Kyzlasov 1978).

DEER STONES AND WARRIORS 153
Although the weapons represented on the Mongolian stones are Karasuk in typology, the chronological uncertainty of the Karasuk-Tagar horizon indicates only that the tradition of deer stone carving may have begun by 1000 B.C. and may have lasted for about 500 years (Volkov 1981: 102104). 16 By assigning a relatively early date to the Mongolian deer stone type, Volkov is able to argue that the images found on these stones and on those of the Sayan-Altay type were fundamental to the vocabulary of the Scytho-Siberian "animal style" and that they thus indicate the South Siberian origins of this style of art (Volkov 1981: 115-116). ,tis certainly true that the deer, boar, and feline images from certain stones from Tuva and Mongolia (e.g., pl. XXd, e) are replicated on many objects from Early Nomadic burials, such as in the great feline plaque from Arzhan (pl. Ila). On the other hand, the highly stylized deer of the Mongolian type do not reappear in that exaggerated form in the plaques and fabrics of the Early Nomads. The deer type found there was stylized, to be sure, but it retained a powerful realism. This discrepancy between the Mongolian deer stone image and the deer images of the Early Nomads confirms Volkov's suggestion that the Mongolian stone type may have preceded the Sayan-Altay type, or that the Early Nomads derive much more closely from the culture specifically responsible for the SayanAltay deer stone tradition.
D. DEER STONES AS SYMBOLIC SYSTEMS
I have already mentioned the widespread belief that the deer stones refer to a heroized male ancestor. Most interpretations of these stones represent variations on that theme, but they are variations shaped by a common concern for the affirmation of Inda-European or Indo-Iranian values and traditions. Thus the shape of the stones is taken to refer to cults of clan fertility (e.g., Kubarev 1979). The remains of charred altars, charred horse bones, and other signs of burnt offerings in association with the deer stone complexes have suggested to several observers the association of animal-specifically, horse-sacrifice with the deer stones. Such sacrifices would have been part of the ancestral cult appropriate to
16 Volkov cites two late Karasuk type daggers which were found at Ulangom, a site he dates to the fifth to third centuries B.C. Volkov argues that the tradition may have gone from the more detailed and anthropomorphically clear stone to the more simplified type of the Sayan-Altay stone (Volkov 1981: 118).

the ancestral aspect represented by the deer stone. 17 The erecting of stones and sacrificial altars indicates a heroization of the clan ancestor and specific dead. Given the difficulty of raising the deer stones, their carving and raising must have been reserved only for "particularly respected and heroized ancestors, with an emphasis on marks of male strength" (Kubarev 1979: 86; Ol'khovskiy 1989). The image of the antlered, presumably male, deer emerges within the deer stone cults as a solar and cosmic animal, a kind of substitute for the cosmic horse. Like Kubarev, Volkov believes that within the deer stone complexes, horse sacrifices referred to Indo-Iranian solar cults, but he joins the association of deer/horse/sun to Okladnikov's understanding of a Siberian cosmic stag-that is, to a Siberian version of the solar animal and myth (Volkov 1981: 94-96; Okladnikov 1964; and cf. Martynov 1990). The animal images carved on the sides of the stones are explained as ornaments embroidered or sewn onto the warrior's clothing, or they refer to tattooing of the warrior's body, a tradition attested to among the Early Nomads by the man buried in Pazyryk 2 (Kubarev 1979: 81-83). In contrast to the arguments of some scholars that the circle with handle motif refers to an earring (Chlenova 1962; Kubarev 1979), Vaynshteyn accepts Okladnikov's argument that it refers to a mirror. However, the traditional Siberian mirror, known from Early Nomadic and Zhou period burials, had its handle in the shape of a central knob rather than in the form of a long handle. As a modern but similar instance of an object invested with great power. Vaynshteyn cites the shaman drums of Sayan-Altay peoples such as the Khakass, Shors, and Altaytsy. The trapezoidal object with diagonal lines may refer in highly stylized fashion to the chest cavity with ribs, just as up to the present shamanic robes are marked on the front and back with skeletal references (cf., Savinov and Chlenova 1978: 75). Rather than referring to warrior values and implements, the mirror, deer, trapezoidal shape, and other marks on the stones refer to ancient shamanistic rites (Vaynshteyn 1974: 30-32). In this respect, Vaynshteyn moves the interpretation of the deer stones closer to specifically Siberian traditions, rather than seeking their meaning within lndo-European traditions. In his opinion, the deer stones functioned not as anthropomorphic funerary monuments but as protective powers, appearing within the context of specific constructs. He
17 The offerings also suggest to Kubarcv the desire to lend to the dead the sexual and physical strength of the horse (Kubarev 1979). In these arguments Kubarev agrees with Kuz'mina's argument for the Indo-European basis of late Bronze Age society in South Siberia (Kuz'mina 1977).

suggests that their function may have been similar to that of the stone walls found around so many of the burial mounds of South Siberian peoples of the late Bronze and early Iron Ages. Although the meaning of those walls also remains unclear, they suggest the establishment of protective precincts: figurative dividers between the realms of the living and the dead. In an early study of the Mongolian stones, N. L. Chlenova proposed that the deer stones in general referred to warrior leaders of a people who invaded South Siberia and Mongolia from a region in Central Asia-the same region, perhaps, from where emerged the very image of the Scythian deer (Chlenova 1962a, 1962b, 1963). Referring to Abayev's argument (Abayev 1949) that the deer was the totemic animal of the Sak:as, Chlenova explained the size and number of the deer on the Mongolian stones as a reflection of the need of an intruding peoplepresumably ancestors of the Sakas-to ressert the sign of their cultural identity (Chlenova 1962a: 34-35; cf. Abayev 1949). The stones thus refer to the carriers of lndo-Iranian traditions and must be interpreted in light of Vedic-Avestan beliefs. She has argued that the Mongolian and South Siberian deer stones, with their zoomorphic imagery, must be related to the stone "baba" of Scythia (about which I shall speak later): in both cases, the stones were associated with burial ritual and structure and in both cases they referred to warriors (Chlenova 1962b, 1984). The deer stone conceived as the sign of a heroized warrior also serves as the basis of Novgorodova's critical interpetation of the Mongolian deer stones. Like Chlenova, Savinov, and Volkov, she points to the comparison between weapon imagery and the Karasuk-Tagar bronze weapons and she dates the stones ofTuva, Mongolia, and the Transbaykal to the late Bronze Age (Nowgorodowa (Novgorodova) 1980; Novgorodova 1989; Volkov and Novgorodova 1975). Novgorodova interprets the peculiar trapezoidal object as a shield, indicative of the stone's martial reference. Within their cultural setting, the deer stones functioned as "cultic monuments," dedicated first to the deer and later to the horse as sign of the ancestor, the sun, and the totemic source. In reading the deer stone as symbol, Novgorodova tends to push interpretation to an extreme. In the upper part of the stone, she finds reference to heaven and the connection between this world and that of the spirits; the middle section, usually filled with the representations of hoofed animals, refers to the middle world; the lower section of the stone, including the representations of weapons hanging from the belt, refers to death and sacrifice and hence to the lower world (Novgorodova 1984: 108-109).

As provocative as such a tripartite interpretation is, on too many stones the order is considerably less clear, with animals and weapons occurring both above and decidedly below the belt of the stone. 18 This variety of interpretative strategies indicates both the complexity of issues involved in the deer stone tradition and something of the centrality of this tradition to the artistic inheritance of the Early Nomads. The stones associated with Mongolia and the Transbaykal, and characterized by distinctive stylized images of deer, were apparently used by two cultural groups, one responsible for the so-called slab graves of Transbaykal and eastern and central Mongolia, the other responsible for the khereksur, kurgans, and stone altars common to western Mongolia, Tuva, and southeastern Gorno-Altayskaya A.O. At this time, both the kherekur and slab-grave structures are believed to have emerged in the late Bronze Age and to have lasted well into the Payzyrk period. Lacking more certain evidence than now exists, it is not possible to say whether the slab-grave culture inherited the Mongolian deer stone type from a culture to the west, one associated with the khereksur complexes, or the reverse. The combination of two different types of ritual and funerary complexes (slab-grave and khereksur) and one kind of ritual stone (deer stone) would indicate a non-belligerent meeting of cultures in which certain fundamental elements of belief were so similar that one kind of monumental carving functioned effectively within two different types of complexes. Similar observations may be made with regard to cultural change in the region ofTuva, Gorno-Altayskaya A.O., and northwestern and central Mongolia. As we have seen, in those areas the khereksur complexes formed a common cultural tradition across present-day political borders, but the deer stone type could and did vary, from one dominated by the elaborate Mongolian deer image to one dominated by the somewhat more realistic images of elk, reindeer, and boar, and even to a relatively uncarved monolith. Within a single general tradition characterized by monolithic carved stones a variety of carving styles coexisted. Despite the number of scholars who associate the deer stones with an Indo-Iranian tradition which privileges an ancestral male warrior and which joins him to a solar signification, there remain a number of facts which are difficult to reconcile with these theories. The stones do, indeed, all appear to represent male figures with implements which may
18 Novogorodova's claim that the part of the stone below the belt would be buried underground is open to considerable question, particularly in light of the stones found buried inverted in the ground, or simply left lying on the ground.

be interpreted as weapons or tools, depending on one's point of view. Nothing else in the aspect of these figures indicates a particularly martial aspect. All the images seem to have been located within ritual and sometimes funerary complexes, and all appear to have been originally placed facing to the east. While a few images representing predatory animals-e.g., wolves, felines, and boar-may be found on the stones, there is not a single instance of the representation of an actual animal attack and certainly no reference to human combat. Moreover, although there are a few cases in which the male deer is distinguished by the indication of his sex, such definition is unusual, and belongs, I believe, to a late phase in these representations. Antlers alone do not indicate gender since antlers are carried by both male and female reindeeranimals which seem to have been represented on the classic deer stone type of the Transbaykal and Mongolia. Finally, deducing a phallic and male emphasis on the basis of the shape of the deer stones seems to be a case of creating meaning (phallic cults) where there is simply a straightforward functional necessity: in this case, the need to set a marking stone into the ground. The deer stone tradition of South Siberia and Mongolia appears to indicate the source of what came to be known as the Scytho-Siberian animal style. The very image of the deer-stylized, monumental, dominating the stones of Mongolia and Tuva and marking the stones of Gorno-Altayskaya A.0.-would seem, necessarily, to precede the deer images of the Early Nomads and the Scythians. The kurgan of Arzhan, dated by its excavator to the eighth century, is perhaps the earliest burial associated with the Scytho-Siberians. The great bronze feline plaque found among the Arzhan ruins may well be the earliest of a series of such coiled felines, including the undated Mayemir gold plaques from GornoAltayskaya A.O., the small gold felines dated to the seventh-sixth century, from Chiliktin in eastern Kazakhstan, and the undated gold plaque from the Siberian Treasure of Peter the Great. Yet the images of coiled or crouching felines on the deer stones from Gurvanbulag, Bayanhongor Aymag, and Yustyd (pis. XXd, XXIa), may be even earlier than the date of Arzhan. At the least, the wolf or feline images from the Yustyd and Gurvanbulag stones, the coiled feline from Arzhan, and the coiled gold felines found in the Mayemir Steppe indicate that South Siberia was the source of at least one of the three images fundamental to the Scytho-Siberian artistic tradition. The deer stones confirm that the deer image also had to have derived from South Siberia and northern Central Asia. Although almost all the deer stones carry the imagery of

weapons and although one may confidently argue that the deer stones do refer in their surface carvings to the figure of an armed male, there are no signs of a specifically belligerent stance: neither in the postures of the stones nor in the representation of animals on the stones. The steadfast lack of imagery representing the actual struggle attendant on animall predation confirms the hypothesis that the deer stones should be dated\ no later than the very early stages of the Scytho-Siberian period, when in the zoomorphic imagery of the burials themselves no portrayals of actual animal combat can be found. At most, the images of predators and prey were simply juxtaposed.
E. CIMMERIAN STELAE AND ScYTHIAN "BABA"
One of the most curious elements within the Scythian artistic tradition are the stone human images traditionally referred to as "baba." Awkward at times to the point of being ungainly, these images immediately call to mind the deer stones of South Siberia and Mongolia; they also bear an undeniable resemblance to the even cruder stone images associated with the Cimmerians, those people who preceded the Scythians in the region north and east of the Black Sea. Any study of these two traditions is hampered by the fact that virtually all the stones-Cimmerian and Scythian-were found within disrupted sites. Most are badly damaged, some to the point of unrecognizability. None have been adequately published. The Cimmerian tradition of anthropomorphic monoliths is represented by a stone found within the embankment of a Cimmerian kurgan known as the Ptichata burial, opened in 1971 in Belogradets, Bulgaria (Toncheva 1972: fig. 6; Savinov and Chlenova 1978: fig. 2/6). The stone is a tall, thick block, the top of which has been broken. A row of beads indicates the neck region, while a belt with gorytus and knife confirms the stone's crude anthropomorphic reference. On the lower part of the stone is visible a section of an interwoven pattern. Because of its placement as a reused stone within the Cimmerian context, the Belogradets stone must be dated earlier than the seventh century B.C. There are a number of other stones associated with the Cimmerian period of the North Pontic Steppe (Toncheva 1972; Savinov and Chlenova 1978; Chlenova 1975, 1984). Like the Belogradets stone, they tend to be crudely anthropomorphic in reference (e.g., pl. XXlc). On two or three of the stones assigned to the Kuban Cimmerian culture of the eighth century B.C. may be found images of horses or goats. In contrast to the

zoomorphic images on the Mongolian deer stones, these are enclosed within circles and suggest a distinctively Kuban style (Savinov and Chlenova 1978: figs. 2/1, 2, 3). Some of these stones have a curious aspect: they seem to have been carved similarly at both ends. For example, both ends of a stone from Ust'-Labinsk, in the Kuban, are carved with the circular line and a round circle that suggests a "head." Another stone, from Zubovskiy khutor in the Kuban, is carved at both ends with a necklace and eye-like circles as well as with circled animals (pl. XXlb). This deliberate treatment of the stone as an object which can be inverted echoes the actual inversion of deer stones at a number of Mongolian sites. 19 It is also reminiscent of the manner in which the deer images on the Mongolian stones had no regular directionality: they could be placed facing to the right, to the left, to the upper end of the stone, or to the theoretically lower end of the stone. Chlenova has proposed that the Cimmerian stones refer to a god of thunder borrowed by the Cimmerians from the Hattians. She and Savinov have identified the Cimmerian stones with a common CimmerianKarasuk tradition, manifested particularly in the weapon typologies found on the stone figures (Savinov and Chlenova 1978; Chlenova 1984; cf. Terenozhkin 1978). The particular treatment of both the Cimmerian stones and of the deer stones of the Sayan-Altay type-with necklaces, belts, circular elements which may refer to earrings or ornaments, but generally without a definition of the human face-certainly supports the hypothesis of an essential link between these two anthropomorphizing traditions. Most striking, perhaps, is the summary character of the anthropomorphic reference and the occasional treatment of the "head" in terms of a flat area sectioned from the lower part of the stone by a band or necklace.20 These parallelisms serve as yet one more element in the still unclear connection between South Siberia and the South Russian Steppe in the late Bronze Age. The male figure type represented with belt and weapons suggests the possibility, too, of an essential connection with anthropomorphic stelae from Central Europe, even though these are dated considerably earlier in the Bronze Age (Gimbutas 1973; Bernardini 1975).21 This monolithic

figure type is exemplified by the famous stele from Lagundo, TrentinoAlto Adige, in northern Italy, engraved with daggers, a belt, and a four-wheeled vehicle pulled by oxen (pl. XXId). Among the Bronze Age stelae from Central Europe, however, a number ofcarved stones refer not to male figures, but to female figures identified as such by their clearly indicated breasts.22 The fabrication of monumental female figures in Bronze Age Europe suggests that if the deer stones of South Siberia were linked to the warrior figures of the Alpine area through the transmission of a Bronze Age tradition, either the female figure was dropped out of that tradition in its gradual passage eastward, or that we are not reading the deer stones correctly. On the other hand, among the few published stones associated with the Cimmerian culture, all seem to refer to male figures by virtue of their belts and weapons. One is left with problematic options. If there was an historical connection between the South Sibe-rian-Mongolian deer stones and the Central European stone figure tradition, and unless there are as-yet unstudied Cimmerian female figures, then the apparent male reference of both the Cimmerian and South Siberian stone figures may indicate the transformation of an older Bronze Age tradition as it was transmitted eastward across Central Asia. At some point in space and in time, the specific representation of the female disappeared, replaced, or perhaps masked, by the male image. In recent years, approximately forty-five so-called Scythian baba from the Kuban, the Black Sea region, and Bulgaria have been published (Shul'ts 1973, 1976; Goranka 1972; Petrenko 1986). Virtually all are crudely carved stone figures representing male warriors holding rhyta (pl. XXle). In several instances they appear to be wearing armor. Tucked under and hanging from their belts are long swords, short swords, and goryti. None of the figures are dated and almost all were found in conjunction with severely disrupted sites. Schul'ts believes that many were originally erected on the tops of kurgans; as the kurgans collapsed,, the stone figures fell and broke, becoming part of the stone rubble. He believes that the phallic shape and martial character of the figures referred to hero-ancestors and that the stones functioned in ancestor cults associated with funerary rituals (Schul'ts 1976: 228-229). The baba are considerably more realistic in their human representation than are the

A number of such figures from the Catacomb-grave period of the North Pontic region have indications of both (female) breasts and of the male sexual organs. Gimbutas has suggested, somewhat unconvincingly, that the female breasts may represent a later "reshaping" of the stone [Gimbutas 1965: 497].

older Cimmerian stelae. This stylistic change might reflect the inherent maturation of a representational process. One also suspects, however, that such maturation more directly reflects the impact of Hellenic taste on the artists of the Scythian world after the sixth century B.C. Like Schul'ts, Rayevskiy has emphasized the phallic aspect of the Scythian baba. This aspect is located not simply in the shape of the figures; it is figuratively referred to in such carved weapon imagery as the whetstone and, literally, in apparent representation of the male sex on one figure (Rayevskiy 1983: 88, pl. XII). 23 Rayevskiy joins these perceived phallic references to his conviction that Scythian mythology and belief systems were fundamentally charged with an Indo-Iranian cosmogony (Rayevskiy 1970, 1978b, 1979, 1985). The underlying conception of the Indo-Iranian universe, in Rayevskiy's understanding, is three-leveled: heaven, earth, and the underworld. The most important symbolic references to that tripartite structure are the World Tree and the human body, the paradigm of which is Purusha, the Vedic Cosmic Man. The head of Purusha is the sign of the heavens; the reproductive organs and digestive organs refer to the earth. From this it follows that the Scythian baba also refer to the tripartite structure of the universe; the indication of their sex refers to origin and stability within the universe. Like other scholars who have attempted to interpret Scythian art in light of Indo-lranian traditions, Rayevskiy is troubled by the discrepancy between the male-centered universe they find in the Inda-Iranian traditions and Herodotus's terse description of the Scythian' s religious beliefs:
The only gods the Scythians worship are Hestia (their chief deity), Zeus and Earth (whom they believe to be the wife of Zeus), and, as deities of secondary importance, Apollo, Celestial Aphrodite, Heracles, and Ares. These are recognized by the entire nation; the Royal Scythians also offer sacrifices to Poseidon (Herodotus (1954]: 260).
Hestia, Herodotus informs us, is the Greek name for Tabiti; he uses Zeus for Papaeus, Earth for Api, Apollo for Oetosyrus, Aprohodite for Argimpasa, and Poseidon for Thagimasadas. Tabiti, the chief deity, was the goddess of the hearth. In her person was located the source of familial and social stability. However, since the Scythian baba refer to male figures, Rayevskiy concludes that their presence at funerary sites refers them back to Targitaus who, according to Scythian legends recounted by Herodotus, was the son of Zeus and the ancestor and first king of the
23 The stones to which Rayevskiy refers are badly damaged and available only through sketches which do not offer convincing evidence for his argument.

Scythians. The three sons of Targitaus, each the ancestor of one of the Scytho-Siberian nations, also represent the three zones of the tripartite universe (Herodotus [1954]: 243-244; Rayevskiy 1983b: 52). Rayevskiy's interpretative strategies rest upon assumptions which have wide and long-standing support. They include the belief that the Inda-Iranian tradition manifested in Scythian antiquities represents a relatively pure continuation of traditions rooted in Vedic-Avestan texts. However, even if the Scythians themselves derived from an Iranian language group, that fact in itself does not predict the particular details of Scytho-Siberian culture. The Scythians' pastoral economy, their zoomorphic imagery, and even many of their weapon types find their most clearly traceable origins within the eastern region of the Eurasian Steppe. Even the tradition of carving stone figures is more clearly associated with the South Siberian-Mongolian deer stone traditions than with the still obscure figure-carving tradition of the Cimmerians. In other words, the interpretation of Scythian cultural artifacts in IndoIranian terms must be tempered by the awareness that there is as yet little knowledge of Scytho-Siberian languages and virtually no agreement as to what set of archaeological facts would predict an Inda-European or Inda-Iranian culture as distinct from a culture which had adopted and adapted some traditions with Inda-European or Inda-Iranian elements. In the vicissitudes which brought the nomads from South Siberia and Central Asia, belief and myth must have undergone changes as profound as the transformation of their environment. Under these circumstances and even if the Scytho-Siberians derived from ludo-European or IndoIranian roots, it is unlikely that interpretations taken directly from Vedic-Avestan texts would be applicable to Scythian antiquities. This point may be emphasized by returning to one object, the rhyton, which is a particular attribute of many of the Scythian baba (e.g., pl. XXIe). The rhyton, or horn cup, has attracted the attention of students of Scythian art not only because of its frequent appearance among burial furnishings and representations in Scythian goldwork, but also because it figures prominently in the Scythian account of their origins as told by Herodotus. It must be recalled that the Scythians traced their lineage and territories back to the youngest son ofTargitaus, who claimed the golden plough, yoke, battle-axe, and cup which fell from heaven (Herodotus [1954]: 243-244). 24 It is possible that the cup here should or could be understood as a rhyton.

Many of the Scythian baba appear to be males carrying weapons and holding rhyta against their chests. One of the most interesting is a broken statue from the Kuban, located in the Krasnodar Museum (pl. XXlf). 25 The figure is headless and dressed in armour. Hanging from his belt and across his belly is an akinakes. Like many of the other Scythian baba, this one presses his forearms against his upper body. In his right hand and against his chest he holds a large rhyton. According to the Schul'ts drawing, the figure carries the image of a recumbent deer under his throat as if it were a clasp.26 There are presently no other known Scythian stone figures which carry deer or other animal plaques in the same place, but the suggestion of an animal-shaped plaque does recall the animals in circular frames found on the upper parts of several of the Cimmerian stelae. It also recalls the inclusion of animal images in the necklaces worn by a number of the Sayan-Altay deer stone figures (pl. XXa-c). The Krasnodar figure is unusual in its relatively sophisticated realism. The representation of a figure holding a rhyton is not, however, unusual among the baba; there are at least seven other recorded figures which hold rhyta.
Schul 'ts dates the Scythian baba between the sixth and the third centuries B.C. He dates the Krasnodar figure to the fifth century on the basis of its akinakes. By virtue of their references to male figures with weapons, the Krasnodar figure and the other Scythian baba invite a comparison with the South Siberian deer stones and the Cimmerian stelae. They differ from those other sculptured images in the clarity and relative realism of their anthropomorphic references. It is certain that this greater concern for the representation of a human figure is based on the observation and emulation of Greek human representation (Schul 'ts 1976: 228-229). On the other hand, the baba with rhyta may be directly related to the many gold plaque representations of Scythians holding rhyta in the act of pledge or consecration. A fine gold plaque from the fourth century barrow of Kul Oba represents two Scythian males drinking from one rhyton as if in a pledge of loyalty (Piotrovsky 1987: pl. 196). On a silver rhyton from Karagodeuashkh the representation of two Scythians on facing horses was engraved, the rider on the left holding a rhyton in his right hand and an upraised sword in his left, and the much

Unfortunately, there are no photographs available to me of this figure and noone has commented on the discrepancies in detail between the published drawings. 26 This, as well as the rhyton, is also missing from the Goranka drawing.

damaged rider on the left raising his right hand in response (Minns [1913] 1971: fig. 121). Figures holding rhyta appear, also, in more complex scenes from Scythian burials; in those complex scenes, I believe, may well lie the key to the meaning of the Scythian baba. In Chapter II, mention was made of a series of plaques from Chertomlyk and Merzhdana and of a gold headdress frontlet from Karagodeuashkh-all representing male Scythians approaching seated women (pl. Vic, d, e). In some of the Chertomlyk plaques, a standing male figure drinks from a goblet before the seated figure of a woman holding up a mirror. In other plaques from Chertomlyk, the woman is frontal. With both hands she holds a goblet(?) over her lap. On her left is an altar topped by a flame or plant-like crown. To her right stands a male figure holding a rhyton in his right hand and raising his left towards the woman. In both representations, the woman is considerably larger than the male figure. Both images are reminiscent of the crude plaque from Merdzhana, representing a female figure seated frontally on a throne holding in her right hand a cup-like object (Artamonov 1969: 331). Hanging on the top of the left-hand back post of her throne is the head of a horse; to the right of her throne stands a large tree. Back and to the left of the throne is the figure of a male rider on a small horse. This figure holds up arhyton, as ifto honor the female figure. The gold plaque from the Karagodeuashkh headdress repeats this theme with greater elaboration. Thus in each of the plaques the subject is similar: two men address each other with rhyta, or male figures stand or sit on horses with raised rhyta before a seated woman. The woman may be frontal or in profile, and she may hold a mirror or a cup or vase. She may be accompanied by an alter, a tree, and a horse-head. The problems of identification of these figures can only be touched on here, but the subject will be returned to in the last chapter. Rostovtzeff identified the female figures from the Chertomlyk plaques and from the crown plaque from Karagodeuashkh with a goddess of the Ishtar-Astarte type, here handing the sacraments of power to a young Scythian lord. Artamonov rejected this interpretation, believing that these scenes, like that from Merdzhana, refer to the acceptance of the gift of divine abundance and strength from the goddess through the drinking of sacrificial liquid (Artamonov 1961). Artamonov argued that the female figures here actually represent a Scythian conflation of two or more deities: Tabiti, the most important deity of the Scythians and referred to by Herodotus as Hestia, and Artimpasa, to whom Herodotus gave the name Aphrodite. Tabiti-Hestia, according to Artamonov, must be asso

ciated with the altar, while Artimpasa-Aphrodite must be joined with the mirror. Hestia was the Greek goddess of the hearth and of sacrifice, as well as the protector of the household. Artamonov points out that while Hestia may have been in some respects a Greek equivalent to Tabiti, in fact the latter was significantly more important in Scythian religious traditions than was the former. As the goddess of the hearth, Tabiti was the ancestral mother in whose person was indicated the unity of the clan lineage. Animal sacrifice was consecrated to her and to honor her the cup of sacrificial liquid was consumed. While the crude representations on the Merdzhana plaque reflect a provincial hand and possibly a more Asiatic conception of the goddess, the narrative realism of the Chertomlyk and Karagodeuarshkh representations reflects the taste for Hellenistic realism which had overtaken late Scythian art.27 The several representations also establish the rhyton or cup as an implement central to some ritual of consecration. This series of images, however, is particularly intriguing for another reason: their image combinations indicate that the stone baba with rhyta must be placed within a larger conceptual context. In speaking of the composition with horsemen from the Karagodeuashkh rhyton, Artamonov argues that there, in contrast to the cult scenes represented on the Merdzhana plaque or on the Pazyryk 5 felt hanging (pl. Via), "the main personage is no longer a goddess but rather a god," perhaps the very god referred to by Herodotus as Papaeus, better known to the Greeks as Zeus (Artamonov 1961: 74). There is nothing in the Karagodeuashkh representation, however, to distinguish a "god" from a horseman with rhyton: both represented figures are roughly equal in appearance, size, and position. I would suggest that these figures simply represent horsemen in the act of devotion-symbolized by the raised rhyton-to some unrepresented deity. The rhyton scene is thus a variation on the Kul Oba representation of two Scythians drinking from the same rhyton. The Karagodeuashkh headdress plaque and the Chertomlyk and Merzdhana plaques suggest that the unrepresented focus of that devotion was a female deity. In a like manner, the baba-usually found alone, without an accompanying figure-referred not to their own
27 Onayko has argued that neither the "great goddess" nor the "mounted god-hero" represented, for example in the Merdzhana plaque, could have come out of Hellenic or Ancient Near Eastern traditions. They rather refer to an Asiatic response to Mediterranean traditions (Onayko 1976). This conception is also reflected in Artamonov' s characterization of the Merdzhana and Pazyryk 5 scenes as significantly different from Greco-Scythian work and indicative of a tradition outside mainstream Scythian conceptions (Artamonov 1961: 63).

significance and not to the significance of an unseen god, but rather to the implicit presence of a female figure, for whom the raised rhyton was a sign of obeisance and honor. It is as if the plaques filled out with narrative clarity the event merely implied by the stone baba: that the presence of the latter implied the honoring of another figure. That other was not a heroized male ancestor; she was a woman, or at least a being who in the context of Hellenized late Scythian art was given the body and gestures of a woman. Whether to call her Hestia-Tabiti or another may be set aside for the time being. What is certain is that she was a figure of major significance for the Scythians. This hypothesis is supported by a late and poorly published group of monumental stone figures from the Kuban. This group is a set of three large images, one female between two males, which was found late in the last century near Prigradnaya. The figures had apparently stood near a kurgan and represented some kind of ritual site. 28 One of the male statues was originally of monumental proportions: with head (now lost), it may have been as much as 4 m. high. This figure carried a gorytus at its left hip and held a rhyton in its left hand and against its chest. The second, poorly described male figure was smaller: without its head it measured 2.80 m. The size of the female figure is not given, but she, too, was presumably of monumental size. Like the seated women in the Chertomlyk plaques, this one wore a long robe and her head was covered with a soft cloth that fell over her shoulders. In her right hand she carried an unusually long rhyton. Schul 'ts has dated these figures to the latter half of the fourth century B.C. The monumental Prigradnaya set involving a male on either side of a female, with at least one of the males and the female carrying ritual objects, reflects the group of figures in the Karagodeuashkh plaque and echoes the scenes in the plaques from the royal Scythian burial of Chertomlyk. The Prigradnaya figures lend support to the hypothesis that the male baba with rhyta indicate not heroized ancestors and not even the ancestor as sign of a tripartite IndoIranian universe, but rather the presence of a female deity, one which under the sway of Hellenic realism took the form of a woman. Information regarding find sites and find conditions for most of the Scythian baba are too incomplete to conclude that these stones figures were intended as funerary monuments or as part of a ritual complex.
28 All available photographs of these figures are extremely unclear. Schul 'ts argues that because of their size and because of their combination of unusual elements, the figures must represent Meotian deities rather than Scythian deities (Shul'ts 1973: 197-201). The distinction between Scythian and Maeotian cultures, much emphasized in his day by Artamonov, remains vague and unsatisfactory, however.

Within burial furnishings, rhyta have been found associated with both male and female skeletons. The plaque from Kul-Oba showing two Scythian males drinking from one rhyton indicates that this kind of vessel could be used in some kind of ritual oath of brotherhood. In all other representations of drinking, however, males dressed in typical Scythian garb are indicated in the act of addressing female figures. The rhyta raised by both males and females apparently functioned as signs of consecration directed to the female of the group. Although the monumental size of the Prigradnaya figures indicates their late date and although the clumsiness of their carving also indicates a provincial hand, the group confirms the signficance of a scene represented more gracefully in the Chertomlyk plaques. When Herodotus described the Scythian pantheon he also pointed out that the Scythians neither made statues nor raised altars or temples. The anthropomorphic representation of that pantheon apparently did not exist yet. This suggests that the earliest stone baba, datable perhaps to the fifth century B.C., represented not deities but male warriors or guardians or similarly significant members of a human social fabric. The Prigradnaya triad was the result of a slow process by which Scythian deities and their mythic traditions, originally embedded in zoomorphic imagery, gradually acquired anthropomorphized formulation. One can only assume that the Kul Oba representations of Scythians pledging brotherhood had had some earlier pictorial indicator, but that lies hidden behind a combination of zoomorphic forms. Similarly, one must imagine that the statement of consecration performed by a Scythian male before a seated female must earlier have been designated by its own zoomorphic sign, one unreadable to eyes which demand stories told by human figures and human actions.
F. GATHERING TOGETHER: SCYTHIAN BABA, CIMMERIAN STELAE,
AND THE SOUTH SIBERIAN-MONGOLIAN DEER STONES
In figure type, in male reference, and in the general association of stones with burial mounds or ritual sites, the Scythian baba point back to some degree of connection with the Cimmerian stone figures. Both, in turn, seem to refer to two more ancient points of origin. On the one hand, it is impossible to ignore the similarities between the Cimmerian stones and the great stone figures associated with Bronze Age Central Europe. In the end, however, there are no continuous routes which lead from those ancient figures down to the Cimmerian and Scythian monolithic

figures. We may simply have to acknowledge an idea too good to be ignored within two cultures widely separated by time and relatively separated by space: by virtue of their own histories and by virtue of available materials, both cultures turned to stone and to the anthropomorphic image as the medium for artistic and mythic expression. There is a possibility, however, that impulses which lay behind the male and female stelae of Central Europe made their way across Eurasia in the course of the Bronze Age, entering South Siberia perhaps only late in the second millennium B.C. The images of carts which began to appear at that time in southeastern and eastern Kazakhstan, and which then spread into Mongolia, Gorno-Altayskaya A.O., and Tuva, argue that together with the intrusion of the Andronovo culture, new values and expressive traditions must have appeared in that far eastern region of Eurasia. Unfortunately, such a map of the universe of carved stone figures is purely theoretical. We lack any material to indicate that the value placed on anthropomorphic stone sculpture was actually continuous from west to east. Perhaps between those distant points, wooden sculpture, now lost, served the same purpose. It is also possible that the anthropomorphic figure as concept, not image, was carried in some other form or lodged within some other expressive context across the long trail running irregularly from Central and eastern Europe to South Siberia. Within this morass of uncertainty, however, several facts are indisputable. The Central European stone images and those of the North Pontic region, both Cimmerian and Scythian, are clearly anthropomorphic in reference. By contrast, the South Siberian-Mongolian deer stone tradition indicates only an inconsistent and uncertain interest in anthropomorphization. The general shape of the stone, some belts and weapons, and the possibility that some of the signs around the "head" of the stone refer to a human visage: these are the only elements indicating that emergent in the deer stone tradition was the idea of the stone as a human shape, and as a male image at that. Far more explicit is the sign of the deer-like a shroud enfolding the Mongolian stones, like plaques ornamenting those of the Sayan-Altay region. Sometimes more elk or maral-like in appearance and sometimes accompanied by coiled felines or wolves, it is nonetheless the deer which creates the imagistic power of the stone and not the stone's larger carving. In the end, the deer stone may accurately be so named, at least within the South Siberian-Mongolian arena, and insofar as the deer stone appears to lie behind the tradition of the Scythian baba and Cimmerian stelae, those types, also, may be

seen as distant referents to the deer stone, even if the deer is no longer visible. Earlier in this chapter I referred to the explicit sexual definition of two pairs of deer at Yalbak-Tash and at Barburgazy in the Chuya Steppe. At that point I suggested that the male definition of the large deer was necessitated by a need to distinguish it from the female deer and that the appearance of antlers would not, in this case, suffice. I also suggested that the deer image there and on the Mongolian deer stones-exaggerated, elaborated, clearly suggestive of the merging of deer and birdactually referred to the reindeer, both sexes of which are ·antlered. Here I will state this more clearly. I would submit that in carving the large pair of deer and in feeling the need to define their sexuality, the artist betrayed a loss of archaic meaning. In carving a definitely heterosexual pair of animals, the artist altered the terms of visual discourse within which there was no indication of maleness or femaleness. The deer of the Mongolian deer stones referred in fact to the female of the species: first to that of the reindeer, but through a process of generalization of reference also to the female maral and elk as well. Within the context of whatever mythic tradition motivated the deer stones and the animal images with which they were emblazoned, the female of the species was endowed with magnificent antlers indicative of her pre-eminent mythic position. Within the South Siberian petroglyphic context, only a demythologizing of the antlered female can explain the large pair of deer at Barburgazy. The femaleness which had been obvious to others had become for that artist not obvious at all, and the mythic load with which the female deer had earlier been freighted had likewise been forgotten. The concern for myth reiterated so often on the deer stones and petroglyphs of Mongolia and South Siberia at Yalbak-Tash and at Bargurgazy gave way to a concern for the pairing of elements and for the measuring and contrasting of power inherent in male and female sexuality. As for the Scythian baba, they only confirm my hypothesis that the actual referent of the deer stone was female. In the Scythian case, that ultimate source is revealed not in the stone itself and not in what was present, but rather in what was absent. The male figures with rhyta must have had some specific reference, but their presence within a ritual context referred to someone other than themselves. In the context of Scythia, that "someone" was a seated female: the women to whom the males of the Chertomlyk and Karagodeushsk plaques raised their cups of consecration. With the exception of the surviving figures from Prigradnaya, her presence was indicated in effect by her material

absence. In the case of the Scythian baba, the stones clearly refer to anthropomorphic forms, just as the goldwork of the Scythians after the fifth century was dominated by anthropomorphic representation. The Cimmerian stelae are considerably less readable, in part because of the uncertainty of their original context, in part because of the crudeness of their carving. On the basis of similarities to the Siberian and Scythian figures, one is justified in assuming that the Cimmerian stelae may fit into the mythic constructs indicated by the Scythian baba and the South Siberian-Mongolian deer stones. Just as the Scythian baba rewrote the deer stones in terms of clear anthropomorphic references, so there, too, did maleness and femaleness become clearly distinguished. If the vast majority of Scythian stone images referred to a human male, we now know that the absent presence was that of a female. This absent presence suggests that the South Siberian-Mongolian deer stones also encompassed a similar distinction, but in a more generalized form. Just as the stone itself was only vaguely anthropomorphic and male in reference, so the deer with which it was emblazoned was female, her essence formulated in terms of an antlered animal. If the absent woman gave meaning to the Scythians' stone warriors, then, likewise, the female deer was the reason for the existence of the deer stones. Facing toward the east, arranged within elaborate ceremonial structures, and accompanied by indications of sacrifice and honor, the deer stones served as the signs of a presence intimated in the body of the deer.

CHAPTER SEVEN
IN SEARCH OF THE ANIMAL MOTHER Pre-shamanic, Shamanic, and Mythic Traditions
In search of the mythic source glimpsed in the materials of archaeology, we come to Siberian ethnography-the one area which may offer decisive verbal and visual clues by which to decipher ancient Siberia's shifting systems of belief. The ethnographic record is, however, no less complex than what we have been considering: indeed, the layering and interweaving of references found within the archaeological sanctuaries of Siberia serve as a metaphor for the layering of objects, myths, and rituals recorded by ethnographers. Just as the representation of a deerbovine at Kalbak-Tash may be the result of a late Bronze Age recarving of an earlier Bronze Age image and the consequent melding of very different myths and values, so may the tale told of a shaman's journey include elements of both archaic and more contemporary development. The investigator of Siberia's past faces the ethnographic record with some of the delight and bewilderment experienced by a hungry diner confronted by a huge buffet: reasoned need is easily overwhelmed by a desire to try everything. The academic result is too often a melange of fascinating possibilities that are offered without regard to chronological or spatial probability. 1 To be useful, the ethnography of Siberia, like its archaeology, must be divided and organized: according to space, time, and the larger context of artifact and belief. It must be considered, in other words, according to its own ecology. Siberian ethnography comprises made objects, oral traditions, and descriptions of rituals and practices. Most ethnographic sources from Siberia have been gathered within the last several hundred years. Those made objects usually include the embellished tools of everyday life, the costumes of everyday and ritual wear, and some objects of purely decorative purpose. The most interesting materials are probably those associated with the religious rituals of community and family (clan) cults, but here complications emerge. While shamanism has been the
1 The belief in the power of ethnography to illuminate the complexities of prehistoric Siberia has been mostrecently and forcefully expressed in Devlet 1988 and Martynov 1990. Throughout this discussion it should be understood that both males and females can be shamans, the use of the masculine pronoun not withstanding.

most thoroughly examined religious tradition among Siberian peoples and while its artifacts have been accorded the most attention, shamanism has been joined, ousted, or contaminated by other traditions among many peoples: most notably by lamaism among the peoples of Mongolia and among some of the peoples of Tuva and Buryatskaya ASSR; and by Russian Orthodoxy. In a number of cases, the artifacts associated with shamanism have been contaminated by non-shamanic, non-Siberian traditions. Fortunately, such intrusions are relatively easy to spot and separate from the earlier layers-those of pre-shamanic cults and myths and those of shamanism proper (Dyrenkova 1937). The most complex interweaving of ethnographic traditions occurs between those which are centered on the figure of the shaman and those which certainly represent a more ancient, pre-shamanic period. In general, the shamanic cults were maintained by the community as a whole. Even in the event of shamanic intervention on behalf of a sick or dying individual, the larger community would become involved in the preparations for the rite and in the actual ritual itself. On the other hand, ethnographers have recorded many cults common to the community as a whole but the rituals for which were maintained by households or clan representatives. They include cults of the family hearth and ofindividual protective spirits, and cults of the spirits of mountains and rivers to insure good hunting, fishing, or safe passage. These traditions may be distinguished from shamanism in several ways, even when they have been integrated into the shamanic cults. They are characterized by the direct relationship between subject (individual) and object (indwelling spirit), while shamanism is characterized by the mediation between human community and spirit world undertaken by a priesthood (the shamans). The cults are concerned primarily with the natural world and with essential aspects of well-being within that world: the protection of children, for example, or of household stock, or of the fire which centers a family's self-identification. By contrast, shamanism concerns itself with issues of life and death: with sickness and the wandering soul, with death and the necessity to conduct the soul of the dead to another world; with threats which affect the community as a whole. While the household member who maintains the family cults is firmly integrated into the social fabric, shamans usually stand somewhat apart by virtue of the process of their selection and by virtue of their activities. Finally, while the paraphernalia of clan practices are usually simple objects which could be fabricated by any knowledgable individual, the artifacts of shamanism are characterized by an unusually rich symbolism of object

and image: elaborated through the artistic imagination of the shaman, specially fabricated by carefully selected individuals, and consecrated by elaborate rituals. The objects and implements used within the pre-shamanic and shamanic cults are explained by a rich body of oral tradition. This tradition contains the degree of consistency and variation one would expect in cultures dependent on oral transmission. While the general themes and structures remain relatively constant, the elaboration of these elements bear the hallmarks of individual creativity. This is apparent in the songs chanted by shamans or in the individual statements by shamans as to how they became initiated (Vasilevic [Vasilevich] 1968). More ancient is the tradition of stories and legends which relate to the natural world and the great pantheon of indwelling spirits by which Siberian peoples felt themselves surrounded, protected, and threatened. Within these tales one finds the accumulated knowledge and understanding of human societies which sought to find order and meaning in the physical features of their land, in seasonal changes, and in the animals, birds, and fish on which they depended for survival. Within this body of pre-shamanic lore and related to this spirit world was another layer of power, elaborated sometimes in the imagery of animals and sometimes in human form. These are the male and female figures which have the power to control cosmic forces, to determine order and disorder on a cosmic scale. By association with cosmic time and space, they reaffirm the shape of the significant universe laid out according to the cardinal directions, the flow of rivers, and the passage of time. Within the oral tradition one may thus distinguish between deities who effect cosmic order/disorder, heroic figures who confront that cosmic order/disorder, shamans who mediate between humans and cosmic forces, and household protective spirits and indwelling spirits who serve as an immediate support to the survival of individual and family.
A. THE SHAMANIC TRADITION
Although shamanic implements and costumes vary from one people to the next, there are general patterns which can be traced throughout Siberian shamanism and which indicate a commonality of tradition (cf. Levin and Potapov 1956, 1961). Throughout the vast area including the Allay Turkic peoples, the Turkic and Mongol peoples of Tuva and Mongolia, and the Paleosiberian and Tungusic peoples of more northern regions, the implements and clothing used by shamans effectively

174 IN SEARCH OF THE ANIMAL MOTHER
represent a reassignment to themselves of the signs and symbols of an ancient pantheon formulated in the bodies and powers of sacred animals. Indeed, the most obvious referents carried by the clothing and implements of the shaman were to animals, and within virtually all Siberian societies the most significant animals have been deer and elk, a variety of birds, and bear. In donning his cloak and headdress and in commencing the shamanic ritual, the shaman did not simply assume the powers of animal helpers; he also became that animal and was reborn into its body and knowledge. In so far as the cloak and headdress referred to totemic beings, it may be said that the shaman returned to the body and being of the tribal progenitor. This ritual reimbodiment of the shaman becomes clear in the consideration of the shamanic costume of cloak, headdress, gloves, and footwear as universal insignia of the Siberian shaman. Eliade has referred to the shaman's costume as representing "a religious microcosm" by which the shaman's immediate self and the space through which he or she moved became sacralized, in contrast to the surrounding profane space (Eliade 1972). Most typically that cloak would be the whole skin of a specially consecrated deer or bear (Anuchin 1914); made from deer skin, it could be cut in the shape of a bird (Anisimov 1958: 170ff.). Similar references to deer, elk, bear, and birds would be fashioned into the shaman's headdresses, gloves, and footwear. The metal images and objects which hung from the body of the shaman indicated both the shaman's animal-helpers and his animal double (Anisimov 1958; Anuchin 1914; Dioszegi 1968). Overarching all the animal references woven into the materials and imagery of the shaman's costume are specific and general references to the female generative force. Among the Ket, the very shapes and designs of worn objects refer to the female sexuality of the enveloping natural world and to the female character of the originating animal (Anuchin 1914). In wearing the shape of the vulva or its stylized reference in reindeer hair upon his deerskin cloak, the shaman assumed the power invested in the generative aspect of nature, its primary metaphor being the deer as generative force. The Evenk believed that the first shamans and the primogenitors of all later shamans were the old women who guarded the road to the dead. Because of this, the drawings on their robes had to be executed by women (Anisimov 1963: 97). Like those of virtually all Siberian shamans, the Evenk shaman's cloak was similar in cut and elaborate decoration to female robes (cf. Levin and Potapov 1961; Anokhin 1924). The dressed shaman would thus present the appearance of an elaborately gowned woman wrapped in references to

IN SEARCH OF THE ANIMAL MOTHER 175
antlered animals, birds, and sometimes bear. Within that elaborate set of references would appear signs of the reaffirmation of the half-human, half-animal aspect of the shaman, while specific indicators of male sexuality would be muted or absent. The shaman's caftan-shaped robe was prepared so that the power of the living animal was retained within its skin and transferred to the shaman. This practice undoubtedly refers to the widely held conception among Altayans, Tungus, and Ket of the shaman's animal ancestor as a wild cervid (Dioszegi 1968; Anokhin 1924; Anuchin 1914; Eliade 1972; Anisimov 1963; Potapov 1935). When the shaman died, the robe had to be ritually disposed of, either destroyed or, more often, hung on a tree somewhere in the forest, far from human settlement. The headdresses of Ket shamans and those of the chief shamans of the Evenk took the form of a metal cap with reindeer antlers (Eliade 1972: 155; Anuchin 1914: figs. 103, 104; Anisimov 1963: 100). References to deer antlers were repeated in the designs of various objects hung from the cloak of the shaman and in the branched form of the shaman's staff. This object was also made of metal; its several branches and the occasional appearance of a bird at its crest referred both to the tree by which the shaman effected his journey into the realm of the spirits and to the antlers of the shaman's deer-being. Dioszegi has detailed how the gowns of the Tofa shamans were made from the skin of a specifically consecrated male or female reindeer. Front and back of the gown were decorated with strips referring to the bones of the shaman-as-animal (Dioszegi 1968) and to the belief shared with other Siberian peoples that the bones represent the source of life (Eliade 1972: 158-165).2 Attached to the cloak were streamers of textile, reindeer hair, or reindeer skin. These refer to the body of the reindeer, but also to wings and feathers by which the shaman-deer regained the ability to fly (Dioszegi 1968). This conflation of deer and bird reminds one of the Ket belief that reindeer were formerly winged: their wings disappeared when it became apparent that wings prevented people from harnessing and saddling their deer (Anuchin 1914). In so far as the shaman was the tribal intermediary between the human realm and that of the spirits, the totemic aspect of his clothing reveals more ancient totemic sources of the clan itself. The robe of the shaman referred to the deer or elk as a primary tribal progenitor as well as the
2 When the shaman-to-be is "killed" in order to be reborn as a shaman, the process involves the (imagined) stripping of the flesh from the bones and the reconstitution of the reborn shaman from the rearticulated skeleton. See, also, the very similar gowns of the Altaytsy (Anokhin 1924).

shaman's animal ancestor (Potapov 1935). The preparation of the shaman's drum also reveals archaic totemic beliefs. The skin from which the drum was made had to be taken from a specially hunted and consecrated deer. The drum frame had to be made from slats taken from a living and consecrated tree. Should the tree die as a result of the cutting of its wood, then the drum would die, too. 3 Within virtually all Siberian shamanic societies, the drum had to be "enlivened" and consecrated through a special ceremony (Vajnstejn [Vaynshteyn] 1968; Potapov 1947). Conversely, when the drum reached a certain age-perhaps 14 or 15, the age of an old deer-it was said to be too old and had to be replaced by a new drum made from the skin of a younger animal (Dioszegi 1968). When the shaman died, his or her drum had to be ritually destroyed. To drop the drum during the shamanic seance was equivalent to the killing of a deer and it was considered to presage the death of the shaman (Anuchin 1914). The concepts revolving around the making and using of the drum indicate that it was conceived in terms of the shaman's deer progenitor and the shaman's steed. In its "body" was reaffirmed the essential association of deer progenitor and Tree of Life and, thus, of the source of the tribe and the location of the tree within the most important tribal rituals. Among the Evenk, the deer-drum was the steed of the shaman, but it was also conceived as the cosmic deer who lay at the base of the Tree of Life. From that tree was fashioned the drum frame (Anisimov 1958: 156 ff.). In this complex of elements, the drum appears as the progeny of both the Animal Mother and of the tree and the mediator between the shaman and the locus of tribal generation. A similar complex of ideas are found, for example, in Selkup rituals accompanying the vivification of the drum. This ceremony would occur in the spring, at the time of the all-important migration of birds. At that time., the shaman, accompanied by his spirit-helpers, would go into the forest to the tree from which had been fashioned the frame of his drum. They would gather the chips that remained on the ground and place them in a pile in the swamp where lived the Ylyunda kotta, the old WomanMistress of the universe. That place was also the point where converged the two cosmic rivers, that of the eagle and that of the nutbreaker (Anisimov 1963, 188). In this complex of ideas the tree of the shaman's drum is returned to the locus of the tribal progenitor, the old woman from

whom flows the tribal rivers of life. The fundamental association of deer and tree and of the relationship of the deer to a female progenitor is again evident in the beliefs surrounding the fabrication of the Ket shaman's drum. According to Anuchin, the skin of the drum had be made of deer skin and the frame had to be taken from a south-facing branch of a ceder tree. The Ket allowed only women to prepare the deerskin, but the rest of the drum was prepared by men (Anuchin 1914: 48). The drum was the very heart of the shaman's steed._ In the sounding of the drum was described the shaman's arduous journey in search of the souls of the sick or to accompany the dead. The framework by which the shaman held the drum was frequently shaped like an anthropomophic doll, the "master of the drum." Among Altayic peoples, the name of that part of the frame preserved a reference to the reindeer ancestor represented by and re-embodied in the drum (Potapov 1935). The resonators on the frame of the drum were sometimes referred to as the arteries of the deer totem (Tofa), sometimes to antlers (Yakut), sometimes to ears (Selkup), and sometimes to the deer teats by which the shaman would derive vital sustenance in his or her journey (Khakass) (Dioszegi 1968; Potapov 1935). Within such conceptions is reaffirmed the understanding of the deer-drum as progenitor, nurturer, and protective steed. Over the long course of the shamanic ritual, the shaman would beat his drum and recount with words and movements the journey he had undertaken. As he chanted, the drum would rise and fall and its pendants and streamers move and sound in imitation of the breathing of the shaman's deer-steed. The dependency of the shaman on the deer-steed and the conviction that the drum would be transformed into that steed is eloquently suggested in a the words of a Soyot shaman addressing his drum, "O my beautiful drum, you are limping my beauty," and "Heed, heed, my horse-stag.... my supreme animals, stag and doe..." (Potapov 1935: 143). The shaman's journey was frequently structured by a real or imaginary tree, perhaps represented by a pole or ladder. This "tree" served as the axis which connected the land of people, the underworld, and the upper realms of the spirits. At the same time, the tree referred to the clan tree and to the tribal understanding of the World Tree, or Axis Mundi. 4 Among the Evenk, the tree figuratively climbed by the shaman was set within the shaman's tent and extended through its smokehole. The tree also referred, however, to the center of the clan lands and to what
4 See, e.g., Anisimov 1958: 162-164. Such ideas regarding the tree as Axis Mundi or Tree of Life are, of course, universal and have been commented on by a number of scholars; cf. inter alia, Cook 1988.

Anisimov has referred to as the topogentilic center of the clan itself (Anisimov 1963; Vasilevich 1963). In this construct may be traced what must have been a gradual absorption into the shamanic ritual of the concept of an archaic World Tree joining the upper, middle and lower realms. Among the Ket, the tree of the shamanic ritual also referred to the tree of Es, the high god, which grew in the East and was associated with the rising sun. This is certainly the same tree as that from which the Selkup shaman's drum was made and which was "returned" by the shaman to the swamp of the old Woman-Mother of the tribe. It is ultimately the same tree-that is, the same symbol of generation and passage-as that which was said to grow from the body of the Evenk elk or deer Animal Mother, the bugady enintyn (Anisimov 1963).5 Within the shamanic ritual, birds were hardly less significant than deer and trees; the three elements-birds, deer, and trees-are constantly reunited in tale and ritual. 6 The Selkup envision the raven-mother and raven-father as key elements in the vivification of the shaman's drum. These birds are said to fly to the swamp where dwells the Ylyunda kotta. There they take water from the whirlpool of life and sprinkle it on the deer-drum which will serve as the shaman's steed. The shaman then erects a sacrificial "tree" next to his tent and hangs his deer-drum on it, thus returning the deer, now revitalized by the birds, to the tree from which it came (Anisimov 1963: 189). Among the Ket, the primary birds were the eagle, the swan, and the grebe (Anuchin 1914: 54-57). The Ket considered the eagle to be the chief helping spirit of the shaman. This bird referred back to the ancient myth of Dokh, sometimes referred as the first shaman, who was instructed by an eagle. Indicative of that bird's central role were the implements carried by the Ket shaman: a metal eagle leg with claws, by which the shaman caught and destroyed evil spirits; the wand with double eagle heads, by which the shaman was endowed with the great foresight and knowledge of the eagle (Anuchin 1914). The swan was the messenger of good tidings and was associated with Tomam of the warm South. By contrast, the grebe inhabited the far North, the kingdom of Khosedam. Represented by metal images worn on the shaman's cloak, the grebe would tell the shaman all that happened
5 The close connection between deer and trees indicated in the shaman's staff and drum and their essential association with sun and moon (that is, with the signs of cosmic order) are reaffirmed by the frequent repetition of stylized images of all four elements on the backboards and doors of the shamans' sleds and huts; see Anuchin 1914: 65, figs. 67, 68. 6 Regarding the general nature of bird symbolism, cf. Eliade 1972: 156-158; Shtemberg 1925; and regarding the extensive bird symbolism in Tofa shamanic headdresses, cf. Dioszegi 1968.

in the world of the tundra; its cry was said to be that of a weeping child or woman (Anuchin 1914: 57). The three birds-eagle, swan, and grebe-thus reflected the basic structure of the Ket universe: the vertical rise represented by Dokh's journey along the Yenisey was the "direction" of knowledge; the South, referred to by the swan, was associated with the return of life to the middle world, and the North, represented by the grebe, was the region of cold and death. The reiteration of references to deer, birds, and trees in shamanic paraphernalia, their conflation, and the transformation of shaman into deer and bird affirm the foundation of these elements within a universe considerably older than shamanism. Shamanism seems to have absorbed constructs which already existed and through which deer/tree/bird already referred to tribal progenitor, intercessor, and the transformation attendent on death. While nothing within known shamanic paraphernalia reproduces the Scytho-Siberian construct of the deer with bird-headed antler-tines, one cannot help but find in the early images of the deer with tree-like antlers a prefiguration of the insistent shamanic conflation of deer, trees, and birds. A significant qualification, however, is that within that earlier period (the early Iron Age), the conflation of these elements seems to have been the deathright of all members of society. Many individuals, male and female, adult and child, carried the images of that conflation with them to the grave, perhaps as a sign of passage to the next world. At some point between the early Iron Age and the emergence of a documented shamanic tradition, a monopoly over those animal references was shifted to and concentrated within the person of the shaman. Within the nomadic burial rituals of the late Bronze and early Iron Ages the structures indicative of passage may also be glimpsed, the structures within which were foreshadowed the shape of the journey of the shaman as psychopomp and the symbolic structures inherent in that journey.
B. PRE-SHAMANIC CULTS
The foregoing discussion has focussed attention on the implements of shamanism and on the archaic elements within shamanic practice and belief. The examples drawn from shamanic traditions of such peoples as the Ket, Evenk, Selkup, and Tofa draw attention, in turn, to those traditions which may be identified as pre-shamanic cults: that is, cults which appear to have developed before shamanism emerged and which point back to archaic beliefs and practices and to an ancient social order. In general, these cults involved a belief in the indwelling spirits of

natural objects and forces. The rituals associated with these cults were undertaken and maintained by individuals on behalf of their clan. Indeed, such cults tended to reinforce the idea of clan unity rather than the integrity of nuclear family or tribe. The deities referred to in those cults were clearly indicative of an archaic belief in a clan mother, an earth mother, or an animal mother of life and death. Within the ethnographic tradition, one frequently finds a combination of elements: shamanic societies within which survive to a greater or lesser degree preshamanic cults of the hearth, of the deity-protectress of children and of the herd; and even bear and mountain cults. Among the Turkic peoples of the Altay or the Mongol peoples of Mongolia and South Siberia, these cults have frequently been obscured by the overlay of shamanism and lamaism. They tend to be more clearly preserved in their archaic forms among more northern peoples, such as the Ket and the reindeer-dependent Evenk.7 In many cases, and particularly among South Siberian peoples closer to the Eurasian Steppe zone, pre-shamanic as well as shamanic cults reveal a complex intertwining of elements suggestive of sexual and social tension. This sexual tension unquestionably reflects slowly changing political structures dependent on an ancient shift ofpolitical power away from a female-centered clan structure, and the reintegration of that power within a male tribal elite. These cults also reveal tensions between pre-shamaic belief systems and the later shamanic cults into which they were ultimately integrated. Such examples of sexual and social tension, lodged within the sedimentary overlay of shamanism on pre-shamanic cults, can be found throughout the ethnographic record. For example, among peoples of the Sayan-Altay region, the drum of the shaman serving a particular lineage or tribe had to be made from trees on the lineage's sacred mountain (Potapov 1958: 320-321). In this tradition may be glimpsed a continuing tension between the pre-shamanic mountain cult-assertive of lineage and family identity-and the shamanic cult of a later period. The South Siberian mountain cult shared by Turkic peoples of the Sayan-Altay region as well as by Mongols, Buryats and Tibetans is another case in point. As a tradition which reaffirmed the identity of the clan lineage, it was most certainly pre-shamanic in origin.
7In fact, the further north the location of a people, the more significant remained the cults of clan deities carried out by individuals on behalf of household and clan. Conversely, the greater strength of shamanic traditions among peoples closer to the Eurasian Steppe may be explained in part as a response to the powerful articulation ofstatehood among cultures south of the steppeland.

The cult involved both the establishment of cult sites (obo, obaa) in the form of stone or stick cairns on the tops of mountains or at the top of significant passes, and the reaffirmation of the power of the mountain deity by ritual offerings (Potapov 1946, 1958). In passing over the mountain at the time of a hunt, the hunter would offer bits of meat or tea to the mountain "master" represented by the obo. Each sacred mountain was associated with a particular lineage or tribe. The resulting sacralization of mountain and lineage and the understanding that a mountain might have its own protective deity was indicated by the establishment of the obo .8 In a real sense, the cult of the mountain indicated a culture of place: a recognition that the well-being of the lineage-insured through the successful hunt and through rich pasture and water-was dependent on the mountain deity. In Tuva, it was only in the nineteenth century that the relationship of lineage to obo, sacred mountain, and mountain deity become displaced and monopolized by shamanic and lamaistic elements (D'yakonova 1975a: 159-160). The mountain cult and its mythology, however, also reveal sexual tensions which reflect the conflict of larger social issues over time. The sexual identity of the "master" of the mountain seems to have varied from male to female. Potapov recounts how in recent times, the "master" of the mountain is said to take the form of a naked female. She approaches the hunter at evening, when he is in the taiga, and sleeps with him. From this encounter is ensured his success in the hunt (Potapov 1946: 159). Sexual tension in relation to the control of power is also expressed in the same region by the fact that the cult of the mountain was often reserved for men alone; women would not be allowed to take part, or even to go to sacred places (the obo, for example); stock might not be allowed to graze on the slopes of the mountain (Potapov 1960: 213 ff). The complexity of the association of mountain cult with a male or female power and the indication of the complexity of sexual reference over time is also suggested by elements in heroic epics which have been gathered from among the peoples of Khakassiya. There one finds that the hero of the epic has been born in a mountain cave or that he finds protective shelter in the caves of mountains considered to have been ancestral places. I. L. Kyzlasov (1982) believes that in these cases the cave refers to the generative and protective female ancestor, the spirit of the mountain. Related to this is the widespread belief in the mountain as the
'Throughout northern Mongolia, Tuva, and the northern Altay, the appearance of obo at the tops of mountains and at passes attests to the continuing vitality of the mountain cult, even in the post-Soviet period.

source of the lineage and the place to which the dead of the lineage return. The mountain is thus understood as the generative source. In commenting on the mountain cult of Khakassiya, Kyzlasov has associated the transferance of cult attention from the female "mother of the mountain" to a "stone father," presumably a stone cairn, as indicative of the rise of patriarchal structures within tribal society. The Siberian bear cult even more clearly reveals references and proccupations which go back to a pre-shamanic stage of prehistory. The cult is laced through with sexual tension reflecting a gradual diminution of female power and the concurrent rise of shamanic traditions and the attendent cults related to Heaven.9 The Evenk consider the bear to be a culture hero from whom people received fire and tools, including such primitive implements as stones and scrapers and a knowledge of tanning skins and harnessing reindeer. This bear-hero gave tools and knowledge not to the tribe as a whole, but rather to a woman. The nature of the bear's gifts suggests the deep antiquity of the Evenk bear cult, seemingly referring back to the Neolithic period and to the later acquisition of the tools for using reindeer. At the same time, the fact that this culture hero gave his knowledge to a woman indicates the survival of an archaic understanding that control over the natural world was vested in a female figure. The Ket and the Evenk believed that the bear had the ability to think and to talk like a human. Indeed, the Ket attribute the existence of a soul only to people and bears, whom they refer to as the "tsar" of animals (Alekseyenko 1960: 91). They ascribe the ability to think only to people, bears, and to the evil Khosedam (Alekseyenko 1977). If an orphaned bear was found, it was raised as a member of the family, fed, clothed, ornamented, and taken on social visits, until it was old enough to be released in the forest (Alekseyenko 1960: 92-93). Among both Ket and Evenk, as well as among other related peoples, there existed numerous requirements which governed how one addressed a bear, how one hunted a bear and drove it from its cave, how one had to appease its spirit, and how one "buried" the bear's skull and bones on a specially selected tree so that it would be reborn (Vasilevich 1971: 160 ff.). 10 These rituals all
9 Among the best sources on the bear cult, see Vasilevich 's discussion of its form among the Evenk, and Alekceyenko's discussion of its form among the Ket (Vasilevich 1971; Alekseyenko 1960; cf. Anisimov 1958). 10 Among the Turkic peoples of the Sayan-Altay, the bear was also considered to have the qualities and abilities ofa human. In killing a bear, it was necessary to ask its foregiveness and to appease it with rituals expressing concern and regret. After the killing of the bear, its head had to be left in the field, in a tree. Arrows would be shot into it, apparently to scare off its spirit from following the men and seeking revenge (Potapov 1958: 317).

indicate the complex interweaving of bear and human origins. They also suggest the emergence of the bear cult at a period when both Ket and Evenk inhabited the mountain taiga zone, that is, the region of the SayanAltay, in the case of the Ket, and, in the case of the Evenk, the PrebaykalTransbaykal. These traces of an ancient habitation of mountainous taiga indicate that the origins of the bear cult lay within the Bronze Age, or even earlier. Other signs of the bear cult's archaic origins lie in the complexity of its themes of human/bear generative relations. These involve myths regarding marriage between bears and human girls, the birth of heroic figures from the marriage of bear and girl, and even myths involving the birth to a young girl of twin babies, human and bear (Vasilevich 1971; Anisimov 1958: 129-131). In that union of girl and bear may be glimpsed totemic conceptions regarding the origin of a clan, within which the union is inevitably between girl/woman and bear, while the boy or man emerges from that union or is in conflict with the bear. This special relationship between bear and girl/woman may be documented in both the myths and the folktales of the Evenk, Even, Orochey, Ul'chey, Nanay, as well as among the Evenk of the Amur region, where the woman is said to have been transformed into a bear when she had finished raising her children (Vasilevich 1971).'1 The Siberian bear cult obviously reflects archaic traditions which go back before shamanism. In its references to the caves, cliffs, and rivers of a homeland in the mountain taiga zone of Siberia, and in the contrasting relationships of bear/woman and bear/man, are glimpsed totemic understandings of tribal origins, as well as a deeply rooted ambivalence regarding the particular interrelationship of bear and woman. In the variations on the Ket understanding of the essential nature and function of the bear is suggested the layering of historical stages of development. Among the more archaic stages reflected here is the sense of the bear as the animal double of the woman and the essential unity of woman and bear. At the same time, the fearfulness of the bear-reflective, certainly, of its actual power as a forest animal-and its role as source and as destroyer echoes the ferocious capacity which the Ket attribute, also, to Khosedam, who ate the souls of the living but who was also, by that act, the catalyst for their rebirth. This construct parallels the dual function
11 The concept of the bear as source is also reflected among the Ket by the fact that the robe of the shaman who takes Mother Earth as his source is sometimes made of a bear skin (Alekseyenko 1977: 31). The shaman thus integrated on his or her person the assimilation of bear and female in the form of generative source.

which the Evenk would attribute to the giant elk mother, who was said to consume the souls of the living. The archaic traditions embodied in both the mountain and bear cults are combined with elements which have been continued up into the modern period; they are laced with the threads of ancient tensions which emerged within a slowly changing social order. Somewhat clearer references back to a pre-shamanic tradition have been maintained in the tradition of household and clan cults which could also be found among virtually all Siberian peoples up into this century. With few exceptions, these cults centered on deities who were female in essence and whose function was protective and generative. This female-centeredness and its archaic elements are particularly clearly reflected in Ket traditions. Among the Ket, as among many other Siberian peoples, the elements of the natural world--earth, sun, moon, water, and so forth-are personified as female. This female personification appears foremost in the conception of the earth as Mother Earth (bangam-earth-mother), navel, that all creatures of the world are connected to. Hidden here is the understanding of death's interconnectedness with earth, i.e. that human life and death emerge equally from Mother Earth (Alekseyenko 1977: 30). This conception became embedded in the Ket shamanic cult, where the shaman is understood to be protected by Mother Earth. The earth is sometimes referred to as mother of the kaigus', that is, the mother of the being who ensures success in the hunt, the mother of the wife of the bear and of the bear-woman, and the mother of all living things. Although within Ket mythic traditions the sun was associated with the great god, Es, within their everyday life the Ket personified the sun in female form and associated her with the regions from which renewal and warmth come-that is, with East and South (Alekseyenko 1977: 32 ff). These directions were considered positive and pure; they regulated the organization of life, from the placement of encampment and the spatial organization of ritual, to the orienting of events such as the birth of a child. To the east rose the sacred tree of Es, the deity of heaven; in its branches were placed the bones of the animals waiting to be reborn. The significance of the sun was reflected in the shamanic rite in which the sun was seen as a protecting spirit of the shaman and as the end of one of the seven roads taken by the shaman in his ecstatic journey . The moon, too, was conceived of as female, as was the north (polar) star-the Mother of Stars-and Venus (Alekseyenko 1977: 33-34). Thus, the directions of life and death and the major celestial markers of the universe retained in whole or in part a female character.

IN SEARCH OF THE ANIMAL MOTHER 185
In the same way, the closer elements of the natural world were charged through with aspects of the female. The Ket personified their watercourses as female deities with the aspect of a mother-as Ulemam (water-ul' and mother-mam ). The Yenisey, the most important of their rivers, was a Great Mother, while all its tributaries were lesser mothers or grandmothers-the mothers of mothers. 12 Trees were also considered female. As sources of life and as the means by which earth and heaven were joined, they were treated with great respect. Although the Heavenly Tree was associated with Es, the tree itself was considered to be female. The fearful elements of the world-the north, islands, cliffs, and rapids, all that threatened the Ket in their daily life-were also female in essential aspect, but they were associated with Khosedam (Alekseyenko 1977: 36-44). The positive and negative by which the world was charged were thus bound together by a female aspect. Among the Ket existed the belief in a being of remarkable abilities, the kaigus' . On the one hand, a kaigus' was a female being, the mother offurbearing animals such as the squirrel and sable. In this form, kaigus' had the ability to take on both animal and human form. It was said that in the form of a woman, kaigus' would meet and mate with hunters in the taiga, thereby ensuring their success. On the other hand, kaigus' was a bear who held dominion over the animals of the forest. Alekceenko points out that in this duality was embedded a firm belief in the interconnection between human and bear, an interconnection which is considered essential to the success of the hunt (Alekseyenko 1977: 44). The belief in kaigus' extended itself to stringent rules regarding how one hunted: not to take more than was necessary, not to inflict unnecessary pain, to observe the rituals required to ensure the animal's rebirth. Moreover, a hunter could lose his kaigus' if his wife did not observe monthly rituals of purification. Like so much within the mountain cult, this last belief seems to mask deep tensions between the underlying female aspect of the bear cult and a developed male domination of the cult. Nonetheless, here and throughout the Ket bear cult emerge the outlines of the female as dual in nature and power. She was both Animal Mother and mother of the animals. Conversely, the bear was believed to be a reincarnated relative; when a hunter killed a bear, it was believed that the bear/relative had come to be released for rebirth (Anuchin 1914: 12-13).
12 In calling on the rivers to loosen the ice with which they are covered, the Ket referred to them as "grandmothers" (Alekseyenko 1977: 35).

186 IN SEARCH OF THE ANIMAL MOTHER
Less fraught with ambivalence was the Ket attitude toward their protecting spirits of the household. Represented in the form of fetishistic female dolls, these spirits were considered to be female, but they were passed down through the male line (Anuchin 1914; Alekseyenko 1967, 1971, 1977). These protecting spirits thus reaffirmed clan lineage while also echoing an ancient dependency on female origins. The antiquity, even pre-shamanic existence, of these traditions is suggested by the independence of these cults from shamanic practice (Alekseyenko 1977: 57). Foremost among the household protecting spirits was bokarn , "firemother," the protector of hearth and household. When the members of the household ate, the fire was also fed with small bits of meat or tea; it was spoken to as if it were a grandmother. When the encampment moved, it was carefully carried along in a special box in order to be redistributed to family members at the site of the new encampment. Redistributed it became, again, the source of household well-being in terms of warmth, light, and food. The Ket personification of the fire as a beautiful woman was not unusual: fire is also given female personification among the Altaytsy, Shors, Khanty, Mansi, Evenk, Nganasan, as well as among other Siberian peoples (Alekseyenko 1971: 264-265; Dyrenkova 1927; Tokarev 1961). The Ket alel (alal, alel barn, barn), protecting spirits of the hearth and family, are also significant survivors of a pre-shamanic tradition. The alel were made from carved and painted pieces of ceder (Anuchin 1914: 86-89). Theyweredressedinclothandfursandomamented with beads and copper. Sometimes the entire face was covered with a sheet of copper or with old pieces of silver money and then hammered and marked with human features.13 In recent times, ale! were invested with domestic tasks: they were believed to be the special protectors of children, to watch over and caress them as they slept. They were also used in divination: when thrown into the air, if they landed face up, the answer to the question was positive (Alekseyenko 1971: 269). The ale! are the latest and probably last expressions of an ancient tradition which invested protective power in female spirits and deities. As personal and prosaic as the alel appear and as reduced in power as may be the "fire-mother," one senses in their cults threads leading back
13 See, e.g., Alekseyenko 1971: fig. 2. Copper or silver could be used in metal ornaments but iron could never be brought near the a/el (Alekseyenko 1971: 266). Attached to one ale/ in the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography, St. Petersburg, is a cast copper openwork ornament with protruberances on its rim; altogether it looks very much like the "sun-disks" found on early petroglyphs; see Alekseyenko 1971: fig. 3; cf. Devlet 1978: fig. 6.

to a more powerful past, one bound to the powers possessed by the duality of Khosedam and Tomam. These figures will be considered more fully below. For the moment it may be said that these greater entities, Khosedam and Tomam, and Khosedam' s unending battle against male gods and male heroes themselves point back to an ancient and possibly unified source, female in character, associated with deer and birds, and ultimately the source of life and death. The levels of the Ket universe, the polarities into which those levels were arranged, further suggest the gradual splitting of individual deity and function over time and the relocation of those functions and powers in the hands of more specialized deities, spirits, heroes, and shamans. Such a model of cultural change, wherein the functional catalysts of awe and mythic elaboration may be traced back to an ancient female source, is reaffirmed when one considers the overwhelming female character of those spirits associated with natural elements and with the well-being of the family and the individual within Ket tradition. Indeed, the Ket universe, like that of so many Siberian peoples, seems threaded through with traces of a femalecentered belief or with what has been called a mother cult, with roots as ancient as the Paleolithic period (Nahodil 1968; Alekseyenko 1977). Ket cults related to the natural world were all rooted in the worship of Mother Earth. From that worship descended the more particular cults, virtually all of which were focussed, also, on female spirits. They represent a world vitalized by a female generative spirit, but a spirit also acknowledged as the source of death. These female-centered cults seem to have existed in tension with the cult of Heaven, centered on the male god Es and forming a major aspect of the shamanic cult. While Es was credited with bestowing well-being on the Ket, the sources of life and death were more concretely located in the female powers represented by Tomam and Khosedam. Similarly, although the sun was associated with heaven and thus with Es, it was personified as a female figure, as were the moon and the (North) Pole star. The Ket cult of the hearth fire was not unique among Siberian peoples. Among the Evenk, the cults of hearth and fire and the related ancestor cults point back to an ancient process of change characterized by tension between an archaic order centered on the female and that which ultimately culminated in the patriarchal social order known in the modern period. The cult of the protective ancestors of the family was focused on those ancestors considered to be the source of the agnate family. The cult was handed down from generation to generation through the oldest scion of the male line or, in case of his death, through the nearest of his blood

relatives (Anisimov 1958: 92). The maintainance of the cult, involving the feeding and honoring of the cult symbols, was thus the prerogative of the oldest male within the family. Similar cults, also maintained by the male members of the family and also complex in their references, are characteristic of other Siberian peoples. Anisimov refers to Shternberg' s observation of the Goldi (Nanay) ancestor cult:
In almost every home... is a large wooden representation, sometimes one, sometimes two, male and female-dzhuolin, in the form of a person with a large chest. The fact that almost all dzhulin'y, even those which are male, are represented with female breasts, indicates that the original dzhulin'y were considered to be the family ancestor; and only with the passage of time, with the change in the position of the woman, did the dzhulin'y, even though male (in form) continue to be represented in their original aspect, that is, as women, out of the fear of destroying the tradition (Anisimov 1958: 99).
Anisimov has emphasized how among the Evenk such complexities have resulted in a peculiar conflict between the patriarchal nature of the family ancestral cult and the mother-centered, and even more important, cult of the hearth fire. Within this cult, the hearth fire, addressed as "grandmother," is understood as the mistress of the tent, of the family hearth, and as the protecting spirit of the family and clan. Her significance appears in the elaborate rituals involving the removal of the hearth fire at the time of the moving of camp and the carrying of coals to the gathered herd of reindeer. In both cases, it is the mistress of the household who maintains the cult and effects its protective rituals. It is she who carries the coals of that fire to the new encampment, she who redivides it among the clan members, and she who takes it to the reindeer herd as reaffirmation of the practical and spiritual link between the clan and its animals. The significance of the hearth fire is made clearer when one realizes that it is believed to be the habitation of the family protector and the clan mother. It marks the place of passage of the soul from the land of the souls to the land of living people. Coming from the realm of the souls and passing through the opening of the smoke hole of the tent, the soul-to-be-born finds a resting place within the womb of a woman. The fire is, in other words, the site of passage from one world to the next (Anisimov 1958: 94 ff.) and a metaphor for birth. The hearth fire cannot be given to individuals other than those who belong to the clan. In this respect, according to Anisimov, the cult of the hearth fire reaffirms the unity and indivisibility of the clan and the identity of the household and clan with the specific place marked by the hearth fire. The members of the clan are "the people of one fire, one hearth" (Anisimov 1958: 97). In this respect, and in the cult's relation

ship to the female line of a family, the fire cult appears to be considerably older than the agnatic cult of the family ancestors. Anisimov points out that the Evenk term, kharan , refers to the yurt site and to the place of the yurt hearth, to the fire in the yurt, and to the general encampment: "In this manner, the encampment, the hearth, and the place for the hearth fire and the dwelling at one time had the same meaning and were expressed by one and the same word" (Anisimov 1958: 97). From this he concludes that the spirit of the hearth fire and the mistress of the hearth, the tent, and the clan were all reflections of the matriarchal aspect of social organization. The beliefs and rituals revolving around the mistress of the hearth fire all involve concepts of protection and regeneration; in their relationship to the continuity of family and herd, they are protective and generative. In these several aspects the cult of the hearth fire stands in sharp contrast to the cult of the ancestors maintained by the male line and to the elaborate shamanic rituals related to the spirits of the dead. In these rituals, the spirits of the dead are conceived as potentially harmful and vengeful elements which must be forced to leave the land of the living. Tension and conflict between the living and the dead are reflected throughout the shamanic rites. In the rituals related to the hearth fire, on the other hand, consistent concern for the continuity between the two realms is reflected. The mistress of the hearth fire is associated with the reindeer herd and the locus of the clan; as such, and in her association with the Evenk mistress of the taiga and animals (bugady enintyn), represented in the form of an elk or wild deer, the mistress of the hearth fire is the source of a lineage's well-being. In contrast to the anthropomorphic aspect of the ancestors and of the dead within the shamanic rituals, the zoomorphic imaging of the Evenk cult mistresses reaffirms the greater antiquity of the cult of the hearth fire and of the matriarchal social order it implies. That this discussion has continually returned to two Siberian people, the Evenk and the Ket, is not accidental. Although the symbolic systems involving an animal mother, the Tree of Life, the transformation of the individual soul, and the nature and function of the shaman are shared by many other Siberian peoples, the Evenk and Ket are most relevant to this discussion. More clearly than any other Siberian or Central Asian peoples, their predecessors are traceable back to a probable identity with the Early Nomads, their Siberian relatives, and their Siberian predecessors. I have already referred to many aspects of their shamanic and preshamanic traditions. It is useful, now, to review the Evenk and Ket

mythic traditions, within which appear even richer resources for a study of early Siberian symbolic systems.
C. THE EVENK AND EVENK MYTHIC TRADITIONS
The Tungusic Evenk are the most numerous of the Siberian "small peoples." They may be found across the whole of Siberia, from the far southeast in the region of the Amur River, around Baykal, and further north, east and west beyond the taiga, into the tundra region. The forerunners of the Evenk are believed to have emerged from the forested lands west ofLake Baykal, an area now known as the Prebaykal. Perhaps first nudged through population pressures in the Bronze Age and then in the late first millennium B.C. pressed by more aggressive groups of Xiongnu ("Huns"), the forerunners of the Evenk spread out from the Baykal taiga zone. Moving to the north along the Lena River, to the west and up the Angara and Yenisey, the Evenk spread into the Siberian taiga-tundra zone. As they moved, they assimilated some Paleoasiatic groups and pushed others further to the north. This large, northern group of Evenk peoples came to be characterized by an economy dependent on hunting and on reindeer herding. The theory of Evenk origins in the region of the Baykal taiga was first articulated by Okladnikov on the basis of archaeological excavations in the Prebaykal and was elaborated further in succeeding years by Okladnikov and other scholars (Okladnikov 1950, 1975; Tivanenko 1989; Levin and Potapov 1956: 701 ff.). This theory has also found support in Vasilevich' s meticulous analysis of the Tungusic Evenk bear cult and the mythic tradition with which it is surrounded. Vasilevich has argued that the Evenk bear cult had to have emerged in a region of mountainous taiga; in the case of the Evenk, that would have been the region to the east and west of Lake Baykal. The cult must have emerged as early as the Neolithic and Aeneolithic periods (Vasilevich 1969, 1971). 14 The northern Evenk designate significant space by the term buga.
14 Vasilevich also places the emergence of shamanism in the same period, but her arguments for such a dating are not convincing. As the proto-Tungusic peoples spread out of the Baykal region, other groups moved to the east and south as far as the mouth of the Amur River. These are the so-called "mounted" Tungusics who over time absorbed cultural and! linguistic elements from the horse and stock-dependent forerunners of Turkic-Mongol groups. The dialects of these Tungusic groups are now strongly Mongolized. Most scholars reject the theory according to which the Evenk originated in the region of the Ordos and Yellow rivers and moved north through Manchuria where they learned reindeer herding (Levin and Potapov 1956: 703-704). The Evenk of that area are of less interest in this discussion of ethnography than those reindeer-dependent groups to the north.

The upper world, of the taiga, animals, and people, and inhabited by the deities of natural phenomena, was referred to as ugu (upper) buga. Ugu buga was similar in all respects to the world of people. That world, the realm of living people, was called dulugu (middle) buga, while the lower world was called khergu (lower) buga. Khergu-buga is just like the middle world, except that everything is reversed: what is alive above is dead below and what is dead above is alive below. All the worlds in turn have their own layers, each of which is reserved for different groupsthe living, the dead, the rulers of the worlds, the spirits, and so forth (Anisimov 1963). In its extensions, however, the term bug!bugalbualba is considerably more complex, revealing Evenk conceptions of significant space in terms of the Evenk lands, the phenomenal world surrounding and effecting tribal existence, and the hostile space outside the Evenk world. Thus, bug refers to land, forest, nature, country, and homeland while buga /bua /ba refers also to homeland, weather, firmament, heaven, universe and world, among other meanings. Semantic qualifications of the term vary meaning and even invert its underlying sense: thus, desolate space-taiga-is referred to as bua khueni ; exterior space, and space outside is referred to as bugadya. (Anisimov 1963: 181-182). One of the most central terms in Evenk cosmology is that of bugady, "of the buga, belonging to the buga," i.e. the sacred clan rocks and trees which belong to the clan land (buga). In the concept of bugady Anisimov finds an essential key to Evenk understanding of the world in terms of genetic and kinship relations. The bugady mark the originating places of the clan; they are sacred because of their significance as clan sourceliterally, as the place from which the clan's spirit ancestors emerged from their totemic source. The topogentilic (Anisimov's term) aspect of the bugady is revealed by the Evenk concept of the bugady mushunin, the mistress of the clan, and bugady enintyn, the mistress-mother of the clan. Bugady mushunin is not only the spirit mistress of the clan but also the mistress of the world and nature. She is conceived in the form of a woman but also as an cow elk or wild cow reindeer. Bugady enintyn, with its element enin meaning both mother and cow elk, also combines the concepts of cow elk (eneche) and mother (eni) (Anisimov 1958: 102105). The two mythic figures together point back to the ancient totemic aspect of the cow elk and cow reindeer within the Evenk belief system. The combination of clan mistress and mistress-mother of the clan suggests that the human aspects of these sacred figures emerged only later as the concept of clan origins became separated from the primary image of the totem animal mother (Anisimov 1963: 169).

Podkamennaya Tunguska Evenk concept of bugady enintyn as the mistress of the universe and the mother of animals and people reaffirms her merged anthropomorphic and zoomorphic aspects. As "Grand-· mother bugady," she is called upon to give animals and fish to the Evenk (Anisimov 1963: 177). In the shamanic ritual of shingkelevun, of which more will be said below, she is unequivocably conceived as having the body and character of an cow elk or cow reindeer. The reconstruction ofEvenk mythic traditions carried out by Anisimov and Vasilevich, among others, indicates the manner in which shamanic: traditions recapitulate the historical development of belief systems central to the life of a specific people. Enfolded within these shamanic traditions are the most archaic layers-layers which refer back to an animal mother, to the transformation of that originating totemic source into a form half-human and half-animal, to the degeneration of that totemic source into a cult object, and, finally, to the subordination of fundamental aspects of archaic beliefs to the shamanic cult, that is, to the, shaman's power and functions. Because the shamanic cult and these: archaic levels are so intertwined within the ethnographic record, it is best to approach the latter through a discussion of rites and objects characteristic of shamanism among the northern Evenk. The Evenk ritual of shingkelevun was performed to ensure success in the hunt (Anisimov 1958, 1963). In this ritual, the shaman would be charged with traveling to the dwelling of the mistress of the clan lands, the dunne mushunin, who was thought to live under a rock or under the roots of the sacred clan tree. From her he learns that she may release the animals to the taiga only if the mother of the universe, the bugady enintyn, agrees. The mistress of the clan lands tells the shaman how to go to the dwelling place of the bugady enintyn, at the origin of the clan lands. Within this tale, the bugady enintyn is clearly conceived as a giant cow elk or doe. She, in tum, allows the shaman to lasso some animals which are transformed into magical woolen threads, shingken, which the shaman carries in his drum. He shows the dunne mushunin his catch of shingken and she lets him pass back through her bugady to the land of the taiga. When he releases the shingkin in the taiga, they are transformed back into animals for the Altaytsy to hunt. Within the shamanic rite of shingkelevun, which joins passage to other worlds with the bugady, the guardian of that passage is also the mistress of the clan lands. Thus the shaman's journey to find animals which his people depend on takes him to a sacred place marked by a sacred rock or tree, and to the locus of a female figure, visually conceived

in the form of a woman. This figure, in turn, functions as the sentinel guarding the entrance to the route the shaman will pursue to arrive at the place of the giant cow elk or doe, the maternal source of all animals and people. The drum which the Evenk shaman used was likewise made from the skin of a deer born specifically for the shaman at the base of the very Cosmic Tree from which the drum's frame was fa~hioned (Anisimov 1958: 156). The transformation of the animals he has lassooed into threads carried within the deerskin drum and the reembodiment of the animals when he empties these threads from the drum onto the taiga recapitulates the process by which the shaman-to-be becomes reconstituted. In that process, the anthropomorphic soul of the future shaman is taken into the underworld of shamans, kherekshe, by his or her spirit ancestor. The soul is led to the turu , the tree which is at once the sacred tree of the clan and the sacred tree of the clan's shamans. Among the roots of the uru lies the great Animal Mother, a cow elk or cow reindeer. She eats the shaman's anthropomorphic soul and then gives birth to the khargi, the soul of the shaman's animal double. The khargi is then placed by the spirit ancestors in an iron cradle hanging from the branches of the larch, or turu. The khargi are half-human and half-animal or bird. They are still represented, for example, by the bird-men figures on the cloaks of Evenk shamans (Anisimov 1958: 74, 136-137). 15 This khargi will function as the chief soul of the shaman. When the shaman is reborn, the animal again slips into its human form. Thus the khargi is able to assume any human or animal form. The transformation and reconstitution of the shaman through the doubling of his being and through the power of the deer or elk mother at the base of the tree recalls the transformative and reconstitutive power of the shaman's deerskin drum (Anisimov 1963: 183). 16 The turu, the tree which grows over or from the body of the deer or elk, is synonymous with clan origin: it marks the place of emergence from the animal mother and the place where one passes to the upper or lower worlds. The tree is joined to the body of the Animal Mother; it "cradles" the soul of the shaman-to-be as if the latter were cradled in the womb of its mother. 17 At the same time, the actual birth of the shaman
"The fusing of bird and human retained in the shamanic ritual forcefully recalls the birdmen of the Selcnga River petroglyphs; cf. Okladnikov and Zaparozhskaya 1969. 1• Among the Evenk, the shaman's animal-mother, in the form of a cow-elk or reindeer doe, a bear, or a bird, is also called khargi (Anisimov 1958, 138). 17 This belief, with slight variation, is common to many Siberian peoples; cf. Anisimov 1958, 83-84.

his passage from cradle to reappearance in an anthropomorphic formdepends upon a larger conceptual transformation in the myth of shamanic selection. The tree is reformulated as a tent ofreindeer skins, the Animal Mother appears as the old woman of the tent, and the spirit ancestors who had perched on the branches of the tree are transformed into the old woman's kinsmen (Anisimov 1963: 183). 18 Anisimov has convincingly argued that this process of shamanic selection and rebirth recapitulates the transformation of a totemic system based upon an animal mother into a shamanism which reduced the totemic object to a cult object and which transformed the animal source into an anthropomorphic form (Anisimov 1958). Similarly, the assimilation of the turu, the sacred clan tree, to the central pole of the shaman's tent effectively wrests power from the clan and the animal mother, and relocates it in the persona of the shaman. The complex staging that accompanied the Evenk shamanic ritual reflects the process by which earlier, independent powers associated with concepts of clan origins were reformulated to serve the shamanic cult. The staging would include setting the symbolic clan tree marking the clan lands within the shaman's tent and erecting around the tent wooden replicas of female spirits and tribal deities-stag, elk, bear, and fish-that served as the shaman's animal helpers (Anisimov 1963). In this reconstruction of the significant universe, the center of the shaman's "world" (the tent) was identified with the clan tree, turu, and the shaman was assisted by animal helpers which had formerly had greater, even independent power. The compression of distinct historical stages within the development of a belief system and the accompanying tension which, over time, emerges between human and animal, male and female, are also reflected in the Evenk concept of the cosmic elk, Kheglen (Anisimov 1958: 6872). Kheglen is identified with the Big Dipper (Great Bear) constellation; since the Little Dipper (Little Bear) is said to be Kheglen's calf, it is clear that Kheglen is a cow elk of gigantic proportions. Kheglen and her calf are said to go into the thickets of the heavenly taiga during the day and to reappear at night. Nightly, the movement of the constellations recapitulate a great hunt. According to most recent versions of the tale, Kheglen is followed by three hunters, represented by the three stars of the Dipper's handle: a Russian (the furthest from the elk-dipper), a Ket, and an Evenk right behind her. The Milky Way represents the hunters'
18 The elements of this myth, including the reindeer tent as the tree and animal spirits, reemerge in the organization of the Evenk shaman's tent at the time of his or her ecstatic journey.

tracks. Every night the Evenk overtakes Kheglen and kills her; but the next night her calf reappears as Kheglen and the hunt is repeated (Anisimov 1963: 161-162). Among the petroglyphs from the Stone Island on the Angara river is a representation of a man on skis following closely behind a cow elk. Okladnikov and Anisimov have concluded that this scene, dating by style to the Neolithic period, refers to the nightly hunt after Kheglen (Okladnikov 1966: pis. 38-39; Anisimov 1958: 3436).19 In what is certainly an older version of the myth, the cosmic Kheglen ran out of the heavenly taiga and impaled the sun on its antlers, carrying it back into the taiga thicket and bringing darkness to the world. To save the world from this darkness, the hero, Main, pursued Kheglen and finally killed the elk at midnight. In taking the sun from Kheglen, Main restored day to the middle world, but he himself was not able to leave heaven. Thus Main is fated to repeat his pursuit every night (Anisimov 1963: 162-163). Within this legend, the great elk Kheglen has both male and female aspects. It is antlered, but it is also accompanied by its calf. In the aspect of antlers may be found, perhaps, a later addition or a conflation of cow elk and cow reindeer, the only female cervid to carry antlers. Furthermore, the antlers may refer to the tension between an archaic female center and an evolving emphasis on a male-centered social order, represented here by Main. Within the perpetual reiteration of the hunt, the conflict between the human hero and the animal female for control of the sun remains unresolved. In a still older version of the Main-Kheglen myth, according to Anisimov, the hunter takes the form of the bear, Mangi, who nightly pursues and devours the sun-elk of the Great Dipper. Anisimov points out that in Evenk, mangi means not only "bear," but also "spirit of the ancestors, "master of the lower world," and "devil" (Anisimov 1963: 164). In this respect, the bear and the elk appear as the most significant cosmic animals, but the bear embodies a complex duality and plays the role of the challenger to the primary animal, the cosmic elk. These patterns of meaning recall the complex relationships of bear and female humans within the wide spread Siberian bear cult. Like many Siberian peoples who lived in proximity to great rivers, the Evenk believed that the soul of the deceased would be transported by the shaman down the river to the land of the dead, but that the shaman must
19 It is curious that among the thousands of representations of cow elk dating to the Baykal Neolithic and gathered from the Lena, Angara, upper Yenisey and Tom' rivers, there is only one other instance, on the Tom' River, which may include a hunter on skis and cow elk (Okladnikov and Martynov 1972: plate opposite p. 70, no. 71).

obtain agreement from the mistress of the world of the dead (of the buni) if the soul is to be admitted there. Only with her agreement could the soul be transferred to the birch bark boat of the dead (Anisimov 1958: 78). The understanding that the river or road to the land of the dead is guarded by a woman is ubiquitous among Siberian peoples and may have deep roots in the Baykal Neolithic or Aeneolithic. The concept of the river as the path to the land of the dead may be particularly reflected in the petroglyphic images of boats found along the rocky shores of the Lena, Angara, upper Yenisey and Tom' rivers, which were referred to in Chapter IV. Like the Evenk, the Nanay and the Nivkh believe that the guardian of the land of the dead is a woman (Anisimov 1963: 167-168). Among the Orochey, a small nationality related to the Evenk, instead of a single mistress of the universe who both devours and gives birth to souls, at the center of the cosmogonic process are two old women in the form of a tigress and a bear. They live on opposite sides of the moon land, one along the Tiger River and the other along the Bear River. These animal mothers nurse the spirits of future humans and animals and toss them up to the middle world. When the animals and people die, their spirits return to the old bear and tigress and the cycle begins anew (Anisimov 1963: 180).20 The Evenk cosmogonic myths are not unique. Throughout the Siberian mythic tradition, one finds an insistent reference back to ancient traditions by which the original progenitor is a female animal, an animalwoman, or a being with aspects of both women and animals. According to a Nganasan shamanic tale, to obtain the powers essential to his functions, the shaman followed a long road ending at a tent on a high hillock. Inside the tent were two naked women covered with reindeer hair and wearing reindeer antlers. The fire between them on the tent's hearth was like the rays of the sun. From these reindeer-women the shaman received the wild and domesticated deer and the hairs necessary for his shaman's cloak (Anisimov 1963: 186). In this case the generative sources are clearly half-human, half-animal. The association of the animal mothers with the fire of the sun and thus with the sun itself parallels the association of the cosmic Kheglen who carries the sun on its antlers. It also offers a parallel to the pan-Siberian association of the
20 Shamanic songs frequently refer to the river as the road of the shaman's journey back to the land of the dead. In one Evenk shaman song published by Vasilevich, for example, the shaman is challenged at successive waterfalls as he makes his way down to the place where the river enters the lower world and the locus of"little mother-night" (Vasilevic [Vasilevich] 1968: 352-359).

sun and fire with female deities. 21 In another Nganasan tale, the shaman makes his way to a swamp where he finds naked women covered with the hair of deer and wearing antlers. From these animal mothers come forth the wild and domesticated deer by which the Nganasan will live (Anisimov 1963: 187). Here again, within a setting charged with the force of creation-a swamp within the tundra, a place of rich sustenance for reindeer and elk-appears the vision of the ancestor in the form of an animal-woman. In both cases, the deer-women are the center of the life-giving universe and the source of life itself. Their location at the end of the shaman's journey serves also as a metaphor for the great antiquity of this rich conception. For all the wealth of imagery surrounding these shamanic visions, however, one senses the loss of power once accorded the original Animal Mother. These animal-women are successors to more ancient concepts lodged in the Evenk bugady enintyn, the giant elk who devours and gives birth,who lies at the base of the clan tree, and whose antlers become the tree itself. A still later formulation of cosmogenesis is represented by the Ket duality of Khosedam and Tomam. Khosedam, associated with the wild reindeer and having the footprints of an animal, was the source of putrification and death, the one who ate souls in order that they may be reborn. Only after a sojourn in Khosedam's womb could the souls return to earth in a new generation (Anisimov 1958: 80). Her complement was Tomam, the source of the bird-harbingers of spring. With the bodies of women but the powers and aspects of animals, they together reiterated the cycle of birth and death referred to by spring-summer and fall-winter. They represent yet another reformulation of the concept lodged in the image of the Evenk buny enintyn, who lay at the base of the clan tree.
D. THE KET AND KET MYTHIC TRADITIONS
The Ket are an almost extinct nationality inhabiting the middle Yenisey River between the mouth of the Sym to the mouth of the Kureyka rivers. They are also found along the lower Podkamennaya Tunguska River and throughout the length of the Yeloguy River. The Ket live primarily by hunting and fishing. They use reindeer for winter transport but they do not ride them. Indeed, there is much to indicate that a reliance on domesticated reindeer has been acquired relatively recently, perhaps from contact with Samoyedic neighbors (Alekseyenko 1969). Accord

198 IN SEARCH OF THE ANIMAL MOTHER
ing to the census of 1926-27, only 1428 Ket existed, of whom 1225 retained knowledge of the Ket language. The language of the Ket is related to a number of now-dead languages-Assan, Aris, Kott, and Pompokol; thus the remaining Ket are virtually the last of what was once a group of related peoples in northern Siberia, all of whom are believed to have moved into that region from the south (Levin and Potapov 1956: 687-700; Jakobson 1957: 222). Ethnographers have long suspected that the Ket originally lived considerably further to the south, in the region of the Sayan Mountains. In their mythology are found references to an event long ago when they were attacked by a more powerful people and forced to move north across a great divide, possibly referring to the Sayan Ridge. One of the major positive figures in Ket mythology, Tomam, is said to live in the far south, on the upper Yenisey. The Ket association ofTomam with lifegiving warmth and migratory birds suggests a now muted memory of cultural origins. Now extinct peoples to whom the Ket were relatede.g., the Arin and the Kott-were reported in the seventeenth century to be still practicing traditions which indicate a southern source: stock breeding and some agriculture and iron smelting (Levin and Potapov 1956). Vaynshteyn, among others, has pointed to the fact that the outer cloak of the Ket-full, straight in cut, crossing from right to left and secured by a belt-is similar to that ofthe Central Asian khalat (Vaynshteyn 1951). The most convincing indicators that the Ket came from a region much further to the south, possibly from the area of the Sayan Ridge, are offered through linguistics. Dul'zon has pointed to shared elements in Ket and Caucasian which must indicate an ancient association, going back at least 4000 years, when the two groups may have been in significantly close contact. Moreover, many close elements between Ket and related but dead languages of northern Siberia (Assan, Arin, Kott, Pompokol) as well as apparent connections with the language of the Xiongnu ("Huns") strengthen the premise that the Ket must have originated in southeastern Siberia, between the upper Irtysh and the upper Yenisey (Dul'zon 1968a, 1968b; Pulleyblank 1963, 1983). Toponymes of Ket derivation within the Krasnoyarsk Krai and in the region of Tomsk and Kemerovo appear to trace the movement of the Ket out of the area of the upper Yenisey and Irtysh to their present region (Dul'zon 1962b).22 Several scholars have suggested that during the

Tagar and Tashtik periods, in the late first millennium B.C., the Ket inhabited the Minusinsk Basin. With the influx of a people known in Chinese sources as the Dinlin, some of the proto-Ket stayed in the Minusinsk Basin and over generations mixed with the newcomers; others moved north, up the Yenisey River (Vaynshteyn 1951; Nikolaev 1960).23 From the mixture of that migratory group with the autochthonous peoples north of the Krasnoyarsk region emerged the forebears of the Samoyedic peoples, including the Nenet, Nganasan, Enet, and Selkup; the Mansi and Khantsi (Ostyak); and the Yenisey Ket and now extinct related groups (Prokof'ev 1940).24 Like the mythic traditions of all Siberian peoples, those of the Ket may be roughly separated into three general types: traditions which center on personal and household protective deities considered essential to the well-being of a social unit; traditions which refer to mythic figures whose powers and realms transcend concerns for daily well-being and the geographical specificity of tribal lands; traditions which center on shamanic figures and interweave the heroic exploit with shamanic functions. All three areas of myth are constantly interwoven, and within all three traditions, vehicles of power continually reaffirm the interconnection between individual human well-being and the events which govern the perceived universe. In excavating the layers of belief making up this tripartite mythic universe, one finds much that indicates that the most archaic layers-those going back to the most ancient roots-are embedded in traditions which refer to personal and household protective deities. The great personages who make up the Ket mythic universe and who explain the positive and negative aspects of existence are unquestionably later developments, the accumulated result of a centuries-old impulse toward the heroic and the epic. Those mythic figures also offer a glimpse back into an archaic past, one which preceded the emergence of heroic figures, male gods, and the most recent tradition of the shamans.

23 Dolgikh has argued for a relationship between Ket and ancient Karasuk burial ritual, albeit not convincingly (Dolgikh 1961). 24 One may note in this respect that there are significant parallels between the mythic tradition of the Ket and that of far northern Samoyedic peoples such as the Entsi, Nentsi, and Nganasan, suggesting a greater proximity in the past (Prokof'eva 1953).

figures in terms of interactive structures (Ivanov and Toporov 1965, 1969; cf. Anuchin 1914; Alekseyenko 1976). Atthe highest level, above the highest of the seven levels of heaven, dwells Es. He is associated with thunder, storm clouds, heaven and the sun; his sacrificial animal is a wild reindeer. Es is in many respects an otiose god; his very being and the manner in which he reflects a monotheism centered on a male god may indicate ancient impulses from Indo-European traditions or more recent impulses from Russian Christianity (Ivanov and Toporov 1969: 149150). Paired with Es is Kales, the embodiment of evil. For all his potential power, however, Kales is invoked primarily in curses; the obscurity of his power suggests that he may once have been joined with Es, and that the present unbalanced duality reflects a more ancient unity. A similar duality, but one of far greater color and elaboration may be found in the positive and negative female figures of the second level. These include Tomam and Khosedam, embodiments also of well-being, on the one hand and of destruction on the other. Like Es, Tomam is associated with the sun: with the south, with warmth, with the return of life to the frozen north in the form of birds. Tomam invokes the renewal oflife and fertility. It is said that she lives far to the south, where the edge of earth and heaven are joined by an opening. That southern land, where even iron glows red, is too warm for people but good for birds. In spring she is said to stand on a cliff over the upper Yenisey. She shakes her arms and from her sleeves emerge the feathers of the geese, swans, and ducks which will fly to the north, to the lands of the Ket. It is to "mother Tomam" that the migratory birds are said to return every fall (Alekseyenko 1976: 88-89). It is precisely this association of Tomam with the upper Yenisey which has suggested to many scholars a poeticized memory of southern lands from which the Ket migrated long ago. For all the beauty and lyricism lodged within the imagery ofTomam, it is Khosedam who cuts the most powerful figure within Ket mythology and the one who appears to intersect most frequently with the figures above and below her in the cosmic structure. Khosedam lives in the north: she is said to inhabit a cold island in the mouth of the Yenisey. She is the source of the cold, fever, and sickness which brings on death and she is said to devour the souls of people and retain them in her womb until they are ready to be reborn. Khosedam' s name refers both to herself as mother (am /aem ) and as old woman. Through her female aspect her existence is joined by marriage and blood to the existence of other mythic figures. At one time in the distant past, Khosedam was the wife

of Es; she left either of her own volition or was forced to leave. 25 Her daughter, apparently the offspring ofEs, is the wife of Dokh, Khosedam' s major protagonist. Khosedam is joined to the heroic figures of the third level, Alba and Dokh, who are sometimes also considered to have been the first shamans. Alba is often referred to as the "first man," and as the hero-creator of the Ket world. It was Alba who freed the human souls consumed by Khosedam. His stay in this world ended with a great journey-one might say, the paradigmatic shamanic journey-from south to north down the Yenisey, and from earth to heaven. Dokh, by contrast, is fated to repeat his journey from south to north, along with the birds which emerge from Tomaro' s sleeves. In his annual return to the south, to the upper Yenisey, Dokh is joined with Tomaro, but his recurring battles with Khosedam draw him to the far north. Just as Dokh's existence is drawn between south and north, so his life is bound by forces of good and evil. He is associated with Es as a positive force; both figures are connected with Heaven and the sun, with whom Dokh is sometimes said to have been joined within marriage (Ivanov and Toporov 1969: 155). At the same time, Dokh was driven from Heaven by Es who was offended by the ritual impurities of Dokh's wife, the daughter of Khosedam. At every turn, Dokh's existence is thus qualified by the character and power of Khosedam. Within this complex relationship are echoed ancient tensions between an archaic understanding of the cosmos organized by reference to a omnipotent, unvanquishable, and complex female principle on the one hand, and, on the other, a social and political order centered on human energy and order, particularly on that of males. Below Alba and Dokh are ranged a series of other figures: lesser heroes; the indwelling spirits of the natural world; the spirits or deities of sun, moon, and stars; the protective spirits of the family hearth and the individual. Many of these spirits echo the bipolarity of positive and negative articulated in the Es/Kales, Tomam/Khosedam constructions. The levels of power which these nature and household spirits represent continually intersect to reaffirm a world which is totally invested with supra-human elements. In the last analysis, that world is characterized by an overarching distinction between that which is Ket and that which is non-Ket. Of all the deities and heroes traced within the Ket folkloric tradition,
25 This tradition, as well as the tradition of sacrificing reindeer to Khosedam, suggests an ancient unity, in some form, of Es and Khosedam; cf. Ivanov and Toporov 1969: 150-152.

however, the most powerful imagery and fluid presence is centered on the figure of Khosedam-on her raging malevolence, her black tent in the north, her sled of destruction. This complex figure seems to have had an unending vitality within the mythic tradition. She is human in form, but she leaves animal prints behind her in the snow. Her lifetime is described in terms of continual battle. She is at once the former wife and constant opponent of Es, but to her, too, is owed the sacrificial reindeer of Es. She is the mother-in-law of Dokh, but she is also his arch enemy. Khosedam's daughter is the offspring of Es and she shares with him an association with the sun. Through that daughter, Khosedam emerges as the motherof the sun, but also as the motherof the defiler of Heaven. She sends putrification to the world and swallows human souls, but it was she who, harried by the first hero, Alba, vomited the souls back onto earth. More than Es, Khosedam thus reveals the complexities of an original creator: life-giving mother and death-bringing hag, the source of both birth and putrification/death. By comparison to Khosedam, Kales is a weak opposite to Es, a figure seemingly stuck onto the god of Heaven for symmetry. Alba and Dokh are both positive figures, two variations of the heroic. Within the upper layers of the Ket cosmic structure, only Khosedam and Tomam appear to be clearly drawn opposites: in function, in imagery, in geographical reference (north/south, lower/upper Yenisey), and in time and condition (summer/winter, warmth/cold). One senses that both figures point back to an archaic unity in which were joined the powers of life and death, ofearth and the underworld. One also senses that in the vivid powers and imagery accorded Khosedam and Tomam is revealed an original layer, one preceding and ultimately ousted by the more muted figures of Es and Kales. That layer was female in character and function; its unity organized the significant space (south/north) of the Kets' river-bound universe and the significant periods of their lives (summer/winter, life/sickness, birth/death). At some unclear period, this dominant female center was deposed from its first rank by male gods-one positive but increasingly otiose, the other negative but weakly defined. At the same time, perhaps, the female unity was gradually split apart into positive and negative, into Tomam and Khosedam. In that duality, however, were retained the most fundamental existential polarities affecting human society. In the power of imagery surrounding both figures, but particularly in that of Khosedam, are revealed the tell-tale traces of the archaic source of the Ket and their mythic tradition. Below Es/Kales, Tomam/Khosedam, Alba and Dokh, exist the shamans and lesser spirits. Just as in folklore the fates of the first

shamans, Alba and Dokh, are bound up in battle with Khosedam and in the eternal journey to the place of her tent, the north, so too are the fates of the lesser heroes and shamans entangled by the whims and power of Khosedam. Within the Ket folkloric tradition the traces of an archaeology of myth and belief are preserved. Those traces take the form of tales which reiterate the feats of shamans, the beneficence of Tomam, and the destructive sallies of Khosedam. In their references to the everyday world or mortals, the tales defuse an underlying tension between the power of elemental forces to wreak havoc in human lives and the neverending attempts of humans to hold back those forces. Dominating those elemental forces is the archaic figure of Khosedam. Demoted and demonized, it is primarily she and, to a lesser extent, her sister, who turns the wheel of the year and human lives, who prompts the annual journey of Dokh and the never-ending shamanic search for sick and wandering souls. Beneath the mythic structure headed by Es and beneath the shamanic tradition, the Ket universe is clearly charged through with powers located in a female source of life and death. Over the millennia, that source has been elaborated in specific figures of highly vivid aspect and actions and in tales of conflict and heroism. Beneath those elaborations, however, the original source and its association with the organizing principles of the Ket world are still clearly discernible: the Yenisey and its tributaries; the sun, moon, and stars; the cardinal directions and the seasons of the year. Finally, the association of birds and Tomam, and of reindeer and Khosedam, root the ultimately zoomorphic character of the primary deity within the aspect of bird and deer (Alekseyenko 1977: 3233).26 The river which joins the locus of both figures, Tomam and Khosedam, recapitulates the journey of Dokh, the first shaman. In recapitulating that journey, the river becomes equivalent to the Cosmic Tree by which the Evenk worlds are joined and to the Cosmic Tree which is replanted in the maternal swampland of the Selkup between two rivers. In the persona of the Tomam/Khosedam duality, what had been inextricably bound together into a single sign of the cycle of birth, sickness, death, and rebirth was torn apart and redistributed to a locus of beneficence and a locus of evil. To those now opposed aspects of being were
26 In the east grows the sacred tree of Es, and in its branches on the east side are placed the bones of animals in order that they may be reborn. It is possible that these considerations are reflected in the manner in which Minusinsk stelae, deer stones, and the organization of khereksur complexes appear to refer to the East as the main direction.

attached symbolic qualifiers by which humans could organize their world. Tomam came to represent the south, warmth, spring, the lifegiving birds. Khosedam was bound forever to the frozen north, barren islands, ice, sickness, death. Khosedam retained enough ambivalent elements, however, to recall her earlier, richer existence. Her bird, the grebe, referred both to the upper world and to that below the waters. She bought death, but only through a sojourn in her body may a soul be reborn. Her raging, ferocious character continually draws the attention and poetic imagination of frail humans. Perhaps more than any other aspect of her character, it is this ability to attract and hold human poetic imagination that suggests something of Khosedam's original, all-powerful self.
E. THE ORIGINS OF SHAMANISM AND THE PREFIGURING OF SHAMANISM
WITHIN EARLY NOMADIC SYMBOLIC SYSTEMS
The preceding discussion has suggested that shamanism was a relatively late development in Siberian religious beliefs and practices. There has been no successful attempt, however, at dating the actual appearance of shamanism as it is known today. Vasilevich, following Okladnikov, associates the emergence of shamanism with the Neolithic-Aeneolithic periods and specifically with the Baykal Glazkov culture. In burials from that period the differentiation in status, wealth, and function which Vasilevich believes indicates the appearance of a shamanic tradition may be found(Vasilevich 1969; Okladnikov 1950). Other scholars find persuasive evidence for the existence of Siberian shamanism during the Bronze Age. They point for evidence to such painted and carved images as the horned figures of the Tom', Angara, and upper Yenisey complexes as well as to the masks of Mugur-Sargol in Tuva (Devlet 1978, 1980, 1988). There is no good reason, however, why distinctions in burial wealth should necessarily indicate a class of individuals who hold the extraordinary power which we associate today with the shamanic function, and there is no way of knowing whether rock representations of horned figures actually refer to a socially defined shaman. It is entirely possible, for example, that the antlered or feathered headdresses of modem shamans derive from another early tradition, one which could not be defined as "shamanic" in the sense of "psychopomp." Anisimov's study ofEvenk religion uses the archaeology of ethnography to demonstrate that shamanism could have emerged only with the disintegration of a matriarchal social order. The specific local and clan

totemic deities, expressed in terms of animal mothers (totems), gradually became subordinated to the idea of family and tribal deities associated with a male-centered social order. The clan totems retained their zoomorphic character, at least in part, but they were dispatched to serve as spirits of the lower world, of the ancestors, and as spirit helpers of the shamans. According to Anisimov, the rise of shamanism thus coincides with the profound change from a matriarchal to a patriarchal social order (Anisimov 1958, 1963). Anisimov speculates that within the area of the Prebaykal, the homeland of the Evenk, this change occurred during the Neolithic-Aeneolithic period; that is, at the point when burials shifted from an orientation towards the rising sun to an orientation towards the river. The former orientation was a sign of the supremacy of a matriarchal clan order, Anisimov argues, while orientation to the river indicates the appearance in religious belief of the idea of the clan river along which the shaman must conduct the soul of the dead to the land of the ancestors. The appearance of boat images among the Neolithic and Aeneolithic rock representations signals the emergence of the concept of the river of the dead and thus the emergence of shamanism. While Anisimov's theory of social development has a convincing logic, particularly within the context of his superb analysis of Evenk religion, it remains ideal and unverifiable. The fact remains that we define shamanism in terms derived from the observation of the institution known only in the last few hundred years. The function most central to the role of the shaman-the ecstatic journey-leaves no material traces in burials; its existence could be known only through the records of a written tradition. While there is nothing to indicate that the gowns, drums, and headdresses which are the mark of the "modern" Siberian shaman can be duplicated in burials of the Bronze or early Iron Ages, there is also no way of knowing whether there may have been other implements, unrecognizable as such to us, which would have signaled the burial of a shaman and the existence of shamanism. There is good indication that the shaman as psychopomp existed as an institution in southern China by the late first millennium B.C. The songs from the late Zhou state of Ch'u refer to wu (shamans) and to ecstatic flights ofa shamanic nature. If one were to agree with Eliade that central to the institution of shamanism is the role of psychopomp, then neither on the basis of textual or archaeological evidence is it possible to maintain that the shaman as psychopomp existed within ScythoSiberian culture. The absence of shamanism from that culture--even within its South Siberian branches-would suggest that North Asian

shamanism had not yet evolved into a widespread and relatively uniform cultural tradition by the late first millennium B.C., or at least not in a form recognizable to modern observers. The term saman or shaman is not universally used by those Siberian peoples among whom shamanic traditions are recognized, but whether the term is kam, kham, or oium, in every case the term refers to an individual, male or female, invested with powers to intervene on behalf of individuals or on behalf of the group to control suprahuman powers. Some kind of shamanism seems to have emerged within Central Asia by the middle of the first millennium A.D. In 568 A.D., the Byzantine emissary to the Turkic Kagan recorded that his embassy was visited by individuals who claimed an ability to control fortune, ward off evil spirits, make fire, and who made use of bells and drums in their incantations. In the Tang chronicles, the term kam is used with reference to individuals with unusual powers among the Yenisey Kirgiz (Potapov 1978b: 12-13). In one of the early Turkic Yenisey inscriptions, there is reference to a ritual similiar in kind to the shamanic kamlenie , even if the term kam or shaman is not used (Potapov 1981: 124-125). The term shaman (saman ), used by Russian emissaries of the Tsar to the Chinese court, appeared only in the seventeenth century with reference to shamans within Tungus society (Potapov 1978b: 7). In drawing on ethnographic traditions to explain the visual images and structures of Neolithic, Bronze and early Iron Age Siberia, the general practice has been to use whatever materials seem to fit the situation. Because of its visibility and theatricality, shamanism has been most frequently turned to in order to explain the strange or the unusual. In using shamanic elements to explain archaeological facts, however, scholarship routinely ignores the essential fact: that the date of the emergence of shamanism is absolutely unclear. Scholars of Neolithic, Bronze, and early Iron Age archaeology regularly refer to symbolic objects and systems as "shamanic," as if one could assume that the societies of those periods were already shamanic in organization and substance. Thus, as has been noted, the frontal figures on petroglyphs and even the deer stones themselves have been seen as signs of the shaman, or of shamanic power; masks have been understood as the sign of shamans. Battling animals have frequently been interpreted as marks of the conflict between shamans (Dioszegi 1952). Support for such an interpretative strategy depends, however, only on analogy and inference. Aside from the masked images or horned figures or the battling animals of Early Nomadic art, one finds no other potential signs of

shamanism anywhere within the Siberian Neolithic, Bronze or early Iron Age context: no drums, no costume, none of the paraphernalia associated almost universely with "modern" shamans. On the other hand, modern ethnography makes clear that strange images, half-human, half-animal, may "stand for" deities who were ascribed with having human form or as being half-human, half-animal. Such beings were given both human and animal form in the cults, such as those dedicated to the bear. Admittedly, the absence of burials marked as those of shamans by the preservation of shamanic paraphernalia is not good evidence against the institution of shamanism. Ethnography indicates that in Siberian societies which retain shamanic traditions to the present day, the bodies and instruments of shamans were frequently disposed in such a manner that there would be no lasting remains. If able to select their burial place, shamans would prefer isolated, unvisited areas. They might be actually buried, but more frequently they seem to have been placed in wooden structures directly on the ground, or on raised platforms, or their wrapped bodies would be placed directly on the platforms themselves. The drum, gown, and headdress of the shaman would typically be placed within the wooden structure, or draped over it, or even hung on a tree nearby. In any of these instances, time and weather would rapidly dispose ofany traces ofthe shaman and of his belongings (e.g., D'yakonova 1975: 72-84). Given the ephemerality of such objects, one must conclude that there is nothing either to confirm or to deny the appearance of shamanism as we know it, at any time within the archaeological record. The Siberian shamanism revealed by modern ethnographic research involves a number of distinctive social elements. The purposes and practices of a shamanic tradition are similar to those of a priestly tradition. Shamanism is founded on the belief that approach to higher, more powerful forces in the universe-ancestors or gods-requires the assistance of a specially chosen intermediary, one marked by his or her sensibilities and intelligence. Conversely, the success of the intermediary is dependent on social acceptance and reaffirmation of the shaman's unique ability to intercede on behalf of society. The institution of shamanism thus implies a willingness to cede power to a single individual. In so far as that function has to do with issues of life and death, the shaman's powers may be even more "powerful" than the privileges and authority ceded by society to its political leaders. Shamanic cults thus reflect a society which has accepted and reaffirmed the location of unusual power within the hands of a single individual. At the same time, the act of locating such powers in a single individual catalyzes ambiva

lent responses from those who depend on the shaman for matters of intense significance. Hence the fact that in many societies the shaman is held somewhat apart; shamans are forced to defend their territory against other shamans, figuratively if not literally; and the power of the shaman is invested as much in destructible objects-his or her gown, drum, or drumstick-as in the person. Until the existence of shamanic institutions can be determined by clearer evidence than the petroglyphic images of masks or of horned figures, it is premature to explain the archaeological traces of Siberian Neolithic, Bronze and early Iron Age cultures with reference to shamanic practices known only from a relatively recent time. On the other hand, shamanism as understood through relatively recent ethnographic research has its own multi-layered accumulation of assumptions, implements, and practices. Indeed, a part of the function of the shaman has been to preserve in tale, song, and dance society's accumulated store of legends-the very stuff of its self-conciousness and the means by which it gave order to the world. Among Siberian peoples, the terms used to indicate the telling of tales also refer to shamanizing, thus locating the shaman at the center of the great tradition of oral legend and folktale. Furthermore, we have seen that the institution of shamanism arrogated to itself signs, symbols, and explanatory formulations from pre-shamanic beliefs and rituals in order to reaffirm its legitimacy and authority. In the particular case of the Ket and the Evenk, the materials of folktales and myths recounted by shamans and preserved in shamanic ritual represent the survival of beliefs which date from a pre-shamanic period. Like any other tradition within highly conservative cultures, Siberian shamanism must have emerged slowly, over generations and centuries. The forms manifested earlier in this century must be regarded as late refinements of considerably earlier and more complex traditions. Even if we cannot find specific indicators of shamanism within the archaeology of the Early Nomads or in that of any of their ScythoSiberian relatives, we are able to discern a number of elements which suggest at the least a prefiguring of shamanism and of its symbolic structures. Central to the institution of shamanism is the journey made by the shaman to the underworld or to the land of the ancestors, to recall the wandering soul of the sick or to accompany the souls of the dead and assure their non-return. The shaman undertakes this journey during the shamanic seance (kamlenie) and on behalf of his social group. The shaman's ability to complete the journey is dependent on the implements referred to earlier: a drum which serves as the shaman's steed; a robe and

headdress decked with imagery and amulets which at once protect, empower and transform the shaman, and a vertical axis, real or imaginary, which serves as the pole linking the underworld, earth and heaven. The latter might be, for example, the center pole of the shaman's tent, or a ladder, or a tree referring to the World Tree, or even an imaginary pole. Underlying the functions and implements of shamanism is the understanding that death is another stage of existence, an inversion of that known in this world, or a continuation of this existence, but in another far-off land: a land of the spirits, the ancestors, or the dead. Sickness denotes a wandering soul; death releases the soul from the body, with potentially destructive results for those who remain in life. As pyschopomp, the shaman travels between this world and the other. The shaman's transubstantiation depends upon an elaborate understanding of the manner in which forces of good and evil can become embodied in both human and animal shapes. By taking on the body of an animal double, or by mounting a specially empowered steed, and with the vigilant assistance of animal helpers, the shaman alone is able to seek the wandering soul of the sick, or to accompany the souls of the dead to made certain they do not return. The shaman's ecstatic journey presumes that the significant universe was formed in a system of layers ranged along a central pole, or World Tree. In poetic formulations, that arrangement might be articulated in terms of the flow of rivers (from south to north, or from above to below) or in terms of the cardinal directions, each of which is associated with forces of good or evil, life or death, and is bound to extensions of space and time.27 After the elaborate preparations for the shamanic kamlenie, the shaman signals the undertaking of his journey through the slow beginnings of drumming and dance. In the ensuing patterns of quickening movement and sound, the ideal order of the universe is reaffirmed and projected onto the phenomenal world. The projection of that order as a river marked by treacherous rapids or as the day marked by the rising and setting of the sun and moon functioned as the shamans' mapping out of the paths they would follow in their quest. No less effective as a map of the shamanic journey were the images painted on shaman drums. On a number of drum faces gathered from the Teleut, for example, suns and moons indicate the heavens in the upper part of the drum, while below

may be found reaffirmations of the earth. Connecting the two spheres are images of trees or of antler-like trees over which hover the figures of birds (S. V. Ivanov 1955). In this reaffirmation of order on a cosmic scale, the shaman confronted and responded to the potential chaos created by sickness and death. In search of the wandering soul and as psychopomp, the shaman's human form was ineffective. Through the ordeal of selection, the shaman lost his human body and learned the language of animals; through the donning of a special robe and headdress, the shaman was at once enveloped by the body of the Animal Mother and transformed into that body. In the course of the journey, the shaman would require the aid of animal helpers: to see, hear, and combat evil forces. Thus, shamanic empowerment was predicated upon a theory ofpotential physical change, as well as upon a conception of the universe which placed extraordinary powers in the being of animals. In seeking the traces of such theoretical assumptions within an ancient archaeology, one is dependent upon the appearance of coherent symbolic systems. We have seen that those coherent systems appear regularly in Scytho-Siberian archaeology: in the orientation of burial structures within organized cemeteries and in the regular placement of the dead, their furnishings, and their horses by reference to the cardinal directions and the movement of heavenly bodies. Moreover, throughout the Early Nomadic culture of South Siberia and Central Asia and throughout the larger Scytho-Siberian culture, the dead and the horses sacrificed with the dead were laid out in clothing and ornaments which conformed to specific and consistent understandings regarding imagery and order. Within that order, the body of the person or the horse was redefined in terms of a central vertical axis. The imagery associated with that axis, along its rise or symmetrically on either side of the rise, affirmed the association of axis with tree or with mountain, and of axis with wings, with antlers, or with horns. Dense and controlled, that imagery may have functioned to project the deceased and their horses onto an ordered passage from the realm of the living to that of the dead, along the path of a pole, a tree, or a mountain. At the same time, the signs of transformation reaffirmed the anticipation and process of transforma-tion which the dead would undergo with their animal helpers or in the bodies of animal doubles. While there is no firm basis in Early Nomadic archaeology for assuming that culture was shamanic, there are many indications that the Early Nomads organized their world around certain theoretical assump

tions which parallel principles underlying shamanic traditions in Siberia and Central Asia. Those assumptions include a human dependency on animals, and an understanding of being as essentially transformative, of death as a process of transformation and passage in space and time, and of that passage as one symbolized by a pole, a mountain, or a tree. They seem to have also included a conviction that the order of the universe was knowable and representable, and that it had to be reaffirmed in the rituals accompanying death. Whereas shamanic societies reserve the most articulate affirmation of those principles for the body and actions of the shaman, however, Early Nomadic society appears to have believed that at death each individual was necessarily and legitimately bound by the principle of transformation and enwrapped in the diagrams of universal order. Death was a potential tearing of the social fabric: a threat of chaos devolving on human society. The funerary arrangement of body and burial served as an opportunity to repair that tear, to reaffirm the ordered structure of the significant universe. Without a shaman, however, one cannot assume the existence of shamanism. It is at least a possibility that the powers accorded the modern shaman were originally lodged in all individuals and that the order invoked by the shaman was in that age still considered the anticipated deathright of each person. The symbolic structures arranged on the bodies of the Early Nomadic dead and on their horses perhaps foretell the symbolic structure underlying the shamanic journey, but they do not predict it. Conversely, the poetry and process of the shaman's journey offers undeniable parallels with zoomorphic imagery in the period of the Early Nomads, but the parallelism remains only suggestive. It is as if Bronze and early Iron Age beliefs and practices contained the seeds for the germination of shamanism. The symbolic and essential constructs uniting deer, tree, and bird, as well as the understanding of death as a process ofjourney and change, were gathered together into the rituals and paraphernalia of the shaman: in the deer/robe, deer/drum, and tree/staff with bird claws. What had been the focus of concern and attention by all members of a social group--the process of death and rebirth-seems at some time after the age of the Early Nomads to have become monopolized by a single individual, the shaman, as that figure is defined through modern ethnography.

To move from ethnography to archaeology requires a leap in imagination and a conviction that the symbolic structures encoded in Siberian mythic traditions have parallels within the material remains of long vanished cultures. Many scholars have made that shift with great ease, even with too much ease. In the process of making analogies between ethnographic materials gathered in recent decades and archaeological materials of the Bronze Age, some fundamental issues have been simply ignored. In fact, as this chapter has attempted to indicate and as some ethnographers have demonstrated, mythic traditions have their own archaeology just as surely as do the material remains of cultures. Only in a careful consideration of the possibility of parallel developments within the mythic tradition and within materials of archaeology can a cautious use of analogy pertain. The results of analogical analysis, however, must be predicated upon the understanding that any material remains-seemingly discrete, seemingly bound in time and space-mask a signification which is essentially an organic weaving of complex beliefs and symbolic imagery reaching back into many levels of time, and at each level varying in shape and substance. The Evenk concept of bugady and of the generative cow elk, bugady enintyn, and the split of the Ket's Khosedam(fomam must surely serve as indicators of meaning within the material remains of ancient South Siberian cultures. It was said above that both Anisimov and Okladnikov have argued that the great images of elk painted on the cliffs of the upper and middle Lena and dating back to the Baykal Neolithic period referred to concepts of the cosmic elk, Kheglen, or to the cow elk totemic mother, bugady enintyn. The cliffs on which the elk images appeared were, in effect, bugady : places marked by trees or stones which indicated the sacred and generative clan source, the point at which the three worlds describing the cycle of birth, death, and regeneration were figuratively joined (Anisimov 1958: 34-35). Both scholars have also found evidence for the significance of the hearth-fire in the archaeology of the Prebaykal Neolithic. In burials from that period, according to Okladnikov, females buried with bows and arrows suggest a social order which allowed female participation in a broad range of economic activities and a female pre-eminence within the household. Similarly, the finds of large and continuously used hearths from the Baykal Neolithic may also reflect a social organization focused on the household and particularly on the hearth fire (Okladnikov 1950: 263 ff; Anisimov 1958: 100).

hearth fires and that female-centeredness are distantly echoed in the panSiberian cult of the mistress of the fire. However it might vary in time and place, the Evenk concept of bugady suggests a rationale behind the persistent South Siberian appearance of specific places marked by sacrificial altars and stelae. Regardless of the specific culture to which it is attached-Altayic Turk, Paleosiberian, or Mongol-the shamanic cult also consists of layers which may be peeled back to an earlier, preshamanic level. The Evenk shamanic cult serves as a model for processes which may have occurred in cultures across South Siberia: it reflects a shift in significance from the primary animal mother, the cow elk or cow reindeer, to a preoccupation with the shaman assisted by now demoted animal helpers. The Ket organization of their universe and particularly the hierarchy described by Es, Khosedam{fomam, Alba and Dokh, also reflects an archaeology of belief: a process of demotion, denigration, splitting, and reassignment of values which ended in the apparent supremacy of the male god and the assignment of the most powerful negative elements to a female force. For all the effectiveness of that process of demotion and reassignment, however, the essential female aspect of the household cults and particularly of the all-important cult of the hearth-fire points back to a persistent, generative source which was female, animal, and the place marker and sign of clan identity. It is probable that the processes reflected in the Ket and Evenk mythic traditions, evolving over millennia, must also lay behind the elaborate stone structures of the Early Nomads and behind the enigmatic symbolic structures with which their dead and their horses were laid to rest.

CHAPTER EIGHT
ABSENCE AND PRESENCE The Deer Goddess of Ancient Siberia
At each stage of this investigation we have found a curious, elusive, fluctuating image. Although first cast in the shape of a female elk, her preeminance with the passage of time was replaced by an image halfhuman, half-animal, and certainly female. Carved onto the surfaces of monolithic stelae in the Minusinsk Basin, it is probably she, too, who emerges among the strange "feather-heads" on the grave slabs from Karakol and on the images from Tamgaly and Saimaly-Tash; indeed, it may be her presence which is acknowledged by the loop-headed figures at Karakol and Shalabolin. The strange bird-women of Kalbak-Tash and Chuluut Gol are most likely another of her many aspects. Female in gender and associated by her signs and placement with life and death, she disappeared in the Bronze Age, only to reappear in the guise of a cow and deer. As a cow, she derived from a tradition which earlier had crowned her with horns, and as a deer she derived from the northern tradition which earlier had given her the body of an elk. As a deer she also came to dominate the iconography of the late Bronze Age, carved ubiquitously on rock walls and boulders or wrapped around monolithic figures of the emerging male hero. She entered the age of the Early Nomads as a recumbent deer, more rarely as a standing deer. Ultimately, however, her fate was obscurity: burdened by overelaboration, smothered under the press ofpredatory animals, her animal form was finally dismissed by the increasing fascination with human imagery and realism. At the very end of the Scytho-Siberian period, she assumed the guise of a woman seated before a male holding a rhyton, but as woman she is finally eclipsed, her invisible presence only referred to by a male figure. Where one might have expected to find the reaffirmation of a supreme male god, heroized male ancestors, or solarized warriors, is instead found their contradiction: a female animal; a monstrous female head; a deer twisted under the grasp of a wolf or cat. It was that image which centered the axis carried by the Early Nomads and their horses to the land of the dead. Reformulated as a bird, caprid, branches of a tree, or the shape and substance of a woman, the metamorphic deer of the Early Nomads established the center of a bilateral symmetry around which the

parable of animal predation was enacted again and again. Horns, antlers, wings, and branches were its sign and the reaffirmation of the axial center. But who or what was the entity behind that fluid image? What was the significance of the symbolic systems for which that image served as both source and center? And by which threads can that image and its symbolic context be connected with the much more archaic images of the Neolithic elk and Aeneolithic-Bronze Age horned and feathered women? The only early literary reference to the deities worshipped by the Scytho-Siberians comes from Herodotus. At the end of Bk. I of his Histories, he tells us that the milk-drinking Massagetae worship the sun, to whom they sacrifice horses (Herodotus [1954]: 101). From that terse phrase there is no way of knowing in what manner the sun was worshipped, or whether it was considered male or female. The historian's comments regarding the Scythian pantheon, however, are more detailed. In Bk. IV, we have seen, Herodotus writes that the chief deity of the Scythians was Tabiti, and was equivalent, he says, to Hestia. Together with Hestia he grouped Papaeus-the Scythians' Zeus-and his wife, Api, or Earth. Among Scythian deities of secondary importance Herodotus included Apollo (Oetosyrus), Aphrodite (Argimpasa), Heracles, and Ares, the only deity whom the Scythians honored by building structures. "It is not their custom," Herodotus asserts, "to make statues, or to build altars and temples, in honour of any god except Ares" (Herodotus [1954]: 260). It would be rash to accept without question what Herodotus writes and particularly his facile equivalencies. After a11, Herodotus looked at the world with the eyes of a Greek and measured what he saw according to Greek standards and Greek concepts. On the other hand, the historian's report that the chief deity of the Scythians' was female and that of the three most important deities, two were female, seems reliable. This structure, after all, was significantly different from the religious pantheon of the Greeks, just as the Scythian' s pantheon and cosmogony, as described by Herodotus, differed radica11y from the Greek pantheon and cosmogony. From Herodotus's account, we may conclude that the Scythians' chief deity was a goddess named Tabiti and that she shared some elements in common with-or reminded Herodotus of-Hestia, and that just below Hestia/fabiti in the religious hierarchy was a male and female generative couple, roughly equivalent to Heaven and Earth. 1
1 Within the Greek pantheon, Zeus was the pre-eminent god and the son-rather than the husband-of Earth/Gaea. Hestia played a relatively minor role: the eldest daughter of Kronos and Rhea, she was the protector of public and domestic hearths and the goddess of

The Greek pantheon to which Herodotus compared the Scythian deities represented a complex intertwining of pre-Hellenic and Near Eastern deities with Inda-European deities and concepts. Aphrodite (the Scythians' Artimpasa) is a case in point: she derived from a combination of a local cult goddess and the Near Eastern Ishtar, who was the result of a long, syncretic process. One must assume that the application of Greek names to Scythian deities would be at best only approximate, and that the Scythian connections with traditions rooted in Central Asia would markedly heighten the complexity of those figures referred to as "Hestia," "Zeus," and "Aphrodite." Artamonov has proposed that, within Scythia, the two goddesses, Hestia/Tahiti and Aphrodite/Argimpasa could be combined into a generalized primary goddess. When shown with the mirror, this primary goddess was identified in her Argimpasa aspect; when represented with an altar, however, it was her aspect as goddess of the hearth and fertility which was most significant (Artamonov 1961). Citing the historian's account of Scythian origins from the union of a snake-woman and Heracles, Artamonov associates the snake-bodied goddess represented on many late Scythian objects with Tahiti. There are two arguments against that position, however. It is only in the Pontic Greek version of Scythian origins that this snake-woman appears. Furthermore, the images of the snake-bodied maiden occur only in highly decorative representations, as if their value was primarily ornamental (Artamonov 1961: figs. 9, 12). In no case do the female representations convey the authority expressed by the seated females in the small plaques from Chertomlyk or even in the crude plaque from Merdzhana. One ends by suspecting that the figures of women with snake or leaf shaped bodies are of little significance in locating images of the Scythians' gods and goddesses. In contrast, the seated woman addressed or surrounded by males with rhyta clearly refers to a female of some importance and authority. It is interesting to note that there are no male images in the Scythian pantheon which are identifiable with a Zeus-like god. It is possible to discern two categories of female figures in late Scythian art. The first must include figures who may have referred to deities; the second group would include those figures who may have once referred to cultic deities but who by the fourth century had entered the domain of decorative elements. Within the former group, those

figures addressed or surrounded by male and female officiants, such as the images on the Chertomlyk, Karagodeuashkh, and Merzhdana plaques, would be included. The "queen" represented on the Novocherkassk crown may be a late variation on the same theme of a Scythian female deity. By contrast, within the surviving art of the Early Nomads there are virtually no images of human beings, and very few of women. The most important exception is the felt wall hanging from }:>azyryk 5. The significance of that hanging and its images increases when considered in relationship to collateral materials, both excavated and unprovenanced. The appearance of parallel images across the Scytho-Siberian world ends by supporting certain aspects of Herodotus' account. The Early Nomads and their relatives across Kazakhstan and the North Pontic region held in particular reverence a female deity who came to be represented in the headgear and garments of high ranking members of the nomadic world. Her spiritual domain probably included elements which were also associated with the Greek Hestia and Aphrodite: with human and animal fecundity, with the bounty of the earth, and with the protection of the hearth. She was almost invariably represented in a seated position, addressed by young male figures. The latter might be represented on horseback or in the company of a horse. In some cases, the male figures visibly carried goryti or other signs of warfare or the hunt. In other cases, however, no weaponry is visible. Rhyta and cups seem to have been as frequent a mark of the male figure's rank and respect as were weapons. The few remaining representations of male and females together indicate that the primary attributes of the women included rhyta, as well as post-like altars and branches or trees-none of which are associated with male figures. In addition, the Merdzhana plaque adds the intriguing element of a horse head hanging from the female's throne. The lateness of all these representations indicates that her incarnation in a visible, human form occurred only with the advent of human representation in the Scytho-Siberian imagistic tradition. On the other hand, the persistence of many other representational elements across the Scytho-Siberian world indicates that there was a shared and, thus, considerably more ancient understanding of this female deity than is indicated by the actual representational record. Other than the Scythians, within the Scytho-Siberian world the Yuezhi (Kushans) had the most extensive and recorded pantheon of female deities, many of whom reflect Iranian traditions. Sarianidi has identified Anahita-the Iranian ancestor of Aphrodite-as the principle goddess of the Yuezhi culture as attested to by the great finds at Tillya

Tepe. Represented as the mistress of animals and as a naked frontal figure, Anahita was the goddess of love, plants, fertility, and water (Sarianidi 1989: 121-123). On the coins of Kushan kings, Nana, a particular version of Anahita, is represented. Nana was a composite nature goddess derived from the Iranian Anahita and the ancient Mesopotamian deity Innana/lshtar. Her most distinctive attributes were a sword, reminiscent oflshtar's association with war, and a staff terminating in the protome of a horse or stag (Rosenfield 1967: 88). This last element lacks any precedent in Iranian traditions, but it recalls the horse head hanging on the throne of the woman in the Merdzhana plaque. It also seems to point back in the direction of the Siberian world of the nomads, or at least to that of the nomads beyond the settled agrarian lands. Before turning in that direction, however, it would be useful to briefly consider the ancient tradition of goddesses referred to by the Yuezhi pair, Anahita/Nana. As the last and the most elaborately represented of Scytho-Siberian female deities, their importance and that of their ancestral traditions cannot be minimized. At the same time, their combination of martial and erotic elements indicates a complexity which needs clarification if we are to understand the nature of the female figures in Scythian and Early Nomadic art. Clarification of the Near Eastern goddess tradition may also assist in the untangling of mythic elements attached to the Siberian image of the deer. As the goddess of love and war, Nana's roots may be traced back beyond Inanna/Ishtar to the fourth millennium B.C. and the first great deity of the Mesopotamian world, Ninhursag: the "lady of the stony ground"; the "lady of the foothills"; the "great mother-goddess"; perhaps even Mother Earth (Gimbutas 1989: 110; Kramer 1964: 148). Ninhursag was the first to establish the eight plants in the paradise of the gods; when Enki, the water god and god of wisdom had them cut so that he could eat them, the outraged Ninhursag placed the curse ofdeath upon him. She was thus associated with the gift oflife and the cause of death. Ninhursag, however, was also mistress of wild animals. In her function as birth-giver, she was known as Nintur, meaning the "lady of the birth hut," or ofthe cattle pen. In her association with cattle, Ninhursag/Nintur was the source oflife-giving milk; her presence was indicated by the cow pen and the pillars or posts which indicated the all-important entrance derness in the lovely inlaid frieze from Al 'Ubaid, in which cows being nuzzled by their calfs are milked in the sacred cow pen, while on the other side of the gateway, marked by posts, the milk is being prepared (Hall 1927: pl. XXXI). Thus Ninhursag, the mother of the gods and humanity

and referred to as the mother of kings, could be characterized as a cow and referred to as a post and as the giver of milk (cf. Hall 1927: pl. 142). Her post thus refers to the entrance to a place of generation and sustenance. Ninhursag' s consort was Enlil, the lord of the storm. As he gradually acquired the power to protect and generate vegetation, he was more frequently envisioned as a bull whose image indicated the presence of the goddess (Jastrow [1911) 1971: 74-75). At Al 'Ubaid, one finds the reference to the life-giving force of the goddess in the form of cows, the copper bulls indicative of her fecundating presence and the cemeteries on the west side of the temple indicative ofNinhursag's association with the dead and with the power to restore life (Hall 1927: 143-146). In this regard, she was frequently represented seated in a boat which would transport her to the great city of Ur to renew her sacred marriage with the Moon god. The power of this most ancient and majestic goddess certainly resides within a complexity of functions, as well as in the variety of her symbolic forms. By the second millennium B.C., Ninhursag had been supplanted in absolute power by the male god, Enki. Her double powers over life and death were now embodied in the sisters Inanna and Ereshkigal, the goddess of death and gloom and ruler of the underworld. In other words, as Ninhursag-the giver of milk, life, and death-became challenged by a male god for pride of place, her realm became split between two females, sisters from the same mother. Inanna's Akkadian incarnation, Ishtar, is particularly clear. She was most frequently represented standing on a lion and wearing a girded robe and horned tiara, or seen driving a war chariot and carrying a bow, arrows, and a scimitar. As the queen of heaven, Ishtar was identified with Venus; her sign was the eightpointed star, usually embedded in a circle with rays extending beyond the perimeter. Ishtar was either accompanied by that sign or indicated by it; in the latter case, her sign was flanked by the crescent moon of Sin and the sun-disk of Shamash, the three signs together referring to the Heavens (cf. Pritchard 1954: figs. 518, 522, 526). Ishtar was not only associated with war and martial power; she was also considered the "protector of flocks...the merciful progenitor of mankind" (Jastrow [1911) 1971: 136); she appears with exposed breasts nursing her children. In the Gilgamesh epic, she is described as weeping for her offspring destroyed in the great flood. Either in combination with her consort Tammuz (the personification of the sun of the springtime"the first of Ishtar's lovers"-who was slain by her) or in combination

with Gilgamesh in the Gilgamesh epic, the pair represents sun and earth, "the combination of the two principles which bring about life; and upon their separation follow decay and death." In association with the sun god, she becomes "the light of heaven and earth," "the shining torch of heaven," light of all dwellings" (Jastrow [1911] 1971: 128). These associations probably derive from her connection with the sun god, as well as from her association with Venus. In association with both Tammuz and Gilgamesh, Ishtar is the passionate lady, but she also appears in these traditions as the earth which drains the sun of its energy. 2 Here, again, one encounters the contradictory, or complementary, aspects of early goddess figures, exemplified first in the supreme goddess Ninhursag. At any point in history, the emphasized aspect appears to have been closely connected with the political ambitions of the current ruler. For example, Ishtar's power as the goddess of war and victory was particularly pronounced in Assyria where Ishtar was revered as the lady of war and battles. Ashurbanapal's father, Esarhaddon, had restored her temple at Uruk, and when Ashurbanapal retook Susa, the capital ofElam, he restored the statue of Ishtar to the temple of E-Anna, from which it had been taken by the Elamites in 2300 B.C. (1635 yrs. earlier) (Jastrow [1911] 1971: 134-135). Under Ashurbanapal (who reigned 668-626 B.C.), Ishtar was often associated with Ashur, the war god, and the two deities were represented standing by the King in his battles, representing the duality of sun and earth. In one of his inscriptions, Ashurbanapal described how Ishtar appeared to him in a dream, armed with bow and sword and promising to lead the him into battle with the Elamites. Among the deities revealed in the Ras Shamra texts was Astarte (Ashtarte), yet another incarnation of Inanna/lshtar. She seems to have been associated in some significant but unclear way with Baal, the chief god. In Egypt, where she appeared as a foreign goddess, her image is clearer; she was represented as a nude figure on a horse, frequently holding the shield, spear, and bow of war. In the Ptolemaic period,, Astarte was referred to as the "lady of the horses and chariots," "repre-• sented by Sechmet standing on a chariot." Pritchard surmises that Astarte's association with the horse and war and herrole as patroness of war in both epithet and representation derived from being brought into Egypt by the Hyksos. As Ashtoreth in the Old Testament, the goddess may have carried some reference to the fecundity of flocks. She appears

as Ashtarte in Phoenician inscriptions only in the first millennium B.C.; although her cult is attested to throughout that millennium, she does not seem to have had a major place in the Phoenician pantheon (Pritchard 1943: 66-72).3 Second to Baal in importance were the two goddesses, Anat and Athirat, whom many believe to have been the biblical Asherah (Obermann 1948). Anat seems to have been a deity of ferocious passion and warlike temperament, unafraid of taunting and threatening her father, El, the supreme god of the pantheon before power shifted to Baal. In the case of Anat, as in that of Ninhursag and Ishtar, one finds associations with cows and cow horns; here, however, Anat is often referred to as a wild cow with "horns of strength" or as an "amiable Virgin" with "scourging horn" (Pritchard 1943: 77; Obermann 1948). Interestingly, she is never shown naked. Invoked by pharaohs as the daughter of Re, the mistress of heaven and the mother of rulers, Anat is also called a "woman being a warrior," a warlike goddess who sought revenge after being raped by the god Seth (Pritchard 1943: 80-81).4 Asherah appears in Palestinian South Arabic texts as a solar deity, the consort of the two moon-gods, Amm and Wadd (cf. Pritchard 1943: 6365). Pritchard believes that in the second millennium, in Syria and, perhaps, South Arabia, Athirat was the chief goddess; by the first millennium, however, her place was taken first by Ashtart, and then by Astarte. Until relatively recently, it was believed that Asherah was not a goddess; other attempts were made to identify her with Ashtart and Ishtar. Only with the Ras Shamra texts did it become clear that such a goddess had existed in the pantheon and that her existence was attested to in texts from many other sources. It is possible that at least a part of the difficulty in believing in her existence was due to the challenge she posed to the Yahwehists of the biblical period. The goddess Asherah was associated with the penetration of the Hathor cult into Syria - Palestine during the period of the Egyptian rule, and with the consequent merging of native Egyptian cults with those of Syria. By the tenth century B.C., Asherah was frequently represented as

In the Old Testament, Anal seems to have been associated only with place names and proper names. The popularity she enjoyed in the second millennium appears to have disappeared or been taken over by Ashtart, in the first millennium.

a naked pillar figure, her pronounced pubic triangle indicating her association with fertility. In Egypt and in some late Bronze Age materials from Syria, she appears with a lion and a tree. On the well-known Taanach cult stand from the tenth century, the goddess still appears in association with lions and trees (Hestrin 1987: 220-221). Like her sister goddesses of the Near East, Asherah of the Old Testament was a complex goddess, exemplifying the syncretism and intertwining of deities in Egypt and the Near East throughout the Bronze Age and well into the Iron Age. In her Qudshu form-naked, frontal, frequently carrying a lotus and wearing the horned Hathor wig-she symbolized beauty, grace, and erotic vitality, as well as fecundity. In the Ras Shamra texts she appears as the wife consort of the supreme god, El; in the biblical tradition, with reference to Yahweh, that position becomes ambivalent, contested, and contradicted. The full meaning of the Old Testament "Asherah" has been the subject of much debate. In some contexts, Asherah seems frequently to have referred to a post or a grove as the symbol of the goddess. She could be represented as a pillar of clay with breasts and head, the pillar thus referring to "the Asherah," or sacred tree, and the whole indicating the Mother Goddess or the Tree of Life, which gives nourishment and life (Hestrin 1987: 222-223).5 InDeuteronomy 16:21-22, reference is made to the nature of Asherah as a tree and a pillar, but this passage also documents the conflict between Asherah' s followers in her popular cult and the new religion centering on Yahweh:
You shall not plant any tree as an 'Asherah beside the altar of the Lord your God which you shall make. And you shall not set up a pillar, which the Lord your God hates.
In her association with trees and milk-giving, Asherah recalls the Egyptian goddess, Hathor, marked by her cow horns (the "Hathor wig") and frequently merged with a tree which kings would drink nourishment from. In the tomb of King Tuthmosis III, the pharaoh is represented drinking milk from Hathor, who is represented in the form of a sycamore tree. In this case, one finds the association of death, rebirth (through the

At the Geze site, with strata representing culture from the Bronze Age through the Hellenistic and early Christian periods, many terra-cotta figures of females, most naked and frontal, and of what Macalister calls the "Hathor-Ashtoreth" type, were found and dated by him to the late Bronze Age-early Iron Age.

milk of the nourishing goddess), and tree (Hestrin 1987: 219; Keel 1978: fig. 254; cf. Bisi 1967). Anahita was the last major incarnation of the great tradition of Near Eastern goddesses. She emerged as a significant goddess in the first millennium B.C. Gershevitch argues that she must have been purely Iranian in origin, since her name is not attested to in Indo-lranian texts, i.e., neither in the Mitanni treaty with the Hittites of the early fourteenth century, where the names of five gods including MithraNaruna are recorded, nor in the corresponding Rig Veda texts. Thus, neither she nor many of the other goddesses in the Iranian branch of the Indo-Iranian tradition seem to have been lndo-European in origin (Gershevitch 1959). Others believe that she was an amalgam of an Indo-Iranian deity and ancient Near Eastern goddess types. Anahita, meaning "immaculate," was the "goddess of celestial waters and fertility." This was the goddess who was known to the Scythians as Argimpasa, or, after Herodotus, as Aphrodite (Herzfeld 1947: 516,527; Masson 1959: 19). According to Herzfeld, Anahita was not associated with any specific earthly home: as the goddess of pure water, she flows down from the mountain Hukarya to the sea, and from the stars down to earth. In verses which, perhaps, are of late date she is represented as driving a chariot drawn by four white animals; she is described as a magnificent, strong young woman (Herzfeld 1947: 517-522). Until the reign of Artaxerxes II (404-359 B.C.), her cult, ifany existed, was aniconic, as were the IndoIranian traditions involving Mithra. Only during the reign of Artaxerxes II do there appear images of both Anahita and Mithra. In that period, Artaxerxes had great statues of Anahita set up in Babylon, Susa, Ekbatana, Persepolis, Bactria, and elsewhere (Masson 1959: 20). In general, however, her position became weakened within the Zoroastrian pantheon. One finds Anahita worshipped primarily in those areas which lay outside the domination of Zoroastrianism, i.e., in the lands of the Yuezhi/Kushans, where she was also given the form of Nana. Within the Iranian lands, no anthropomorphic imagery corresponding to any of the deities of the lndo-Iranian mythic traditions can be found before approximately fourth century B.C. On the other hand, one finds a persistent reference to Bronze Age female deities, frequently in association with snakes or birds. The bottom of a cup from Altyn-Tepe in Turkmenia (third- second millennia B.C.) is painted with images of a schematic bird-headed goddess, her body bent as if seated, before whom stands another schematic figure with upraised arms. Above, on the side of the cup, is a vertically placed snake. A broken terracotta

fragment from the same site apparently represented a female figure with a snake coiled on her chest (Kozhin 1968: figs. 1, 2). Another deliber-ately bird-headed "goddess" figure was painted on a cup from Kara-tepe in southern Turkmenistan (Masson 1959: fig. 1). As in the case of the figure on the cup from Altyn-Tepe, this figure is bent in the posture of one seated on a throne. On either side of the bird-headed figure on the shard are the remains of two (probably male) figures; judging from the position of their feet, they were facing her, in heraldic fashion. The strata from which this fragment was gathered-Namazga III-is dated by Masson to the first half of the third millennium B.C. In the same site and strata were also found several terracotta figures of bird-headed seated women. According to Masson, the frequency of such terracotta figures in the archaeology of this period testifies to the popularity of a cult focussed on a goddess figure among the early agrarian peoples of Turkmenia. This cult was maintained in the region of Turkmenia until comparatively late in the second millennium B.C. The tradition of making goddess figures probably emerged out of many different cults dedicated to goddesses of the agricultural and stock-dependent peoples of the Aeneolithic and Bronze Ages. They formed the basis for the development of the Avestan deity, Anahita, the protector of cattle and the deity of heaven and fertility (Masson 1959: 20-21). The cult of a goddess-whether of Anahita or, as some have suggested, of the Zoroastrian goddess of order, prosperity, and fertility Asi-Urti-Rti (Ashi)-lasted with force late into the first millennium B.C. and into the common era. The strength of these cults in the region of Margian, Khorezm, Tokaristan and Sogdia is well attested to through archaeological finds, particularly of small terracotta figures. These cults also revealed their strength in the Yuezhi finds at Tillya-Tepe, in which representations of female goddesses serve as a major theme on the thousands of gold plaques. Naked and clothed, carrying implements indicative both of their martial character and their attributes as goddesses of love, the goddesses of the Tillya-Tepe finds indicate the persistence into the Iron Age and into the end of the Scytho-Siberian tradition of the ancient and complex Near Eastern goddess tradition. This overview of the ancestors of the Nana/Anahita (Aphrodite) goddess type leads to a number of general conclusions. It is clear that the goddesses of the ancient Near East tended to blur into each other. This is particularly certain in the second millennium, where the coming of one goddess into the area of another (e.g., Anat into the Egypt of Hathor) resulted in a merging of both function and representation and in both text

and ritual. It is also clear that the goddess figure carried to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the period and the place, values, powers, and associations which would seem vastly contradictory to the modern mind, but which were apparently linked in the minds of earlier peoples. Thus, in Ninhursag and Inanna/lshtar one finds a powerful combination of generative, life-giving forces bound in one goddess with a destructive, warlike character. More striking, perhaps, is that with the passage of time and the rise of male challengers, the two sides of the female goddess become more extreme: fertility, fecundity, and love become bound together with more ferocious, vengeful characters. When one considers the larger tradition of Near Eastern goddesses beginning with Ninhursag and ending with the Anahita/Nana duality, one finds persistent patterns of behavior and recurring iconographic attributes. The combination of life and death, of life-giving and destroying, seems to have been fundamental to the earliest of these goddesses. Down to the representation of Nana, they could be associated with weapons, war chariots, lions-the signs of a warrior. Through cow horns or the Hathor wig they were joined back to the cow, a vessel of life and of life-giving milk. In the form of Hathor and Asherah, there was a regular conflation of goddess as source of life and tree which gave sustanance. The naked, frontal aspects of the Qudshu figures, of her Palestinean variation, 'Elat (Hestrin 1987: 215-217, figs. 1, 2, 3), and of her Old Testament variation, Asherah, wearing cow-horns and having the form of a post or tree, indicate the widespread understanding of the goddess as being associated with those fundamental aspects. In many ways, Asherah exemplifies the syncretism and intertwining of deities in the Near East throughout the Bronze Age and well into the Iron Age. The perseverance of her cult suggests something of the tenacity with which culture clung to an ancient goddess and endowed her with the powers of giving life and death. In her Qudshu form, she symbolized beauty, grace, and sexual vitality. The fecundity that she represented was indicated also in her naked body, as well as in her cow horns and in her manifestation as a post or tree. At the same time, the transformations attendant on the Asherah figure indicate, I believe, something of the hidden struggle for spiritual power which increasingly swirled around her and which increasingly challenged the authority of the ancient goddesses. In several of her incarnations-most spectacularly as Ishtar and most ferociously as Anat-the goddess is associated with symbols usually joined to the male god or ruler: the sun, the lion, the bull, the chariot, and

weapons of war, as well as brightness, strength, speed, and bellicosity. The association of the bull with Ninhursag and Inanna/Ishtar and of the lion and chariot with Ishtar clearly indicate that even when referring primarily to another deity, symbols may indicate the presence of the goddess and may transfer to her the power they represent. Thus the bull as the source of seed refers at least in part to the fecund nature of the cow; and the lion as a solar animal lends his glory to the warlike Ishtar. As we shall see, these martial aspects are particularly enlightening with respect to the association in Scytho-Siberian scholarship of weapons, bulls, chariots, sun, and fire with the male warrior. These ancient goddesses could be naked or clothed; their crowns were frequently a variation on horns or feathers. They could also be associated with birds through the birdlike treatment of their heads and faces. 6 The appearance of twisting snakes on the body of the goddess and the manifestation of feathers, used to indicate divinity, suggest ways of understanding the so-called "feather-heads" of Karakol and the Minusinsk stelae in a manner other than as "sun heads." In both cases, it is possible that the rayed elements refer to feathers or serpents. This is particularly possible in the case of the vertically waving elements which emerge at the top of the masks on many of the Minusinsk stelae and continue to the upper part of the stones. The persistence of the ancient Near Eastern goddess in varying forms and under varying names, from as early as the third millennium down late into the first millennium B.C., surely indicates the tenacity of her cult even in the face of the emergence of male god-centered religions. Her replication in thousands of small clay images throughout that period and throughout the cultures of the Near East reveals her extreme popularity and the immediacy of her presence. To say this is not to negate the equally frequent veneration of male gods; it is, however, to insist that, regardless of the apotheosis of the latter and despite the contemporary male domination of political power across the Near East and into Central Asia, the cult of a complex goddess persisted well into the end of the first millennium B.C. and well into those areas which were dominated by Scytho-Siberian groups. Furthermore, her archaic tradition repeatedly
6 The feather headdress was actually the attribute of both gods and goddesses from the ancient Orient. It is represented as a high-sided headdress, the feathers bound around approximately 1/2 way up the sides. In Assyria, Shamash, Ashur, and Ishtar were often pictured wearing a crown of horns and feathers (Pritchard 1943: 38-40; Smith 1928: fig. 17) By the first half of the second millennium it was regularly used in the area of Babylonia to indicate divinity. The feather headdress continued to be used down into first millennium Assyria.

reiterated the complexity of her character and her association with animals-cows, birds, and snakes, in particular-as well as reaffirming the concept of milk as a source of life and trees or posts as the sign of fecundity. Whether she was called Hestia or Tabiti, Argimpasis or Aphrodite, Nana, Ardoxsho, or Anahita, her cult remained a major aspect of religious belief throughout the Scythian, Saka, and Yuezhi hegemony. Even if her material form or image were absent, she was indicated by one of her own attributes, or by the body or attributes of others. In other words, if the tree or the post symbolized the goddess, then the bull and the chariot may also refer to her presence. This discussion brings us back to the world of the Scytho-Siberians and to the possibility of extending to that world some of the insights offered by Near Eastern traditions. The lack of written documents characteristic of the Scytho-Siberian world in general and of the Early Nomads and their predecessors in particular makes absolute certainty impossible. There is no way of proving that the seated woman on the Pazyryk 5 (pl. Via) hanging is a South Siberian expression of the seated woman in the Chertomlyk, Karagodeuashkh (pl. Vic, e, e), and Merdzhana plaques. We cannot argue from analogy with Near Eastern symbolic structures that the frontal figures on the Minusinsk stelae, the feathered and horned figures from Karakol, and the strange bird-women from petroglyphs of the Chuluut and Chuya rivers must refer to a fundamental goddess figure. It is not possible to say this figure means that, or that here we certainly have influence from there. It is possible, however, to take parallel structures seriously. In considering the range of female imagery from the Scytho-Siberian world-images as early as those of the Pazyryk 5 hanging and as late as the female bust from the Novocherkassk crown-a number of elements continually reemerge, albeit in different positions and in varying relationships to the female figures. These elements include trees or branches, horses, deer, caprids, and a vertical axis. In the case of Nana and the woman of the Merdzhana plaque, the horse head hangs from a staff or post. In the case of the woman from the Pazyryk hanging, the horse appears before her and she holds the tree-staff. In the unprovenanced anecdotal plaques from the Siberian Treasure, considered as a pair, the woman sits at the base of the tree flanked on either side by men and horses. In the plaques from Chertomlyk and Karagodeuashkh, the woman is addressed by men holding cups or rhyta, the sign of the caprid, or she holds the rhyton herself, thereby indicating her conceptual centrality within the composition. In the case of the more elaborate tree

crown from Tillya-Tepe, the woman is the central axis of the tree. In fact and in image, she is the center of the tree crown from Novocherkassk, but there she is also flanked by antlered and horned animals. The crown which was placed close to the head of the man buried at Tillya-Tepe reaffirmed the association of horned animal, tree, and death. There-and as in the case of the mountain headdress at Issyk-the symbolism of central axis marked by tree or mountain was transferred to the male from its original source, the female; by that transposition the vitality ascribed to the central and transcendant axis was also reconferred. The association of horse head and staff or post represents a late reformulation of the symbolic system at the center of which was placed the deer as tree or centering axis. We have seen that within the cluster of goddess associations in the ancient Near East, there was a frequent conflation of goddess, tree, post, and source of sustenance (milk). In this connection it is worth noting that among the Yakut there is a very similar cluster of symbolic elements. The Yakut are a Turkic people who retreated northward from their homeland in the Prebaykal perhaps as early as the late first millennium A.D. They are theoretically the principal inhabitants of the vast Siberian region known as Yakutia (Levin and Potapov 1956: 268-271; Okladnikov 1970). Because of their early withdrawal out of South Siberia, the Yakuts have preserved archaic cultural elements more clearly than any other Turkic group has. Their carved, wooden horse-hitches offer a particularly interesting example of archaic elements within their material culture. The horse-hitches are similar in form and function to the horse hitches one sees to this day throughout Mongolia and South Siberia. The southernmost hitch in a row, the one closest to a dwelling, would be considered the most prestigious; that furthest away would command the least respect and authority. Indicative of the centrality of the dwelling and of the respect commanded by the head of the household, the hitches were also believed to function as the resting places of good spirits capable of bringing wellbeing to a household. Although these observations are drawn from modern ethnography, Kubarev has argued that the organization of hitches in relationship to a dwelling is reminiscent of the rows of stones (balbal) in relationship to ritual and burial mounds from the Turkic and perhaps Early Nomadic periods (Kubarev 1979). Although the primary purpose of the Yakut horse-hitches refers to the function of holding a horse and, thus, honoring the head of a household, there are a number of secondary associations which bear upon the discussion of ancient goddess figures. S. V. Ivanov tells us that, until

recently, the hitching posts were used in rituals to assure the fertility of women. Special hitches would be set up under a tree in summer and cupshapes carved at their crowns would be used to hold koumiss for mother earth. In this restructuring of the horse-hitch an ancient association of pole/tree/milk/earth/fertility is indicated, all associated with the horse, the primary Yakut source of milk and koumiss. Ivanov has published one elaborate Yakut tether, collected in the nineteenth century, the upper part of which takes the form of elaborate tree branches with a small human figure at the base and a bird at the top (pl. Ve). The potential power of such hitches is also suggested by the fact that the Yakut designated special horse-hitches only for the "winged" or "humpbacked" horse of a big shaman; to hitch any ordinary horse to such a tether would be to kill it (S.V. Ivanov 1976). There is absolutely no way of tracing the real signs of a connection between the pole or tree form of the ancient Near Eastern goddesses and the Yakut horse-hitches, and there is no way of documenting any certain connection between the latter and the woman from the Pazyryk 5 hanging. There is, however, a striking analogy between the clusters of associations, one that argues for a widespread and archaic understanding of the relationship between tree/pole, woman/milk, and a power so vital as to be capable of giving life and at the same time inflicting harm and destuction. The duality of character embodied in Ninhursag and all her female descendants is distantly glimpsed in the thin line between life and death epitomized in the act of bringing a being into the world, when the female body is both the source of life and the threat of enclosing death. In those early goddesses, as in the special Yakut horsehitches, that which gives life is also capable of destruction. It is no wonder that the tree should become the metaphor for that complex aspect of being: rooted in the ground, reaching toward heaven, displaying in its foliage the eternal cycle of emergence, florescence, and death, and bearing on its branches the fruits of life, the tree was the ideal sign of the Mother Goddess and of all that she embodied. Whether translated into a post in the form of a frontal woman, into a seated female holding a branch, or into a woman wearing a tree crown, the combination of elements remains consistent and points back to parallel religious and mythic conceptions.
We have seen that beyond their funerary purposes, the slab-grave and khereksur complexes of South Siberia were the sites of elaborate ritual, including rituals of sacrifice. In intention and to some degree in structure, these complexes refer back to a period considerably earlier than the

late Bronze Age date to which the khereksur are usually assigned. While Kubarev has emphasized the difficulty of determining chronologies for all parts of the khereksur and deer stone complexes, Tivanenko has emphasized the antiquity and continuity of ritual sites in the Baykal region, and especially those sites which included sacrifical altars (Kubarev 1979; Tivanenko 1989). Like the ritual sites of the Baykal region, Yustyd is the kind of archaeological complex which has come to be called a "sanctuary," a place sanctified by the practices and structures of successive generations. It is generally acknowledged that South Siberia is marked everywhere by sanctuaries which may include the images or structures of cultures as early as the Neolithic and as late as those of the present-day. We have seen this process of overlay and sanctification in the case of petroglyphs. It is no less evident in the interpenetration of Afanasevo, Early Nomadic, and Turkic cemeteries in Gorno-Altayskaya A.O., in the ritual sites reused over centuries in the Transbaykal, or in the reuse and reconstruction of Mongolian deer stones and circular stone altars. With the exception of the Turkic structures, most parts of these sanctuaries resist certain dating. What is clear is that their roots go back to at least the early Bronze Age and possibly earlier. Throughout South Siberia there is ample evidence that the location of sanctuaries was dependent on the character of a place. That is, the natural environment conferred a signification on the site of the ritual structures and it, in turn, was sanctified by the deposition of human artifacts. The petroglyphs of South Siberia are regularly located beside or above rivers, as if the river itself were a metaphor for significant experience and the petroglyphs were witness to the sanctification of that experience (cf. Okladnikov 1950, 1966; Tivanenko 1989). In many cases, ritual sites marked by sacrificial altars have been found at the base of or directly under cliffs with petroglyphs, as if the images in stone represented or referred to the spirits to whom ritual sacrifice was made. Such ritual sites relative to petroglyphic complexes have been particularly noted in the region of the Prebaykal where images of female elk dominate the cliffs, their presence affirming a date in the Neolithic period. Along the upper Angara and Lena rivers and their tributaries there is a clear relationship of petroglyphs and ritual sites to stretches of the river marked by dangerous rapids (Tivanenko 1989: 82 ff.). From this combination of elements the river emerges as a metaphor for the river to the land of the dead, and the rock paintings and carvings functioned as an invocation to the spirits who would guide the dead to that other world.

period, the image most frequently invoked was that of the female elk; it must have been she to whom the ancient cultures along South Siberia's rivers appealed for assistance in their fearful passage down the waterways. The distribution of ritual structures in South Siberia indicates that, with the passage of time from the Neolithic into the Bronze Age, rituals relating to death were freed from a necessary association with rivers. Certainly this appears to be the case in those regions capable of supporting a gradual shift to a pastoral economy. In the Minusinsk Basin, the stelae dominating what may have been late Neolithic or Aeneolithic ritual sites faced to the East rather than being oriented by reference to rivers. Elsewhere during the South Siberian Bronze Age, a similar orientation became more widely spread. Ritual sites were frequently placed in broad valleys surrounded by mountains. Most of those valleys are marked by the rivers which helped to form them. The deer stones themselves, however, were turned toward the East; and as far as can be gathered from recorded sites throughout Mongolia, the Transbaykal, Tuva and the northern Altay, the complexes of enclosures, khereksur, and burials which were marked by deer stones also became oriented by reference to the cardinal directions. This change in orientation suggests that the passage to another world had come to refer to a larger universe than was earlier indicated by specific rivers. The rivers that flowed from the warmer south towards the ice-bound north-the Yenisey, the Tom', the Angara and Lena, for example-had served as metaphors for the passage from the land of the living to the land of the dead for the people of the Baykal Neolithic. Within the Bronze Age Minusinsk Basin, the Sayan-Altay Ridge, and Mongolia, the significant universe became organized by reference to the four directions, and within that universe it is probable that mountains, valleys, and the movement ofcelestial bodies played a more important role than rivers did. Such a transition in sanctified places-from river to mountain valley-should not be wondered at. It was precisely during the Bronze Age that South Siberian peoples made the critical transition from a dependency on hunting and fishing to a dependency on livestock. The grass-rich plains of the Transbaykal and northern Mongolia and the pasture land marking the terraced valleys of the Sayan - Altay became the source of well-being for Bronze Age South Siberia and the fitting locus of ritual sites. From the mountains flowed the water on which pasture depended, and on the spring and summer flanks of the mountains both wild animals and grazing stock pastured. Within such an ecologically adjusted niche,

it was fitting that mountains became the locus of helping spirits and the source of a lineage's life and well-being. Within both the deer stone/khereksur and deer stone/slab grave contexts, the essential, common element is the vertical post. Gyaznov has proposed that the stone stele is simply a more permanent form of the ancient wooden posts used to mark ritual sites (Gryaznov 1978, 1984), and there is some evidence to support that hypothesis. One of the ritual sites at Lower Burgultae, on the Dzhide River in the southern Transbaykal, included slab-graves, khereksur, and over fifty circular enclosures. Each of the enclosures included the skull, backbone, and hoofs of a horse. A significant number included other animal bones as well as signs of burning. Within a number of the enclosures the remains of wooden posts that had risen from the center of the ring were found (Tivanenko 1989: 107-109) At Shan Tengerintal, in the Arhangay Aymag, Volkov recorded a complex that included two gigantic khereksur and a squared enclosure defined by several deer stones. In the southwest corner of that enclosure and at its center were found the remains of large wooden posts. At the base of the post in the center part of a calf's backbone was also recovered (Volkov 1981: 26). The association of posts or trees with sacrificial altars was not limited to the Bronze and early Iron Ages. Indeed, the burial and ritual sites of the early Turkic period indicate that this association was maintained for many centuries. At an early Turkic period site in the Uzuntay River basin of Gorno-Altayskaya A.O., Kubarev found a number of ritual enclosures within which had been placed the root sections of large trees (Kubarev 1978). In light of known mythic traditions of the early Turks, it is probable that these root sections symbolized sacred trees or the World Tree, which offered passage from the land of the living to the land of the dead. The appearance of such symbolic trees within a Turkic ritual site suggests a fundamental link between Turkic ritual structures and those which can be found as early as the late Bronze Age (cf. Savinov 1981). It is the Minusinsk stelae carved with masks which offer the most striking parallels and precedents for the later deer stones. It is probable that these great monoliths were originally intended to serve as the central elements in ritual sites that also included stone hearths or altars for ritual animal sacrifice. In some cases, such as that of the large complex in the Sorga Valley which included burials, sacrificial altars, and huge stones, the stelae were clearly ranged from north to south and were turned to the East. The sacrificial altars were placed to the west of the stelae. This regular ordering, as well as the combination of structures and functions

within a single complex, closely parallel those established in the great deer stone complexes of Mongolia and Tuva. It is also significant that the Minusinsk stelae were buried deep in the ground, with as much as one-third or one-half of the stone's length beneath the surface of the earth. Certainly a part of that deep burial was practical: in order to remain upright, they required such deep rooting. There is much evidence, however, that the purpose of burying the stone was more than functional. A number of the stones were apparently buried deeply enough so that parts of their carved surface were lost from view. Other stones were placed in the ground in an inverted position, or in such a manner that the masks were inverted (e.g., pl. Xa). A similar inversion is suggested by the irregular directionality of the images of deer on the Mongolian deer stones, as well as by the carving of Cimmerian anthropomorphic stelae, which sometimes have two similar ends (e.g., pl. XXIb). In all these instances, one senses ancient parallels to the common Siberian belief, exemplified in the case of the Evenk, that the land of the dead is like that of the living, but in reverse. It seems as if the placement of the stones effectively functioned as a metaphor for the joining of two different spheres, an underworld and an upper world, and as if that function was necessarily accompanied by sacrificial altars. The female aspect of the masks dominating the Minusinsk stelae has impressed many observers, as have her peculiar animal characteristics: her large nostrils, horns, and staring eyes. Khlobystina has identified the animalistic masks as reflecting the conflation of the female ancestor and her totemic husband, the bull (Khlobystina 1971 a: 170). Kyzlasov associates the female mask with what he calls the First Mother; her stele refers to the axis of the world, analogous to the World Mountain and the World Tree (Kyzlasov 1986). The possibility of developing, as has Kyzlasov, an elaborate interpretative strategy to account for all elements on the stelae is questionable in the absence of sufficient contingent material. It is certain, however, that the female and animal aspects of the carved images were significant and dominating elements within the iconographic program of the stelae. It is also certain that within a ritual context involving animal sacrifice, the stelae represent the closest parallels to the deer stones of the Sayan-Altay and Mongolia-Transbaykal types. We lack a continuous thread between the Minusinsk stelae and the deer stones of the late Bronze Age, and occasional carved stelae only suggest that continuity. One from the Sorga complex, carved with a mask on its eastern face but the upper end carved in the shape of an elk head,

was reused within a Tagar site (pl. Xlb). Other potentially transitional stones of the Sayan-Altay type were discussed in Chapter V. However, assuming that the classic deer stones cannot be dated earlier than approximately 1000 B.C., it is obvious that within the chronology of the South Siberian monolithic stelae there is a gap between the Neolithic and late Bronze Ages traditions-a gap which may or may not be filled by deer stones exemplied by a number from the Chuya Steppe. Assuming that the Minusinsk stelae do not represent a cultural dead-end, that they were indeed the "ancestors" of the later deer stone tradition, it is reasonable to expect that the beliefs and myths consecrated in those great monoliths flowed into the cultural base of succeeding periods, albeit in changed form. The tradition represented by petroglyphs of female elk associated with ritual altars and animal sacrifice belonged to cultures dependent on rivers and forests for their survival, cultures with an economy rooted in hunting and fishing. In contrast, the stelae of the Minusinsk Basin must be associated with the emergence of stock raising. The transition between the two economic traditions is suggested by the combination of elk representations and female masks on the Sorga and Sartygoy stones (Kyzlasov 1986: figs. 32, 124) and in the overlapping cultural layers of petroglyphs at Shalobolin. That transition, however, can also be traced in the petroglyphs and Bronze Age ritual sites in the region around Lake Baykal, where forest gives way to grassland and the possibility of pasture. Within Bronze Age South Siberia a series of symbolic transformations occurred indicative of the essential transformations of underlying myth. The female elk image had long since been discarded, and the female mask-quasi-human, quasi-animal-had also been left behind, as were the curious bird-women recorded in petroglyphs along the Chuluut and Chuya rivers. These female images were replaced in Bronze Age petroglyphs by images of antlered deer, bovines, and horned and hatted figures. At Kalbak-Tash and Chuluut Gol, animals seemingly combining the bovine and deer mark the overlay of two traditions: one rooted in a forest/river economy, and the other rooted in pastoral stockbreeding. These syncretic animals suggest the deliberate fusing of zoomorphic images in response to the actual fusing of cultures at the figurative and real borders between forest and steppe. It is not surprising that such images appear precisely in areas which could have supported both pastoralism and hunting. Furthermore, the continued appearance of thousands of images of deer and cattle throughout the petroglyphic

record of Bronze Age South Siberia attests to a continuing process of cultural influx and interchange. I have referred on a number of occasions to the ritual organization of space with reference to the cardinal directions characteristic of both the Minusinsk stelae complexes and those of the deer stones. Indeed, so similar are these traditions in their sacrificial dedication and in the use of carved monolithic stelae facing decisively to the East that one would be hard pressed to explain away the similarities through the arguments of coincidence or convergence. Decisive images, however, had changed. The Minusinsk stelae were carved with the monumental heads of beings resembling a cross between humans and animals. Breasts and full bellies indicate the female gender of these strange beings; horns and wide-set eyes most frequently seem to refer to bovines. Snake-like streamers and unidentifiable four-cornered marks complete the complex of images. In contrast, the deer stones are marked most obviously by the image of the antlered deer. In its appearance on Mongolian and Transbaykal stones and in its reappearance on petroglyphs throughout northern Mongolia, Tuva, and the northern Altay, that deer image almost certainly derives from the reindeer, rather than from the elk or maral. The stone itself unquestionably refers to a human male. Whether one concludes that it is indeed the image of a warrior or whether it may simply be the image of the male in ritual regalia-his prized tools and weapons hanging from his belt-the male reference of the stone is beyond doubt. While it is possible to theorize about the meaning of the quasi-human, quasi-animal masks on the Minusinsk stelae, certainty remains out of reach. One is impressed, however, by a certain coincidence of elements. The stelae combine monumental posts with images that would best be described as animal-women. The appearance of breasts and swollen bellies and the location of these stones at sacrificial sites, set with the masks facing to the East, convey the impression of a primary concern for beginnings of time and space and for regeneration. On the other hand, the deep anchoring of the stones in the soil, the appearance of menacing beasts on a number of the stones, and even the ferocious aspect of some of the masks suggest, also, a concern for the negative and deathconnected aspects of existence. In this combination of characteristics, the stelae offer a South Siberian parallel to the goddess figures of the Near East, particularly in their post or tree formulations. The combination ofpositive and negative and life and death, lodged in stelae and mask offers a northern alternative to the goddess of love and death, and to the erotic and ferocious character of an Ishtar or Anat.

stelae there seems to be indicated either another expression of what may have been a virtually universal understanding of the Mother Goddess or the result of the infiltration of cultures from the southwest, from the region of Kazakhstan, and of the resulting merging with autochthonous cultures. We know that in the region ofTurkmenia there was a widespread and tenacious cult of a great goddess figure from the beginning of the Bronze Age and that this goddess seems to have shared in the complex symbolism of her Mesopotamian sisters. The images preserved in the petroglyphs of Saimaly-Tash surely indicate, as Golendukhin has argued, a cult associated with the first ploughing of the earth (Golendukhin 1971). While the "sun-heads" there may refer to a solar cult, given the virtually certain pre-Indo-European date of those petroglyphs it is probable that the cult was dedicated to an earth goddess and that the curious feather or ray-headed creatures may refer to her, rather than to a god. So, too, may the heads with radiating rays from the pre-Bronze Age petroglyphs at Tamgaly refer to a cult of the goddess, rather than to the cult of a sun god. This is particularly true of the impressive frontal figure with circular head, standing on a long-horned bull (pl. VIIIg). In contrast to the ithyphallic animal, the standing figure has no indication of male gender, leading one to believe that here, as in the case of similar frontal figures from the Karakol slabs, a female deity is represented, rather than a male. The interior of the figure's head is filled with large dots arranged in a manner reminiscent of a constellation: one in the center surrounded by nine others. From the circle of the figure's head extend rays, more reminiscent of the extended rays of Ishtar's star sign than of the enclosed rayed sun disk of Shamash (e.g., Pritchard 1954: figs. 518, 529). The: relationship of bulls and lions to Mesopotamian goddess figures raises. the possibility that the bull here refers to the goddess's fecund presence; figure and bull are the necessary duality for the beginnings of life. These and similar images from Saimaly-Tash and Tamgaly appear to offer iconographic evidence for an ultimately distant source for the images found at Karakol and those appearing on the Minusinsk stelae. The masks on the Minusinsk stelae suggest the association of an anthropomorphic-bovine image with the influx of a culture more dependent on pastoralism than had been true of previous cultures in the region. At the same time, the mixed bones and teeth found in related sacrificial sites indicate the transitional dependency of that culture on wild animals, as well as on domesticated stock.

of the Great Goddess of the Near East may not, in other words, have been entirely coincidental. The idiosyncratic nature of all these images beyond the Mesopotamian world, however, indicates the independent elements that the masks refer to. The strange figures at Tamgaly, Karakol, Shalobolin, and those carved into the Minusinsk stelae trace the imagistic and conceptual reworking of an idea as it was carried further and further from its homeland. Lacking texts to clarify the transitions we see in symbolic structures, we may turn to those structures themselves to inform our understanding of underlying processes. There are two considerations which may illuminate the transition indicated between, on the one hand, the dominant images of Neolithic South Siberia-the female mask/stele and the female elk/petroglyph-and, on the other hand, the sign of late Bronze Age South Siberia-the male anthropomorphic stelae with deer images. Of all female cervids, the female reindeer (or, in North America, the caribou) bears antlers. The importance placed on the reindeer image reflects the real economic value of the animal within the Siberian woodland and tundra-an animal which is both wild and domesticable, an animal which would ultimately be herded in Siberia like domesticated cattle, horses, and sheep. As late as the nineteenth century, the wild Siberian reindeer were said to move in herds estimated in the thousands, their huge numbers promising human groups security from hunger and cold. There has been considerable, if inconclusive, discussion regarding the origins of reindeer domestication and riding, with calculations of its appearance ranging from the Bronze Age to the middle of the first millennium B.C. (Kyzlasov 195; Vaynshteyn 1968; Zeuner 1963). The Great Boyar petroglyphs on the Sukhaya-tes River in the Minusinsk Basin, dated to the late Tagar period, include the representation of two riders apparently herding deer; one of these deer is shown being ridden (Devlet 1976a). On the basis of the extensive use of reindeer products in Pazyryk 1, Gryaznov has argued that the inhabitants of the Sayan -Altay region may have already herded them by the early Iron Age (Gryaznov 1978b). Regardless of the actual date of the reindeer's domestication, however, the finds of reindeer bone in Neolithic and Bronze Age Siberian sites and the dependency of the Early Nomads on reindeer products indicate that even in its wild state the animal was a primary source of meat, leather, and bone for the inhabitants of Bronze Age Tuva, northern Mongolia, and within the Pre-and Transbaykal zones (Flerov 1960). It is not difficult to imagine that the reindeer herds of Siberia would serve early cultures as a metaphor for the wealth of the natural world

and-for those cultures which increasingly depended on stock-as a metaphor for the desired wealth in domesticated herds. Like the female elk of more wooded regions, the female reindeer would seem to double the invocation for fertility and well-being: as part of the herd and as the source of its numbers. In the Baykal Neolithic period, it was the female elk which served as the sign of life and rebirth; it was most certainly the shape of the Great Mother to which the dead would return along the clan rivers. With the emergence of a stock dependency brought to South Siberia by cultures coming out of the southwest and west the image of the Great Mother took on the form of a strange being, half-cow, halfwoman. It is to her that the Minusinsk monoliths were dedicated, and her association with beginning and end, life, death, and renewal, is indicated by the stones' rootedness in the ground and by the masks' facing towards the East. It is as if the underlying object of reverence---call it the Great Mother, the Animal Mother, or the Great Goddess-had simply changed shape, from elk to cow-human, with the transformation of economic dependency from hunting and fishing to pastoralism. The female elk disappeared because her mythic substance had been reformulated under the impact of new cultural elements. It takes little imagination to understand how the antlered but female reindeer could function to join early beliefs rooted in a hunting economy with the beliefs which emerged from an increasing dependency on livestock. From the basic understanding that the deer stones refer to male warrior figures in general and to the tribal progenitor in particular, has followed the assumption that the deer stone complexes must be associated with cults dedicated to the male ancestor. The phallic appearance of the stones has also been repeatedly cited as indicating the dedication of the stone to rites offertility vested in the male. The position taken here is that the phallic appearance of the deer stone is purely coincidental. The argu-ment for its phallic significance on the basis of its vertical shape is no more justified than would be the argument that the circular mirror of the Scytho-Siberians was symbolic of the female sex and thus of female power. If the deer stone in its various types refers to a male figure in dress regalia without necessarily representing a phallus and without necessar-ily referring specifically to a warrior, how is one to reconcile this male figure with what has been said above: that within the deer stone ritual complexes the deer emerges as the inheritor of traditions which were: embodied in the female mask and female elk? Some of the answer may be found within the tradition of Scythian art, including that of the carved

monolithic figures. Of all the Scytho-Siberian artistic traditions which inherited the South Siberian Bronze Age mythic and iconographic vocabulary, that of the Scythians was most clearly shaped by the realism of the Hellenic world. Through the adoption and adaptation of Hellenic realism to Scytho-Siberian mythic traditions, the Scythians translated into human and naturalistic terms the religious beliefs which lie behind the images of deer, feline, and bird. The plaques from Chertomlyk, Karagodeuashk, Merdzhana, and the Prigradnaya figures argue that the male stelae alone must have been intended to indicate the presence of a woman or goddess. The combination of the male who honors and the female who is honored is, of course, the same combination represented in the great felt hanging of Pazyryk 5. Missing from this Siberian version and from those of Chertomlyk and Karagodeuashkh, as well as from almost all the Scythian stone figures, is the image of the deer. Only on the Krasnodar figure is it recalled by the plaque of a deer on the figure's chest. That figure, however, raises a rhyton to its chest, as if silently honoring the absent seated female. If the Scythian figure is representation, then the unseen female is the indicated presence, and the significance of the stone figures lie in a balance implied between the male officiant and the enthroned female. In the earlier deer stones of South Siberia, the deer that wraps itself around the male figure was the sign of that female power. Yet even there in South Siberia, the stones reveal a tension between sources of power, both spiritual and worldly: a tension between the power of the archaic female as source and the power increasingly claimed by those who would officiate at her altar. Against this background, the principles we found associated with the Early Nomads' symbolic systems become clarified. The vertical axis with images displayed symmetrically on either side referred to a pole or tree associated with the source of the cycle of birth, death, and regeneration. In the materials from Tuekta and Pazyryk, we find a persistent implicit designation of that axis by the placement of bird wings, foliage, antlers, and horns, and by motifs which seem to shift between these elements, as if the very fact of their visual transformations would invoke the cycle of death into life. The antlered and homed animals displayed on either side of the axis were the sign of that essential source. The images of predation-in which deer or caprids are attacked, but never killed-reiterate symbolically that cycle of existence, but the images now refer to the natural world which surrounded the Early Nomads. The predation of large cats and wolves on deer and caprids had become a metaphor for the pattern of existence which earlier had been fully

summed-up in the singular image of an elk or deer. This recourse to the natural world surely measures the impact on Early Nomadic culture-as on the culture of the Sakas and Scythians-of the realism of Near Eastern and Hellenic styles. The Achaemenid mirrors, rugs, and belt buckles found in the Pazyryk burials indicate that foreign standard of representation to which the archaic Siberian symbolic systems were now adjusted. The adaptation of such foreign motifs as lions and eaglegriffins measures, also, the shifting taste of the Pazyryk culture as it figuratively turned away from its ancient Siberian focus and towards an increasing awareness of the signs of Near Eastern wealth and power. More reflective of the gradually rising wave of realism inspired by Persian and Hellenic taste is the mountain headdress from the Issyk burial and the realistic axial combinations of trees, birds, deer, caprids, and humans embedded in the crowns from Tillya-Tepe and Novocherkassk. So, too, on the Aluchaideng crown, the bird hovering over the predation of wolf on caprid restates the literal translation of the motif of death and regeneration. Even the headdresses of Ulandryk-much further removed from the influence of Persian and Hellenic taste--demonstrate the intrusion ofrealism. There, however, one senses a loss or weakening of symbolic systems, a reduction of once powerful metaphor to the symmetrical display of skillfully carved images. Against this discussion it is useful to reconsider one of the most unusual images from the Scythe-Siberian world, that of the deer with bird-headed antler tines. It is not possible to determine the actual source of that image since it has been found on objects as separated in time and space as fifth century Bulgaria, the North Pontic region, the Caucasus, the fourth century northern Altay, and extensively from Xiongnu finds in Mongolia and Inner Mongolia. It appears frequently in objects from the Siberian Treasure of Peter the Great and is recapitulated on belt plaques worn by the man buried in Issyk kurgan. Whatever its source, this image apparently carried an immediately comprehended meaning across the nomadic world. In an earlier study I suggested that the image of the deer, its antlers reminiscent of tree branches and its head and antler-tines transformed into birds, must have referred to a tree of life. In those cases where the deer is twisted as if under the impact of a predator-as in the case of the images tattooed on the man from Payzryk 2-the twisting refers to the death from which regeneration will emerge. The placement of such images on either side of the central axis of the man surely reaffirmed the location of that cyclical process of change at the center, which is ultimately signalled by the antlers of the animals, and

at that center are the antler-trees in which the birds of souls to be returned to the world are perched. The deer with bird-headed antler tines was a relatively late restatement of an idea already undergoing change. As in the case of the literal representations of predation from the Pazyryk saddle blankets, the explicit nature of the transformation of antlers into bird_heads, of deer heads into great beaked heads, and the evocative twisting of the body of the deer suggest an emerging concern for explicit representation. In contrast, the great feline plaque from Arzhan, the recumbent deer and crouched felines on the Kelermes gorytus cover, and the recumbent deer from Kostromskaya kurgan refer in monumental formality to the same cyclical nature of being treated in greater detail in the recumbent deer from Ak-Mechet, Zhurovka, Ilyichovo, and Axjutintsy. The increasingly detailed rendition of that process points ultimately to the weakening of archaic myth and the concept of the deer as Great Mother within the Scytho-Siberian world. Detail and realism, the translation of the archaic deer image into the prettified, weak Kul Oba deer, the transformation of the deer into the image of a female goddess: these are the signs that the archaic mythic tradition of the early nomadic world had been buffeted and thrown into question by impulses from the Hellenic and Achaemenid worlds. It is as if the closer the nomads moved to those sedentary lands-the closer physically and culturally, that is-the more their ancient traditions were compromised by new concepts, new understandings, and new goddesses and cults.
Considered against the background of the fluidity of Siberian cultures and mythic traditions, the symbolic systems revealed in Siberian ethnography acquire greater meaning, and the mythic traditions of the Ket and Evenk begin to fill in the gaps of the story we have been trying to reconstruct through the broken archaeological record. It becomes clearer that even up to the present time aspects of a mother cult have been recorded throughout Siberian societies. It is also apparent that they are rooted in an ancient and more magisterial, more unified understanding of cosmogenesis and in the continued dependency of human society on this originating source. Over the centuries, the transformation of the archaic tradition has demoted that original spiritual center, restricting her powers to lesser cults, remnants of which are preserved in the bear cult and in the Ket kaigus' and ale/. They are also glimpsed in the Nanay cult of the ancestors, centered on the wooden dzhuolin . The sexual and social tensions lodged in those beliefs become more comprehensible in

light of the traditions which were lost. The ubiquitous fire cult-the cult of the hearth, the family's center both literally and figuratively-emerges as a more substantial echo of the deer-mother whose locus referred to the beginning of a lineage, to the place of return to the clan river, and to the vital center of the lineage itself. Of all surviving Siberian peoples, the Ket and the Evenk are most easily traceable back to Bronze Age roots in the very regions from which probably emerged the ancestors of the Early Nomads: the region around Lake Baykal and the upper Yenisey. For that reason, their archaic: traditions have been of particular interest in this study. The Evenk concepts of bugady mushunin and bugady enintyn-mistress of the clan and mistress-mother of the clan-both combining the concepts of woman and cow elk or wild cow reindeer point directly back to the female elk and deer images of the Siberian Neolithic and Bronze Ages. In the concept of dunne mushunin, the Mistress of the clan lands who lives under a rock or under the roots of the sacred clan tree and points. out the shaman's way to the dwelling place of the bugady enintyn, one finds the reaffirmation of the concept of the post or tree which marks the passage to the underworld. In the image of a giant cow elk or cow reindeer, lying under the clan lands, one seems to catch distant sight of the impulses behind the great stelae wrapped in the images of deer, or of the deer with bird-headed antler tines. The complex cycle of birth, destruction, and rebirth appears in the Evenk rite of shingkelevun as well as in the concept of an animal mother referred to in the deer stones and within the symbolic systems of the Early Nomads. The shifting conception of these references, from woman to deer or elk and back again, reflects, I believe, the complex reference of the Bronze Age deer image. It also anticipates the animal's eventual transformation into the figure of a goddess. The shifting reference from deer to woman to deer, found in many archaic Siberian mythic traditions, is vividly reflected in the Nganasan belief in a swamp where their animal mothers live as naked women with the hair and antlers of deer. It will be recalled, however, that the fire in the tent of these animal mothers is analogized to the sun, and that the great female elk, Kheglun, is variously said to carry the sun on its antlers and to be the body of the Great Dipper constellation. Considering these traditions together with the almost universal Siberian association of fire with a female protective deity, one begins to question the appropriateness of imposing a male solarism on South Siberian cultural traditions. The archaic aspect of the association of fire and sun with female

entities-anthropomorphic or zoomorphic-which has been attested to throughout Siberian cultures by modern ethnography strongly suggests that its roots are ancient and deep, preceding even the period of the Early Nomads. The stability of these traditions makes it probable that one need not have recourse to an Indo-European solar tradition to "explain" Scytho-Siberian myths. In the age of the Early Nomads, the sun was not necessarily associated with a male warrior or male ancestor; it was much more likely connected with a female aspect and was referred to through the image of the deer. One must recall the repeated association of the Scytho-Siberian deer and its Bronze Age predecessors with a post-tree or antler-tree in which appear the heads of birds-the birds of the souls to be born. In that treereferred to as post or stele or branching antlers-appears the pictorial counterpart to the mythic traditions lying behind the Evenk concept of the turu , the sacred tree of the clan and the sacred tree of the clan's shamans. Among the roots of the turu lies the great elk mother of the clan. It is she who eats the soul of the shaman to be born, and it is the turu and the elk mother who mark the place of clan origin. Within the mythic tradition, the concept of the tree rooted in the Animal Mother and marking the point ofreturn and origin clarifies, I believe, the purpose and function of the deer stones, marking the sacred places of sacrificial enclosure, ritual mound, and burial. The Evenk mythic tradition animates the powerful images of female elk and deer from the Siberian Neolithic and Bronze Ages, lending a surging vitality to the image of the female animal, to the deer wrapped around the vertical stelae, to the deer with the heads of birds and with antlers transformed into branches tipped with birds. Yet the Ket mythic tradition illuminates the tension which appears in the Early Nomads' visions of predator and prey, of elk, deer, and caprid crushed by the weight of wolf and feline. That mythic tradition also goes a long way in explaining the process which finally resulted in the loss of the deer image as mythic symbol and in the eventual diminution of the fundamental concept of a single great mother. It will be recalled that the Ket mythic universe is theoretically dominated by the figure of Es, the male god of Heaven, who was associated with the sun and to whom wild reindeer are sacrificed. In fact, however, the most compelling figure of that pantheon and the one who functions as a perpetual source of disruption is Khosedam. She is the former wife of Es; to her, as to Es, a reindeer must be sacrificed, and it is Khosedam who is locked in eternal battle with the champion of human society, the hero Dokh.

Tomaro one sees the splitting of power which accompanied the history of the Great Goddess wherever she occurred, the gradual exaggeration of her power to destroy and her horrific aspects, on the one hand, and the elaboration of her beauty and goodness in human terms on the other. The rages of Khosedam, her passage up the Yenisey to afflict human society and her flights back to her ice-bound island in the north, her eternally recurring battle with Dokh, and, most importantly, the fact that Khosedam remains both the source of human sickness and death and her womb the necessary passage to rebirth: all these aspects reveal the conflicting forces within which the deer-mother of the Bronze Age became dislodged, diminished, and backed into extreme positions in the Iron Age. Like one act following another, the Ket mythic tradition seems to offer the dramatic, turbulent sequel to that of the Evenk. Something of the ambivalence toward the Animal Mother was eventually institutionalized in the practices of shamanism. The deer aspect of the shaman's robe, the references to deer and birds in the shaman's headdress, and the deerskin drum conceived in terms of the animal mother at the base of the Tree of Life and as the shaman's steed: all these major aspects of Siberian shamanism point back to a time when knowledge of the source of human life and death did not require shamanic mediation. In comparing the signs and symbols associated with the shaman with the ubiquitous appearance in Early Nomadic burials of the signs of the journey after death, it becomes apparent that there was a displacement of power since the early Iron Age. At some point-perhaps early in the first millennium A.D.-the institution of shamanism as we know it today emerged, gathering into its rituals reformulations of the symbolic systems of an earlier period. The antlered deer became the mother and cloak ofthe shaman. The deer and the tree were reconsecrated to the shaman's drum. The drum emerged as the shaman's steed, a late reflection of that same fusing of deer and horse which appears in the Early Nomadic deer with bird-headed antlers. Even the female sex of the deer would be reaffirmed in imagery found so often on the shaman's costume, or in the terms of endearment by which the shaman would address his drum. It must also be acknowledged, however, that if the shamanic tradition reformulates and reallocates concepts of beginning, mediation, and return that were earlier attached to all people, it is also true that the shamanic tradition represents what we might call a specifically Siberian solution to the sexual and social tensions apparent in late Scytho-Siberian art. Within that solution, tension and its resolution were negotiated through zoomorphic imagery and through the consistent

reaffirmation of animal doubles and an animal source. In contrast, one may point to the Near East, where realism and anthropomorphism gave the female element the form of a goddess. Among the Scytho-Siberians, when she was translated into a female goddess she became one of many, all displaced from the seat of power by male gods and by male-centered values. Within Siberia, it was the Siberian solution to the allocation of power which survived: the Animal Mother was reformulated in terms of cultic spirits-of the fire, the sun or moon, the hunt. In the shamanic rite she retained a powerful position; but in that tradition, without the shaman as mediator there is effectively no animal mother, no tree of life, and no access to the realm of the spirits.
Considerable distance separates the deer images at Yalbak-Tash and the Mongolian deer stones from which they emerged. Even greater space and time divides these remnants of Bronze and early Iron Age Siberian cultures and the plaques from Chertomlyk and Karagodeuashkh, the crowns from Tillya-Tepe and Novocherkassk. Joining these objects and images is a whole chain of finds, stretching across the Eurasian Steppe and tracing the gradual spread of an early nomadic culture out of the forest-steppe and steppelands of Mongolia and South Siberia, across Kazakhstan and western Siberia, down into the steppe and mountainous regions north and east of the Black Sea. Within that spatial and temporal transition is written the history of the emergence and disappearance of the Scytho-Siberians' culture. We know the materials of that culture through the structures and objects recovered by archaeology. They focus our view on the people themselves, on the trappings in which were embedded their understanding of the meaning of death within some larger cosmic process. Within those trappings, the image which returns again and again is that of the deer: alone in magnificent isolation; caught in the talons of a bird; crushed by the weight of a cat; transformed into some kind of composite beast, part-deer, part-bird, part-horse. There are no texts, no words to explain what we see. Turning to a mythic tradition which emerged and developed far away from the origins of the nomadic world, scholarship has attempted to flesh out the unknown by recourse to the known, even when the only basis for doing so is simple analogy. The words of Herodotus have dominated the translation of Scytho-Siberian antiquities, despite the patently Greek orientation of Herodotus' account and even though Herodotus almost certainly depended on the uncertain testimony of Greek travelers and of Greek inhabitants of the Black Sea colonies.

outside the Scytho-Siberian world and particularly distant from that of the Early Nomads has been seized upon and used to interpret the objects and rituals of the nomads, it is no wonder that the result is such a pastiche of bits and pieces: of solarized warriors, heroized ancestors, winged deer, and sun horses. No wonder that there can be no agreement on the origins of the so-called "animal style": depending on what the images "mean," their origins must vary from theory to theory. The purpose of this study has been to locate the meaning of the deer image in ancient South Siberia and to decipher its symbolic systems. In searching for the symbolic load of that one image and its permutations, we have found that the transformation of motifs and styles within the art of the Early Nomads and of their larger culture, the Scytho-Siberian, was coherent and meaningful. There was signification in the slow elaboration of animal images, from archaic and stylized to realistic and Hellenized. Meaning is revealed, also, in the curious emergence of an anthropomorphic tendency, first suggested in the deer stones of the late Bronze Age, and triumphant, finally, in the late precious-metal work of the Scythians and Yuezhi. Rather than finding clarification outside that world, however, one must look within it and back in time. In the centuries of overlapping South Siberian cultures, the mythic traditions and their variations which shaped the roots of Early Nomadic culture were developed. That culture and its iconography were the results of the interweaving and mixing of traditions reaching up into the Siberian forest land and down to the borders of ancient Iran. Only by taking such a broad view is it possible to reconcile elk and anthropomorphic mask, deer, bovine, deer stone, deer and predator, and deer and woman. Ultimately, it is the deer of the Early Nomads which is the key to the anthropomorphic figures of late Scytho-Siberian art, just as it is the key to deciphering the deer stones of the late Bronze Age. Icon and symbol, absence and presence, this animal is laden with values forged in the South Siberian Neolithic and reshaped in the Bronze Age. Whether ultimately referring to elk, reindeer, or maral, even when challenged by the image of the bovine, the image of the deer never lost its preeminent value. One senses in the history of its image a drama of epic proportions, but one long drawn out and intensely complicated by the intertwining of cultures. For hundreds of years the South Siberian deer was the center of a fluid symbolic system which traced in its shifts and fluctuations the passage of time and the transformation of culture. Within the art of the Early Nomads, the deer's image represents the final statement of an ecology of belief.
