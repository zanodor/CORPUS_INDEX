The following map shows S’atadru (Satluj) as a tributary of River Sarasvati flowing through the Ghaggar River channel, joining at Shatrana. The joining of S’atadru tributary waters and Sarsuti waters at Shatrana made the ancient (palaeo-) channel of Sarasvati River as wide as 20 kms.
Archaeological evidence shows that many of the settlements in the Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilisation (yellow triangles) developed along the banks of a river called the Ghaggar-Hakra (dark blue) in northwest India and Pakistan. The map also shows how Satluj River had flowed southwards at Ropar (near the Satluj river exit of Sivalik ranges) to join Ghaggar-Hakra palaeochannel.
This map also shows how Palaeo-Yamuna channels flowed through Drishadvati River which joined Satluj-Ghaggar-Hakra Palaeo-channel at Kalibangan. A palaeo-channel of Drishadvari River close to River explains how Rakhigarhi archaeological site had access to the full potential of the navigable waterway of Sarasvati River right upto Rann of Kutch and beyond through the Persian Gulf and Tigris-Euphrates into Mesopotamia.

Notice that the Ghaggar breaks up into two channels before disappearing into the sands of the Thar Desert. The northern channel gives way to the Hakra in Bahawalpur (Cholistan, Pakistan) [Landsat ETM + FCC mosaic]. One palaeo-channel (likely channel through which Yamuna River of Vedic time) flowing through Hissar (close to Rakhigarhi) joins the Satluj-GhaggarHakra palaeo-channels south of Pilibangan.
As the following elaborated drawing shows the sites of Ropar, Kunal, Banawali and Kalibangan were located on the Satluj-Ghaggar-Hakra Palaeo-channel, augmented with the waters of the Satluj Palaeochannels which flowed southwards from Ropar.
This explains how, these sites, Ropar, Kunal, Banawali, and Kalibangan could use the full potential of the navigable waterway of River Sarasvati which linked these sites to the Rann of Kutch and onwards through Persian Gulf into the Tigris-Euphrates doab in Mesopotamia.

Figure 6.2. The broadly linear pattern of the distribution of the Harappan settlements (older than 5500 yr B.P. to about 3300 yr B.P.) coincides with the now waterless, sand-choked, extraordinarily wide channel of the Ghaggar–Hakra–Nara [From Valdiya, 2002].
Among the settlements is Ganweriwala, (Fig.6.2) the second biggest metropolis of the time. About 5 m below the Hakra bed the 100 m thick sand body in the Fort Abbas reach point to its deposition by a large perennial river (Mughal, 1995). The U-Pb zircon dating demonstrates that the channel was active until about 4500 years B.P. (Clift et al., 2012). Samples of sediments close to the archaeological sites show similarities with the sediments of both the Beas and the Satluj rivers in the west and the Yamuna River in the east (Clift et al., 2012). Giosan et al., (2012) concede that the Yamuna may have contributed sediments to the Hakra before the Mature Harappan time, for they recovered 5300-year old sandy flood deposit at Fort Abbas. In other words, there are tell-tale evidence of the Himalayan rivers Satluj and the Yamuna flowing through the channel of the Ghaggar–Hakra until the Harappan times (Valdiya, 2016). http://jalshaktidowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/PalaeochannelExpertCommittee_15thOct2016_0.pdf (p.75)

VaIdiya notes: "The more than 5200 km long mountain chain, bordering the Indian subcontinent isolates it securely from the rest of Eurasia. Rivers Indus and Brahmputa hold the lofty rampart in their sweeping embrace." (Valdiya, K.S., 1998, Dynamic Himalaya, Universities Press, Hyderabad).
The dynamism of the Himalayas is related to Plate Tectonics.

A royal mountain named Himalaya lies in the northern direction. Carrying the treasure of water from east to west stands the king like a measuring rod of the earth.
Kalidasa starts his Kumarasambhavam, narrative of the birth of Skanda the son of Siva and Parvati and invokes the Kailasanatha who is in penance over Mt. Kailas by first remembering the sheer majesty of the Himalayan ranges as the wate-treasure, toyanidhi. This glacial water reservoir is the source of major river systems of the world which waters the fields to feed about 3 billion people through Yangtse, Huanghe, Mekong, Irawaddy, Salween, Brahmaputra Tsangpo, Ganga, Sarasvati, Sindhu. The mountain range is dynamic growing higher by 1 cm every year as the Indian plate like varaaha lifts up the Eurasian plate explaining the orogeny. As monsoon waters fall in heights above 8000 ft. above sea level, they get frozen into snow and ice with glacier storage trickling down as torrents.
Isn't it significant that national poet Kalidasa does not first talk about Siva or Parvati or even about Skanda but reminds us about Himalaya the water-source?
This life-giving, water-giving natural phenomenon where Siva meditates is the inspiration for the Jyotirlinga of Bharatam Janam who continuously do abhishekam with water over the sacred stones in memory of the water-giving divinity.

Terrane and the Pir Panjal-Dhauladhar ranges. While the Siwalik and Lesser Himalayan terranes were beaten and washed by heavy rains, in the lofty Himadri packs of snow and ice grew thicker and thicker. The ‘Abode of Snows’, the Himalaya, thus came into existence.” (ibid.)
Present geological understanding of the Dynamic Himalayas is best presented in a scientific report by US Geological Survey. https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/himalaya.html Excerpted in full as follows:
The Himalayas: Two continents collide
Among the most dramatic and visible creations of plate-tectonic forces are the lofty Himalayas, which stretch 2,900 km along the border between India and Tibet. This immense mountain range began to form between 40 and 50 million years ago, when two large landmasses, India and Eurasia, driven by plate movement, collided. Because both these continental landmasses have about the same rock density, one plate could not be subducted under the other. The pressure of the impinging plates could only be relieved by thrusting skyward, contorting the collision zone,



13
and forming the jagged Himalayan peaks.
About 225 million years ago, India was a large island still situated off the Australian coast, and a vast ocean (called Tethys Sea) separated India from the Asian continent. When Pangaea broke apart about 200 million years ago, India began to forge northward. By studying the history -- and ultimately the closing-- of the Tethys, scientists have reconstructed India's northward journey. About 80 million years ago, India was located roughly 6,400 km south of the Asian continent, moving northward at a rate of about 9 m a century. When India rammed into Asia about 40 to 50 million years ago, its northward advance slowed by about half. The collision and associated decrease in the rate of plate movement are interpreted to mark the beginning of the rapid uplift of the Himalayas. Artist's conception of the 6,000-km-plus northward journey of the "India" landmass (Indian Plate) before its collision with Asia (Eurasian Plate). Solid lines indicate present-day continents in the Indian Ocean region, but no geologic data exist to determine the exact size and shape of the tectonic plates before their present-day configurations. The dashed outlines for the "India" landmass are given for visual reference only, to show the inferred approximate locations of its interior part in the geologic past. The "India" landmass was once situated well south of the Equator, but its northern margins began to collide against the southward-moving Eurasian Plate about 40 to 50 million years ago (see text). The Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau to the north have risen very rapidly. In just 50 million years, peaks such as Mt. Everest have risen to heights of more than 9 km. The impinging of the two landmasses has yet to end. The Himalayas continue to rise more than 1 cm a year -- a growth rate of 10 km in a million years! If that is so, why aren't the Himalayas even higher? Scientists believe that the Eurasian Plate may now be stretching out rather than thrusting up, and such stretching would result in some subsidence due to gravity.

Fifty kilometers north of Lhasa (the capital of Tibet), scientists found layers of pink sandstone containing grains of magnetic minerals (magnetite) that have recorded the pattern of the Earth's flip-flopping magnetic field. These sandstones also contain plant and animal fossils that were deposited when the Tethys Sea periodically flooded the region. The study of these fossils has revealed not only their geologic age but also the type of environment and climate in which they formed. For example, such studies indicate that the fossils lived under a relatively mild, wet environment about 105 million years ago, when Tibet was closer to the equator. Today, Tibet's climate is much more arid, reflecting the region's uplift and northward shift of nearly 2,000 km. Fossils found in the sandstone layers offer dramatic evidence of the climate change in the Tibetan region due to plate movement over the past 100 million years.
At present, the movement of India continues to put enormous pressure on the Asian continent, and Tibet in turn presses on the landmass to the north that is hemming it in. The net effect of plate-tectonics forces acting on this geologically complicated region is to squeeze parts of Asia eastward toward the Pacific Ocean. One serious consequence of these processes is a deadly "domino" effect: tremendous stresses build up within the Earth's crust, which are relieved periodically by earthquakes along the numerous faults that scar the landscape. Some of the world's most destructive earthquakes in history are related to continuing tectonic processes that began some 50 million years ago when the Indian and Eurasian continents first met.
Understanding plat motions
Scientists now have a fairly good understanding of how the plates move and how such movements relate to earthquake activity. Most movement occurs along narrow zones between plates where the results of plate-tectonic forces are most evident.
There are four types of plate boundaries:
• Divergent boundaries -- where new crust is generated as the plates pull away from each other. • Convergent boundaries -- where crust is destroyed as one plate dives under another. • Transform boundaries -- where crust is neither produced nor destroyed as the plates slide horizontally past each other. • Plate boundary zones -- broad belts in which boundaries are not well defined and the effects of plate interaction are unclear.
...Continental-continental convergence
The Himalayan mountain range dramatically demonstrates one of the most visible and spectacular consequences of plate tectonics. When two continents meet head-on, neither is subducted because the continental rocks are relatively light and, like two colliding icebergs, resist downward motion. Instead, the crust tends to buckle and be pushed upward or sideways. The collision of India into Asia 50 million years ago caused the Indian and Eurasian Plates to crumple up along the collision zone. After the collision, the slow continuous convergence of these two plates over millions of years pushed up the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau to their present heights. Most of this growth occurred during the past 10 million years. The Himalayas,



15
towering as high as 8,854 m above sea level, form the highest continental mountains in the world. Moreover, the neighboring Tibetan Plateau, at an average elevation of about 4,600 m, is higher than all the peaks in the Alps except for Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa, and is well above the summits of most mountains in the United States.
Above: The collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates has pushed up the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. Below: Cartoon cross sections showing the meeting of these two plates before and after their collision. The reference points (small squares) show the amount of uplift of an imaginary point in the Earth's crust during this mountain-building process.

Understanding Bhuj earthquake 26 January 2001
Postseismic deformation and stress changes following the 1819 Rann of Kachchh, India earthquake: Was the 2001 Bhuj earthquake a triggered event? Geophysical Research Letters
By: A. To, R. Burgmann, and F. Pollitz
Abstract
The 2001 Mw 7.6 Bhuj earthquake occurred in an intraplate region with rather unusual active seismicity, including an earlier major earthquake, the 1819 Rann of Kachchh earthquake (M7.7). We examine if static coseismic and transient postseismic deformation following the 1819 earthquake contributed to the enhanced seismicity in the region and the occurrence of the 2001 Bhuj earthquake, ???100 km away and almost two centuries later. Based on the Indian shield setting, great rupture depth of the 2001 event and lack of significant early postseismic deformation measured following the 2001 event, we infer that little viscous relaxation occurs in the lower crust and choose an upper mantle effective viscosity of 1019 Pas. The predicted Coulomb failure stress (DCFS) on the rupture plane of the 2001 event increased by more than 0.1 bar at 20 km depth, which is a small but possibly significant amount. Stress change from the 1819 event may have also affected the occurrence of other historic earthquakes in this region. We also evaluate the postseismic deformation and ??CFS in this region due to the 2001 event. Positive ??CFS from the 2001 event occur to the NW and SE of the Bhuj earthquake rupture.
https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70026934 The Mw 7.7 Bhuj earthquake: Global lessons for earthquake hazard in intra-plate regions Journal of the Geological Society of India By: E. Schweig, J. Gomberg, Mark D. Petersen, M. Ellis, P. Bodin, L. Mayrose, and B.K. Rastogi
Abstract
The Mw 7.7 Bhuj earthquake occurred in the Kachchh District of the State of Gujarat, India on 26 January 2001, and was one of the most damaging intraplate earthquakes ever recorded. This earthquake is in many ways similar to the three great New Madrid earthquakes that occurred in the central United States in 1811-1812, An Indo-US team is studying the similarities and



17
differences of these sequences in order to learn lessons for earthquake hazard in intraplate regions. Herein we present some preliminary conclusions from that study. Both the Kutch and New Madrid regions have rift type geotectonic setting. In both regions the strain rates are of the order of 10-9/yr and attenuation of seismic waves as inferred from observations of intensity and liquefaction are low. These strain rates predict recurrence intervals for Bhuj or New Madrid sized earthquakes of several thousand years or more. In contrast, intervals estimated from paleoseismic studies and from other independent data are significantly shorter, probably hundreds of years. All these observations together may suggest that earthquakes relax high ambient stresses that are locally concentrated by rheologic heterogeneities, rather than loading by plate-tectonic forces. The latter model generally underlies basic assumptions made in earthquake hazard assessment, that the long-term average rate of energy released by earthquakes is determined by the tectonic loading rate, which thus implies an inherent average periodicity of earthquake occurrence. Interpreting the observations in terms of the former model therefore may require re-examining the basic assumptions of hazard assessment.
https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70025930 A media-based assessment of damage and ground motions from the January 26th, 2001 M 7.6 Bhuj, India earthquake
Abstract
We compiled available news and internet accounts of damage and other effects from the 26th January, 2001, Bhuj earthquake, and interpreted them to obtain modified Mercalli intensities at over 200 locations throughout the Indian subcontinent. These values are used to map the intensity distribution using a simple mathematical interpolation method. The maps reveal several interesting features. Within the Kachchh region, the most heavily damaged villages are concentrated towards the western edge of the inferred fault, consistent with western directivity. Significant sediment-induced amplification is also suggested at a number of locations around the Gulf of Kachchh to the south of the epicenter. Away from the Kachchh region intensities were clearly amplified significantly in areas that are along rivers, within deltas, or on coastal alluvium such as mud flats and salt pans. In addition we use fault rupture parameters inferred from teleseismic data to predict shaking intensity at distances of 0-1000 km. We then convert the predicted hard rock ground motion parameters to MMI using a relationship (derived from internet-based intensity surveys) that assigns MMI based on the average effects in a region. The predicted MMIs are typically lower by 1-2 units than those estimated from news accounts. This discrepancy is generally consistent with the expected effect of sediment response, but it could also reflect other factors such as a tendency for media accounts to focus on the most dramatic damage, rather than the average effects. Our modeling results also suggest, however, that the Bhuj earthquake generated more high-frequency shaking than is expected for earthquakes of similar magnitude in California, and may therefore have been especially damaging.

The 26 January 2001 M 7.6 Bhuj, India, earthquake: Observed and predicted ground motions
Abstract
Although local and regional instrumental recordings of the devastating 26, January 2001, Bhuj earthquake are sparse, the distribution of macroseismic effects can provide important constraints on the mainshock ground motions. We compiled available news accounts describing damage and other effects and interpreted them to obtain modified Mercalli intensities (MMIs) at >200



18
locations throughout the Indian subcontinent. These values are then used to map the intensity distribution throughout the subcontinent using a simple mathematical interpolation method. Although preliminary, the maps reveal several interesting features. Within the Kachchh region, the most heavily damaged villages are concentrated toward the western edge of the inferred fault, consistent with western directivity. Significant sediment-induced amplification is also suggested at a number of locations around the Gulf of Kachchh to the south of the epicenter. Away from the Kachchh region, intensities were clearly amplified significantly in areas that are along rivers, within deltas, or on coastal alluvium, such as mudflats and salt pans. In addition, we use faultrupture parameters inferred from teleseismic data to predict shaking intensity at distances of 01000 km. We then convert the predicted hard-rock ground-motion parameters to MMI by using a relationship (derived from Internet-based intensity surveys) that assigns MMI based on the average effects in a region. The predicted MMIs are typically lower by 1-3 units than those estimated from news accounts, although they do predict near-field ground motions of approximately 80%g and potentially damaging ground motions on hard-rock sites to distances of approximately 300 km. For the most part, this discrepancy is consistent with the expected effect of sediment response, but it could also reflect other factors, such as unusually high building vulnerability in the Bhuj region and a tendency for media accounts to focus on the most dramatic damage, rather than the average effects. The discrepancy may also be partly attributable to the inadequacy of the empirical relationship between MMI and peak ground acceleration (PGA), when applied to India. The MMI-PGA relationship was developed using data from California earthquakes, which might have a systematically different stress drop and therefore, a different frequency content than intraplate events. When a relationship between response spectra and MMI is used, we obtain larger predicted MMI values, in better agreement with the observations.

Sarasvatī River is adored in the Rgveda as hiranyavartanī, ‘having a path of gold’: र्सरस्वती घोरा
दिरण्यवतादनः (RV, 6.61.7) In addition to this being a metaphoric account of the glory of the river, in a place called Lohgarh on the banks of Sarasvatī River, in Sivalik ranges, Yamunanagar Dist., Haryana, even today gold panning licences are used to gold panniers searching for gold nodules flowing in the Sarasvati streams from the Himalayas. For millennia, the river has been
recognized as a bestower of wealth and annam,‘food’ (using the expression वादजनीवदत which is
explained by Sayana as अन्नवदत ‘abounding in food or victuals , especially boiled rice’. These are clearest references to the river as the wealth-giving divinity for the people who live on her banks. Hence, she gets adored with the metaphor of ‘ambitame, greatest of mothers’ who sustained and nurtured a civilization (RV .2.41.16).
The majesty of the Himalayan river is matched by the adoration of Dynamic Himalaya which is a growing, greatest Water Reservoir of the Globe quenching the thirst of over 2 billion people with the sacred waters of नगादिराज ‘Emperor of Mountains’. This Naga, ‘mountain’ is moving,
dynamic because the formation by the collision of India and Europe continental plates is ongoing as the Indian plate moves northwards at the rate of 6 cms. per year and lifts up the Eurasian plate by 1 cm every year, making it the only undiminishing, growing water reservoir of the globe, despite glacial melts and global warming. The Northern Monsoon lashes across the 5200 km. Himalayan range storing water in the reservoir in the form of snow and ice.
Storage of water occurs as snow and ice occurs at heights between 8000 ft and over 24000 ft. of Mt. Sagarmata (also called Everest, 29,029 ft.) and Mt. Karakoram Kw (28,251 ft.)

Abstract “As a Quaternary repository of wind-reworked Indus River sand at the entry point in the Himalayan foreland basin, the Thal Desert in northern Pakistan stores mineralogical information useful to trace erosion patterns across the western Himalayan syntaxis and the adjacent orogenic segments that fed detritus into the Indus delta and huge deep-sea fan throughout the Neogene. Provenance analysis of Thal Desert sand was carried out by applying optical and semi-automated Raman spectroscopy on heavy-mineral suites of four eolian and 11 fluvial sand samples collected in selected tributaries draining one specific tectonic domain each in the upper Indus catchment. In each sample, the different types of amphibole, garnet, epidote and pyroxene grains—the four dominant heavy-mineral species in orogenic sediment worldwide—were characterized by SEM-EDS spectroscopy. The chemical composition of 4249 grains was thus determined. Heavy-mineral concentration, the relative proportion of heavy-mineral species, and their minerochemical fingerprints indicate that the Kohistan arc has played the principal role as a source, especially of pyroxene and epidote. Within the western Himalayan syntaxis undergoing rapid exhumation, the Southern Karakorum belt drained by the Hispar River and the Nanga Parbat massif were revealed as important sources of garnet, amphibole, and possibly epidote. Sediment supply from the Greater Himalaya, Lesser Himalaya, and Subhimalaya is dominant only for Punjab tributaries that join the Indus River downstream and do not contribute sand to the Thal Desert. The detailed compositional fingerprint of Thal Desert sand, if contrasted with that of lower course tributaries exclusively draining the Himalaya, provides a semi-actualistic key to be used, in conjunction with complementary provenance datasets and geological information, to reconstruct changes in paleodrainage and unravel the relationship between climatic and tectonic forces that controlled the erosional evolution of the western Himalayan-Karakorum orogen in space and time.”

Plate tectonics, the collision of two continents -- the Indian and Eurasian plates -- result in the dynamic Himalaya which results from the Indian continental plate thrusting into and uplifting the Eurasian plate.
The Main Central Thrust moves northwards, away from the Equator, at a speed of about 6cms. every year.
This explains the formation and evolution of Himalaya as the youngest mountain range in the world, growing in height by 1 cm. every year as the Main Central Thrust pushes into and lifts up the Eurasian plate. One Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization metaphor for this thrust, pushing and
lifting up is the वरािः varāha, Divine Boar incarnate of the Supreme Divine, Paramātman. The
snout of the boar is called िषालः caṣālaḥ. AThis word is of special significance in the
performance of Veda Yajna; िषालः caṣālaḥ is a ring made of wheat chaff and mounted on the top of a sacrificial post; िषालं ये अश्वयूपाय तक्षदत Rv.1.162.6; िषालयूपतन्नच्छो दिरण्यरिनं
दवभुः Bhāg.4.19.19. -2 An iron ring at the base of the post. -3 A hive. As the post, the pillar, yupa goes up in flames, the fumes of the wheat chaff enter the element carbon into molten metal to transform iron into steel. This knowledge system signified by the sculptural protome of Devi Sarasvati on the िषालः caṣālaḥ,snout of the boar. (See Khajuraho temple and breathtaking metaphors on the pratimā of the divnity). The entire body is adorned with sculptural friezes of Veda divinities, blacksmiths, artisans, seafaring merchants of the Civilization.

Mother of Rivers, River Sarasvati is born as this extraordinary collision of two continents unfolds like a Cosmic dance. In Sarasvati-Sindhu Hindu civilization tradition the Cosmic Dance is called ताण्डव tāṇḍava नृत्यम् nṛtyam portrayed in sculptural metaphors. See the bronze sculpture of the Cosmic Dancer who adorns CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, Switzerland.

World’s Greatest Water Tower which nurtures over 2 billion people with fresh, sacred waters, stretches from Hanoi to Caucasus, west of Tehran and Zagros mountains. The Reservoir holds about 2000 growing glaciers on the Northern side and 1500 growing glaciers on the Southern Indian side. The glaciers are growing because the Northern Monsoon rains which fall on these mountain ranges convert to snow and ice above the height of over 8000 ft. The Himalayn ranges rise upto 24000 ft. high, constituting the highest mountain peaks of the world such as Sagar Mata [Nepalese. Also known as Mt. Everest; 8,848 m (29,029 ft)] and Mt. Karakoram K2 [8,611 m (28,251 ft)]. The glaciers yield more than five largest rivers of the globe: Yangtse,Huanghe, Mekong, Irrawaddy, Salween, Brahmaputra, Ganga, Yamuna, Sarasvati, Satluj, Sindhu
Earthquakes caused by these continental plates explain the dynamic rise of the Himalayas across the stretch of over 5200 kms. and also explain the changes in the flows of Himalayan glacier rivers which result in migrations of two major tributaries of River Sarasvati. Satluj, a tributary of Sarasvati migrates westwards at Ropar. Yamuna, a tributary of Sarasvati migrates eastwards close to the Capital of the Civilization, Rakhigarhi, the pattana, the transhipment point between 1. West-flowing navigable Sarasvati River and 2. East-flowing Ganga-Yamuna-Brahmaputra rivers.

The plate tectonic events which resulted in the migrations of Yamuna and Satluj rivers is brilliantly documented in Yamuna and Satluj Tears seen on Sivalik ranges from satellite images. The two tears which resulted in gaps in Sivalik ranges which moved apart controlled by the jutting in Aravalli (Arbuda) ranges into Himalayan peaks are seen in these images.

Satluj River migrated westwards to join the Chenab River (one of five rivers called Panjnad which join Sindhu River) west of Bahawalpur. Panjnad is formed just below Uch by successive junctions of the Satluj, Beas, Ravi, Jhelum and Chenab Rivers. The Panjnad (literally “Five Rivers”) flows 71 kms.southwest to its junction with the Sindhu River near Mithankot.

Charmanwati (also spelled Charmanvati) is a river mentioned in the epic Mahabharata. It is believed that the ancient name of Chambal river was Charmanvati, Charmanwati was the southern boundary of Panchala Kingdom:- King Drupada ruled the southern Panchalas up to the bank of the Charmanwati river (1:140). King Rantideva is mentioned as performing animal sacrifices on the banks of Charmanwati (7:65, 12:29, 13:66). Kunti left her new-born baby (Karna) in a basket and made it float in the river. The basket floated from the river Aswa to the river Charmanwati, and from the Charmanwati it passed to the Yamuna, and so on to the Ganges (3:306) and reached the city called Champapuri the capital of Anga Kingdom.



47
Marching to the banks of the Charmanwati, the Kuru warrior Sahadeva met the son of king Jamvaka, who had, on account of old hostilities, been defeated before by Vasudeva Krishna. The son of Jamvaka gave battle to Sahadeva. And Sahadeva defeating the prince marched towards the south (2:30). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charmanwati There are indications that Chambal river was also called Drsadvati. The Chambal River is a tributary of the Yamuna River in central India, and thus forms part of the greater Gangetic drainage system. The river flows northnortheast through Madhya Pradesh, running for a time through Rajasthan, then forming the boundary between Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh before turning southeast to join the Yamuna in Uttar Pradesh state.This Chambal river pirates River Yamuna and carries the Yamuna waters to create the Triveni Sangamam at Prayagraj.

According to Manusmriti, the Brahmavarta, where the Rishis composed the Vedas and other Sanskrit texts of the Vedic religion, was at the confluence of the Saraswati and Drishadwati rivers during the Vedic period. (Manusmriti, Chapter 2, Shalok 17) Latyayana Srautasutra (10.17) describes it as a seasonal river, with the Saraswati a perennial river until its vinasana (10.15-19). "It says that the land, created by the Gods, which lies between the two divine rivers Sarasvati and Drishadvati, the (sages) call Brahmavarta." The text also says that although the Sarasvati formed the northern boundary of Kuru Pradesh, the Drishadwati flowed in south of Kuru Pradesh and north of Brahmavarta. According to the Mahabharata, the southern boundary of Kuru Pradesh was Guru Drona's ashram (present-day Gurgaon at one end and Rohtak and Jhajjar at the other); therefore, the Drishadwati flowed in the southern portions of these cities. The Drishadvati was identified by Oldham as the Chautang River and in 2000 Talageri identified it with the Hariyupiya and Yavyavati Rivers. In 1871 Alexander Cunningham identified the Rakshi River as the old Drishadvati and demonstrated its flow to have been from Chunar, near Varanasi.
The expression र्सोममािनंर्स in RV 10.125 combines two words: Soma and आिनर्स , which I
submit is a pun on the words which means आिनर्स 'destroyer of the enemy' and
also āhangar ‘blacksmith’ linked with and derived from aśani ‘thunderbolt’ cognate śyena ‘falcon’, sena ‘thunderbolt’. The semantics of aśani ‘thunderbolt’ leads to the expression āhangar ‘blacksmith’. (Pashto. Kashmiri) P آهن āhan, s.m. (9th) Iron. Sing. and Pl. آهن ګر āhan gar, s.m. (5th) A smith, a blacksmith. Pl. آهن ګران āhan-garān. آهن ربا āhan-rubā, s.f. (6th) The magnet or loadstone. (E.) Sing. and Pl.); (W.) Pl. آهن رباوي āhan-rubāwī. (Pashto). Soma has two synonyms in Rgveda: 1. Amśu and 2. Pajra. Pajra is signified by an Indus Script hieroglyph which is a synonym of ेश्यन śyena, the bird which brings Soma from heaven. The word hieroglyph is pajhar, ‘eagle’
(Santali)
Amśu is cognate ancu ‘iron’ (Tocharian); Pajra is cognate pasra ‘smithy, forge’.

https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/िब्द कल्प द्र ुमः The Aravalli Range, an eroded stub of ancient mountains, is the oldest range of fold mountains in India. The natural history of the Aravalli Range dates back to times when the Indian Plate was separated from the Eurasian Plate by an ocean..The Aravalli Range is a



52
northeast-southwest trending orogenic belt that is located in the northwestern part of Indian Peninsula. It is part of the Indian Shield that was formed from a series of cratonic collisions (A craton (/ˈkreɪtɒn/,
/ˈkrætɒn/, or /ˈkreɪtən/;[1][2][3] from Greek: κράτος kratos "strength") is an old and stable part of the continental lithosphere, which consists of the Earth's two topmost layers, the crust and the uppermost mantle.)... The Aravalli-Delhi Orogen is an orogen event that led to a large structural deformation of the Earth's lithosphere (crust and uppermost mantle, such as Aravalli and Himalayas fold mountains) due to the interaction between tectonic plates when a continental plate is crumpled and is pushed upwards to form mountain ranges, and involve a great range of geological processes collectively called orogenesis...Metal sulfide ores were formed in two different epochs, lead and zinc sulfide ores were formed in the sedimentary rocks around 1.8 Ga years ago during Paleoproterozoic phase. The tectonic setting of Zinc-leadcopper sulfides mineralisation in Delhi supergroup rocks in Haryana-Delhi were formed in mantle plume volcanic action around 1 Ga years ago covering Haryana and Rajasthan during mesoproterozoic. In the southern part of Aravalli supergroup arc base metal sulfides were generated near the subduction zone on the western fringe and in zones of back-arc extension to the south-east. Continued subduction produced W-Sn (Tungsten-Tin) mineralisation in S-type (sedimentary unmetamorphosed rock) felsic (volcanic rock) plutons (underground crystallised solidified magma). This includes commercially viable quantities of minerals, such as rock phosphate, lead-zinc, silver mineral deposits at Zawar,Rikhabdev, serpentinite, talc, and pyrophyllite) and asbestos, aparite and beryl.. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aravalli_Range
Aravalli Range, seen from the range's highest point at Guru Shikhar, in Rajasthan
Sahibi or Sabi River, originates near Manoharpur in Sikar district flows through Haryana and meets its confluence with the Yamuna in Delhi where it is called Najafgarh drain, along with its following tributaries. This River is identified as the old Ghaggar-Hakra River (of which Tangri river is a tributary) which is the Sarasvati river. Some identify Sahibi or Sabi River with



53
the Drishadvati river of Vedic period, on the banks of which in the Vedic state of Brahmavarta, Sarasvati-Sindhu civilisation or Vedic Sanskriti developed.
During the mature phases of Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization, Sarasvati River was the major navigable channel linking Meluhha with Ancient Near East. A network of rivers of the Arbuda (Aravalli) ranges including Sabi (Drishadvati) constituted the supply-lines from the hinterland into the navigable channel for maritime trade of copper and other minerals and products made of alloy metals. The site of Rakhigarhi served as the trans-shipment port for controlling the movements of metal products including tin (cassiterite) ores from Brahmaputra-Ganga-Yamuna system and copper-zinc ores from Khetri mines close to Ganeshwar. Thus, Rakhigarhi became the capital of the Sarasvati-Sindhu Polity dealing with Ancient Maritime Trade of metal and gemstone products.
27.632732°N 75.879359°E “Ganeshwar is located near the copper mines of the Sikar-Jhunjhunu area of the Khetri copper belt in Rajasthan. The Ganeshwar-Jodhpura culture group has over 80 other sites currently identified. The period was estimated to be 2500–2000 BC. Historian Ratna Chandra Agrawal wrote that Ganeshwar was excavated in 1977. Excavations revealed copper objects including arrowheads, spearheads, fish hooks, bangles and chisels. With its microliths and other stone tools, Ganeshwar culture can be ascribed to the pre-Harappan period. Ganeshwar saw three cultural phases: Period 1 (3800 BCE) which was characterized by hunting and gathering communities using chert tools; Period II (2800 BCE) shows the beginnings of metal work in copper and fired clay pottery; Period III (2000 BCE) featured a variety of pottery and copper goods being produced. Nearly one thousand pieces of copper were found here. Red pottery was found here with black portraiture. Ganeshwar mainly supplied copper objects to Harappa.The Ganeshwar people partly lived on agriculture and largely on hunting. Although their principle craft was manufacture of copper objects but they were unable to urbanize. With its microliths and other stone tools, much of Ganeshwar culture can be considered a pre-Harappan Chalcolithic culture that contributed to the making of the mature Harappan culture. The copper was obtained in the nearby Aravalli Range.” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganeshwar

The role played by Arbuda (Aravalli ranges) in providing copper for the Tin-Bronze Revolution, attested archaeologically and proved by provenance analysis of Tin-Bronzes of Ancient Near East. (cf. Friedrich Begemann & Schmitt-Strecker researches). The role of Arbuda functioning as a water-divide in Bharatam, explaining the eastwards and westwards flow of Himalayan glacier rivers is alluded to in a Rgveda metaphor. The reference to Arbuda in RV 10.67.12 is significant. The metaphor is that the head of Arbuda was cleft asunder by Indra to set free the Seven Rivers. This metaphor is explained by the Yamuna Tear fault where the ridge of Arbuda (Aravalli) ranges jutting into the Himalayas results in the migration eastwards of Yamuna River close to Rakhigarhi, caused by Plate Tectonic upheavals which rent asunder the Sivalik ranges resulting in the Yamuna Tear which moved the waters originally flowing through Bata divide. The tectonic uplift of the type caused by Bhuj earthquake of 26 January 2001 might have resulted in the plate tectonic upheaval of the ridge near Rakhigarhi resulting in the migration eastwards,along the east of the Arbuda water divide, of River Yamuna flowing through the Yamuna Tear also caused by plate tectonic upheavals.

Dynamic Himalayas exercise, through ongoing Plate Tectonic events, total structural control over the drainage systems of Himalayan glacial flows. For e.g., Satluj migrated westwards and Yamuna migrated eastwards; both were Himalayan river tributaries of River Sarasvati.

In this article, Javed N. Malik and C. Mohanty demonstrate how Satluj River which was flowing southward through the Soan Dun got deflected westwards through the Satluj Tear of Sivalik Ranges.This Tear is dramatically evidenced on an ISRO satellite image. This westward shift of Satluj River occurs at Ropar, an archaeological site of Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization. Thus, plate tectonic events resulted in the Satluj River abandoning its tributary status to the Sarasvati River system and migrated with a steep turn westwards to join the Beas/Sindhu Rivers. It is most significant that Sarasvati Civilization sites are marked by a number of archaeological sites south of Ropar, along the southflowing palaeochannels of Satluj River until it joins Sarasvati River at Shatrana, resulting a palaeo-channel width of a staggering 20 kms.at this place, Shatrana.
This plate tectonic event resulting in migration of Satluj River weswards away from River Sarasvati occurred sometime after the Mature Phase of Sarasvati Civilization, i.e. ca.2000 BCE. Prior to this date, Satluj River flowed through Soan Dun and Pinjore Dun and emerged through the Ghaggar River Tear of Sivalik ranges. The palaeo-channels of Satluj called Naiwal south of Ropar upto Shatrana are explained by the LANDSAT images analysed by Yashpal et al.

Quartzite tools of lower Paleolithic period were excavated in this region extending from Pinjore in Haryana to Nalagarh (Solan district in Himachal Pradesh.)” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinjore

Aurobindo translation with elaborations: May purifying Sarasvati with all the plenitude of her forms of plenty, rich in substance by the thought, desire our sacrifice. She, the impeller to happy truths, the awakener in consciousness to right mentalisings, Sarasvati, upholds the sacrifice. Sarasvati by the perception awakens in consciousness the great flood (the vast movement of the ritam) and illumines entirely all the thoughts.
Aurobindo notes that "the symbolism of the Veda betrays itself to the greatest clearness in the figure of the goddess Sarasvati ... She is, plainly and clearly, the goddess of the World, the goddess of a divine inspiration ..."
Wilson translation RV 1.3.10 May Sarasvati_, the purifier, the bestower of food, the recompenser of worship with wealth, be attracted by our offered viands to our rite. [Sarasvati_ = va_g-devata_, divinity of speech].

Niruktam explains the expression as a metaphor which conveys semantics -- विनवन्तः ।
When Soma is pressed out without any residue (as brilliantly elaborated by Vipin Kumar Mahodaya; see appended explanatory note), the full product is realized. Sayana explains the expression as अदभषूयमाणाः : अदभ-षु ( 3 √ुर्स ) , (3. pl. -षु्ण्व /अस्न्त ; ind.p. -ष्/उत्य ) to press out
(with stones) the र्सोम juice (or any other juice) S3Br. &c ; to press out with the help of any
liquid Mn. v , 10 (Pass. 3. pl. -षूयेन्त ) Sus3r. ; (fut. p. -र्सोष्यत् cf. Pa1n2. 8-3 , 117) to
moisten Bhat2t2. : Caus. -षावयदत Pa1n2. 8-3 , 65 Comm. In RV 9.75.5 the metaphor is explained by Sayana as loud-sounding proclamation of the resultant full product. नामन् nāman in Vedic is ‘mark, sign, token’; मिन्नाम is the name of the abundantly realized product. Thus, in RV 10.125 the expression Somam Ahanasam refers to the full realized product (concentrating the full essence or sap), wealth of Soma.

RV 2.13.1 Griffith translation: RV 2.13.1. THE Season was the parent, and when born therefrom it entered rapidly the floods wherein it grows. Thence was it full of sap, streaming with milky juice: the milk of the plants' stalk is chief and meet for lauds. RV 2.13.1 Wilson translation The season (of the rains) is the parent (of the Soma), which, as soon as born of her, enters into the waters in which it grows; thence it is fit for expression, as concentrating (the essence of the) water, and the juice of the Soma is especially to be praised (as the libation proper for Indra).

Some devas represent the forces of nature and some represent moral values (such as the Rudra, As’vinA, “त्वष्ट्ा र TvASTara,Pushana, Bhaga, Varuna, and Mitra), each symbolizing the epitome of a specialized knowledge, creative energy, exalted and magical powers The most referred to Devas in the Rig Veda are Indra, Agni (fire) and Soma, with "fire deity" called the friend of all humanity, it and Soma being the two celebrated in a yajna fire. When she holds and bears these celestial forces, she attains the status of राष्ट् र ी॑ ‘the Supreme Being’, the holder of all celestial forces, in all facets of human endeavour.

[quote] HOT METAL (LIQUID IRON):
It is the hot, liquid, metallic iron product obtained upon reduction of iron ore (normally in Blast Furnace or in Corex Furnace). It contains about 93-94% Iron (Fe) and other elements/impurities like Carbon (4%), Silicon (~1%), Manganese (+1%) Sulphur, Phosphorus etc. Hot metal is the primary input for production of steel in the Integrated Steel Plants.[unquote] https://steel.gov.in/glossary-terms-definitions-commonly-used-iron-steelindustry

This is comparable to the expression aham somamāhanasam in RV 10.125 which can be interpreted to mean: I am Soma, pressed liquid hot iron -- āhan which is the explanation of a hot liquid form of Soma to become āhanasam as endorsed in वािस्पत्यम् : “तिािना अभवत् दपुप्यषी ”

RV 2.13.1 (Griffith)
THE Season was the parent, and when born therefrom it entered rapidly the floods wherein it grows.
Thence was it full of sap, streaming with milky juice: the milk of the plants' stalk is chief and meet for lauds.
In my view, this sap referred to in RV 2.13.1 is a transformed form of Soma into a liquid (watery) form, ready for आहनस् āhanas आिन्र्स a. [आ-िन्-अुर्सन् ] 1 To be beaten or pressed out (as Soma).
I suggest that this is a reference to hot liquid form of iron is alluded to in the Expression aham somamāhanasam in RV 10.125.
The transformation signified on RV 2.13.1 is explained in Wilson's translation of RV 2.13.1 which specifies the 'watery (liquid) form 'fit for expression, as concentrating (the essence of the) water and the juice of Soma.':
RV 2.13.1 The season (of the rains) is the parent (of the Soma), which, as soon as born of her, enters into the waters in which it grows; thence it is fit for expression, as concentrating (the essence of the) water, and the juice of the Soma is especially to be praised (as the libation proper for Indra).
RV 5.42.13 (Griffith) My newest song, thought that now springs within me, I offer to the Great, the Sure Protector,
Who made for us this All, in fond love laying each varied form within his Daughters' bosom.

The Indus Script inscriptions are wealth-accounting ledgers.
Rāṣṭrī if feminine form of Rāṣṭram, 'nation'.
The sūktam (RV 10.125) is rendered as a soliloquy, an oration or proclamation by R̥ ṣikā vāgāmbh ̥rṇī.
The word vāgāmbh ̥rṇī is a metaphor which signifies:
vāc, vāk 'speech, knowledge' वाच् f. (fr. √ वि्) speech , voice , talk , language (also of animals) , sound (also of inanimate objects as of the stones used for pressing , of a drum &c ) RV. &c(वािम्- √ऋ , ईर् , or इष् , to raise the voice , utter a sound , cry , call); a word ,
saying , phrase , sentence , statement , asseveration Mn. MBh. &c (वािं- √वि् , to speak words
; वािं व्या - √हृ , to utter words ; वािं- √िा with dat. , to address words to ; वािा ंर्सत्य - √कृ , to promise verbally in marriage , plight troth); Speech personified (in various manners or forms e.g. as वाि् आृम्भणी in RV. x , 125 ; as the voice of the middle sphere in Naigh. and Nir. ;
in the वेि she is also represented as created by प्रजा -पदत and married to him ; in other places she
is called the mother of the वेिs and wife of इन्द्र ; in VP. she is the daughter of िक्ष and wife
of कश्य प ; but most frequently she is identified with भारती or र्सरस्वती , the goddess of speech
; वािः र्साम and वािो व्रतम् N. of र्सामन् s A1rshBr. ; वािः स्तोमः , a partic. एका*ि S3rS. )
ambhas 'water' अम्भस् n. (cf. अ्भ्र /अ , /अुम्ब ) , water RV. &c , the celestial waters AitUp.; power ,

̥rṇī personification and feminine form of ऋण 'debt owed, fort': n. anything due , obligation , duty
, debt (a Brahman owes three debts or obligations , viz. 1 . ह्मब्रिया or " study of the वेिs " , to
the ऋदषs ; 2. sacrifice and worship , to the gods ; 3. procreation of a son , to the Manes TS. vi , 3 , 10 , 5 Mn. vi , 35 , &c ; in later times also , 4. benevolence to mankind and 5. hospitality to guests are added MBh. &c ) RV.

The proclamation of R̥ ṣikā vāgāmbh ̥rṇī in Rāṣṭrī sūktam (RV 10.125) is that debt is owed by all citizens of a nation, because the wealth of a nation is created by the fortress of water, a knowledge system, moving wealth cargo on the navigable waterway.
The intimations of a navigable waterway are apparent from these expressions:

Manasarovar lake yields River Sutudri (Satluj) which joins as a tributary to River Sarasvati.
River Sarasvati originates from glaciers of Bandarpunch massif of Himalayas.

The flow of Yamuna at present is through Uttarakhand, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Himalachal Pradesh and Delhi before merging with Ganga at Prayagraj, Triveni Sangamam. Yamuna carried the waters of the captured channels of River Sarasvati to create this Sangamam, Confluence of three rivers
.
Yamuna river at Yamunotri
This identification of River Satluj as a major tributary of River Sarasvati is central to an understanding of the River Sarasvati System as a navigable waterway, for periods from 7th millennium BCE to 3rd millennium BCE..
“Sinha et al (2013) utilized resistivity surveys and drill cores to confirm the presence of the buried palaeochannel in the Ghaggar plains and to establish its upstream connectivity.Two transacts for resistivity soundings mapped the sub-surface lithology of the region close to Kalibangan and Kunal across the large valley partially occupied by the Ghaggar river channel at present (Figure 2.3). The third transect, SRH, was located across the trace of a palaeohchannel near Sirhd in Punjab close to the Himalayan front. This palaeochannel was originally identified by Yashpal et al (1980) as a possible former course of the Satluj River. Although this area lies in the semi-humid region with an average rainfall of 690 mm per year, there is no major surface drainage in this region. This modern Satluj flows ~150 km west and the Yamuna flows ~150 km east of this transect. It has been suggested that the Satluj flowed through this region before moving west (Yashpal et al, 1980).” (Report of the Expert

The average width of palaeo-channels (old channels) is about 6 km.; at a place called Shatrana, the width is as much as 20 kms since Satluj joins Sarasvati at this place.
Plate tectonics (earthquakes) resulted in the migrations of major tributary Rivers Satluj and Yamuna westward at Ropar (for Satluj) and eastward, near Rakhigarhi (for Yamuna) thus abandoning flows into River Sarasvati. The westward migration of Satluj and eastward migration of Yamuna are due to the water-divide in Northwest Bharat caused by the high ridge of Aravalli



94
(Arbuda) mountain which passes through close to Rakhigarhi. The eastward flow of Yamuna along this ridge was caused by the tectonic shift, tearing up Shivalik ranges moving the Himalayan waters flowing eastwards through this tear at Paonta Saheb (Dehradun). A satellite picture attached.

For this purpose, satellite images of IRS P6 LISS-3 data (23.5m resolution) of Februar 2004 and Radarsat SAR data (50 m resolution of December 2002 have been processed to delineate palaeochannels. In this area, Radarsat SAR image could pick up a wide moist zone (turquoise channel with dark tone), possibly indicating a subsurface palaeochannels that matches with the signatures of IRS LISS-3 image. The delineated palaeochannel between Ropar and Patiala is named as ‘Satluj palaeochannel’ which is represented by N-S trending tortuous
palaeochannel extending for a length of about 75 km with having width from ~1 to 6 km. The Satluj palaeochannel is connecting present day Satluj River near Ropar and the Ghaggar River in the south of Patiala. Thus, the Satluj, Saraswati and Drishadvati palaeochannels possibly contributed to the main Vedic Saraswati to form a mighty flowing River in the past.” (Bhadra, B.K.and J.R.

Sarasvati Basin in 3rd millennium BCE (After Fig.1 BB Lal, 2002. The Saraswati Flows on: the Continuity of Indian Culture. New Delhi: Aryan Books International )
Prof. BB Lal suggests the following tasks for multidiciplinary researches and activities by ASI, GSI and Dept. of Tourism: 1. We have discovered at Bhirrana a very early stage of the Harappan Civilization, which goes back to the 6th millennium BCE. There must have been still earlier stages in the evolution. Hence intensive exploration should be carried out in the nearby areas, particularly the sub-Siwalik regions to discover the same. Action: ASI
2. The excavated remains at Kalibangan are in a pitiable condition, owing to four decades of utter neglect. These, along with those at Rakhigarhi, another important Harappan site in the region, should be properly conserved and face-lifted for tourism. Action: ASI and Dept. of Tourism
3. At Kalibangan, the evidence of hydrology, archaeology and C-14 method of dating has shown that the Sarasvati dried up around 2000 BCE. This ought to be confirmed by independent dating of the emergence of the Bata-Markanda Divide which blocked the route of the Sarasvati in the Himalayas (next slide). Action: GSI
4. Because of the sudden diversion of the waters of the Sarasvati into the Yamuna large-scale flooding took place in the upper Ganga-Yamuna basin, around 2000 BCE: Evidence from Bahadarabad in UP confirms this, where a 3-metre thick deposit of silt and sand overlies the remains of Copper Hoard Culture. The date of this flood, the first of its kind in ancient Indian history, should be determined independently, on geological grounds. Action: GSI
In this context, BB Lal notes that the Satapatha Brahmana, which is ascribable to the 2nd millennium BCE, does refer to a massive flood that wiped off most of the settlements. Only Manu and a few sages were rescued by a fish (Matsyavatara of Vishnu) taking them in a boat to the northern



105
mountains. After the recession of the flood, they returned to the plains and settlements started afresh. This ‘’afresh” is also attested to by archaeology.
Sites of Copper-hoard culture including Hastināpura.
I invite particular reference to the following image which shows the stratigraphy of Hastinapura:
In a seminar held in March 2017, BB Lal noted: "Archaeologically, the deluge of the Saraswati took place around 2000-1,900 Before Common Era (BCE) or broadly, in the first quarter of the second millennium BCE. This was exactly the time of Manu's flood, which occurred after the Rigveda, but before the beginning of the second millennium BCE. Should we still call Manu's Flood a myth?" His presentation suggested that the flood may explain the enormous layers of sediments in the Copperhoard sites such as Bahadarabad.
The same reason may also explain the presence of large sand layers in Hastinapura site investigated earlier by BB Lal. See the slide of Hastinapura stratigraphy.
“At a number of places such as Bahadrabad, Nasirpur, Jhinjhana, Hastinapur, Noh, Ahichchatra, Atranjikhera, etc., these (OCW) waves have been noticed to occur sporadically. Otherwise clean plain, which imperceptibly merge into natural soil. Indications are that these deposits may be water-laid. Are we then faced here with a huge deluge covering hundreds of miles of the GangaYamuna basin? Chronologically, this deluge may have to be placed some time about the middle of the second millennium BCE. Again, though there is a strong circumstantial evidence that this ware may have associated with the Copper-Hoards.” Ochre colour pottery and copper hoard



106
tools, Chapter IV, (pp. 130131) http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/36863/5/chapter%204.pdf
Given the enormity of the sand, silt layers below the 1200 BCE OCW layer reported from Hastinapura, it is likely that the human settlement may have been in existence, at Hastinapura, for an extended period, much earlier to 1200 BCE.
This suggests a re-evaluation of the chronological sequencing of Copper-Hoard culture which may have started co-terminus with the late phases of Sarasvati (Harappan) civilization sites such as Bhirrana and Rakhigarhi. The anthropomorphs found in Copper-Hoard sites with Indus Script hypertexts, is also a corroborative evidence for the continuity of Sarasvati civilization in Coppper-Hoard culture.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Sarasvati is known as the holiest river of India, as much as it has retained its sacred character right from the Rigvedic age to the present day. The name `Sarasvati’ is frequently used most of the ancient literatures like Rigveda, Yajurveda, Mahabharatha and Puranas. The Rigveda is supposed to be the oldest text which was probably composed more than 8000 years ago. The river Sarasvati is described in the Rigvedic literature as the ‘Ambitame, Naditame, Devitame’ that is the best of mothers, best of rivers and the best of Goddess. The river was one of the mightiest rivers of the Vedic period and must have been significantly broad and perennial. The Vedic Sarasvati, a mighty and holy river of northwest India during 6000-3000 B.C., originated from Bandarpunch glacier in Garhwal Himalayas and finally discharged into the Gulf of Khambat in Gujarat coast and disappeared around 3000 B.C. Several remnants of this river exist as palaeochannels (Ghose et al., 1979; Gupta, 1996; Mishra, 1995; Radhakrishna, 1999; Valdiya, 2002; Yash Pal et al., 1980). Today the Vedic Sarasvati River is represented by the Ghaggar River which flows on palaeochannel of Vedic Sarasvati, located in the western part of the Haryana state (Bhadra et al., 2006). The Vedic Sarasvati River has been flowing sub-parallel to the Indus River in NW India (Krishnan, 1952; Oldham, 1893; Pilgrim, 1919; Stein, 1942; Wilhelmy, 1999). The discovery of the sites of Harappan civilization along the banks of Sarasvati River also indicates towards mighty and its magnanimity. This ancient civilization is believed to have come to a sudden end as a result of neotectonics as well as climatic change. Due to these causes, river Sarasvati which once flowed in true majesty dwindled to an ephemeral stream and finally got lost in the sand of Thar Desert (Fig.1). Rivers of Punjab, Haryana, western Rajasthan and the northern Gujarat, present an interesting and complex evolutionary history of drainage development dating back to middle Pleistocene. The study of `Lost River Sarasvati’ becomes a fascination which leads to unflagging interest in the minds of the Scholars and Scientists in India and abroad.

1.1 Topographical Variation of the Region using DEM Physiographic features of northwest India can be depicted on the slope map (Fig.2) which is generated through SRTM DEM (90m resolution). It shows an extensive stretch of gently sloping flat land from northeast to southwest with an elevation range between 270m in the foothills of the Himalaya and the seacoast of Gujarat. A number of streams emerged from the southern slope of Siwalik Hills and flow towards southwest direction and joins Ghaggar River. Except the foothill tract of Himalaya, a vast stretch of northwest India is comprised of alluvium deposits which are composed of clay, silt and sand. A hot and dry summer, southwest monsoon season and a bracing cold season characterize the climate of the area.
1.2 Physiographic Divisions of Northwest India
1.2.1 Physiographic Divisions of Rajasthan: There are two natural divisions of Rajasthan. The northwest tract is sandy and unproductive with little water, but improves gradually from desert land in the far west and southeast to comparatively fertile and habitable land towards the east. Western part of Rajasthan is charaterised by aeolian sands and alluvium in the Thar Desert. In the southwest of Rajasthan, many hillocks form as a part of Aravalli chain of mountains.
The main physiographical features of Rajasthan are as follows:
(a) Western Sandy plains
(i) Sandy Arid plains (Marusthali) (ii) Semi-Arid transitional plains (Rajasthan Bagar)
(b) Aravalli Range and hilly region
(i) Aravalli Range and Bhorat Plateau.
(ii) Northeastern hilly region
(c) Eastern Plains
(i) Banas Basin
(ii) Chappan Plains
(d) Southeastern Rajasthan-Pathar (Harauti Plateau)
(i) Vindhyan Scarpland
(ii) Deccan Lava Trap
1.2.2 Physiographic Divisions of Haryana:
Haryana can be divided into four major Physiographical features:
(a) Siwalik Hills - Altitude varies between 900m to 2300m. These hills are the source of the river like Sarasvati, Ghaggar, Dangri and Markanda.
(b) Ghaggar-Yamuna Plains - It is divided into two parts viz. the higher one is called ‘Bhangar’ and the lower one is called ‘Khadar’. This alluvial plain is made up of sand, calcareous balls like gravel, locally known as ‘Kankar’.



108
(c) Semi-Desert Sandy Plain - This area is bordered with Rajasthan and Haryana including the districts of Sirsa, parts of Fatehabad, Hisar, Bhiwani and Mahendragarh. (d) Aravalli Hills - This is a dry area with uneven irregular landscape.
1.2.3 Physiographic Divisions of Gujarat:
Different phusiographic features of Gujarat are given below.
(a) Coastal Zone – Present in the southern part of the state.
(b) Kachchh Mainland - The central part of state composed of rocky land with hill in the north and coastal plains.
(c) Banani Plains - It is characterized by fluviomarine sediments, with mud flats and soft pans.
(d) Two Ranns - Great Rann in the north and Little Rann in the east, comprising vast saline wasteland
1.3 Drainage System of Northwest India A few thousand years back several mighty rivers drained the northwestern part of India and these now stands disrupted, partly destroyed and preserved only as poor River Sarasvati in Northwest India Regional Remote Sensing Centre, NRSC/ISRO, Dept. of Space, Govt. of India, Jodhpur relicts making up the present day drainage system. The bounty of the Himalayan Rivers sustains the entire Indo-Gangetic plains except for the tract that embraces southwest Haryana, southern Punjab and western Rajasthan. This vast river-less tract is underlained by nearly 10-30 m thick mantles of riverine sediments of younger age characterized by a multiplicity of channels in which only flood waters flow for extremely limited durations. The wide channels are either choked with sediments or are buried under the sands of the Thar Desert (Raghav, 1999).
Presently, northwestern part of India is drained by three major independent river systems namely Yamuna, Satluj and Ghaggar (Sarasvati). Yamuna and Satluj are perennial river systems while the Ghaggar is mainly ephemeral. The Satluj River originates in the Himalayas from the holy lake of Mansarovar in Tibet and enters the plains near Ropar (Punjab), where it takes a sharp right-angled turn and flows westward over a distance of 150 km before being joined by the Beas river near Firozpur. The river is joined by Sirsa nadi, Siswan nadi, Chikni nadi, Bakhi nadi and Haripur nadi from the east. It flows as a highly meandering and sinuous river. Further north, Tons River originates from Bandarpunch glacier in Garhwal Himalya and joins with Yamuna River at Paonta Sahib. The Yamuna River originates from the Yamunotri glacier and reaches the plains near Yamunnagar. The Yamuna River and its tributaries are originating from the central Himalayas and display typical rectangular drainage pattern. Most of the streams are joining each other at right angles, which exhibit that it is flowing through a structurally controlled terrain. Giri River meets Yamuna near Paonta about 12km upstream from the confluence of Bata and Yamuna. The Yamuna, which was supposed to be a major tributary of Sarasvati, got diverted through the Yamuna tear fault was earlier flowing through the Bata river course and joining the Markanda river. The wide valley of the small Bata River supports this. The Ghaggar River rises in the Siwaliks from the Morni hills and enters the plains near Ambala (Haryana). After covering a distance of 175 km it joins the Sarasvati at Rasula (Patiala district). The combined river now known as Ghaggar flows through Sirsa (Haryana), Hanumangarh and Ganganagar districts (Rajasthan) and through the Bahawalpur state (Pakistan). The Sarasvati rises in the Sirmur region of the Siwaliks and enter the plains at Adi Badri (Yamunanagar district of Haryana). After



109
flowing through Yamunanagar, Kurukshetra and Karnal districts in Haryana it joins the Ghaggar near Rasula (Patiala district-Punjab). The Ghaggar bed dries up near Sirsa. The Ghaggar is also noticed to have flowed along straight lines joined together at sharp angles. This reflects structural control as the old Ghaggar must have flowed into an unstable channel controlled by lineaments. Markanda River originates from Nahan in Sirmaur district of Himachal Pradesh and reaches the plains in Ambala and later joins the Ghaggar in Patiala district. The river acts as a divide between the BataMarkanda complex and the Giri river.
The following four major rivers have been mentioned in Rigvedic literature (Sridhar et al., 1999). (a) Sindhu (Indus) and its tributaries like Vitasa (Jhelam) and Asikni (Chenab) River Sarasvati in Northwest India Regional Remote Sensing Centre, NRSC/ISRO, Dept. of Space, Govt. of India, Jodhpur 5 (b) Shatadru (Satluj) and its two major tributaries like Vipasa (Beas) and Parasuni (Ravi) (c) Sarasvati and its several tributaries in its upper reaches viz. Markanda, Ghaggar, Chautang, Dangri etc. (d) Drishadvati with Lavanavati (?) as one of its tributaries.
These rivers originated in the Himalaya and flow across Rajasthan, Gujarat and parts of Pakistan and meet at Rann of Kachchh of Arabian Sea. Out of the four river systems, Indus and Satluj are still flowing today through vast tract of IndoGangetic alluvium plain. However, Sarasvati and Drishadvati have been destroyed (dried) completely whose remants can be found below the sands of Thar Desert. Oldham (1893) reported the existence of a dry bed of older Satluj course as Hakra which flowed through Bikaner and Bhawalpur. When Satluj changed its course westward to meet Beas and finally the Indus, its abandoned eastern arm (Hakra) was left as deserted cnhanel. The lower course of Satluj was referred as Hakra, Sankra, Wandan, Wahind and Nara. Thus, dry channel of Hakra-Nara was presumed to the old course of Satluj River. Occurrence of a large number of archaeological sites (Harappan) between Indus and Hakra-Nara (Satluj) indicates the furishment of Harappan civilization. However, recent studies show the existence of an independent river system along Indo-Pak border which runs paralle to Indus River. Based on historical, archaeological and physiographic evediences, this river is regarded as `Sarasvati River’ which is flowing as sub-surface palaeochannel in northwest India. The rivers of the Sarasvati and the Indus systems have together built a vast floodplain that forms the western part of the Indo-Gangetic Plains. This plain embraces the northern upland of the Indian Shield up to the foothill of the Himalaya. A large part of the Sarasvati-Indus Plain is now covered by windblown sand, heaped as ridges and dunes in the Thar Desert. The rocky area sloping gently westwards and northwestwards in front of the Aravalli range is covered by a thin discontinuous veneer of varied sediments. This NE-SW trending Aravalli Range thus marks the eastern limit of the domain of the Sarasvati-Indus Rivers. 1.3.2 Sarasvati-Ghaggar River System: Sarasvati Nadi (also known as Sarasvati River, Sarasvati Nala, Sarsuti and Chautang in certain segments) in northern Haryana is one of the important tributary of the Ghaggar River system. The Sarasvati Nadi flows seasonally from Adi Badri and passes through Bilaspur, Mustafabad, Thanesar, Bibipur and Pehowa and ultimately joins river Ghaggar near Rasauli village in Punjab. Presently, Sarswati Nadi is in defunct state and exibitsts as a discontinuous drainage. Existence of a large number of archaeological sites along the river suggests it to be an important drainage of the past. Though Adi Badri is located on the bank of River Somb, but local people believe that Sarasvati originates at Adi Badri. Mention of Sarasvati Nadi of Haryana has been made in drainage related studies carried out by various authors in this region. However, exclusive studies on this drainage system are very rare. As seen on the SOI topomaps, Sarasvati Nadi originates from a place called `Rampur Herian’ which is located south of Adi Badri in Yamunanagar district. The existence of



110
Sarasvati Nadi from Rampur Herian to Bibipur is seen clearly on the topomaps and satellite images. On Survey of India (SOI) topomap of 1969-70, it is shown as Sarasvati Nala / Nadi / River. The name `Sarasvati/Sarsuti’ Nadi in Haryana has been mentioned elsewhere in the earlier literatures (Chauhan, 1999; Kalyanraman, 1999; Kochhar, 2000; Radhakrishna, 1999; Valdiya, 2002).
Sarasvati Nadi is believed to be a sacred river in Haryana. This is evident from the occurrence of several historical temples, pilgrimage and Hindu ritual sites and relics of archaeological sites all along the course of this river indicating it to be a perennial river in the past. Most of these pilgrim sites belong to either PostHarappan or Mahabharata period. The river passes through Yamunanagar, Kurukshetra, Kaithal and Fatehabad districts and joins with River Ghaggar at Rasauli village near Shatrana in Patiala district of Punjab. Drainage pattern of Sarasvati Nadi, derived from the SOI topomaps, shows two southwesterly flowing sub-parallel streams on either side of the Chautang Nala which crisscross at several places between Purangarh and Babain villages. The shifting of their course is possibly due to discontinuous discharge in the past. The local people strongly believe that Adi Badri is the place of origin of Sarasvati Nadi which is the main Vedic Sarasvati River. Local populace performs different Hindu rituals along this river course. The floodplain, through which the River Sarasvati once flowed, slopes southwest from an elevation of nearly 250m altitude above sea level in the Ambala-Ludhiana tract to the low-lying marshy stretch of the Great Rann of Kachchh. This floodplain was built on the northern marginal shelf of the Indian shield that had sagged gently as it slid under the Himalaya. In this sunken part of the Indian crust, known as the Himalayan Foredeep, huge piles of the detritus were deposited by the rivers originating from the rising Himalaya. Some part of the sediments was also contributed by the Aravallli Hills. The drainage modification in the last 10,000 years of the Holocene period is manifested by the streams abandoning of old courses. The abumdoned courses are recognizable as curvilinear or meandering segments of dry channels amidst the sea of sand. Remote sensing techniques helped to locate these buried channels on the satellite images. The interpretation of the satellite imagery indicates progressive westward shift of the river courses. This phenomenon is discernable in both the northern Sarasvati (Ghaggar) basin and the southern Lavanavati (Luni) basin. As stated earlier, the Barwani-Jaisalmer Ridge that has been rising and has consequently causes shift of the drainage, separates the two independent basins. The Sarasvati-Drishadvati system that belonged to the northern basin migrated progressively northwest or west over time, to occupy the present Ghaggar-Hakra line, and the Lavanavati occupied the southern basin and shifted in the southerly direction. The Sarasvati and across the Barwani-Jaisalmer water divide, the lavanavati remained independent of one another throughout the geological history.
Sinha et al. (2013) opined that major palaeo-river channel course, the GhaggarHakra, flowed in the interfluve between the modern Yamuna and Satluj rivers in the western Ganges basin during the Late Quaternary. A thick and extensive sand body is present in the subsurface in parts of north-western Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab. The dimensions of the palaeochannel bodies imply that these are the deposits of a large river system.
1.3.3 Drishadvati River System: Drishadvati system of Haryana is also an ancient river system, more or less contemporary to Vedic Sarasvati. It is proved by the mention of Drishadvati in Rig Veda and occurrence of a large number of Harappan sites along its course (Kar and Ghosh, 1984; Sahai, 1999). There is no continuous trace of River Drishadvati in central Haryana which is attributed mainly due to the disturbance of original ground through digging of dense canal



111
network in this region. But its presence can be inferred from discontinuous drainage, Vedic literature and archaeological findings. It is believed by most of the previous workers that the course of Western Yamuna Canal has been constructed along the palaeocourse of River Drishadvati (Ghosh et al., 1979; Kar and Ghosh, 1984; Oldham, 1893; Wilhelmy, 1999; Yash Pal et al., 1980). The Chautang Nala (1.0 - 1.5 km wide channel) is considered as the main tributary of the Drishadvati River.
1.4 Objectives
The following are the main objectives of the present work.
• Delineation of palaeochannels using IRS P6 AWiFS, LISS-III and LISS-IV data.
• Physiographic study using SRTM DEM.
• Preparation GIS database for road, rail, settlement, administrative boundary, existing drainage, location of archaeological and drilling sites.
• Field validation of the palaeochannels using historical data, archaeological sites, sedimentology (drilling/litholog), hydrogeology and geochronology data.
• Study of available geochronological ages of sand, water, artifacts.
• Possible River Linkages of Vedic Saraswai with Somb, Tons/Yamuna, Drishadvati and Satluj Rivers.
• Reconstruction of palaeodrainage network from Mann Sarovar to Dwaraka.
1.5 Methodology
In the present study, satellite data from IRS P3 WiFS, IRS P6 AWiFS (56m), LISSIII (23.5m) and LISS-IV (5.8m) of February, 2004 have been used to delineate the course of the palaeochannels in NW India. For specific area, Landsat ETM and Radarsat SAR data also have been used for palaeochannel mapping. The extent of Thar Desert and the present day drainages in NW India have been shown on Landsat imge (Fig.3). All these data have been digitally processed in ERDAS/Imagine software (version 10.0). Digital image processing techniques like histogram equalization, piece/scene wise linear stretching, contrast and brightness enhancement, different band combinations and edge enhancement etc. have been applied on the satellite data. Present day drainages are traced from IRS P6 LISSIV data (5.8m resolution) and the Survey of India topomaps (1969). For integrated study, GIS database of various thematic layers (administrative boundary, settlement, road, rail, drainage, well location, archaeological sites etc.) have been prepared by using ARC/MAP software (version 10.0). The delineated palaeochannels are validated with various ground data and collateral information from archaeology, sedimentology, hydrogeology and petrography.

2.1 Vedic Literature
The Sarasvati River is described in most of the scriptures of India. There are frequent references of Sarasvati in Vedic literatures (Chauhan, 1999; Kochhar, 1997). No other river has received so much importance and respect as Sarasvati. Rigveda, the oldest of four Vedas contains ample information about the lost Sarasvati River than that of River Ganges. There are seventy-five Mantras spread over all the ten Mandals (books) except the fourth. A few hymns are there in Yajurveda and Artharvaveda also. The hymns are composed by different Rishis (scholars) in glory of River Sarasvati. Some of them are listed below:
2.1.1 Sarasvati as described in the Rigveda: ambitame nadi tame devitame Sarasvati aprasasta iva smasi prasastimamba naskridhi (2:41:16) Best of mothers, best of rivers, best of rivers, best of Goddesses, Sarasvati we are ignorant & untrained, give us wisdom & knowledge. aa yatsaakam yashaso vaavashaanah Sarasvati saptathi sindhumaataa yaah susvayanta sudughaah sudhaa raa abhiswena payasaa pipyaanaah (7:36:6) May the glorious seventh (stream) Sarasvati, the mother of Sindhu & other (rivers) charged with copious volume of water, flow vigorously; come together, gifting abundant food & milk. Sarasvati sarayuh sindururmibhirmaho mahiravasaa yantu vaksanih devirapo maatarah sudiyitnvo ghrittavatpayo madhumanno Arcata (10:64:9) Let great streams with mighty currents come to protect us- Sarasvati, Sarayu, Sindhu, Ye Goddesses give us butter & honey.
2.1.2 Sarasvati in Yajurveda: pancanadhyah Sarasvatimapi yanti sasrotasah Sarasvati tu pancadhaa so deshe abhavat sarit (34:11) (1803) River Sarasvati in Northwest India Regional Remote Sensing Centre, NRSC/ISRO, Dept. of Space, Govt. of India, Jodhpur 10 The five



114
equally celebrated rivers, merged with the mighty Sarasvati. The same Sarasvati got (divide) into five glorified flows in the country. It is, therefore, obvious that the Sarasvati has five important tributaries. They were the Drishadvati, the Satudri (Satluj), the Chandrabagha (Chenab), the Vipasa (Vyas), & the Iravati (Ravi). This Mantra supports the earlier assumption that all the above stated rivers of Punjab were tributaries of Sarasvati. The second part of the Mantra is still interesting which state that the Sarasvati was divided into five parts (pancadha). These ought to be the five distributaries of the Sarasvati; through them the river merges to the Sindhu Sagar (the Arabian Sea).
2.1.3 Sarasvati in Atharvaveda: devaa imam madhunaam sanyutam yavam sarasvatyaa madhi manaavacarkriyuh aasit sirapatih shatakratuh kinasha aasan marutah sudaanavah (6:30:10) God bestowed the people on the bank of the Sarasvati, with sweet juicy barley, where generous Maruts became farmers & Indra as the Lord of agriculture. This Mantra suggests that farming of cereals was practiced on the fertile soil of Sarasvati during Vedic times.
2.1.4 Sarasvati in Manusmriti: Sarasvati drisadvatvor devanadhyory dantaram Tam deva nirmitam desham brahmavart pracakshate (3.17) The land between the Sarasvati & Drishadvati is created by God; this land is defined as Brahmavarta.
2.1.5 Sarasvati in Mahabharata: The Sarasvati River continued to be a celebrated river during the Mahabharata time also. It was referred as mother of the Vedas. Vedanam mataram pusya (Mbh. Santiparva 12920) Mahabharata gives clear geographical accounts of a number of pilgrimage
sites spread along the course of the Sarasvati River. Sri Balaram’s pilgrimage, along the upsteam course of the Sarasvati from Samudra Samgam to Plaska prasaravana give a vivid desription of most of these holy places. Sarasvati punya vaha - samudraga maha vega (Mbh. 3.88.2) Holy flow of the Sarasvati joins the sea impetuously.’ This suggests that the river receives occasionally and attains the satte of rapid flow, even at its point of confluence. Balaram after visiting a number of holy places reaches to Vinasana, the place where the Sarasvati disappeared. During Mahabharata period, the discharge of water in Sarasvati became extrely low. As a result, the river vanished in the desert sand at certain place along its regular course i.e. at Vinasana. Hence, the river River Sarasvati in Northwest India Regional Remote Sensing Centre, NRSC/ISRO, Dept. of Space, Govt. of India, Jodhpur channel appeared dry. However, underground flow of water continued to exist in the river bed.
2.1.6 Sarasvati in Purana:
The Sarasvati River is widely quoted in Puranic literature. Vamana Purana gives vivid description of the place of origin of the Sarasvati like Markandeya manina santapta paramam tapah Yatra samayata plakshashajata sarasvati Sa sabhajya stuta ten munina dharmikena ha Sarah sannihitam plavya pascima prasthita disam Rishi Markandeya, close to the place where he meditated and offered sacrifices saw Sarasvati rising from the Plaksha tree (Pipal tree). The sage prayed and worshiped the rising river. There from the Sarasvati River flowing down and occupying the Sannihitasar Lake, followed a westward course. 2.2 Vedic Sarasvati and its Disappearance
2.2.1 Vedic Sarasvati River System:
It is clear from the Vedic texts that the Rig Vedic people lived on the banks of a river called the Sarasvati. The major rivers of northwest India were Sarasvati, Sindhu (Indus), Shatadru (Satluj),



115
Vipasa (Beas), Vitasta (Jhelum), Parushni (Ravi), Askini (Chenab), Yamuna, Drishadwati and Lavanavati. All these rivers have changed their courses since Vedic times. Sarasvati, Drishadwati and Lavanavati no longer exist. There were about 300 cities and so many towns and villages along the banks of Sarasvati. The Vedic Sarasvati was a mighty river system that originates somewhere in the Himalayas, entered the plains and followed southwesterly direction through present day Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat prior to joining the Arabian sea. Important towns like Kurukshetra, Shatrana, Yamunanagar, Sirsa, Kalibangan, Pilibangan, Suratgarh, Beriwal etc. flourished on its bank. Vedic Sarasvati was already in existence prior to Ganga River system as per evidences in Rigveda. The Sarasvati River has been one of the mighty river systems of the Vedic age. The very name of the Sarasvati in Rigveda means
‘Abounding in pools and lakes’ suggests that ever since the Rigvedic people knew the course of the river looked like ‘lakes’ (Saras). This happens in the structure of a river flowing in plains,
when, either its gradient becomes irregular or disturbed by action of earth movements or when as result of setting in of desiccation (an area having rainfall under 10 cm becomes subjected to this process), the gradually shifting sand dunes attack its bed at several places. Sarasvati known as Ghaggar (6–8 km wide) in its middle reaches indicate that it must have been once been a carrier of quite a voluminous discharge. The several tributary streams springing from the Siwalik Hills could not have alone contributed that large volume of water. So it is logical to say that the source of Sarasvati River lay beyond the Siwaliks in the Himalayas. In it’s hey days the river Sarasvati is supposed to have seven tributaries namely Yamuna, Satluj, Chautang, Vishapa, Kantli, Drishadvati and Luni. The river flowed through four main regions. The first region was the Siwalik Hills near Adi Badri (Haryana) where it comes down to plains. The second region was the area between Kurukshetra and River Sarasvati in Northwest India Regional Remote Sensing Centre, NRSC/ISRO, Dept. of Space, Govt. of India, Jodhpur 12 Sirsa in Haryana where there was a thick population of Pre-Harappan and Harappan settlements. The third region lies in between Anupgarh and the erstwhile Bahawalpur (in Pakistan). The fourth region is the marshy area where it flowed as Hakra parallel to Indus and passing through Sindh province where it meets the Rann of Kachchh. During the Vedic period the Sarasvati River had flowed through the region between the present Satluj and Yamuna. The present day river systems of the Satluj Yamuna divide are the Satluj, the Ghaggar, the Sarasvati, the Markanda, the Chautang and their tributaries. The Satluj and Yamuna are perennial rivers rising in the Himalayas and fed by glaciers. The river Sarasvati, Ghaggar, Markanda and Chautang all rise in the Siwalik Hills and are non-perennial. All the above river systems can be grouped into three main systems viz. the Satluj system, the Ghaggar system and the Yamuna system.
Sarasvati must have been a perennial source from a permanent glacier at Bandarpunch in Garhwal Himalaya. After originating from Bandarpunch glacier, Vedic Sarasvati started flowing in southwesterly direction for nearly 40 km and it acquires huge dimension and high discharge from Pabbar confluence. It took a southwesterly course and flowed in a tortuous manner for nearly 100 km before entering in Paonta Doon. In other words, Vedic Sarasvati flowed through the course of present day Tons River from Higher Himalaya down to Siwalik foothill upto Paonta Sahib where it joins with Aglar, Yamuna and Giri Rivers. In the past, Vedic Sarasvati was possibly flowing towards west along the streams of Bata, Markanda/Sarasvati and Drishadvati. At Rasula, the Sarasvati met Ghaggar River that comes from southwest from the Morni Hills near Chandigarh. In due course, Yamuna River took a turn towards south, cutting across the Siwalik Range. Rising in the Himalayas from the holy lake of Mansarovar in Tibet, the Satluj river enters the plains near Ropar (Punjab), where it takes a sharp right-angled turn and



116
flows westward over a distance of 150 Km before being joined by the Beas river. The Ghaggar River raises in the Siwaliks from the Morni hills and enters the plains near Ambala (Haryana). Yamuna River originates from yamunotri glacier in Higher Himalaya and entered in the plains near paonta Sahib. This river is believed to be flown along Drishadvati River through central Haryana before disversion along Yamuna Tear Fault.
2.0 LITERATURE SURVEY
The Rigveda, which is supposed to be the oldest texts available to mankind, contain the maximum information about the river Sarasvati. Rivers of Punjab, Haryana, western Rajasthan and northern Gujarat, present an interesting and complex evolutionary history of drainage development dating back to Middle Pleistocene. Most of the evolutionary history, Late Quaternary climatic changes and tectonism have played a significant role in modifying the drainage pattern. Many authors have studied Vedic Sarasvati River for the poast few decades based on multi-disciplinary approach (Bharadwaj, 1999; Chauhan, 1999, Kalyanraman, 1999; Kochhar, 1997; Radhakrishna, 1999; Rajaram, 1994; Valdiya, 2002).
2.2.2 Disappreance of River Sarasvati: The Sarasvati river system in the Vedic period includes the rivers like Ghaggar, Markanda, Chautang, Satluj and Yamuna. The diversion of the Satluj and Yamuna is considered as the main cause of lost of River Sarasvati by most of the researchers. The rivers Ghaggar, Markanda, Sarasvati and the Chautang rise in the Siwalik Hills. Presently they flow mainly during the monsoon and none of these reaches the sea or join any major river as tributary. Different scholars attempted to establish chronological sequence of events that contributed to the desiccation of Vedic Sarasvati. Their compliled works are based on different aspects like climate, tectonism, drainage changes and River Sarasvati in Northwest India Regional Remote Sensing Centre, NRSC/ISRO, Dept. of Space, Govt. of India, Jodhpur 13 cultural events which can be combined for the purpose of evaluating the changes in the drainage systems of northwestern India. In turn, it throws light in the events that have contributed the decline and final loss of river Sarasvati. Late Quaternary tectonism in combination with the sudden increase in aridity related aeolian activity disrupted and obliterated the courses of the rivers of NW India mainly the Sarasvati River. From the studies by the various eminent researchers for the past several years now it has been clear that the Yamuna as well as the Satluj were tributaries of the Sarasvati River. Around 3700 B.C tectonic disturbances in the area have caused the capture of upper catchment water of Sarasvati by Yamuna and westward migration of Satluj causing the drying up of the river (Oldham 1886; Radhakrishna 1998, Valdiya 2000). Deflection of Satluj at Ropar might have occurred 2600 years BP (Wilhelmy, 1969) and the deviation of Yamuna at Paonta Sahib had occurred around 3700 BP (Valdiya, 1996) or around 3900 BP (Wakankar, 1987). It may be noted that the deflection of Yamuna occurred much earlier than the deviation of the Satluj River. Over a 3000 year long period since the Vedic times, the drainage pattern of many rivers had changed from that described in the earlier religious literatures. The decline of Sarasvati appears to have commenced between 5000 – 3000 B.C. probably precipitated by a major tectonic event in the Siwalik Hills of Sirmur region. Geologic studies indicate destabilizing tectonic events in the entire Siwalik domain extending from Potwar in Pakistan to Assam in India resulting in massive landslides and avalanches. These disturbances, which continued intermittently, were all linked to uplift of the Himalayas. One of these events must have severed the glacier connection and cut off the supply of glacier melt-waters to this river. As a result, Sarasvati became non-perennial and dependent on monsoon rains. All its majesty and splendour of the Vedic period dwindled with the loss of its tributaries and the river



117
totally got lost around 3000 B.C. Considerable tectonic activity connected with Himalayan orogeny continued during the Holocene. Uplifts were at their peak during 0.8 – 0.9 million years. The high elevation of the mountains perturbed the wind circulation patterns and modified climatic changes, which had melted the glaciers and resulted in the formation of rivers. This was the scenario of the Himalayan region when the Sarasvati emerged as a major river about 9000 years ago and flowed in full swing till its decline to an impermanent monsoon dependent state some 4000 years later. Sarasvati was totally lost when its water was captured by the Satluj and the Yamuna (Oldham 1893, Valdiya 1996). This view differed from that of several others who felt that Sarasvati vanished due to lack of rainfall. However the recent meteorological research about palaeo climate, oxygen isotopic studies, thermoluminescence (TL) dating of wind-borne and river-borne sands in the Thar Desert region, radio carbon dating of lake-bed deposits and archaeological evidences have all indicated that during early to middle Pleistocene this region has River Sarasvati in Northwest India Regional Remote Sensing Centre, NRSC/ISRO, Dept. of Space, Govt. of India, Jodhpur 14 enjoyed wetter climate, heavy rainfall and even recurring floods and that increase in aridity commenced only by mid-Holocene (5000 – 3000 B.C). The Tons with its tributary Yamuna must have flowed westward in the Dun valley of Paonta Sahib in southeastern Himachal Pradesh. The river terraces at Sudanwala and Garibnath testify to this. There are four generations of gravel terraces in the anomalously wide valleys of the misfit river Bata. The two older terraces at Sudanwala (near Kolar) and Garibnath (north of Paonta) are characterized by an abundance of pebbles of exotic metamorphic rocks and quartzites, derived from the Higher Himalayas (Puri and Verma, 1998). A major seismic activity in the Himalayas resulted in the formation of the Bata-Markanda divide, which is nearly 30m high, restricted the westward flow into the Adi Badri. Later Yamuna Tear fault opening provided new drainage. Yash Pal et al. (1980) observed a sudden widening of Ghaggar near Patiala which they argue can take place only if a major tributary had joined it. According to them ancient Shatadru (Satluj) must have been this tributary. Tectonism involving rise of Delhi-Haridwar ridge and uplift of Aravallis, capture of Satluj by a tributary of Beas River through headward erosion and existence of a fault through which it got diverted are considered to be the reasons for the diversion of Satluj. The deviation in the course of the Sarasvati river could as well been caused by a process called river piracy. The headward erosion by the Yamuna cut the channel deeper and deeper eventually leading to the capture of the flow of the Sarasvati (Bakliwal and Sharma, 1980; Valdiya, 2002). This is accelerated by the NNW – SSE trending fault passing by Paonta Sahib. The faulting had caused the eastern block to move north relative to the western block which had prompted the Yamuna to swing southwards and follow the fault zone. Geodetic measurements indicate that the fault continues to be very active. There was a horizontal movement of 30 cm within a short period between 1962 and 1966 (Krishnaswamy et al., 1970) and 0.7-5.7 cm between 1965 and 1976 (Rajal et al., 1986)ecent work has shown that the land to the east of the River Yamuna is 14-22m lower than the land on the western side of the fault (Thussu, 1999). Thus, climatic changes and geotectonic movements have led to the migration and abandonment of several rivers and drainage systems. The cumulative effect of reactivation of Yamuna tears constriction of catchments area of Vedic Sarasvati by emergence and migration of river Drishadvati. Views of some important authors have been highlighted here. (a) Bakliwal and Grover (1988) believed that there has been an upliftment of the region along Aravalli hills, which has resulted in the westward shift of streams in the western side of the Aravalli hills (like river Satluj) and eastward shift in streams in the eastern side of the Aravalli hills (like river Yamuna). The authors suggested the following causes for Sarasvati migration and drainage desiccation in



118
NW India. The following are the possible reasons for migration and loss of Sarasvati River: River Sarasvati in Northwest India Regional Remote Sensing Centre, NRSC/ISRO, Dept. of Space, Govt. of India, Jodhpur 15 1. Rise of Delhi-Haridwar ridge along the NE-SW lineaments. 2. Intermittent reactivation of the Kuchchh fault and Luni-Sukri lineaments (extending from great Rann of Kuchchh to Dehradoon ) 3. Rise of Aravalli hills bounded by lineaments on its west. 4. Changes in climatic condition in the region. 5. Reactivation of Cambay garban, Jaisalmer-Barwani lineaments and Khatu lineaments that trends NE-SW. 6. Stream piracy by the rivers like Yamuna and Beas. (b) According to Ghose et al. (1979), the reasons for the disappearance of Sarasvati are attributed to: 1. Climate change from wet to dry spell, as evidenced by geomorphological and stratigraphic records during the Quaternary period. 2. Neotectonic changes in the Himalayan and Aravalli regions. 3. Uplift of Himalayas and Siwaliks 4. Uplift of Aravalli range resulting in northward shift of river Sarasvati. 5. River piracy of Sarasvati and subordinate rivers by Yamuna, Satluj, and Ganga. 6. Climatic changes from humid to desertic condition. 7. Changes in glaciation in Himalayas. 8. Choking of rivers by enormous sand debris. (c) Bakliwal and Ramasamy (1987) observed northwesterly and westerly migration of rivers on NW side of Luni-Sukri lineament zone and preferential southeasterly migration on SE side of the lineament zone and believed that the rise of Aravalli hills has further added to the rapid migration of the rivers Sarasvati and Yamuna.
2.3 Previous Work Done on River Sarasvati Study of River Sarasvati has been initiated by various scholars in the past 125 years due to great fascination of Indian culture and heritage. However, it requires systematic analysis and systhesis to establish chronogical evolution of Sarasvati River basin. Most of the works are carried out as research projects and not as operational projects to explore the natural resources. Many of the studies have been carried out at departmental level to study particular aspects of the river i.e. palaeochannels, archaeology, geology, groundwater prospects/movement etc. and not as a project to rediscover the entire course of the river right from the origin to its end. Establishing the exact course of the mighty river Sarasvati, causes of its disappearnce, sentimental attachment of the people in the area, archaeological, geological, hydrological and mineralogical importance of the sacred river has led to the involvenment of various agencies in the research work. Different agencies involved in the Sarasvati River study are: (i) Space Application Centre (SAC)/ISRO – Ahmedabad. (ii) Regional Remote Sensing Centre (RRSC-W)/ISRO – Jodhpur, Rajsthan.

119
M.S. University of Baroda – Vadodara, Gujarat There are varying views on the origin of the river Sarasvati. According to geological and glaciological studies the Sarasvati was supposed to have originated in Bandarpunchh massif (Sarasvati-Rupin glacier confluence at Naitwar) in Western Garhwal Himalayas. Though the search for Sarasvati River has progressed a lot with the advancement of Remote Sensing and GIS technology, still there exists controversies among the origin of the river, its exact course and reasons for its disappearance still appears vague. Various workers have postulated different views on these aspects and some are controversial while some match with that of the other workers. But in general all have accepted that the river Sarasvati was the mightiest river in the proto-historic times. Salient features of remote sening studies on Sarasvati palaeochannels are given below: (a) Ghose et al. (1979, 1980): Based on the study of aerial photography and LANDSAT imagery, they have suggested that the Sarasvati River flowed along NE-SW through the Rajasthan desert and that the Luni was one of its tributaries. The authors invoke this hypothesis to explain the present valley segment of the Luni between Pachpadra and the Rann of Kachchh. The river later shifted westward, severed its connection with the Luni and flowed through channels through the desert terrain in Jaisalmer district. Only later the river occupied the Hakra-Nara-Wahind-Raini course. The authors observe that the Sarasvati was forced to shift its course westward at least four times by aeolian sand encroaching on its southerly course to flow to the west. These courses are- • The oldest course was NoharSurjansar- Samrau-Pachpadra River Sarasvati in Northwest India Regional Remote Sensing Centre, NRSC/ISRO, Dept. of Space, Govt. of India, Jodhpur 17 • The Second course was SirsaLunkarnansar-Bikaner-Samrau-Pachpadra • The third course was Nohar-Rangmahal-SuratgarhAnupgarh-SkhiHakra-Nara • The fourth course was Jakhal-Sirsa-Hanumangarh-PilibanganSuratgarhAnupgarh-Sakhi-Hakra-Nara • The fifth course was the shift at Anupgarh-Fort Abbas to join the Indus drainage basin rather than drain independently into the Rann of Kachchh. (b) Yash Pal et al. (1980): They studied the multidate LANDSAT imagery to unravel the mystery of the ‘Lost’ Sarasvati. Remnants of old fluvial channels of the river both buried as well as abandoned were delineated on the basis of the pattern of drainage scars, distinct tones, texture, surface manifestations etc. The authors support the hypothesis that the Satluj river once flowed into the Ghaggar river bed and was probably joined by the Yamuna. The Satluj has a sharp westward right-angled bend near Ropar due to the river capture or stream piracy, which could be responsible for the diversion. Other observations made by the authors include- • A palaeo channel Y1 in the SE of Markanda joins the ancient bed of Ghaggar at Shatrana. The present Sarasvati mostly flows through these channels. • Another channel Y2 which corresponds to the Drishadvati or the present Chautang joins the Ghaggar near Suratgarh. • The Yamuna probably flowed into the ancient Sarasvati before joining Ganga through the Chambal. (c) Sood and Sahai (1983): In continuation to the earlier study by Yash Pal et al (1980), Sood and Sahai (1983) made a detailed study of the palaeo channels of the Sarasvati River in the Jhakal – Sirsa tract. Wellpreserved meanders of the palaeo channels were observed indicating that during its active life the channels were meandering not braiding. The channels have two definite directions of flow i.e. NW-SE and NE-SW roughly at right angles to each other. They also observed that the various saline lakes in Rajasthan have a preferred orientation parallel to the regional lineaments. They felt that these regional lineaments have genetic relationship with the basement and might have been propagated to the upper unconsolidated sediments by the mechanism of down faulting. (d) Kar and Ghose (1984): They traced the former courses of Drishadvati, a major tributary of the Sarasvati. Starting from the Siwalik, its course was traced through the Markanda up to Gadauli and in the vicinity of Jagdhauli and then it followed the course of the Chautang up to Jind and



120
Narnaund. Thus, it flowed through the Hansi-Hakra branch of the Western Yamuna Canal up to Hisar. Numerous channels, possibly representing shifting courses, connect it to Nohar, Bhadra and Hanumangarh. At Hanumangarh, most of the old courses join the Sarasvati. However, some of these courses River Sarasvati in Northwest India Regional Remote Sensing Centre, NRSC/ISRO, Dept. of Space, Govt. of India, Jodhpur 18 show the Drishadvati traversing the Thar Desert in north-south direction. Authors were able to trace only segments of these courses on band 7 of LANDSAT MSS imagery as all these courses are buried under recent deposits including Aeolian sand. According to the author’s occurrence of sub-surface water at shallow depth enabled deciphering of the courses. The easternmost course of the Drishadwati is traced through the districts of Churu, Sikar and Nagaur. It flowed through the present dry valley of the Jojri through Khedulil and Mokala up to Plundla. From Plundla, the Jojri is traceable up to its confluences with the Luni through Pipar and Risalpur but is completely an under fit stream. Upstream of Plundla, the valley is fairly wide but at many places blocked by heavy drifts of aeolian sand in the form of dunes and sheets. They have cited litho logs of well sections at four selected sites along the courses of the Drishadvati at Sardarshahar and Churu (Churu district) and at Marwar and Degana Railway Station (Nagaur district), which show the presence of thick
alluvium underlain by coarse reverine material. The author’s noted that a number of tributaries arising from the Aravalli joined the Drishadvati during its course through the desert, northern most being the Kantli, which joined it, either near Raigarh or near Dudwa Khard. As the Drishadvati moved westward, it lost the supply of the Aravalli streams, which got choked up by the advancing aeolian sands and got lost on the way. Kar and Ghose (1984) opined that the imbalance between load and stream capacity were responsible for dwindling supply and the adverse climatic changes in the past which were the main cause for desiccation of the Drishadvati River. (e) Bakliwal and Grover (1988): The authors suggested that lakes like Lunkaransar, Sambhar and Didwana and Ranns of Jaisalmer, Pachpadra etc. are considered to be the remnants of past river systems. They proposed that the Sarasvati had seven stages of migration in chronological order. Their stage seven essentially matches the course suggested by Yash Pal et al. (1980). (f) Ramasamy et al. (1991): The authors used LANDSAT MSS and TM data and observed that the river Sarasvati flowed close to the Aravalli hill ranges, met the Arabian Sea in the Rann of Kachchh. It gradually drifted towards northwest and then finally lost in Anupgarh plains. Interpreted palaeo channels have a width of 60-80 km on either side of the present day Luni river course, especially in Siwana region. The authors suggested that the upheaval along the trace of Aravalli hills to the foothills of Himalaya would have made the Sarasvati drift along northwestwards from its earliest course along the Aravallis. Subsequent Luni – Sukri cymatogenic arching would have accelerated the northwesterly drift. If the Sarasvati was flowing into the Hakra – Nara bed, the westward shift of the Indus might have also led to the disorganization of the Sarasvati system and its final burial in Anupgarh plains. Other observations made by the authors include- River Sarasvati in Northwest India Regional Remote Sensing Centre, NRSC/ISRO, Dept. of Space, Govt. of India, Jodhpur • The meanders of Yamuna in Agra and Dehradun area coincide with the Luni-Sukri graben, suggesting control by Pliestocene tectonism on river migration. Yamuna seems to have migrated 40 – 100 Km towards east due to rise in Aravalli hills. • Shifting of courses by main rivers leads to the disorganization of the tributaries. The rivers like the Sahibi, the Banganga and the Kantli, which were tributaries of the Yamuna in northeastern Rajasthan, now fail to reach Yamuna. Now these rivers flow in a disorganized manner and often cause flood havoc. • The Indus has migrated towards northwest in the northern part and towards the west in central and southern parts. • The authors also



121
confirmed the findings of Yash Pal et al. (1980) and Sood & Sahai (1983) that tectonism was primarily responsible for the drying up of the mighty Sarasvati.
(g) Raghav and Grover (1991) have delineated three palaeo-courses of the Kantlil River in parts of Jhunjhunu and Sikar districts using LANDSAT TM imagery and aerial photographs. The river Kantli rises from the Khandela hills (Sikar district). At present, it flows over a distance of 100 km only in rainy session through the district of Sikar and Jhunjhunu. It enters Churu district and lost in the Sandy terrain. It used to flow in SW-NE direction and was once a tributary of the Yamuna (the Drishadvati) before the latter joined the Ganga system. Ganeshwar, where large copper hoard of probably preHarappan period have been found is located along the Kanti River in Sikar district. Several tectonic lineaments observed in the area seem to have controlled shifting of the channels.
3.0 PALAEOCHANNEL MAPPING USING REMOTE SENSING & GIS
With the advent of Remote Sensing technology and the available satellite images, it is possible to trace the drainage course in the form of buried palaeochannels. Remote Sensing techniques helped in locating these buried channels as they are clearly seen on the satellite images (Ghose et al. 1979, 1980; Yashpal et al. 1980; Sood and Sahai, 1983; Bakliwal and Grover, 1988; Ramasamy et al. 1991; Kar, 1995; Sahai, 1999). In ISRO centres, pioneering works in Remote Sensing studies has been carried out by Yash Pal et al. (1980), Sahai (1993), Rajawat and Narain (1996), Rao (1999) and others who have compiled various studies pertaining to the palaeo drainage network of northwestern India. Recently the entire course of River Sarasvati has been traced from satellite images by the researchers like Bhadra et al. (2005), Bhadra et al. (2006), Bhadra et al. (2009), Bhadra and Sharma (2011), Bhadra and Sharma (2012), Bhadra and Sharma (2013), Gupta et al. (2001), Gupta et al. (2004), Gupta et al. (2011), Sharma et al. (2006), Sharma and Bhadra (2009) and Sharma and Bhadra (2012). 3.1 Satellite data Used for Delineation of Palaeochannels Due to having synoptic viewing capability with different spatial, spectral and multitemporal resolution, IRS satellite images of different sensors viz. WiFS (188m), AWiFS (56m), LISS-III (23.5m) and LISS-IV (5.8m) have been used for palaeochannel delineation and other thematic mapping interpretation. Palaeochannels are basically the old course of river channels which appears on the satellite image as serpentine drainage course with high moisture content (dark tone). For delineation of palaeochannels, digital image processing techniques like histogram equalization, linear stretching, contrast and brightness enhancement etc. have been applied on a small area of the satellite images (IRS P6 LISS-III of Summer, Kharif and Rabi seasons). Drainage features are highlighted on applying local stretching on ~10X10 sq. km area out of the full LISS-III scene (141X141 sq. km). In this process, palaeochannels are delineated with proper care by avoiding the canals, existing ephemeral drainages and water logged areas. A large number of palaeochannels have been delineated in parts of Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat. Many of these discontinuous palaeochannels are found to be linked with the existing/abundoned channels as well as dry lakes/Rann. The delineated palaeochannels of Sarasvati River in different states have been discussed below. 3.2 Delineation of Palaeochannels in Rajasthan Gupta et al. (2004) have mapped the course of Sarasvati, buried below sands of Thar Desert, using IRS P3 WiFS and IRS 1C LISS-III satellite data. They showed presence of Sarasvati channels which are self-evident on satellite images (Fig.4 and 5). “Piece-wise Histogram Stretching” technique has been used to enhance the palaeo channel signatures on the image. This technique has been found unique in enhancing palaeo channel details in the sandy as well as alluvial and vegetated areas. The feature enhancement is carried



122
out by way of loading sub-scenes of 1k River Sarasvati in Northwest India Regional Remote Sensing Centre, NRSC/ISRO, Dept. of Space, Govt. of India, Jodhpur 21 x 1k size on computer terminal in full resolution and improving the feature contrast by histogram stretching interactively.
River Sarasvati in Northwest India Regional Remote Sensing Centre, NRSC/ISRO, Dept. of Space, Govt. of India, Jodhpur They have also validated the course of Sarasvati River through collateral data such as published old maps, archaeological data, geomorphic anomalies, drilling data (litholog) of tube wells and age of ground water.The drilled tube wells in Jaisalmer district



123
of Rajasthan shows potable water with high discharge from the sub-surface fluvial palaeochannels. Isotopic dating of trapped water is correlated with the Harappan Civilisation. Thus, a palaeochannels etwork of Sarasvati River in Rajasthan and parts of northern Gujarat has been established across the Thar Desert (Fig.6 and 7).
3.3 Delineation of Palaeochannels in Haryana and Punjab The Sarasvati river system (present day drainages along with palaeochannels) in Haryana and Punjab (Fig.8 and 9) has also been studied in detail by using IRS P6 AWiFS, LISS-III and LISS-IV satellite data (Bhadra et. al., 2006; Bhadra et al., 2009; Sharma and Bhadra, 2009; Bhadra and Sharma, 2011).
Where ever necessary, Landsat ETM data also have been used for delineation of palaeochannels in Haryana, digital image processing techniques like histogram equalization, linear stretching, contrast and brightness enhancement etc. have been applied on a small area of the satellite images. Drainage features are highlighted on applying local stretching the full LISS-III scene. Using this process, the possible course of Sarasvati and Drishadvati palaeochannels in Haryana are delineated. An attempt has been made



124
to identify the continuity of Sarasvati palaeochannels in eastern Punjab also. For this purpose, satellite images of IRS P6 LISS-III data (23.5m resolution) of February, 2004 and Radarsat SAR data (50m resolution) of December, 2002 have been processed to delineate palaeochannels (Fig.10).
In this area, Radarsat SAR image could able to pick up moist zone (torquous channel with dark tone), possibly indicating a subsurface palaeochannel. The delineated palaeochannel between Ropar and Patiala is named as Satluj palaeochannel which is an N-S trending palaeochannel extending for a length of about 75 km with having width from 1 to 6 km. The Satluj palaeochannel is connecting the present day Satluj River near Ropar and the Ghaggar River in the south of Patiala. The delineated palaeochannels in Haryana and Punjab have been validated on the ground by using archaeological sites, hydrogeological and drilling data, rainfall data and stream discharge data.
3.4 Sarasvati Delta Structure in Rann of Kachchh (Gujarat) The Sarasvati River is supposed to be the mightiest river in the proto-historic times which might have been flown through Rann of Kachchh and finally discharged into the Gulf of Kachchh. The Rann is today a salt impregnated marshy tract, which gets flooded during the rainy session. A number of references have been made about the Sarasvati River meeting the sea along the existing Kori Creek (Oldham, 1893). Recent investigations have revealed that more than one river were involved in building up the deltaic deposits in the Great Rann. According to Roy and Merh (1977) the channels represent relicts of a delta of Nara River which is a tributary of Indus River. The Sarasvati delta is characterized by strikingly uneven topography, marked by areas of higher grounds (bet of river borne sandy and silty sediments) and depression or distributary channels (Malik et al., 1999). Digital image processing of IRS-P6 AWiFS and Radarsat SAR images reveals deltaic drainage pattern (Bird’s Foot type) which is made up of complex intertwined channels. This structure was



125
formed in the past by huge sediment discharge of Sarasvati River within marshy land of Great Rann of Kachchh. The delta structures are restricted by the E-W fault, known as Allah Band. However, these palaeochannels can be traced upto the Gulf of Kachchh which might have a link to the submerged Dwarka of Mahabharata times. In northern Gujarat also, a large number of Harappan settlements are found to lie near the delineated palaeochannels. Thus, a close association of Harappan civilization can be established with the delineated palaeochannels which might have a link with the Vedic Sarasvati civilization. Beyond Little Rann, Sarasvati channel might have continued upto Dwarka along the Gulf of Kachchh (Fig.11).
3.4.1 Sarasvati Confluence at Gulf of Kachchh: Dwarka was the capital of the Yadavas which is mentioned in Indian epic Mahabharata. It is believed that Lord Krishna has found this town by reclaiming 12 yojana land from the sea at about 3,600 years ago. After the Mahabharata War, Krishna lived for 36 years at Dwarka which was extended from Bet Dwarka in the north to Okhamadhi in the south. It is described in Mahabharata that Balaram travelled along the dry banks of Sarasvati River from Dwaraka to Mathura. Hence, it is possible that Sarasvati palaeochannel might have continued beyond Little Rann upto Dwarka along the Gulf of Kachchh. Archaeological excavation revealed the existence of Harappan settlements in Dwaraka as well as port city of Lothal (Gaur, et al. 2000 and 2005; Rao, 1979 and 1985). Underwater explorations in Bet Dwarka and Poompuhar yielded a large number of potteries, stone anchors and building blocks from 5-8m water depths and have been established by thermoluminiscence tests to be 3,528 years old. Marine archaeological expeditions between 1983 and 1992 revealed the discovery of wellfortified township of Dwarka which was built in six sectors along the banks of a river. Nigam (2012) studied sea level changes along the Gujarat coast during Holocene period based on the abundance of microfossils like Foraminifera. In southwestern Gujarat, Lothal was an ancient dockyard which is presently located about 10-12 km away from the sea and few meters above the present sea level. This dockyard is believed to be of 4500 years old and is connected to the sea through a channel. Dr. R. R. Nayer proposed a theory that probably sea level was lower than today about 60-80m around 10,000 years ago because fossils in the sediments are found at that depth. Reclamation Dwarka land by Lord Krishna may be explained



126
by lowering sea level changes after 4500 BP. In the year 2000, NIO Goa discovered Neolithic settlement of 9500 BP in Gulf of Khambat which was lost because it submerged under the sea due to the rise in water level around 7000 BP. Rise in sea level and occurrence of tsunami like phenomenon caused submergence of Dwarka in the year 3443 BP. 3.4.2 Rejuvenation of Sarasvati Palaeochannels after Bhuj Earthquake (2001): As discussed in the previous section, Sarasvati drainages in Thar Desert area have disappeared due to climatic changes in 5000 BP. These dry channels have been covered by aeolian sands all along the Indo-Pakistan border, leaving with a few traces as relict palaeochannels. The evidence for the confluence of araswati palaeochannels could be found in Rann of Kachchh region with obscured impression like palaeodelta complex (Malik et. al., 1999). Most of these drainages are either submerged under tidal sea water or buried under the mud flat in the Rann area. The entire region appears bluish white on the satellite image due to development of salt encrustations after desiccation of sea water. It has been observed that the sub-surface drainages (palaeochannels) in the Rann area rejuvenated after the Bhuj earthquake of 26th January, 2001. The phenomenon of sudden spurt of the water jet in the area might have been caused due to increase in hydrostatic pressure at the sub-surface aquifer condition. Rigorous shaking of saturated soil by tectonic disturbance may result such type of oozing as an artesian well. Appearance of these drainages can be seen on the post-earthquake IRS LISS-III satellite images on both FCC (colour) as well as Infrared band image (black and white). The spectacular drainage features have been compared between preearthquake (10.12.2000) and post-earthquake (29.1.2001) satellite images around Khadir Island in Rann of Kachchh region (Fig.12).
Similar spectacular drainage features can be seen on post-earthquake satellite image and may be compared with the pre-earthquake image of 1989 (Fig.13).



127
Similar phenomena like sudden spurt of sub-surface water oozing at Kalayat village in Jind district of Haryana has been observed in December, 2005 (Bhadra et al., 2006). This incidence was in concurrence with the mild earthquakes in Jind district and the earthquake event (6.8M) of 13th December, 2005 in Hindukush area. All these observations coupled with the archaeological findings (Harappan age) clearly indicate that source of oozing water at Kalayat was from the Sarasvati palaeochannel.
4.0 GROUND VALIDATION OF SARASVATI PALAEOCHANNELS 4.1 Historical maps A number of very old maps of Indo-Pakistan region of Mughal period have been prepared by the Italians, Dutch and British authors during 14th –17th Century A.D. (Fig.14).



128
These maps have been studied as a reference to the drainage conditions, in Indo-Pakistan region during that period (Source: A series of early printed maps of India in facsimile, New Delhi, 1980).
Empire of Great Moghul published a map (sheet no. 27a) in the year 1746 A.D. which shows Indus as a parallel river system with that of in the east. Presence of a stream parallel to Indus in 17 th century map indicate towards presence of the dry channels of Sarasvati along which occasionally water flowed during heavy monsoon or flood events, which continued till 13 th century and minor flows up to the end of 16th century (Wilhelmy 1969). The mapped courses of Sarasvati main course runs for 80 to100 km east, parallel to the Indus river course.
4.2 Field Studies along Sarasvati Nadi Field studies in western Rajasthan have been carried out during 1998-99, 1999- 2000 and 2007-08. Field photographs show vast stretch of aeolian terrain with different sand dune features (Fig.15).



129
Although the terrain is devoid of thick vegetation, but sparse vegetation such as phog, chag, ker, aak, bue, sewan, khib, khejri etc. has grown on aeolian plains. Several tube wells have been drilled on the palaeochannels which provides potable water in Tanot, Gotaru, Ranau and Ghantiyali villaves in Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan.
Field investigations in Haryana have been done during 2004-2005 and 2005-06 along the Sarasvati drainage course, right from Adi Badri to Bibipur Lake till Pehowa. The presence of this drainage courses in different villages (Bari Pabni, Choti Pabni, Chhapar and Mustafabad) have been located through Global Positioning System (GPS) survey and are shown through field
photographs (Fig.16 and 17). The name of “Sarasvati Nadi/ Nala” has been inscribed at several old rail/road bridges. In the downstream direction, this drainage becomes wider but left with stagnated water. At many places sewerage water was flowing along the Sarasvati drainage course at Sadhaura and Mustafabad in Yamunanagar district and Thaneswar and Pehowa in Kurukshetra district. Ground truth in the area reveals that the drainage becomes narrow (about 10-100m wide) at several places which is the result of climatic and tectonic changes coupled with anthropogenic interventions. The holy river of the past has turned into a sewerage drain, obliterated at different places, virtually defunct and is flowing seasonally. As a result, frequent flash floods occur in the



130
area, causing enormous damage to the crop and the property. Sarasvati Nadi in this region is in the verge of obliteration and witnesses an unbearable pathetic condition.



131
4.3 Archaeological Data Analysis The pre-historic remains in the Sarasvati basin were for the first time brought to light in the early 1940’s with the investigation of Hakra valley by Stein
(1942). Stein’s work was further extended by Ghosh during (1950-52) during survey of the dried up course of Sarasvati and Drishadvati in Ganganagar district of Rajasthan (Ghosh et al., 1979, 1980). Kar and Ghosh (1984) have carried out an intensive survey of the Sarasvati basin within Haryana since 1960. In northern Haryana, important Harappan sites were discovered at Banawali, Rakhigarhi, Kunal, Birrna, Balu and others (Chakrabarti and Saini, 2009, Kalyanraman, 1999; Lal, 2002, 2009; Valdiya, 2002). Late Harappan and Painted Grey Ware (PGW) materials were recovered from Kurukshetra, Mirzapur (Kurukshetra district) and Bhagwanpura (Hissar district).
Recent excavations at Bhagwanpura and Kasithal (Kurukshetra district) have yielded evidence of a partial overlap between the late Harappan and PGW culture. The Ghaggar-Hakra palaeochannel course has been associated with extensive Bronze-age Harappan civilisation archaeological sites that are located with the channel. The abrupt abandonment of urban centres at ~3500 BP has been explained as a consequence of river diversion, although alternative



132
explanations for cultural decline have also been offered (Sinha et al., 2013). The explored area has been seen to be rich in archaeological sites which may be classified as Harappa, PGW and Early Historical with the addition of the well-known Pre-Harappa. The remains of the prominent PGW settlements are often overlaid by those of the succeeding early historical (Rang Mahal) culture. The Rang Mahal culture is named after the site of Rang Mahal about 3Km up Suratgarh. A general dissection followed the decay of the Rang Mahal culture as indicated by a scatter of pottery in the dry riverbed and also on the sand dunes. A steady flow of water, followed by dessication and then utter dryness of the river is clearly indicated by the archaeological evidences. Eastward diversion of water to the Ganga system is indicated in 1750 B.C. (end of Harappa culture), resulting in a dry phase (partly coinciding with the PGW period), a recurrence of the wet phase in the early centuries A.D (Rang Mahal period) and then by another desiccation. Thus, the PGW sites are generally small and are sometimes situated in the riverbed itself indicating a scanty flow. Radiocarbon dating indicates that Kalibangan, the Mature Harappan settlement located on the bank of the ancient river Sarasvati was abandoned around 1900 B.C. because of the drying up of the river. More than 1200 settlements of the Stone Age and Harappan civilizations are found along the river course implying the availability of year-round supply of water, which only perennial rivers could have provided. Joshi et al. (1984) have compiled the data on Harappan, Early Harappan (Pre-Harappan) and Late Harappan sites in India. A summary of the sites in the Sarasvati valley is given below (Table-1):
The archaeological studies reveal the following information: (a) No Early Harappan or Harappan sites occur along the present Satluj or the Yamuna channel, (b) There is fairly good distribution of Early Harappan and Harappan sites along the Ghaggar – Hakra bed and (c) No Late Harappan sites are found in Rajasthan along the Sarasvati bed which must have dried up during that period forcing eastward or westward migration (Joshi et al. 1984; Mughal, 1982; Rajani and Rajawat, 2011).
4.3.1 Archaeological Studies in Rajasthan: More than 1200 of the 1600 settlements, including many prosperous towns of Harappan culture (5000-3500 B.P.) have been discovered in the Sarasvati river basin (Valdiya 2002, Mughal, 1981). Out of the archaeological sites discovered by the Archaeological Survey of India in the Sarasvati river basin (Possehl, 2000), 54 sites of Early-Harappan and Mature Harappan period are falling in the western Rajasthan (Table-2).



133
These have been plotted on to the palaeo channel map prepared from WiFS data, to observe if any correlation exists between the two types of data. It is observed that most of the archaeological sites of Harappan period discovered in Ganganagar and Hanumangarh districts fall along the Ghaggar River (Fig.18), indicating Ghaggar to be the palaeo Sarasvati course
(Gupta et al., 2001, 2003).
4.3.2 Archaeological Studies in Haryana and Punjab:
The locations of archaeological sites, discovered till 2000 in Haryana (Possel, 2000) and a few recently discovered archaeological sites have been plotted and overlaid on the mapped river courses for age determination. The archaeological sites are classified into four categories viz. Mature Harappan, Sothi Harappan, Late Harappan and Post to Harappan (Table-3). In northern Haryana, mostly Late Harappan sites have been found to lie in Yamunanagar, Kurukshetra and Kaithal districts (Fig.19). However, clustered Mature Harappan/Sothi Harappan sites are found to occur in Jind and Karnal districts, where many palaeochannels have been demarcated.



134
Apart from the Harappan sites, archaeological sites of Late-Harappan to Medieval period have been discovered in Adi Badri, Sandhya, Kapal Mochan, Mustafabad, Bilaspur, Sadhaura, Thanesar and Pehowa which lie mostly along the course of Sarasvati Nadi. Although catchment area of Markanda River is larger than that of Sarasvati Nadi, but the number of available



135
archaeological sites are much more along the course of Sarasvati Nadi. This indicates towards higher level of historical significance of Sarasvati Nadi in the region than that of Markanda River. Recently, an archaeological site (12th Century old Painted Grey Ware i.e. Post-Harappan) has been discovered at Bhor Saidan village which lie on the bank of Sarasvati Nadi in the west of Kurukshetra (Purohit, 2006). All these evidences indicate flourishment of Mature Harappan to Post-Harappan culture along the Sarasvati Nadi. The delineation of the palaeochannels of Sarasvati & Drishadwati in the northern parts of Haryana got a big boost by the discoveries of Harappan sites. The excavations are done by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) & various other scholars. It provides a good evidence of the presence of an ancient civilization which is known as ‘Harappan Civilization’ or ‘Indus Valley Civilization’. Most of the sites of this
civilization have shown a common characteristic like (a) Presence of house made of bricks, (b) Well planned city, (c) Ploughed agricultural field, etc. The region between Sarasvati River System in the north and Drishadvati River System in the south witness a rich cultural sequence from Harappan to Modern period.
1. Birdana - C.4000 B.C
2. Kunal - C.3200-1700 BC
3. Balu - C.2500-1700 BC
4. Banawali - C.2500-1450 BC
5. Rakhigarhi - C.2500-1450 BC
6. Siswal - C.2450 BC
7. Bhagwanpura - C.1700 BC-1300 BC
8. Mirzapur - C.1700 BC-1600 AD
9. Raja Karna ka tila - C. 800 BC-1600 AD
10. Daulatpur - Late Indus to Medieval period
11. Harsh ka Tila, Thaneswar - Pre-Kushana to Late Medieval period.
There are more than 400 archeological sites spreads all over Haryana especially in the northern part. Some of these belong to Harappan age & some to Post Harappan age. These Archeological sites are present in cluster, which are called “Economic Pockets” by Joshi et al. (1984). Most of the sites are falling on or nearby the paleochannels. Most of the green and yellow spots representing the Mature Harappan sites are found at the SW part of Haryana, i.e. Jind, Hisar, Fatehabad and Sirsa districts. But the Post-Harapppan sites represented as brown spots are present in the eastern and NE part of Haryana i.e. Kurukshetra, Kaithal, Karnal, Ambala and Yamunanagar. This probably shows the shifting of the people from W to E with loss of river. Similarly, location of a large number of archaeological sites along the Satluj palaeochannel in eastern Punjab indicates close affinity between ancient civilizations with the Sarasvati River.
4.3.3 Archaeological Study in Gujarat:
Available archaeological sites of Pre, Mature and Post Harrapan ages have been plotted in Kachchh, Mehsana, Patan, Jamnagar, Rajkot and Surendranagar districs of northern Gujarat.



136
Plots of archaeological sites of Mature Harappan period in Kachchh district (Desalpur, Dholavira, Gunthai, Kanthkot, Kerasi, kotada, Lakhpat, Luna etc.) clearly indicates close association of important civilization along the bank of Sarasvati palaeochannels (Fig.20).
4.4 Drilling (Litholog) Data Analysis
The geophysical (resistivity) survey was carried out for identifying potable groundwater in the desert areas. It revealed the presence of several zones of less saline and fresh water in the form of arcuate shaped aquifers. The disposition of these water pockets are correlatable with the traces of the palaeochannels found in these areas. This subsurface evidence of fresh water further adds prevalence of an earlier active drainage system in these areas. Sedimentological analysis for aquifer characteristics have been done in collaboration with Ground Water Department (GWD), Jodhpur and Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), Jaipur. The palaeochannels most often consist of the alternating layers of fine to medium and coarse grained sand and sometimes have gravel columns, indicating presence of fluvial regime. Coarser sediments are noticed at a depth ranging from 40–125m (general depth of 55-85 m) and have been encountered in 9 of the 14 tube



137
wells drilled (Fig.21). Channels are about 35 to 80m thick with depth of water level ranging from
35-60m (Table-4).
Exploration of palaeochannels (PCs) in the Jaisalmer district by the Ground Water Department (GWD), Rajasthan has proved existence of large quantities of potable quality ground water along



138
the explored palaeochannels (Fig.22, Table-5). Further, available litholog data for the wells drilled by the GWD for water supply to villages in different districts of Rajasthan has been analyzed to confirm if the mapped palaeo drainage courses conform to the fluvial regime. Data available for the study area from districts of Sri-Ganganagar, Sikar, Jhunjhunu, Churu, Bikaner, Nagaur, Jaisalmer, Jalor, Pali, Sirohi and Barmer districts was plotted on GIS layer and overlaid on to the palaeochannel map. It was observed that the wells falling along the palaeochannels mostly had encountered coarser sediments (Medium to coarse sand and gravels) during drilling.
Recently, electrical resistivity soundings were used to map the large-scale geometry and architecture of the palaeochannel system along Ghaggar River in NW India (Sinha et al., 2013). They found a thick and extensive sand body in the subsurface in parts of north-western Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab. The dimensions of the palaeochannel bodies imply that these are the deposits of a large river system. The dimensions of the palaeochannel complex suggest a large, longlived fluvial system existed in this region.

To investigate the charactersistics of the palaeochannels in Haryana, litholog and hydrological data from a large number of wells drilled in 9 districts of northern Haryana have been collected from Ground Water Cell, Govt. of Haryana. The locations of the individual lithologs have been plotted in different districts on the map (Fig.23). Sedimentological characteristics encountered at different depths of the lithologs have also been studied. On superimposing the litholog points on the palaeochannel map of Haryana, it has been found that most of the lithologs falling near the palaeochennels have medium to coarse grained sands and associated gravel and pebbles at a depth between 10 to 100m.

4.5 Hydrological Data Analysis
4.5.1 Hydrogeological Study of Western Rajasthan: Analysis of sediments and water samples obtained from core drilling of 14 tube wells on the image identified palaeochannels in TanotKishangarh–Longewala-Ghotaru section Jaisalmer district indicate that the water quality is quite good (Table-4) for most of the drilled wells, as compared to tube wells / dug wells away from the channel. As per the local Government norms, in the desert region ground waters upto EC of 4000 μs/cm are supplied to villages for drinking water purposes. The ground water away from palaeochannels is saline (non potable), EC >8,000 μs/cm at 25°C (CGWB, 2002 and GWD, 2003). The presence of vegetation even during extreme summer shows that these courses still maintain their headwater connection and form potential groundwater zones for exploitation. In spite of very low rainfall (less than 150 mm) and extreme weather conditions in the northwestern part of Jaisalmer district groundwater is available at a depth of about 50-60 m along the course. Despite being intensively used for 35-40 years there is no indication of any decline in the discharge of tube wells or of the lowering of water table. The wells in the vicinity do not dry up throughout the year.
4.5.2 Hydrogeological Study in Haryana: As a part of field validation, hydrogeological data (yield, water quality etc.) from different wells in all the northern districts of northern Haryana has been analyzed. Electrical Conductivity (EC) zoning pattern of the area shows that most of the demarcated palaeochannels lie in lower EC zone (2000-4000 μS/cm) indicating good quality



141
water. Poor quality water (brackish to saline) is found in the central Haryana (Rohtak district) and northwest Haryana (Sirsa district) where EC values are very high (>4000 μS/cm). The
analysis of water level data in some districts of Haryana also gives evidences of ground water at shallow depth. The water level contour of 4 district of northern Haryana (Kurukshetra, Karnal, Kaithal, & Panipat) shows large variation within the district. The water level contour, which are closer to any river show lower value as compared to those which are far away from rivers or palaeochannels marked e.g., northern part of Kaithal and eastern part of Karnal show shallow water level (15- 25m) as compared to the central part of Kaithal and western part of Panipat (3560m). The contour map of discharge data of the 4 districts of north Haryana also verifies the above conclusion. The discharge contour map shows the contour line with higher values in the northern part of Kaithal and western part of Karnal and Panipat (21000-39000 cusec) as compared to central part of Kaithal, Karnal and Panipat (15000-19000 cusec).
5.0 GEOCHRONOLOGICAL AGES OF SARASVATI RIVER BASIN
5.1 Age of Sediments in the Palaeochannels in Haryana - Based on the collection of subsurface lithofacies data from well logs, Saini et al. (2009) attempted to map the buried channelfloodplain systems of a part of the northwestern Haryana plains and provides evidence of buried major sand bodies at various depths. They have identified four lithological facies based on litholog data analysis: (a) Brown sandy facies – Well-sorted very fine sand, deposited by eolian activity (b) Brown silt facies – This sequence is of 20-40cm thick, formed by floodplain. (c) Grey sandy facies – Fluvial deposit (d) Brown clay/mud facies – Floodplain or lacustrine deposit Further, Sediment characteristics from litholog data and Optical Stimulated Luminance (OSL) dating of sand (quartz) samples suggest the following evolutionary history of fluvial activity in western part of Haryana (Saini et al., 2009): F-3 Phase (< 2.9 Ka) – Weak, piedmont-fed Ghaggar system, semi-arid climate ~~~~~~Desiccation of the channel between 4.3 Ka and 2.9 Ka~~~~~~ F-2 Phase (2.9 to 5.9 Ka) – Vedic Sarasvati channel, buried as relict land, subhumid climate ~~~~Aeolian phase with accumulation of sand dunes/sheets, arid climate during 15-20 Ka~~ F-1A Phase (~21 Ka) – Disorganization phase, weak fluvial activity, buried at 3-6m depth, terminated around Last Glacial maximum (LGM) F-1 Phase (26-28 Ka) – Himalayan-fed channel network, including palaeochannels courses at Sirsa-Phaggu, Fatehbad-Agroha and Hisar at 6m depth, humid climate. Active channel during interglacial period (MIS-3) Thus, OSL dates of sands at different levels suggest the existence of much older palaeochannels (~26 to 28 Ka) than the Sarasvati palaeochannels (2.9 to 5.9 Ka), as estimated by most of the previous workers. 5.2 Age of Aeolian Sands in Rajasthan Using Thermoluminescence (TL) and Optically Stimulated Lumeinisance (OSL) dating of sands, Singvi and Kar (2004) advocated that the Quaternary aeolian activity in Thar Desert is more than 150Ka old. There were four major phases of pre-LGM (Last Glacial Maximum) aeolian accumulation during the Late Pleistocene viz. 100 and 115 ka, ~75 ka, ~55 ka and between 30 and 25 ka. LGM was a period of high aridity, when the desert could have extended far beyond its present boundary. The LGM also experienced reduced fluvial activity. Maximum sand mobility and accumulation took place when the SW monsoon wind strength was sufficient during the transition period from an arid phase to a wetter phase and vice versa. Thus, the peak of aridity at ~18ka was marked by very less Aeolian activities. The Aeolian deposition following the LGM started at ~16ka, but the major activities took place roughly between 14 and 10ka, when sand spread to areas far beyond its present eastern limit. A northward shift in dune forming climate during the Holocene was also seen. Thus the southern margin of mega-Thar in Gujarat did not experience any dune building activity



142
after 10Ka, the north Gujarat plain experienced dune aggradation activity up to 5ka, while large parts of west Rajasthan, containing the core of the Thar experiences dune activity even after 2ka. Within the present desert boundary, the major phases of aeolian activities after the Holocene Climatic Optimum were between 5 and 3.5ka, and 2 and 0.8ka (0.6ka in the western part). The Harappan and pre-Harappan civilization in the northern part of the desert flourished during a waning phase of SW monsoon, when rainfall events were more aberrant, and Aeolian activities high. 5.3 Age of Groundwater in the Palaeochannels The isotopic ages (H3 , O18 and C14) of 17 groundwater samples from the existing wells along the palaeochannels in Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan were analysed by the Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC), Mumbai on the basis of Pearson model (Table-6). The analysis indicates the variation in groundwater ages from 1340 to 18880 BP at different localities from NE to SW (Rao and Kulkarni, 1997; Nair et al., 1999). These areas lie either on the palaeochannel or very close to it viz. Kuriaberi (1340 BP), Ghantiyali (550 BP), Ranau (1930 BP), Sadewala (18800 BP), Longewala (12400 BP), Ghotaru (8910 BP), Dost Mohd. (2000 BP) etc.. Hence, age analysis of water samples indicate towards a palaeo source of water along the channels that may be linked to Ghaggar (Sarasvati) palaeochannels. The shallow (>30m) and deep (>60m) groundwater along the palaeochannels have similar chemical and isotopic characteristics. The ground water do not have isotopic signature of present day Himalayan Rivers. However, the deep groundwater indicates towards origin from Himalayan source. Based on the relative radiocarbon ages, ground water movement (velocity) along the palaeochannels has been estimated as 5m/yr.
5.4 Palynological Evidence for Climatic Changes Based on palynological studies on sediments derived from three salt lakes in Rajasthan, namely Sambhar, Didwana and Lunkaransar, Singh et al. (1974) postulated climatic fluctuations during the period 8000 B.C. to present day. Out of the five phases, Phase IV (3000 B.C. to 1800 B.C.) encompasses the early Harappan and Harappan culture. It was postulated to be characterized by heavy rainfall at least 50 cm more than the present rainfall in the arid zone. The decline of the Harappan culture during the period 18001000 B.C. was attributed to setting in of a dry climate. This hypothesis has not been accepted by



143
many archaeologists and palaeobotanists (Mishra, 1984). Increased rainfall during 8000-2000 B.C. should have led to farming activity in western Rajasthan. No Neolithic- chalcolithic or early Iron Age site has been reported from even the Luni basin where extensive exploration has been carried out during sixties and seventies. Mughal (1982) has reported hundreds of farming sites of Neolithic-chalocolithic period from Cholistan desert (Bahawalpur state), which is considered to be still more arid (rainfall ~100 mm/year) than the western Rajasthan Thar Desert (rainfall ~200250 mm/year). 5.5 Geochronological Events of Sarasvati Drainage Evolution A comprehensive table has been generated for the geochronological events of the Sarasvati drainage network evolution based on the available data of isotopic (H 3 , O 18 and C14) analysis, Thermo Luminescence (TL) dating, Optical Stimulated Luminance (OSL) dating, foraminifera study of sea level changes and other collateral information (Table-7). Sample analysis of sediments in lithologs and OSL dating of sand (quartz), Saini et al. (2009) suggested a much older palaeochannels (~26000 to 28000 BP) than the Sarasvati palaeochannels (2900 to 5900 BP). Using TL and OSL dating of sands, Singvi and Kar (2004) interpreted that the Quaternary aeolian activity in Thar Desert began prior to 150,000 years before present. The Harappan and pre-Harappan civilization in the northern part of the desert flourished during a waning phase of SW monsoon, when rainfall events were more aberrant, and aeolian activities were high. Isotopic analysis (H 3 , O18 and C 14) of 17 groundwater samples from the existing wells along the palaeochannels in Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan by BARC, Mumbai indicates that age of trapped groundwater varies from 1340 to 18880 BP (Rao and Kulkarni, 1997; Nair et al., 1999). Recently, groundwater samples were analysed by Reddy et al. (2011) in parts of the Jaisalmer district. The groundwater of deeper aquifer (~480m) was found to be more than 40,000 years and the age of groundwater in medium aquifer (~170m) vary from 9000 to 17,000 years. Based on the study of foraminifera along Gujarat coast, Nigam (2012) advocates that sea level was lower during 7,000- 10,000 and 3,000-4,000 years. Lowering of sea level is evinced by the dissociation of an ancient dockyard like Lothal which is presently located about 10-12 km away from the sea and few meters above the present sea level. Rise in sea level was observed during 4,000-7,000 and 1,500-3,500 years which causes submergence of Neolithic settlement in Gulf of Khambat and Dwaraka in Gulf of Kachchh. All these available data indicates that the Himalayan drainage in NW India was existing more than 40,000 years ago i.e. before the Sarasvati civilization. Vedic Sarasvati River was in full majesty during 6,000-8,000 years (Radhakrishna, 1999; Valdiya, 2002).



144
6.0 DISCUSSION ON SARASVATI RIVER LINKAGES 6.1 Linkage of Sarasvati Nadi with Somb River at Adi Badri Topographical and ground survey show that Sarasvati Nadi originates near Rampur Herian village, located 9 Kms south of Adi Badri area in Yamunanagar district of Haryana. However, the Somb River originates further north in the higher reaches of the Siwalik Hills. Somb River is located east of Sarasvati Nadi and flows in N-S direction and finally joins River Yamuna in the southeast. Adi Badri is located on the bank of a small rivulet joining the Somb River. Topography of Adi Badri area is studied based on the satellite data of SRTM of February, 2000. SRTM derived hill shade view shows the emergence of ephemeral 1st order drainages of Sarasvati Nadi and Somb River from the Siwalik foothill zone (Fig.24a). Close contour pattern of this area (Fig.24b), generated from SRTM DEM, indicate gentle topography between Adi Badri (360m) and Rampur Herian (330m). A height difference of only 20m has been observed from the tip of Sarasvati drainage line at Rampur Herian (330m) and the Somb River bed (310m) in the E-W direction. Thus, the drainage pattern of the area indicates the possibility of joining the upstream of River Somb with the Sarasawti Nadi in the past. On high resolution satellite data (IRS LISS-IV FCC) of May, 2004, an N-S trending dark greenish red



145
colour linear tonal anomaly can be clearly demarcated in the southwest of Adi Badri area upto the 1st order drainage from where Sarasvati Nadi originates near Rampur Herian (Fig.24c). This strong image anomaly indicates a possible linkage of drainages around Adi Badri area with Sarasvati Nadi in the past, instead of River Somb in the present state. This gives rise towards a strong possibility that drainage originating from the upper catchment area of Somb River in the north of Adi Badri must have served as the drainage of Sarasvati Nadi in the past. The configuration of tributaries of Somb River also indicates towards feasibility of river capture of previously upstream drainage of Sarasvati Nadi by the Somb River at Adi Badri. All these evidences lead towards the likely origin of Sarasvati Nadi at Adi Badri sometimes in the past (historic/pre-historic period), as strongly believed even today by the people of the region.



146
6.1.1 Archaeological Importance of Adi Badri Area: A major archaeological breakthrough has been reported from the archaeological excavation carried out during 2002-03 at Adi Badri area, north of Kathgar in Yamunanagr district (Dwivedi et. al., 2006). Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) excavated three sites viz. ABR-I and ABR-II on western bank of Sarasvati-Somb River confluence and ABR-III on the eastern side of the Somb River (Fig.25a and b). A rich heritage of Buddhist Civilization, right from 3rd -4 th Century A.D. (Burial activity) to 10th -12th Century A.D. (Dressed stone structures) have been discovered from ABR-III. Stone sculpture associated with Shivling of medieval period has also been found from this site. Local people believe that the udgamsthal (origin) of Sarasvati Nadi is at Adi Badri where water oozes from a cave. A large pond (Sarasvati Sarovar) has been constructed here for a holy bath for the pilgrims and a large number of artifacts of Buddhist period have been excavated from ABR-I (Fig.25c). Moreover, this area is known as the Haridwar of Haryana due to the existence of three old temples viz. Adi Badri, Adi Kedar and Mantra Devi. Based on the evidences of Hindu rituals sites (after death) at Adibadri stream confluence with Somb and the occurrence of several Buddhist settlements and stupa there, it may be concluded that Adi Badri has been an important historic place in the past.



147
6.1.2 Study of Riverine Sediments at Adi Badri:
During excavation of archaeological sites (ABR-I, ABR-II and ABR-III) at Adi Badri area, the nature of riverine sediments (mostly pebbles) has been studied by Puri and Verma (1998). They inferred that these pebbles are of glacial origin and belong to Higher Himalayan metamorphic rocks. The area has been revisited by the present authors in 2005-06 for detailed study of the nature of the sediments to reveal their source / provenance. Physiographically, Adi Badri lies on an elevated region, on the southern flank of Siwalik Hills in Yamunanagar district. ABR-I and ABR-III are located at lower elevation on either side of the Somb River. But the ABR-II site is located on a ridge (locally known as Itonwali), 1⁄2 km NE of Kathgarh and it lies at a higher elevation (~70m high) from the Somb River bed (Fig.25b). A large number of pebbles of varying nature (colour and texture) have been found at ABR-II. These pebbles are rounded to subrounded, light to dark grey in colour and medium to coarse grained texture. Moreover, the pebbles are mostly sorted (more or less same size) which indicate the end phase of fluvial deposit. At ABR-II site, pebbles of both sedimentary and metamorphic rocks have been found at ridge top. But pebbles of only sedimentary origin are reported from ABR-I and ABR-III sites.



148
Since the Somb River is the only river flowing through this area, it is possible that in the past, these pebbles might have been transported by Somb/ Sarasvati which was perhaps more energetic and must have had higher carrying capacity than the present day flow. Occurrence of large number of pebbles at such a higher elevation at ABR-II indicates that possibly Somb River might have been flowing at 70m high above the present river bed. In other words, present day physiography is the result of deep river cutting across the Siwalik Hill range.
Detailed field observation in two pits of ABR-II excavation site shows sub-rounded pebbles which are aligned almost parallel to the valley configuration. It reveals that this ridge constitutes the basal part of T3 terrace which is the oldest terrace in outer Himalaya during Holocene period (Puri, 2001; Puri and Verma, 1998). They have reported pebbles of high grade metamorphic rocks like mica schist, quartzite and metabasite along with the pebbles of Siwalik rocks. Similar assemblages of sedimentary and metamorphic pebbles are also reported near Sudanwala T3 terrace, NE of Adi Badri, on other side of Siwalik Hill slope. Occurrence of high grade metamorphic rocks are very uncommon all along the Siwalik Hills rather they have an affinity with the rocks of Central Crystallines / Jutogh Group in Higher Himalaya.
6.2 Linkage of Sarasvati Nadi with Yamuna River
Pebbles of metamorphic rock have been found at several places viz. Adi Badri, Sudanwala, Garibnath etc. between Tons-Yamuna River confluence (Paonta Sahib) and Bata-Markanda River divide (Fig.26). Puri and Verma (1998) postulate that these pebbles might have been transported by a river like Tons which originate from Higher Himalaya in the north. Transportation of these pebbles for such a long distance and their deposition on river terraces of Siwalik foothills clearly indicates towards the existence of an ancient powerful drainage system. Since this drainage course follows the Bata valley, it is possible that Tons River might have flowed through Bata River in the past and joined either with Markanda or Sarasvati Nadi in aryana. In such a case, the present day Yamuna flow was not to the south rather it flowed westward along Bata River. Puri and Verma (1998) also postulated that the Vedic Sarasvati might have drained through the Adi Badri site and dumped the metamorphic pebbles at ABR-II. Petrographic studies indicate occurrence of pebbles of calcareous sandstone and quartzite of metamorphic origin at Adi Badri area. However, the catchment area of Sarasvati Nadi is confined to the southern slope of the Siwalik Hills and the river receives only seasonal flow due to low precipitation. Hence, no linkage of Sarasvati Nadi with any major perennial river systems like Yamuna could be found out based on the available data and evidences. It remains doubt that Sarasvati Nadi could have formed a powerful drainage system in the past and served as the main channel of Vedic Sarasvati River. The present day topography, rainfall and drainages of the region, does not support the hypothesis provided by the Puri & Verma (1998). However, study of neotectonic activity along major and active faults like Yamuna Tear Faults shows upliftment or subsidence of the terrain. As a result, drainages have been shifted eastward and capture by other stream (river piracy) due to accelerated headward erosion (Virdi and Philip, 2006).



149
6.3 Linkage of Sarasvati Nadi with Vedic Sarasvati
As observed from Satellite data and the SOI topomaps, Sarasvati Nadi has been a tributary to the Vedic Sarasvati River. Sarasvati Nadi presently originates from a place `Rampur Herian’ which is located south of Adi Badri in Yamunanagar district. The river passes through Yamunanagar (Bari Pabni, Choti Pabni, Chhapar, Sadhaura and Mustafabad), Kurukshetra (Pipli, Thanesar, Jyotisar, Bhor-Saidon, Bibipur and Pehowa), Kaithal and Fatehabad districts and joins with River Ghaggar at Rasauli village near Shatrana in Patiala district of Punjab. The catchment area of Sarasvati Nadi is found to be confined to Yamunanagar and Kurukshera disricts. Since the catchment area of Sarasvati Nadi is confined to the southern slope of the Siwalik Hills, the river receives only seasonal flow. Hence, this stream (Sarasvati nadi) in its present form does not seem to be a powerful drainage system in the past. However, sites of Late-Harappan to Early Historic period like Sandhaya, Kapal Mochan, Sadhaura, Mustafabad, Bilaspur, Thanesar and Pehowa etc. and also the sites of Mature/Sothi Harappan period viz. Bhagwanpura, Garhi Rodan and Nandu Khera in Kurukshetra district are found to lie along the course of Sarasvati Nadi and its tributaries. Relics of a large number of old temples and ashramas (hermitages) of Rishis like Parasara, Ved Vyas, Dadhichi, Parsurama etc., described in ancient texts of Mahabharata and Puranas and several sacred ponds and sites of Vedic rituals are present along the banks of the obliterated Sarasvati drainage course. All these indicate Sarasvati Nadi to be a historically



150
important and perhaps perennial stream of the past and served as the main powerful channel of Vedic Sarasvati River.
6.4 Linkage of Satluj Palaeochannel with Vedic Sarasvati
In previous section, it has described that optical data as well as SAR images could able to pick up a subsurface palaeochanne between Ropar and Patiala and is known as Satluj palaeochannel. It is a N-S trending palaeochannel of nearly 75 km length and 1-6 kn width. The Satluj palaeochannel is connecting the present day Satluj River near Ropar and the Ghaggar River (Vedic Sarasvati) in the south of Patiala. Thus, Satluj palaeochannel possibly acted as a major link between the Himalayayan glacier and the Vedic Sarasvati.
6.5 Linkage of Vedic Sarasvati from Mannsarovar to Dwaraka
Rising in the Himalayas from the holy lake of Mansarovar in Tibet, the Satluj river enters the plains near Ropar (Punjab), when it takes a sharp right–angled turn and flows westward a distance of 150 km before being joined by the Beas river. The Ghaggar River rises in the Siwalik from the Morni Hills and enters the plains near Ambala (Haryana). After covering a distance of 175 km it joins the Sarasvati at Rasula (Patiala district). The combined rivers now know as Ghaggar flows through Sirsa (Haryana), Hanumangarh and Ganganagar district (Rajasthan) and through the Bahawalpur state (Pakistan). The Sarasvati rises in the Sirmaur region of the Siwalik and enter the plains at Adi Badri (Yamunanagar). After flowing through Karnal in Haryana it joins the Ghaggar near Rasula in Patiala. The Ghaggar bed dries up near Sirsa.
To be a vibrant mighty river, the Sarasvati in Vedic Period must have been contributed by any major river system of the Himalaya. Presently, Satluj and Yamuna are the two perennial rivers which are likely to be the feeder channels of Vedic Sarasvati River in the past. Beyond the range of Siwalik and Lesser Himalaya, these two rivers are fed with the permanent glaciers in the Higher Himalaya. It has been observed from the satellite images that the size of the glacier of Satluj River is much larger than the size of the Yamunotri and Bandarpunch glaciers. But, due to tectonic changes in the past, these two perennial rivers shift their courses viz. Satluj to the west to join river Indus and Yamuna to east to join River Ganges near Allahabad. Based on the analysis of several satellite images coupled with the Remote Sensing techniques, the entire course of Sarasvati palaeochannels have been delineated from the Himalayan foothills to the Rann of Kachchh, passing through the Thar Desert in NW India (Fig.27).



151
As mentioned earlier, Vedic Sarasvati River met the Arabian Sea at the Rann of Kachchh. In Late Vedic period, Sarasvati lost her major tributaries, Yamuna and Satluj. Satluj turns west and joined Beas-Sindhu system and Yamuna started migrating east to join Ganga (Valdiya, 2002). During Mahabharata times, the volume of water flowing down the Sarasvati had reduced and did not flow upto the sea. At the time of Krishna’s birth Yamuna has not as mighty as it is today. Hence, it must have been possible for Basudev to cross the river with the new born Krishna in his arm. It is described in Mahabharata that Balaram travelled along the most dry banks of Sarasvati and then along the banks of Yamuna from Prabhas (Somnath) to Mathura. Dwaraka city was in existence during Mahabharata period whose northern extension ends at Bet Dwarka. Based on all these scientific evidence, the course of Sarasvati River may be linked from Mansarovar in Higher Himalaya to Dwaraka in Arabian Sea coast during late Quaternary period (Fig.28).



152
7.0 CONCLUSIONS AND SUGGESTIONS
7.1 Conclusions The entire course of Vedic Sarasvati River has been delineated using latest satellite images. The mapped course is validated with a variety of ground data such as archaeological sites, drilling and hydrogeological data. Radiometric ages of river sediments suggests that the age of Vedic Sarasvati River (older palaeochannels) may be as old as 28,000 years and flourished during 8000 to 5000 years ago which may be represented by younger palaeochannels in Haryana. However, the age of trapped ground water in the palaeochannels in Rajasthan shows contemporary age of Sarasvati (1340-8910 BP) and as old as 18800BP.
Present day perennial sources of Satluj and Yamuna/Tons rivers upto the Siwalik foot hills have been considered as part of Vedic Sarasvati River. Available sources with the present scientific evidence leads to the conclusion that Sarasvati River network might have been in existence as old as 28,000 years BP and ceased to be a dry channel during 3792 years BP.
Integrated study with multi-disciplinary approach leads to the following conclusions:



153
• The northwestern region of Indian sub-continent witnessed a number of mighty flowing rivers in the past. Like present day Indus River system, a sub-parallel river system known as `Vedic
Sarasvati River’ was flowing with full majesty around 6000 B.C. The river dried up subsequently and disappeared around 3000 B.C. due to climatic and tectonic changes in Himalayan region. The relict of this lost river is still found as palaeochannels in the above states.
• River Sarasvati originated in the Higher Himalayas and flowed through the western part of Indo-Gangetic alluvial plains along several tributaries like Satluj, Yamuna, Chautang and Drishadvati. The Sarasvati river system passed through the states of Himanchal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan and finally discharged into Rann of Kachchh in Gujarat.
• Close association of contemporary Vedic composers all along the River Sarasvati indicates that the Rig Vedic tradition might have been prevailed during 8000-5000 BP. Rishi Veda Vyasa composed Mahabharata with the observation of sky inscriptions on the banks of River Sarasvati. Recent astronomical dating indicates that Mahabharata War was fought around 3792 BP. Thus, civilization grown along the Sarasvati River possibly links between Vedic and Mahabharata period (8000-3792 BP).
• The course of Vedic Sarasvati is mapped using modern tools like Remote Sensing and GIS. The satellite image interpretation shows the obscured signature of `palaeo-rivers’ below the aeolian sands in the Thar Desert. An attempt has been made to trace the entire drainage network of the `Lost Vedic Sarasvati’ from the Siwalik foothills to Arabian sea and its possible link to the perennial source in higher Himalaya.
• Multi-spectral and multi-resolution satellite images like optical satellite data (Landsat ETM and IRS P3 WiFS and IRS P6 AWiFS, LISS-3 and LISS-4) as well as microwave (Radarsat SAR) data have been used to delineate the palaeochannels.
• The mapped courses have been validated with a variety of ground information like archaeology, sedimentology, hydrogeology and drilling data.
• The relative ages of the discovered archaeological sites and the radiocarbon dating of ground water and sediment samples all along the palaeochannels are highlighted in the present study.
• Radiometric ages of river sediments suggests that the age of Vedic Sarasvati River (older palaeochannels) may be as old as 28,000 years and flourished during 8000 to 5000 years ago which may be represented by younger palaeochannels in Haryana. However, the age of trapped ground water in the palaeochannels in Rajasthan shows contemporary age of Sarasvati (13408910 BP) and as old as 18800BP.
• Present day perennial sources of Satluj and Yamuna/Tons rivers upto the Siwalik foot hills have been considered as part of Vedic Sarasvati River. Available sources with the present scientific evidence leads to the conclusion that Sarasvati River network might have been in existence as old as 28,000 years BP and ceased to be a dry channel during 3792 years BP.
• Satluj palaeochannel in Punjab links Vedic Sarasvati River to the major source at Mansarovar Lake. A linkage of the entire drainage network has been established from Mansarovar (Tibetan Himalaya) to Dwarka (Arabian Sea coast) during late Quaternary period.
7.2 Suggestions for Reviving Sarasvati River



154
7.2.1 Safeguarding Sarasvati Nadi at Adi Badri: There is a need to safeguard and revive the Sarasvati Nadi which is historically and archaeologically important drainage in Haryana. This could be done by diverting water (through canals) from existing Rivers (Markanda, Somb or Yamuna) which are close to the Sarasvati Nadi. The effort may benefit the people of the region to meet their religious needs and perform rituals along the banks of flowing River Sarasvati. At the same time, water can also be used for irrigation along the Sarasvati River.
7.2.2 Action Plan to Revive Sarasvati Nadi in Haryana: Based on the present study and assessment of the actual ground situation, the following action plan is suggested for revival of Sarasvati Nadi, restoring the heritage and keep with the people’s sentiments.
1. Silt removal / deepening of Sarasvati Nadi in blocked areas for free flow of water and routing of flash floods.
2. Legislation to avoid dumping of sewerage / industrial water into Sarasvati Nadi by way of providing alternative disposal mechanism.
3. Legislation and movement for freeing the encroached river land belonging to Sarasvati Nadi from private possession.
4. Revival of Sarasvati Nadi to restore the heritage by way of River linking with Somb, Markanda or Yamuna Canal. (a) Linking of Sarasvati Nadi with Somb River by constructing artificial channel near Rampur Herian for about 1.5-2.0 km distance. Also construction of reservoirs in upstream of Somb River area to augment and divert the flow of water in Sarasvati Nadi in dry periods. (b) Linking of Sarasvati Nadi with Markanda River by constructing artificial channel for about 3-4 km distance near Saranwan village. (c) As a permanent solution, construction of a feeder canal to supply water from Western Yamuna Canal into Sarasvati Nadi (between Radaur and Purangarh village in Kurukshetra district) for a distance of 6-7 km to make it perennial.
5. Usage of ground water available along the Sarasvati palaeochannels for supplemental irrigation. Palaeochannels form storehouse for good quality ground water.
7.2.3 Revival of Vedic Sarasvati:
Vedic Sarasvati River is believed to be the holiest in India by the local people of Haryana,
Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat. Projects have been already started for the revival of the ‘Lost Sarasvati’. ‘Sarasvati Sarovar’ has been constructed in Adi Badri region recently as part of the project. The water from the pretty stream is collected at the ‘Sarasvati Udhgam Sthal’ known as the Sarasvati kund. In the region, a small stream exists which is known as Sarasvati Nadi. It is now represented by a drain called Sarsuti. The lower parts of this stream are also dissected and cannot be traced downstream.
Numerous temples and Sarovars are constructed along the course of the Vedic Sarasvati. The Sarasvati Sarovar at Mustafabad village is filled by the present Sarasvati nala. The Kapal mochan Sarovar near Bilaspur and the Jyotisar Talab near Kurukshetra were all once fed by the Sarasvati River. The dimensions of these water bodies also indicate the mighty of the river Sarasvati in the past. The religious, sentimental and emotional attachment of the people of the Sarasvati basin is the main cause behind reviving the Sarasvati River.

The objective of the project includes tracing of the entire course of the river as well as construction of channels wherever required to make the Sarasvati water flow through the recent course of the river. The old courses of the river will also be utilized for the purposes of interlinking of rivers. 7.2.4 Public Utility of Sarasvati Palaeochannels: Finally, the delineated course of Sarasvati palaeochannels can be utilized for the benefit of the region and the country in the following three sectors: 1. Ground Water Resources: (a) Groundwater Exploration (b) Groundwater Recharge 2. Tourism Sector:
(a) Renovation of Temples / Tirtha Sites
(b) Reconstruction of Ritual Sites along the Sarasvati Channels to perform Pind Dan, Asthi Visharjan, Mundan etc. 3. Vedic Cultural Heritage: (a) Restoration of Historical sites (b) Excavation of New Archaeological Sites.
