Samos, Giamos, Bitouesc Summer, Winter, and Worlds
Segomâros Widugeni in Nemeton Segomâros on Mar 04, 2015
The ancient Gaulish worldview can only be known in general outline,
and then mostly from linguistics. We have no great literature in
Gaulish, as we do in Greek, Latin, Irish, and Welsh. We have only
inscriptions and what can be pieced together from comparative
studies. Still, given the paucity of evidence at our disposal, it is
surprising how much we can know. We can get ideas of seasons and
cosmic principles, of Three Worlds in space, of directional
symbolism,, good, evil, honor, destiny and Fate, animal symbolism,
and the soul. Together, these comparative scraps of evidence allow
us to sketch the lineaments of a worldview.
Cosmic Principles:
Built into the Celtic languages and worldviews are two great cosmic
principles that exist in a system of complementary duality. Each is
needed to complete the cosmos. Neither by itself can support life
and wholeness. We have no direct evidence as to whether the Gauls
had words for such principles, but linguistic reconstruction suggests
that the words existed in Old Common Celtic, so it would be
surprising if the words didnʼt survive into Gaulish.
Here, we use the terms from Alexei Kondratievʼs Apple Branch, with
meanings taken from Kondratiev, the Brothers Reesʼ Celtic Heritage,
and a touch of intuition.
Samos: The cosmic principle of the summer, the light, daytime, the
Upper World, the living, order, the tame, and the mundane.1



Giamos: The cosmic principle of the winter, the dark, nighttime, the
Lower World, the dead, chaos, the wild, and the magical.2
The alternation of these principles, in the form of day and night, or
summer and winter, or waxing and waning moons has profound
meaning. It is the means by which time and the calendar are
generated.3 It determines which spiritual influences are dominant at
any time, and which activities are of good omen.
The Three Worlds:
Modern, Irish-based Celtic Reconstructionists tend to use the three
worlds of Land, Sea, and Sky in their practice.4 They base this on
well-founded mainstream scholarship of early Irish cosmology, which
finds the belief reflected in the Irish epic the Táin Bo Cualigne, as
well as in various oaths and prayers. 5
There is evidence for this same belief among the Gauls as well, in the
form of Straboʼs famous quote that the Celts on the Danube “feared
nothing so much as that the sky might fall on them”.
Celtic linguists recognize native words for “Heaven”, “Earth” or “the
World”, and “the Deep”, in the Celtic languages, that have similar
connotations to Land, Sea, and Sky. These include attested words in
Gaulish6 The archaeological evidence of Gaulish sacrifice, while
ambiguous and of many types, reveals at least two kinds that are
most likely to celestial and infernal deities.7
With that in mind, we can sketch the outlines of a cosmic system.
Essentially, it consists of Sky, This World, and the Deep, with the
possibility of a World Tree linking them, though this last is
conjectural. It resembles the system of Land, Sea, and Sky closely,
though I see no reason not to use the Gaulish terms for these things,
since we have them, and their connotations are quite different from



any words in English.
Albios: The Sky, home of celestial deities, celestial bodies, with
connotations of light, purity, and Truth, source of power for the
Samos principle8
Nemos: Sky, another word for Albios, above, though perhaps more
restricted in meaning to the physical sky.9
Bitus: This world, home of humanity, animals, plants, and various
spirits, acted upon by the Upper and Lower worlds.10
Mori: Sea, another word for Dumnos below, though definitely more
restricted in meaning to the watery sea.11
Dumnos: The Deep, home of Chthonic Deities, spirits of the dead,
and certain dark spirits, connotations of darkness, fertility, and
mysterious power, source of power for the Giamos principle. 12
Bilios: A tree, by extension the World Tree, linking the Three Worlds.
Conjectural.13
Celestial and Chthonic:
According to Delmarre, there were also attested Gaulish words for
“celestial” or “uranian” and “chthonic”.14 This supports our argument
here that the Three Worlds and two cosmic principles were
important elements of Gaulish cosmology. That there were words for
worlds, descriptive terms for things from above and things from
below, and differences in ritual in some places and times, all suggest
the centrality of a cosmic system emphasizing the shining Heavens,
the dark Deep, and the world between them, over which they
alternated influence.
Ueronados: From above, pertaining to Albios, celestial.15



Andernados: From below, pertaining to Dumnos, chthonic,
infernal.16
The Directions:
The orientation of the directions in Celtic cultures is well-accepted in
Celtic linguistics, and in Indo-European linguistics more broadly. The
person at the center stands facing East. The West is behind him or
her. The South is to the right hand, and the North to the left hand.
The South is of good omen, and the North of ill omen17 The system
below reproduces all that, and adds my own conjecture that the
East, being the place of sunrise, is to be associated with Samos,
while the West, being the place of sunset, is to be associated with
Giamos. I also add ideas from the Brothers Rees on the importance
of the Center. I do not use the rest of the Irish directional system
preserved in The Settling of the Manor of Tara, because I find little
convincing evidence of its being known in Gaul.
Are: East, before, in front of, direction of Samos. 18
Dexsiuos: South, at the right hand, favorable.19
Eri: West, behind, rear, direction of Giamos.20
Tutos: North, at the left hand, unfavorable.21
Medios: Of the middle, central, the center.22
