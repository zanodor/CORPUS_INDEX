Late 11th- or 12th-century sculpture illustrates both the preferred medium of the Champan artists (stone sculpture in high relief), and the most popular subject-matter, the god Śiva and themes associated with the god. Shiva can be recognized by the third eye in the middle of his forehead and by the attribute of the trident. The hands above his head are making the gesture called uttarabodhi mudra, which is regarded as a symbol of perfection. Śiva with thirdeye. Champa. 10th cent.

mūlādhāra, Root Chakra is associated with the Sacral-Coccygeal
Ganglion of Impar. Sympathetic ganglia are the chains of nerve bundles of the sympathetic nervous system, that deliver information about stress, danger, and the flight or flight response. These sympathetic ganglia run vertically along the spine on both sides, ending with a single point called the Ganglion Impar, or “odd ganglion” in Latin. This is the lowest ganglion at the level of the coccyx, the tip of the chain, and only unpaired ganglion of the sympathetic nerve trunk.

Bindu cakra is the Mūlādhāracakra (मूलाधारचक्र ) It is the
“fountainhead of evolutionary energy”.—Gaṇeśa is said to preside over the Mūlādhāracakra (the fountainhead of evolutionary energy, located at the base of the spine, where it is coiled up like a sleeping serpent). When activated, the human consciousness expands and unknown and unexpected faculties emerge. Subtle powers of intelligence and accomplishment arise.



Lalitāsahasranāmastotra calls the goddess “the scripture that is her own Command”.
Ājñā (आज्ञा ) ‘COMMAND’ or Ājñācakra refers one of the “sixteen stations of the ascent
of kuṇḍalinī” according to the Manthānabhairavatantra, a vast sprawling work that belongs to a corpus of Tantric texts concerned with the worship of the goddess Kubjikā.Accordingly, “[...] (6) The Wheel of the Command [i.e., ājñācakra] is between the eyebrows. It is a fire in the form of a Point (bindu). In the middle of it is the seed of power (śaktibīja), red like vermilion. [...] (Perfect) contemplation (samādhi) is with (these) sixteen aspects and is (attained) within the form of the sixfold deposition (ṣoḍhānyāsa). He who knows this is (a veritable) Lord of Yogis, the others (who do not) are (just) quoting from books. Once attained the plane that is Void and Non-void, the yogi is freed from bondage”.

Ājñā, meaning “command' or 'summoning”, is the sixth primary chakra. The Ājñā cakra is positioned in the stomata directly behind the center of the forehead. Its kṣEtram, or superficial activation site, is in the eyebrow region at the position of the “third eye”. The seed syllable is Aum, or "Praṇava Om", the supreme sound.
Function: Ājñā translates as 'command' and is considered as the eye of intuition and intellect. When something is seen in the mind's eye, or in a dream, it is being 'seen' by Ājñā. It is a bridge that links gurus with disciples, allowing mind communication to occur between two people. The sense organ and action organ associated with Ājñā is the mind.

Śaktipāta refers to the conferring of spiritual “energy” upon one
person by another. Śaktipāta can be transmitted with a sacred word
or mantra or by a look, thought or touch–the last usually to
the Ājñā cakra or third eye of the recipient.
This work [Cidgaganacandrikā] of Kālidasa (Srivatsa) being a
commentary on Kramastuti of Sambhunatha gives more
emphasis on the Krama aspects of Trika philosophy.

Heart is the abode of the Pañcaprāṇās—the Vāyu element. Like Agni which purifies the impurities, Vāyu also
purifies the Smell and hence referred to here as Pāvaka. The first appearance of spanda in Sṛṣṭikrama,
from Prakāśa-Śiva as Vimarśa transforms into Prāṇās --“prāk śaktiḥ prāṇe pariṇatā” iti nītyā śektaḥ prathamāvirbhāvovarohakrame prāṇā eveti tantrāgamaśāstrābhiyuktāḥ |
Śakti in her Bliss state affords the sādhakas to attain this abode of her, by her grace of revelation of the eternal nature of Self. Praṇava’s three vowels represent the Jāgrat, Svapna and Suṣupti states of mind. Suṣupti is traced to the Mid of Brows (Ājñā) position known as Bindu. It also represents the Sanskrit letter ‘hrīm’ (hṛllekha). Cause of Manifestation of Soul is Nāda—name for the group of Ardhacandra, Rodhinī and Nāda—which is the Turīya state.
The fifth Turīyātīta state is state of Bliss which spreads [through the following levels of contemplation]:
1.Nāda, 2.Nādānta, 3.Śakti, 4.Samanā, 5.Vyāpinī and 6.Manonmaṇī.

Need for studies on extratemporal lobe epilepsy
The circadian rhythm refers to the 24-h cycle of behavioral and physiological activity. The circadian rhythmicity of mammals is a hierarchically organized multi-oscillator system, coordinated by a central pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus... Core-Clock Gene and Epilepsy
The core-clock genes not only regulate the circadian rhythms but also contribute to epileptic
susceptibility. The core-clock genes can disrupt the neuronal inhibitory and the excitatory balance
rhythmically, leading to seizure periodicity.. However, the exact role of the core-clock genes in the
process of epileptogenesis remains unknown. Future studies with functional assays may give us more
insight... Interestingly, the expression of the CLOCK gene in epileptic brain specimens, obtained from
focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) cases, is found to be reduced in
epileptogenic tissue when compared to control tissue. In addition, Emx- Cre, Clockflox/flox mice with
conditional deletion of CLOCK in the excitatory neurons, exhibits sleep-related seizures. Those results
suggest that the disruption of the function of the core-clock genes may play an important role in the
generation of focal epilepsy. However, most experiments are conducted on temporal lobe epilepsy;
further studies on extratemporal lobe epilepsy are warranted.

How is melatonin controlled? In humans and other mammals, the daily rhythm of pineal melatonin production is driven by the 'master' circadian clock. This 'clock' is in a region of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nuclei, which expresses a series of genes termed clock genes that continuously oscillate throughout the day. This is synchronised to the solar day via light input from the eyes. The suprachiasmatic nuclei link to the pineal gland through a complex pathway in the nervous system, passing through different brain areas, into the spinal cord and then finally reaching the pineal gland. During the day, the suprachiasmatic nuclei stops melatonin production by sending inhibitory messages to the pineal gland. At night however, the suprachiasmatic nuclei are less active, and the inhibition exerted during the day is reduced resulting in melatonin production by the pineal gland. Light is an important regulator of melatonin production from the pineal gland. Firstly, it can reset a specific area of the brain (the suprachiasmatic nuclei clock) and, as a result, the timing of the melatonin production. Secondly, exposure to light during the body's biological night reduces melatonin production and release. https://www.yourhormones.info/hormones/melatonin/
Melatonin is produced by various tissues in the body, although the major source is the pineal gland in the brain. Melatonin (blue) is produced naturally from the amino acid tryptophan, by the pineal gland (purple) at night-time. Nighttime is detected by reduced light entering the eyes (left), and the arrow shows the melatonin secretion signal sent by the optic nerve to the pineal gland once darkness has fallen.

The Pineal Gland and Melatonin The pineal gland or epiphysis synthesizes and secretes melatonin, a structurally simple hormone that communicates information about environmental lighting to various parts of the body. Ultimately, melatonin has the ability to entrain biological rhythms and has important effects on reproductive function of many animals. The light-transducing ability of the pineal gland has led some to call the pineal the "third eye". Anatomy of the Pineal Gland The pineal gland is a small organ shaped like a pine cone (hence its name). It is located on the midline, attached to the posterior end of the roof of the third ventricle in the brain. The pineal varies in size among species; in humans it is roughly 1 cm in length, whereas in dogs it is only about 1 mm long. To observe the pineal, reflect the cerebral hemispheres laterally and look for a small grayish bump in front of the cerebellum. The images below shows
the pineal gland of a horse in relation to the brain.

Histologically, the pineal is composed of "pinealocytes" and glial cells. In older animals, the pineal often is contains calcium deposits ("brain sand"). How does the retina transmit information about lightdark exposure to the pineal gland? Light exposure to the retina is first relayed to the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, an area of the brain well known to coordinate biological clock signals. Fibers from the hypothalamus descend to the spinal cord and ultimately project to the superior cervical ganglia, from which post-ganglionic neurons ascend back to the pineal gland. Thus, the pineal is similar to the adrenal medulla in the sense that it transduces signals from the sympathetic nervous system into a hormonal signal. http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endo crine/otherendo/pineal.html
Melatonin: Synthesis, Secretion and Receptors The precursor to melatonin is serotonin, a neurotransmitter that itself is derived from the amino acid tryptophan. Within the pineal gland, serotonin is acetylated and then methylated to yield melatonin.

Synthesis and secretion of melatonin is dramatically affected by light exposure to the eyes. The fundamental pattern observed is that serum
concentrations of melatonin are low during the daylight hours, and
increase to a peak during the dark.
Examples of the circadian rhythm in melatonin secretion in humans is depicted in the figure to the right (adapted from Vaughn, et al, J Clin Endo Metab 42:752, 1976). The dark gray bars represent night, and serum melatonin levels are shown for two individuals (yellow versus light blue). Note that blood levels of melatonin are essentially undetectable during daytime, but rise sharply during the dark. Very similar patterns are seen in other species.The duration of melatonin
secretion each day is directly proportional to the length of the night. http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/otherendo/pin eal.html
The mechanism behind this pattern of secretion during the dark cycle is that activity of the rate-limiting enzyme in melatonin synthesis - serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT) - is low during daylight and peaks during the dark phase. In some species, circadian changes in NAT activity are tightly correlated with transcription of the NAT messenger RNA, while in other species, post-transcriptional regulation of NAT activity is responsible. Activity of the other enzyme involved in synthesis of melatonin from serotonin - the methyltransferase - does not show regulation by pattern of light exposure. Biological Effects of Melatonin
Melatonin has important effects in integrating photoperiod and affecting circadian rhythms. Consequently, it has been reported to have significant effects on reproduction, sleep-wake cycles and other phenomena showing circadian rhythm.
