Chariot #1, after: 50% (1448 x 870 pixels) 100% (2896 x 1740).
The pictures on this page are high-resolution photographic
reconstructions for two of the damaged chariots displayed on the Standard
of Ur. Of the four chariots depicted in the bottom register (row) of the
standard, the chariot shown above was the only one that is usable in its
present condition, even though it is also heavily damaged. This is the first
time in more than 4,400 years that the chariots can be seen the way they
looked when new.
To get some idea of the magnitude of these high-resolution photographs:
Each chariot and team of horses on the Standard of Ur is a little over 4
inches long and 2 inches high; which is coincidentally the same size as the
picture seen above. If the high-resolution photograph of chariot #1 was
printed to full scale, at 100 pixels per inch, it would be 26.6 by 13.6 inches,
more than six times larger than the original image of the chariot.
Chariot #1:
I did a few minor touch-ups to repair some, but not all, of the damage
done to the figures.
This damage is both ancient and modern (when seen in high-resolution
photographs,
there is a surprising number of blobs of modern bitumen on the standard).
Perhaps the most noticeable change is the restoration of the horse heads.
The originals were too damaged
to reconstruct using Microsoft Paint, so I simply replaced them with the
horse heads
from the king’s chariot shown in the top register (after some re-sizing and
re-coloration).
I say "simply", but it took all day to do it. At first I had the horse
heads tilted slightly more forward than the original. Normally this would
be just a minor detail, but there's a reason why the artist has
the horse heads tilted back. It's to show that the horses are being held
back by the reins. The chariot attack starts slowly, the horses are walking
and the driver is causally sitting down. Then the horses are running and
the driver is standing up. Next, the horses are in a full gallop, and then
they rear up victoriously over the vanquished enemy. In each successive
scene the horse heads are tilted further forward to convey the increasing
speed and impetus of the attack. I realized that I needed to adhere to the

intent of the original artist, so I spent another half day correcting
the angle of the horse heads for chariot #1.
Note: I use the generic term "horses", but they are actually "onagers":
asses or donkeys
Curiously, this perfectly shaped arrowhead is on the
upper left trim of chariot #1, next to the driver. It seems to be more than
just random spotting, and there is nothing else like it on the
Standard of Ur.
The other noticeable change is restoration of the soldiers’ battleaxes. From
the position of their hands and the diagonal lines across their shoulders, it
is obvious that both soldiers are carrying some kind of weapons. The lines
are too short to represent spears, so the other choices would be swords,
battleaxes, and maces (war clubs). None of the soldiers on the
Standard of Ur are equipped with swords except for the king. Although
maces are shown in each chariot, none of the men are shown using them
(though the damaged figures of the drivers in chariots #3 and #4 may be
wielding maces). Since the soldiers in the top register are shown with
either spears or battleaxes (or both), battleaxes seems the logical choice
for the weapons carried by the soldiers in chariot #1. Of course, there's no
gaurantee that both soldiers are carrying the same weapons; one soldier
could be carrying a battleaxe and the other soldier could be carrying a
mace. Since it's "six of one and half a dozen of the other", I decided to give
both soldiers the same weapon. Their axes are two different modifications
of the one carried by the soldier accompanying the king’s chariot (below).
I also restored the symmetry of the damaged mace-head. It has always
been mistaken for just another spear in the low-resolution photographs

that were previously available.
The king's chariot: The right side of the Standard of Ur's "war" panel is
the least damaged
part of the standard. This picture gives some idea of what the
standard would have originally
looked like. When new, the Standard of Ur would have sparkled like a
gem. I modified this picture by editing out the royal prince originally seen
walking in front of the horses, in order to concentrate on the image of the
chariot itself. For the complete version of this picture, see
The Standard of Ur: war side. Detail from a photograph by Mary
Harrsch. Enlarge.

Chariot #2, before: 50% (1420 x 878 pixels) 100% (2840 x 1756).
Chariot #2, after: 50% (1446 x 880 pixels) 100% (2892 x 1760).
The difference between the two pictures is best seen in a side-by-side
comparison. As can be seen by the line bisecting the horse's body, this is a
composite photograph, made of two separate pictures. All of the high
resolution "before" pictures were generously provided by
Michael Greenhalgh and made available by Opencontext.org.
Unfortunately for my purposes, the pictures were taken at slightly
different angles and lighting conditions, with some of the
figures split in half. It required a lot of cutting, pasting, re-sizing, and re
coloring to achieve a consistent image quality for the pictures.
This chariot was so heavily damaged, I was inclined to not even attempt a
restoration of it. Fortunately, the outlines of the figures were still visible,
so I had something to work with.
Had I known what I was getting into, I never would have started this
project. Although the restoration may seem like a modest improvement
over the original photo, it represents
a week of painstaking effort.
For the head of the driver, I modified the face of the soldier from the
king’s chariot, which I tilted back to match the original. For the figure of
the horses, the head is a composite of the face and nose from the horses of
chariot #1, combined with the ears and mane of the original
horses (chariot #2) along with a considerable amount of painting
and repair of the face and neck area. I also repaired the leather armor of
the horses and the woven braid of their collar.

Three spears are shown at the front of the chariot. The front panel of this
chariot is narrower than that of chariot #1. It seems to hold only three
spears or perhaps two spears and a mace. Three spears and a mace
together would be too large to fit within the narrow borders of the
panel (unless one of the weapons is partially concealed behind the
others). On the other hand, there may be a piece missing from the
damaged weapons collection. The other three chariots are shown with a
full array of weapons, even though the four weapons exceed the borders of
the front panels. It seems unlikely that the chariot was the only one
with just three weapons, so I included another version of the picture with
the full weapons array:
Chariot #2, after, with full weapons array: 50% (1446 x 880 pixels)
100% (2892 x 1760).
These restorations are as faithful to the original as I could make them. I
didn't add any of my own artwork to the images. I only used the images
that were already on the standard, with minimum modifications as
needed. Nor did I attempt to repair all the damage done to the
chariot scenes, in order to convey a sense of their great antiquity.
Sumerian War Chariot Attack:
The whole purpose of the operation thus far has been to add both
chariots together to get some semblance of the original attack scene:

The above photograph is with the full complement of weapons (three
spears and a mace) for chariot #2. It is also available with only three
spears for the chariot:

The above picture is 8% of its original size. If printed to full scale, the
picture would measure 55.5 by 17.6 inches.
Chariot #3 is too damaged to be restored. See a high-resolution
photograph (50% scale).
I also did a partial restoration of the lead chariot (chariot #4).
As explained in The Standard of Ur: war side, this is the king's chariot. It's
a partial restoration because most of the figures are too damaged for a
complete reconstruction:
The King's Chariot:

The restored pictures of the chariots are copyrighted, but are freely
available for personal, academic, and nonprofit use. If using these pictures
on a website, a notation should be made that they are modern
reconstructions so they won't be mistaken for the original images.
The "Sumerian War Chariot Attack" gives some idea of the full effect the
original scene had when all four chariots could be seen together. When
new, the chariot battle scene on the Standard of Ur would have been truly
impressive.
*************
Sumerian ceremonial chariots:
As an interesting aside (and because I really wanted to use the images and
had nowhere else to put them) the Sumerians often used decorated war
chariots in ceremonial processions. One example of a ceremonial chariot
is described in detail in Weapons: Royal Tombs of Ur. Below is a fragment
of a chariot from a Gudea stele commemorating the building of a temple
for the war god Ningirsu. The front of the chariot is decorated with
the figures of two gods. Above the double-curve top (like on the chariots of
the Standard of Ur) is a battle ensign featuring Anzud, the lion-headed
eagle, grasping two lions with his claws.

The front of the chariot is turned toward the viewer to show the details of
its construction. A notable feature of the chariot is that it has two yokes
attached to the horses rather than just one like on the Standard of Ur. This
chariot on the Gudea stele is also mentioned on the Gudea Cylinders, both
of which commemorate the building of the temple for Ningirsu. Gudea
is instructed to "build a chariot for your master", "fashion for him his
beloved standard and write your name on it" and to "decorate this chariot
with refined silver and lapis lazuli".
*************
Sumerian chariot tactics:
There has been some debate on whether a Sumerian chariot was actually
used in combat. Many scholars believe that it was merely a “battle taxi”,
used to convey a commander to a strategic part of the battlefield where he
could lead his troops, in the same way that a modern general uses a jeep or
helicopter to reach the front lines. Scholars also believe the chariots
were used to carry noblemen to the battle, where they would dismount
and then fight on foot.
These assumptions are easily refuted by the Standard of Ur. It clearly
shows an attack of Sumerian war chariots, so there can be little doubt that
they were actually used in combat. The story of Ur-luma abandoning 60
Sumerian war chariots reconstructed about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/66701.html

chariots during his retreat (see War: Umma and Lagash)
indicates that chariots were used in great numbers for large-scale attacks.
Scholars also debate whether the chariots were used to attack massed
infantry formations, because this tactic later proved to be ineffective
against disciplined infantrymen who were willing to stand their ground.
Nevertheless, chariots were used against massed infantry until
the battle of Gaugamela (331 BC) when Alexander the Great devised a new
tactic to defeat a scythed chariot charge by Darius III. The scythed chariots
had whirling blades on the wheels to mow down the opposition. During
the attack, Alexander had his soldiers open up gaps in their lines. The
chariot horses, avoiding the array of spears at the front of the phalanx,
were thus funneled into the gaps. Then the front ranks closed in behind
them, and the charioteers were slaughtered at leisure behind the lines.
What’s interesting is the fact that chariots were still being used to attack
infantry formations more than 2,000 years after the Standard of Ur,
and there had previously been no effective tactics to counteract them.
In a way, Sumerian war chariots were the battle tanks of the ancient
world. They were the Sumerian equivalent of “Shock and Awe”. They
charged full speed against the enemy infantry, causing panic in the ranks,
and thus broke up the enemy formations. In ancient battles, when an army
formation lost its cohesion, it became ineffective because the soldiers
could no longer provide mutual support for each other. Individual men, or
groups of men,
would then be surrounded and killed. Once the ranks were broken, a
defeat easily became
a rout, with disproportionately high casualty rates for the losing side.
In Sumerian times, the chariots were also used to attack the enemy’s
flanks and rear while the Sumerian infantry attacked the enemy in the
front. If the enemy army also had chariots, the Sumerian chariots would
keep them engaged and thereby prevent them from attacking
the Sumerians' own infantry. In addition, chariots were deployed for
reconnaissance, for skirmishing, and for hit-and-run attacks. Chariots
were also used to pursue and kill the fleeing enemy soldiers after a battle.
This is how they are depicted on the Standard of Ur. The chariots run to
ground the fleeing soldiers after the enemy army has already been routed
by the Sumerian infantry. In later times, the cavalry performed all of the
Sumerian war chariots reconstructed about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/66701.html

same functions as the chariots. The Sumerians, however, didn't have a
cavalry because their horses were too small to carry a rider.
Sumerian chariots were constructed of woven reed and wicker formed
over a wood frame.
The wheels were two semi-circles of solid wood pinned together in the
middle, rather than
the lighter, spoked wheels of later chariot designs. The wicker armor was
lightweight,
but the solid wooden wheels were heavy.
The chariots were brightly colored. Each city-state had a different paint
scheme to make their chariots recognizable on the battlefield. Chariots
were used mostly by the nobility because the chariots were costly to build
and the horses were expensive to maintain.
Two-wheel chariots were used for reconnaissance and for battlefield
communication. They were also suitable for combat, since they were
shown equipped with weapons.
The four-wheel chariots weren't as maneuverable as the two-wheelers (of
course) but they
had a short wheel-base (the distance between the front and rear axles) so
they had a tight turning radius. They were much heavier because they had
four wheels and carried two men. They were also underpowered because
the horses were rather small and not very strong.
The chariots were slow starting out, but once up to speed, they were
almost as fast as a single horse could run. What's important is they were
faster than a man, and they had more stamina for distance, a decided
advantage during combat. Unlike most chariots, the Sumerian chariots
had a front shield to protect the occupants, which is yet another indication
that they were designed to be combat vehicles.
The four-wheel Sumerian “war chariot” is often called a "war wagon" to
differentiate it from the standard two-wheeler, though the terms are often
used interchangeably.

Sumerian war chariot (restored) on the Standard of Ur. See it in its
original condition.
What did a Sumerian war chariot really look like?
On the Standard of Ur, the panel with the double-curved top is shown on
the side, though it actually represents the front of the chariot. The
artist has turned it toward the viewer to show its details, in the same way
that the rein rings are turned sideways to show their shape.
Modern depictions of Sumerian war chariots sometimes show the panel
in front, sometimes on the side, and sometimes both. The panel is
actually the front shield of the chariot, as illustrated below.

The gold helmet, dagger, spear, battleaxe, and rein rings topped with
a horse figurine, used by the warrior-king in this picture, can also be seen
in Weapons, The Royal Tombs of Ur.
Note the quiver of javelins slung on the side. Sumerian war chariots are
always depicted with the weapons in a separate container mounted on the
exterior of the chariot.

When viewed from the side, the flat shield appears as just a straight
vertical line. All modern depictions of Sumerian war chariots show the
front shield as completely flat and vertical.
They also show a Sumerian chariot as being very "wagon-like". This is
perfectly justified because there are ancient models of Sumerian chariots
that have the same configuration:

3 of 18 8/18/2020, 3:07 PM



Bronze chariot model with a flat shield, circa 2500 BC. See a profile
view and hi-res picture.
Perhaps there really were Sumerian chariots with this configuration. Then
again, perhaps these models were overly simplified because they were
merely meant to be children's toys and not accurate scale models of real
chariots. In either case, the war chariots on the
Standard of Ur are different. All of them have a distinctly angled front:
Why do the chariots have this angled front? It seems to be a needlessly
complicated design.
It would be much easier to nail a flat shield to the front of a wagon and call
it a chariot.
It would be quicker and cheaper to build them this way, something to be
considered when many handbuilt chariots needed to be manufactured
Sumerian war chariots deconstructed about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/84201.html

during an ancient "arms race".
The angled front is too obvious to be ignored. It has to be accounted for.
There must have been a good and necessary reason for the Sumerians
to go through the added effort and expense of manufacturing
a complicated structure instead of a simple one.
A flat shield is the simple and obvious design choice, so why isn't it used?
I've always been interested in aircraft design, so I tend to look at vehicles
from a structural point of view. I also know that an ancient war chariot,
like a modern warplane, needs to be strong but lightweight, fast but
maneuverable. This is the design criteria that best explains the
unusual configuration of the chariots on the Standard of Ur.
Sumerian two-wheel chariot, from Ur. See a picture of the chariot
with its relevant features labeled for the purpose of this discussion.
Notice how the front shield has a side panel (partially obscured by the
leopard skin covering). It’s not just a flat board. This chariot also has the
same angled front as the chariots on the Standard of Ur. There’s a reason
for this:
Imagine a driver standing in the chariot, above the wheel axle. He would
have his hands
Sumerian war chariots deconstructed about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/84201.html
5 of 18 8/18/2020, 3:07 PM



at shoulder-height, holding the reins above the front shield. The top of the
shield, being slanted forward, creates more space for his hands while
allowing him to remain standing aligned above the wheel axle. The shield
is also angled forward on the bottom to provide
more foot room and it probably also housed some structural
reinforcement for the attachment of the central shaft. If the front shield
were straight-up vertical, the driver
would have to stand further back on the chariot to have the same amount
of room
for his hands, but on this chariot there is no “further back”. Of course the
chariot could be
built longer in the back (or the front) to accommodate a vertical shield,
but this would add
extra structure and weight, thus making the chariot heavier and therefore
slower.
The forward slant of the front shield effectively increases the interior
space of the chariot
without increasing its overall length and weight. This is an important
consideration
because the Sumerian horses (asses, donkeys) were rather small and not
very strong,
so the chariot needed to be as lightweight as possible.
It’s important that the driver stand close to the wheels for “center of
gravity” reasons, to make the chariot more maneuverable. The center of
gravity (CG) is the “balance point” for an object. In this case, the CG is the
balance point for the combined weights of the chariot structure and
the occupant(s). Without going into a lengthy technical explanation, a
chariot is most maneuverable if the CG is very close to the wheel axle. The
angled front of this chariot is designed to minimize the weight of the
structure and to keep the CG as close as possible to the wheel axle. This is
the lightest, fastest, most maneuverable design possible for a
two‐wheel chariot.
The angled front of the four-wheel chariots on the Standard of Ur serves
the same purpose. It minimizes the overall weight of the structure while
maximizing the interior space. It also helps to maintain a favorable CG by
allowing the driver to stand as far forward as possible to compensate for
the rearward shift of the CG when another soldier is in the back.

6 of 18 8/18/2020, 3:07 PM



A forward CG, closer to the front wheels as they change direction,
improves the chariot's maneuverability.
It seems the Sumerians applied the same design principles of the two
wheel chariot to their four‐wheel chariot. It's their attempt to offset
the inherent disadvantages of a four-wheeler:
greater weight and less maneuverability. They were willing to sacrifice
ease of production for increased performance on the battlefield. (Greater
performance is the same reason why the British were willing to invest the
additional labor necessary to manufacture the complicated elliptical wing
of the Spitfire during WW II.) It's not at all surprising that the Sumerians
took this sophisticated approach to chariot design, since they're the ones
who invented chariots in the first place.
Getting back to the subject of the true appearance of a Sumerian war
chariot:
The weapons compartment is shown as an integral part of the chariot, and
not as a separate attachment. A triangular corner brace behind the
shield is used to reinforce the unsupported part of the shield above the
railing. The reinforcement is absolutely necessary to prevent the
shield from bending. The mark at the angle in front, seen on most of the
chariots, indicates that the side railing, the angle, and the point where the
Sumerian war chariots deconstructed about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/84201.html
7 of 18 8/18/2020, 3:07 PM



diagonals cross, were all in alignment. It also suggests that the side railing
continued around the front to the edge of the shield.
To get an idea of what a Sumerian war chariot really looked like, we need
to remove
the shield from the side and then rejoin the front and back, like so:
Watch what happens to the triangular corner bracing on top of the railing:

Sumerian war chariot deconstructed. The shield is on the front so
it's no longer visible when the chariot is viewed from the side. The upper
portion of the shield has a side panel that wraps around to the railing. It is
wide enough to accomodate a rather large decorative square
of woven reeds at the top. Notice how the triangular corner brace behind
the shield has disappeared. That's because it's actually the bottom corner
of the side panel It merged seamlessly with the side panel at the exact
same angle. The triangular corner bracing is no longer necessary because
the side panel by itself gives the shield enough structural rigidity to
prevent the shield from bending backwards and forward. The railing
continues around to the front of the chariot and terminates at the edge of
the shield at the same level where the diagonals on the shield intersect. In
this way, all the lines converge at a central point to create a dramatic and
unifying effect.

Additional proof that some chariots had this configuration is found on a
cylinder seal. The chariot in the lower register has an angled-front and a
wide panel on the side of the shield.
If this chariot were drawn realistically, it would look something like this:

10 of 18 8/18/2020, 3:07 PM



With the shield removed, the driver can now be pictured further forward,
so there is room in the chariot for the other soldier and he needn't stand
with just the tip of his toes on the back
of the chariot. Imagine if the shield was rotated to a straight-up vertical
position, how it would force the driver to stand farther back, crowding the
passenger, who in turn would also have to stand farther back. Now both
men are standing toward the rear of the chariot. This leaves the front
wheels lightly loaded, which decreases the steering authority. The aft CG
makes
the chariot highly unstable during a sharp turn, causing the back wheels to
skid to the side, and possibly inducing the chariot to tip over.
The forward slant of the shield allows the driver stand further forward,
above the front axle.
The passenger can also stand further forward. This shifts the entire CG
forward, and makes
the chariot more maneuverable. During an attack, the driver stood as close
as possible
to the front of the chariot. He also leaned ahead, practically laying on the
front shield, to shift
his weight forward. The passenger stood close behind him and also leaned
forward while holding on to the driver's shoulder strap. With both of their
weights close to the front wheels, the four-wheel chariot could maneuver
more like a two-wheel chariot. During combat, the passenger stepped back
so that both soldiers had more room to wield their weapons.
The weapons (spears and maces) are stored inside the chariot, and not in a

separate quiver attached to the side. This made the weapons easily
accessible to both the soldier and the driver, but not accessible to the
enemy during close combat (the driver fought when he could while
maneuvering the chariot; most of the drivers in the attack scene on the
Standard of Ur are wielding weapons). The spears were arranged along the
interior walls of the front shield and the side panel with the minimum
amount of attachment necessary to hold them in place. The spears were
not in a quiver, so the soldiers could just grab a spear as needed without
pulling its full length out of a quiver, like pulling a nine-iron out of a golf
bag.
A quiver mounted on the outside of a chariot is completely impractical.
Look again at this picture of a war chariot. It would be quite difficult for
the soldier in back to pull a long spear out of a long quiver that is placed
far ahead of him, up high, and tilted away from him.

Assyrian four-wheel chariot. This picture illustrates how the side
panel flairs into the curves at the top of the shield.
Higher-resolution photograph of the two-wheel chariot previously shown:
The wheels have the same construction as the chariot wheels on the
Standard of Ur. Note the leather tire around the wheel. The chariots on
the standard would likewise have the same kind of tires to protect
the wheels against splintering and damage. The Sumerians not only
invented wheels, they also invented tires. See treaded tires on a
ceremonial chariot from the period of Gudea.
The above photo clearly shows the reed and wicker construction of the
body of the chariot. Woven reeds are also used to reinforce the
chariot's central yoke. Reed (such as bamboo) is a tough yet lightweight
material, an important factor in keeping the chariot as light as possible
to enhance its speed. The Sumerians made extensive use of reeds because
they didn't have a lot of wood. There weren't many forests in Sumer, but
there were plenty of marshlands; so the Sumerians didn't have a lot of
timber but they did have plenty of reeds. Like the chariot pictured above, a
chariot on the Standard of Ur was constructed of reed and wicker panels
stretched over a wooden frame, which brings up an interesting point:

Chariot #1, which I reconfigured above, and the king's chariot which is
shown below, have sharply angled fronts. The other three chariots are
more rounded in front. I suggest that Sumerian war chariots were a lot
more "curvier" than is generally supposed, because of their
wicker construction. They were not so wagon-like. Wicker construction
readily lends itself to compound curves and complex shapes (such
as wicker baskets and furniture). Although the sides of the chariots were
probably flat, it's difficult to imagine why Sumerians would build
boxy chariots when it's so easy to form the wicker into smooth shapes
and transitional curves (like around corners). Even if the shield itself were
flat (except where it's folded) the corners at the front of the chariot would
have been rounded off. It is also possible that the entire front of
the chariot was rounded, with the shield composed of compound
curves. In either case, a chariot on the Standard of Ur would more closely
resemble later chariot designs. It would look more like a chariot and less
like a wagon.
Throughout the ancient world, chariot warfare was always the domain of
the wealthy nobility because chariots were expensive to build (a modern
estimate says it took 600 man hours to build a two-wheel Egyptian
chariot). Horses were also expensive to buy and costly to feed and to
maintain. It seems that Sumerian war chariots were quite flashy and
sporty, as befitted the nobility, with the bright red chassis and light
colored trim, the crossed diagonals, and spotted rear fenders, the double

curve shield with a decorative panel on the side, and the
brightly caparisoned horses. On the Standard of Ur, the king himself is
driving a chariot,
and it's highly doubtful that he would be seen driving a boxy, glorified hay
wagon.
There is one final adjustment that needs to be made to the appearance of
the war chariot:
Chariot profile. Click on the photograph to see a "before and after"
picture of the chariot.
When reconfiguring the war chariots on the standard, I tried as much as
possible to preserve the same dimensions used by the artist. However, I
believe that the necessity of having to place the shield on the side forced
the artist to drawn the chariot longer than it really was. Otherwise there
wouldn't be enough room in the chariot to accomodate the two passengers
(even so, they just barely fit). I believe the artist lengthened the chassis by
increasing the distance between the front and back wheels. In the above
picture, I have moved the wheels closer together. The chassis of
a Sumerian war chariot would be as short as possible, the minimum length
necessary for the soldier and the driver to effectively do their jobs. This
would insure that the chariot was lightweight and therefore faster. A
shorter wheel base (the distance between the front and rear axles) would

also make the chariot more maneuverable, for the same reason that a
sports car has a tighter turning radius than a Cadillac.
So, to summarize: A Sumerian war chariot had an angled front with a side
panel on the upper part of the shield. The weapons were carried in the
interior of the chariot, not in a quiver attached to the side. In addition, the
front of the chariot had some curvature because of the
wicker construction.
Just for the fun of it, I also deconstructed the king's chariot:
The King's chariot. The royal prince is seen in front of the horses.
The king's chariot has a peaked panel on the side that is different than the
other chariots. See "The Standard of Ur: War".

Eannatum. His chariot on the Vulture Stele is like the chariots on the
Standard of Ur, with the same angled front and the crossed diagonals on
the shield. The chariot is drawn in the same unusual manner, with the
front on the side and the side on the front. His chariot also has
the same peaked panel as the king's chariot. See "The Standard of Ur:
King".
More chariot pictures can be found in "Sumerian War Chariots".
Because of the perishability of wood and wicker, there is no example of a
war chariot that has survived the millennia, so we only have pictorial
evidence for its true appearance. Fortunately, we have the artist of the
Standard of Ur as our main authority on the subject. He is an expert on
military hardware. The structure of the chariot wheels, the spears, maces,
battle axes, helmets, rein rings, etc., are exactly like those found in the
Royal Tombs of Ur. Were it not for his detailed and accurate depiction of a
Sumerian war chariot, we would have no idea what it really looked like.
